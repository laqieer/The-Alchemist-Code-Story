001	There's a presence over by the castle gates.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
002	This presence... I recognize it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
003	That voice!
004	Azami! Don't get ahead of yourself!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
005	What do you mean?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
006	I finally understand what Celis was talking about.
007	The look in her eyes just never changes... But there are other things that have.
008	Like what?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
009	The eyes house your soul, and your soul resides in humdrum of the every day.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
010	Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life. Still, if the surrounding environment were to change...
011	Your soul and daily life would change along with it.
012	What do you mean?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
013	Now that all three of us are members of the Blade Fox, we can't expect things to be exactly like before.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
014	So whatever is emitting this strong presence is the source of Azami's grudge?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0045
015	No doubt about it. But...I was sure Celis destroyed it back then...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
016	How could it...? Well, there's no point worrying about that now.
017	It's impossible to forget such extreme sadness.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
018	On a normal day, Azami would be fine on her own, but if she's lost herself in rage...
019	Right. Sounds like we ought to hurry.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0037
020	Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!!!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0021
021	Stay out of my way!
022	Sorry. We're in a bit of a hurry.
023	Let's go, Captain Tanosuke! To the castle gates!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
