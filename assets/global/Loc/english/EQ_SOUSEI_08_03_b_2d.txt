001	Gahh!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
002	Matter! Give me more strength!
003	That won't be enough.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
004	Hrk! Haa...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
005	The Cursed Beasts are comprised of all the sins borne by their regions' people, you know.
006	Tch! Cursed is right...	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
007	Ulgh!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0042
008	Quence!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
009	Keep a close eye on it! It's coming back for more!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
010	Wha— Aaah!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0025
011	Emmel, was it? Arrogant of you to believe you would be able to bear all of this on your own, don't you think?
012	I don't...care! I'm not...giving...up!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
013	...
014	(Why is it looking at me again?!)
015	Hmm. I guess the fight is over.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
016	Wait, what...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
017	It doesn't seem like Lucifer wants to continue.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
018	He probably thinks it a shame to have you die here. And I feel the same, frankly.
019	You're a surprisingly delightful human.
020	What are you planning to do with me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
021	Why, treat you as a proper guest and entertain you, of course. Just give me a moment to make the preparations.
022	Yes, Sir?
023	Prepare a room for our special guest, and another for our prodigal son. And make sure to have the finest meals at the ready for each, as well.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
024	Yes, Sir.
025	You should rest now, young lady. I'm excited to see what you will decide to do next—if you'll deign to challenge me again, or finally give up this foolish pursuit.
026	How...dare you...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
027	And, just like that, the girl who had swept into our home like a storm took a knee before Father's might.
028	She looked absolutely pitiful, her body mottled with wounds. And yet...
029	A stalwart determination remained in her eyes.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
030	What a mess this all turned out to be...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
031	Nonetheless, we should treat their injuries. Can you take care of Quence, Ignacio?
032	Well... If that is your wish. But, do you really think it wise?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
033	What do you mean?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0004
034	I... I mean... They just tried to usurp us. They're the enemy.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0045
035	True. But Father called them guests, so we should treat them as such.
036	Even if we don't exactly want to.
037	I...suppose that's a fair point.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
038	Though I'd suggest we take care of it quickly. It would be best if our guests did not overstay their welcome.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
039	That girl...is trouble.
040	I must say, I'm surprised. It's rare for you to doubt Father's judgment.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
041	You think so? Perhaps I'm just a bit on edge. Things did happen rather suddenly this time.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
042	If that is the case, however, then...well, I am a bit ashamed of myself for allowing my emotions to get the better of me. Sorry.
043	Hmm...
044	What is it? You know you may always speak freely with me.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
045	Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how much more...endearing you used to be.
046	Oh. Well... That's probably because humans mature quickly, unlike your kind.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
047	Not helping! When you say things like that, you endear yourself to absolutely no one!
048	Hahaha! Duly noted. If you'll excuse me, then, I'll go see to Quence.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0008
049	Hmph!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
050	Nimul...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
051	Saving everything, huh?
052	It's a nice thought. If only it were possible...
