001	Hyaahhh!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0032
002	Agh?!
003	...Was that the last of them?	VO_alba.alba_battle_0019
004	Yeah.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0006
005	Too bad.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0011
006	...?!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1002
007	Yuto, wasn't it? You've got a good physique and a keen sense of combat.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0006
008	That being said, your experience and tactical abilities are not enough. Once you have that, you'll do plenty well as a mercenary.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0031
009	I'm not a fighter. I'm just a tree doctor.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1001
010	I have no desire to fight or hurt others...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0022
011	...But sometimes fight you have to fight to protect.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0012
012	Lucian?
013	...No, never mind. Forget about what I said.	VO_rusia.rusia_chara_1002
014	... ...
015	Well, what's your reason for coming to the Ancient Dragon Bone, Yuto?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
016	You were gonna say something, weren't you?
017	Oh...the Shaman asked me to come here and help find the Spirit Grass to heal the trees in this forest.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0006
018	In that case, we'll help out! It'll be our way of saying thank you.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
019	But...Aruba, I thought you guys were gonna investigate the mountain?
020	That was the plan, but with things have escalated to this point...	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
021	At the end of the day, our main pursuit is the Trading Company. I doubt we'll find anything else.
022	I see.
023	Are you gonna come too?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0002
024	Hm? Well, I'll tag along for the sake of securing the safety of my client.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0050
025	Then come carefully. Where we're headed now is a place that is especially dangerous around these parts.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0016
026	Don't worry. I'm confident on my feet. Choose whichever route suits you the best.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
027	That being said...	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0030
028	How far are we going to climb? We've almost reached the point where I can see the summit.
029	Spirit Grass only grows around the ridges.
030	In other words, our goal really is the summit.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0016
031	That being said, Yuto has the build for it so that's one thing, but you're also pretty nimble as well, Aruba.
032	Well, a merchant's body is his business capital! Besides, I take Kiki and Adel for walks on mountain paths like this all the time.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0008
033	Honestly. I feel ashamed to call myself a mercenary. From now on, I'll have to consider this kind of activity too when training.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0031
034	Mountain paths are harsh. They're ruthless places. Better to not underestimate them.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0016
035	There it is. If we use this Spirit Grass to make the medicine, then the tree will become healthy again.
036	By the way, what kind of sickness does the tree have?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0002
037	It's called Stone Rust...
038	The tree suffers from consuming an excessive amount of Alchemia from the surrounding land. Ultimately, it becomes petrified.
039	No way...	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
040	Do you know something about it?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1002
041	It goes further than that. That's the disease I came here to investigate.
042	More accurately, I came here to find its cause.
043	In the documents I've seen, the cause seems to be unknown.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0031
044	Were the documents the ones from Northern Pride?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0002
045	Yes, but...
046	Then you won't find answers there. After all, it comes into conflict with the Magna Code.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0039
047	In other words, anything related to Alchemy has been frantically hidden by the Trading Company.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0005
048	So...Stone Rust was caused by humans?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1008
049	From long ago, the creation of Philosopher's Stones has always been a source of problems for Alchemists.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
050	In the past, they condensed the Alchemia possessed by powerful goblins or sacrificed the lives of many...
051	Amongst such trial and error, the research you mentioned began.
052	By using the special properties of certain trees, Alchemia could be sucked up from the earth itself and used to make Philosopher's Stones.
053	I've heard of that before.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0006
054	The desert between Gluttony Foss and Envylia used to be an independent country.
055	However, due to the excessive experimentation for Alchemy, the land was exhausted and transformed into a sea of sand.
056	The excessive extraction using trees was probably one of the causes, although there seemed to be many others.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
057	However, ultimately, that experiment ended in failure. The Philosopher’s Stones were never successful and all of this only resulted in exhausting the land.
058	Thus the study of Philosopher’s Stones moved more towards the expenditure of human life and blood.
059	It's a horrible story. So? Why are the people from the Trading Company trying to resume the experiment?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0016
060	I think it’s because they think they can make a profit. Lucian, haven't you also heard about what happened in Wadatsumi?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
061	Yeah. Where they said Greed Dike was working behind the scenes, right?
062	It's true that if you were to mass produce Philosopher’s Stones using that information it would make a massive profit.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0044
063	That being said, why Saga? They should experiment in their own country.	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1013
064	I said it has to be a tree with special properties, right? That tree now only grows here in Saga.
065	That's why they came to this forest...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0018
066	If that's the case, then those people just now are also in the forest!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_battle_0019
067	Yuto?! Wait, we'll go with you!	VO_alba.alba_chara_1001
068	So, without knowing it, he's also been pursuing the same thing we've been.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0045
069	Honestly, you never know where fate takes you.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0008
070	Huff...huff...
071	That's a Slothstein built Guard Droid.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0018
072	It must be the Trading Company people that were experimenting in the Ancient Dragon Bone!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
073	They must've realized we'd come to investigate them, so they moved their test site.
074	Individuals without identification code detected... Elimination will be implemented.
075	Tsk! They've found us!	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0019
076	They're experimenting in this forest...? This forest will die...? No...never...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0020
077	Yuto?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
078	I will not...allow it!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0017
