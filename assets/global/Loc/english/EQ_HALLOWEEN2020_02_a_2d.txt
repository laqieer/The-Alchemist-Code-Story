001	So you really just missed? Huh. With a throw like that, I figured you had it in for me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
002	I fear my fiery passions ran away with me. You have my humblest apologies.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0035
003	I'm really sorry too.
004	It's all good. Just be more careful next time, eh? I gotta tell you, this smarts.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
005	So this is how they settle arguments at this Halloween Carnival? It's a little weird, but it's better than fighting it out.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0045
006	Grr... Such humiliation! That the Successor of the Sun should have to bow his head to anyone...
007	For all that, you seemed pretty apologetic back there.
008	For the fault was all mine. Sometimes, even the Successor of the Sun must admit his mistakes!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
009	You know, at first I thought you were totally full of yourself, but you've got your priorities right where it counts.
010	Plus you're really trying to cheer Julia up. Maybe you aren't so bad after all.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
011	Hmph! This is the least of what the Successor of the Sun should be expected to do!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0016
012	Unfortunately, our fluffy prize has slipped through our fingers.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
013	Well, you win some, you lose some. We'll just have to think of something else.
014	Ramses! Blanchett!
015	I come to investigate a disturbance, and what do I find but you two! Just what has been going on?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
016	Oh no.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
017	A teddy bear? For me? Well, at least your hearts were in the right place.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
018	Good grief. Do you have any idea how worried I was when I realized you were gone?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
019	My apologies. Distressing you was not my intention.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0036
020	We only kept it quiet because we wanted it to be a surprise. I'm sorry it ended up like this.
021	Don't worry about it. It was a kind thing to try to bring a 'pleasant surprise' to me. Very befitting of the theme of the carnival.
022	Huh? Oh, right! Ahaha, you got us!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
023	My training must be lacking if you could have given me the slip so easily.
024	Anyway, it seems I've given you the wrong idea. I wasn't staring at that teddy bear because I wanted it.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
025	It just happened to catch my attention, that's all.
026	Such things aren't meant for people like me.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
027	Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
028	It doesn't matter. What's important is that I've finished baking. Would you care to taste-test?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0008
029	Fresh-made sweets?! I'm there!
030	Of... Of course. It would be my pleasure.
031	Hrmm... Something about Julia's smile sets me ill at ease.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
032	It reminds me a little too much of a certain someone...
033	Julia...
034	Whoa, there's LOADS! Just how many did you make?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0024
035	Let's see here... Mmm, these are splendid! This homely, yet refined sweetness satisfies even my royal tongue!
036	I'm happy to hear that. I didn't know how many we might need, so I made as many as time and ingredients allowed.
037	If that's enough, I should join the others on guard patrol.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
038	I'm still worried about her, you know. I get the feeling she really struggles to put herself first.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
039	Like, if she really didn't care about that bear, then why was she staring at it so hard? It's like she's always trying to hide how she really feels.
040	Hmm...
041	She made me really happy when she complimented my cutouts. If she's feeling lonely, I have to do something.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0042
042	I want to make sure she has a happy Halloween too.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
043	I agree. So long as I am here, my responsibility as Successor of the Sun is to make sure even Julia has a wonderful time!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
044	Moreover, a part of me cannot stand to see the sadness in her eyes. What we need...is a plan.
045	Trick or treat! Give us our candy or you'll get pranked!
046	Bwah!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0026
047	Do not leap at me so, little ones! We will apportion you your treats shortly, but not now!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0014
048	Huh? You mean you're out of candy?
049	Then you know what comes next! Rosa, prank them!
050	Now, now, children, not so hasty. I expect the same composure from you as from any other servants of the red and black.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0003
051	Hey, Rosa, what gives?! Who are these kids, and why are they so dead-set on pranking us?!
052	Hehe, a fine question. To show I've mended my ways since last year, I have been researching the ultimate prank for amusing the townsfolk.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
053	Tonight you will drink deep of the intoxicating blessings of the dark angel of Halloween! Are you ready, children?
054	Ready! Three, two, one... Go!
055	My! What a magnificent display of fireworks! In such sinister hues of red and black!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
056	Look! They're forming a jack-o'-lantern! Whoa, it's so Halloweeny!
057	The perfect 'pleasant surprise,' wouldn't you say? I thought long and hard about how I might best enliven this carnival.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1020
058	Halloween only comes once a year, after all. Any who fail to prepare their most ambitious tricks are neglecting half of its delights.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
059	Just don't blame me if your most ambitious tricks get you another telling-off.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1003
060	Hold a moment, Blanchett. I feel the rumblings of imminent inspiration...	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
061	Monsters?! And in such numbers! The fireworks must have angered them!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
062	Grrraaaargh!
