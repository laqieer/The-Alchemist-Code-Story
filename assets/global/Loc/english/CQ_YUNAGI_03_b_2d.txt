001	Thank you... I'm sorry.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0033
002	You must be tired from working all day...yet here you are, waiting late into the night for me to come home.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0016
003	K-Kazahaya?
004	Go home and rest already.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
005	Thanks for telling me not to come home. Bye.
006	Kazahaya! Wait! Why are you being like this?! If you want to come home, I—!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0002
007	I came here because I have something I want to do... Something I have to do.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
008	Does that have something to do with the way you've been acting?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0001
009	I found something that's more important than protecting our village.
010	What? Did you get yourself a girlfriend?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0010
011	No! Tch... I've joined a cause. I'm trying to protect something bigger than just us.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0016
012	I won't let you help me anymore.
013	S-so that's what this is all about, huh?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_1047
014	I do want to protect you, and our village. I mean that.
015	But...I also want to give everything I have to help Lord Zain achieve his goals—even my life, if need be.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0035
016	If that happens, you'll be all alone, won't you? When I think about that, I can't bring myself to do it. I can't dedicate myself to it.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
017	Hehe. I guess I was acting a little like an overbearing parent.
018	All right. I understand. Even if you end up getting yourself killed, I won't be sad. So you don't have to worry about me, or the village, okay?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0038
019	Tch. Somehow, I doubt that.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0010
020	I guess this means that you'll be working for the Holy Guard someday.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0007
021	Well, it'd be one step towards repaying my debt to that kid who saved me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0007
022	Hmmm... He did help us escape to the safety of this village, so I don't blame you for feeling like you owe him. However...	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0031
023	You can fawn over Lord Zain all you want, but I don't want you to end up like that lancer boy.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0022
024	I knew you were going to say that. There was so much melancholy to him.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0004
025	I know how you feel, but...he's not someone you should aspire to be. Just be you, okay? And come home once in a while!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0010
026	Tch. Get off my back, would you? Bye.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0007
027	Heheh. Look's like he's all grown up now. He's gotten strong enough to carry a burden as heavy as the fate of the world on his shoulders. It makes me feel a little lonely, but...	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0007
028	Well, as they say in Wadatsumi—you gotta send off a young man on his first journey with a smile!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0004
029	I need to do my best, too.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0004
030	Kazahaya! You little punk!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0008
031	If you don't outlive me, I'll make your afterlife hell!
