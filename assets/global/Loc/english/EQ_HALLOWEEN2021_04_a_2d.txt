001	The map shows that we can go along this river to reach the Ratty's nest.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0031
002	Waah!
003	The ground is muddy and slippery around here. Let's be careful.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0030
004	Maybe this will make it easier to walk.
005	…! You're right, it is easier now! What did you do?
006	I turned the mud into a more solid form.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0031
007	You can do that?!
008	Water-absorbing magic is a specialty of mine!
009	But due to this power and origin, people have used me for selfish things…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0016
010	Huh?	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
011	Legend has it that my ancestors were mermaids.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
012	I don't know if it's true and I personally don't believe it.
013	But people don't really care about finding the facts. They just want to believe what they want to believe.
014	What they want to believe… Also sounds like the people who believed I was a vampire.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0039
015	Basically, one and the same.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0005
016	I believe in myself and I don't care about looking into the past. But they have no desire to see me for who I am.
017	They have these illusions built up and they try to throw them onto me.
018	They became envious, jealous…and did a lot of things that I wouldn't approve of.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0022
019	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up your past.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0006
020	I said it because I wanted to say it. No need to apologize.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0002
021	…Taking advantage of others, trying to grab them or touch them… That's why I hate people.
022	It's just plain disgusting to think about.	VO_thetis.thetis_battle_0019
023	And that's why I avoid people. It makes me uncomfortable and I don't want to get close.
024	Tethys…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0029
025	We may both avoid people, but we have our differences.
026	…
027	But I admit… I don't dislike you.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0037
028	Huh?
029	We have some similarities, but some differences too.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0003
030	Even though you are uncomfortable with other people, you make an effort to stand up against your fears and that's great.
031	You also have trauma like me, but instead of looking the other way, you're on a new path.
032	I respect you, Cordelia.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
033	R-respect…?
034	You're really going to just give up?
035	Huh?	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
036	When I see you trying, I feel strangely encouraged...it would be a shame if you just...gave up.
037	That's just my thought…
038	I'm…encouraging you?	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0031
039	By looking at what you're saying, it's making me think that talking to some people might be a good thing.
040	Even that little girl who wanted me to play with her. Maybe I could have…
041	Though I'm not good with children…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0030
042	I'm feeling like I should give it a bit of a try at the moment.
043	Tethys…
044	Why don't we…try helping each other? Together with you I feel I can try harder and not give up.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0001
045	I don't know what else I can do, but I hope you can become friendly with that little girl.
046	You're right. I think I can with you by my side. Thanks.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0005
047	But before we do that, let's head to the nest.
048	Yes!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0004
