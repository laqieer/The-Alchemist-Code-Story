001	Extracting the Alchemia Particles from the body... How horrible.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
002	Can even a potential captain become obsessed with power?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
003	It just goes to show how dangerously alluring Alchemy can be.
004	In the past, many Paladins, in pursuit of power were drawn in and set on the path of destruction.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0012
005	Alchemy is truly frightening, isn't it?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
006	That's why it's important to have a steadfast heart that believes in justice.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
007	A steadfast heart...that believes in justice...
008	Even if someone you love is on the brink of death, even if your beloved country is threatened by a crisis, or even if you're faced with intense sorrow or terror...
009	If you are not determined to carry out justice, your heart will be consumed by power.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
010	Power...
011	Listen Kanon... As Paladins, we must not only have strength, but the mental capacity to continue believing in justice.
012	That's the eternal mission of a Paladin. What do you think? Can you abide by it?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
013	I won't get consumed by power! I don't seek strength for myself!
014	I seek it so that I can help others!
015	That's right, Kanon. Don't forget that feeling. That's an absolute requirement for becoming a Paladin.
016	Yes, Captain!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0010
017	Heh. Good answer. As Paladins, we fight to save even those who remain nameless to us.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
018	Kanon, let's go to fulfill our mission!
019	Captain... Zahar vanished this way!
020	I think he's using the inner part of the ruins as his hideout! Let's hurry!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
021	Something's wrong.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
022	Huh? What's the matter?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
023	Wait! Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
024	!!!
025	Eeeeeek!
026	Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
027	What?! Captain Cadanova! Agh! It's a trap set by Zahar!
