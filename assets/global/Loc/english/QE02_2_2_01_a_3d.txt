001	Alkemono...that's...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
002	It's Ejitan's helmet, aye. I couldn't bring myself to leave it behind.
003	Allie...
004	Now isn't the time to be feeling depressed. For his sake as well, we...
005	I know, aye!
006	It's the role of the living to give meaning to Ejitan's death! I won't let it go to waste!
007	Heh... That's the spirit. Don't worry; his spirit continues to live on in our hearts.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	Aye!
009	More importantly, what're we gonna do?
010	From what I recall, Big Bridge Station is the terminal station further past Redington City.
011	There's no way we'll make it in time.
012	Well, we'll manage somehow. You don't have to worry about it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
014	Ronnie, don't take this the wrong way. I'm gonna leave you around here where it's safe.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
015	What...?!
016	What do you mean?!
017	Exactly what I said. Listen, Ronnie...I'm letting you off around here. You're gonna go back to Real Heaven.
018	Wh-wh-why?! Why just me?!
019	Because you're still a kid.
020	Guaranteed that there are even greater dangers waiting ahead of us. I can't bring a kid like you into that.
021	Y-y-you gotta be kidding!!! Are you gonna just leave me behind?!
022	If it's so dangerous, what about Miss Elester?!
023	I'd like to leave the little lady behind as well, but she might be the decisive factor in our search for the Sacred Stone.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
024	I...I agree. We can't let you get involved any further in our problems...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
025	You gotta be kidding!!! Seriously! There's no way I'm going along with that!
026	No way I'm gonna let you just get rid of me!!!
027	Squeak...! Guard Droids approaching, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_demo_0001
028	Tsk... We'll talk later. Let's hurry on ahead.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
029	Tsk... You gotta be kidding me!
030	All right...you should be safe here, Ronnie.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
031	No way.
032	Hey, hey. Come on now.
033	Before...you said I was a lady, didn't you?
034	Huh? What's going on all of a sudden? Of course you're a lady.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
035	Then you can't leave me behind. Doesn't it go against your character to refuse a lady's request?
036	Doesn't it contradict your policy to tread on my determination to follow you?
037	Ack...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0029
038	I'm gonna follow you no matter what happens! Even if you leave me behind, I'll chase after you!
039	Tsk. Once you get started, you never listen.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
040	Does that mean...?
041	I give up. We can't afford to waste time here. Let's buy some food for the road and get out of here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
042	All right! You had me worried there for a second!
043	Right! Around here, there's a place that's famous for its sardine oil bagels!
044	Sounds good. Think you can get some?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
045	Leave it to me!
046	...All right, let's go.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
047	Huh? But what about Ronnie?
048	From here onwards, the Beckrams are gonna double down on us. It's for her own safety.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
049	It's for Ronnie's own good. It can't be helped, aye.
050	You're right. I'm sorry, Ronnie.
051	Sorry! They were out of sardine oil bagels, so I got...huh...?
052	No way... Are they serious?! You've gotta be kidding me! Those morons!!!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0021
