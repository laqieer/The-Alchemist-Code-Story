001	Face reality...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
002	None of you seem to be aware that you're about to repeat the same tragedy that occurred in Wadatsumi!
003	I will do absolutely everything I can to prevent that from happening!!!
004	That's a mistake!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
005	Allowing the Mikaboshi to remain in this world is the same as allowing the existence of something that has the power to ruin the world!
006	We need to do everything we can to find the Mikaboshi and eliminate it from this world!!!
007	No! How can you not consider the fact that destroying the Mikaboshi may not necessarily serve justice!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
008	That instead would lead to destroying the balance of power in this world and lead to its destruction!
009	No! Wadatsumi was destroyed precisely because of the Mikaboshi existence!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
010	The Mikaboshi is the culprit for producing conflict in this world!
011	Ack...! Is there nothing I can do to make you see things differently?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
012	I'd ask the same of you! Can I not get you to listen to what I am saying?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
013	I would've liked to have avoided this...but I guess there's no choice.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
014	If we cannot see justice under the same terms...then, as knights, we must determine matters with our swords.
015	...Fine. As Lord Commander I accept your proposal!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
016	I've discarded my empathy, Kanon!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
017	In order to protect this world and the equilibrium of power, I will become the "supreme judge"!!!
018	I will as well, Captain Kudan! I will open your eyes to reality!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
019	The End!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0012
020	Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
021	!!! Wh-when did you gain...so much power...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
022	Ag...ghh...! I'd ask the same of you, Captain! I had no idea your power of darkness had increased to this point!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
023	Still...my resolve...is on another level than all of you!
024	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
025	I...have...seen...the destruction...of Wadatsumi! I have seen...its...despair...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0001
026	I have seen...Kagura...living...with despair...beyond...imagination!!!
027	Ug...ugh?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
028	I will...never...allow...that tragedy...to be repeated...again!
029	Even if...no one...understands me...even if...the whole world...turns against...me...
030	I will...save...this world...from such...despair!!!
031	Hurrrahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
032	Aghh...!!! Ackkk!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
033	Kanon!!!
034	It's over...Kanon...I ask you...once again! Your answer...will decide...whether or not...I must make...a ruthless...decision!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
035	My...my feelings are the same!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
036	...!
037	Y-you will never be able to save the world with your way of thinking, Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
038	That's...an unfortunate...answer...Kanon. Farewell!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0037
039	...!
040	Kudan...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
041	...!
042	...Kagura? Is that...you...Kagura?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
043	Kudan...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
044	Kagura! You're safe...I've come to save you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0008
045	To save me?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
046	They were going to use you again!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
047	But you're okay now...as long as I am here, I won't let them harm you!
048	Kudan...is it true that you killed...Commander Zain?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
049	...! It is...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
050	...!
051	Zain had the wrong mentality. I can't explain it you easily now. I'll explain my actions properly to you later.
052	Agh! N-no...! I will not let you take Kagura!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
053	Shut up! You are all leading the world to its destruction! I won't let you have Kagura!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
054	What are you saying...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
055	You should all examine your own vulnerability! Your weakness is what is allowing you to be taken advantage of!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
056	Your lack of strength has turned you into the culprits that will bring about the destruction of this world!
057	Ugh! Ar-are you still going on about that?! We are not being taken advantage of...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
058	As long as you choose to turn a blind eye to your own weakness, you will never realize the truth!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0015
059	At least I am coming face to face with my own vulnerabilities!
060	I am painfully aware that my lack of strength is the cause for all of this! I am not like you who cannot face your own weakness!
061	What...are you saying?!
062	If I had the power to destroy the Mikaboshi, Zain would have never tried to use Kagura!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
063	If I had enough power, I would've been able to save you all from walking down the wrong path!
064	If only I had the power, I would be able to maintain the balance of this world again.
065	Without a "supreme judge" in the world right now, unless someone can replace that power, there will be no future for this world!
066	Are you saying that you're going to maintain the balance of this world, Captain Kudan?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
067	Yes! I cannot ensure the fate of this world to you Paladins who have been infiltrated by the Corpse!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
068	I will obtain even further power and become the "supreme judge"!
069	Instead of the Lord Commander, I will be the one to maintain the equilibrium of power in this world!
070	I will eliminate all dangers that threaten this world...
071	There will come a day when all of you will understand!
072	Captain...Kudan!
073	This...is where...it ends!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
074	Vermilion Bird!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
075	?!
076	..Kagura?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
077	I'm sorry...Kudan.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0035
078	Wh-what...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
079	You needed to protect me...that's why you continued to seek power.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
080	I was so weak...that I needed your protection.
081	I am sure that it was me who killed your original, gentle self.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0019
082	Kagura! What are you saying?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
083	But...you're wrong.
084	What...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
085	The people of Wadatsumi do not seek power!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
086	Power drives people mad. The people of Wadatsumi understood this. That's why they continued to hide the Mikaboshi!
087	Huh...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
088	The people of Wadatsumi would never accept your way of thinking!
089	Your way of thinking...is the same as those who destroyed Wadatsumi!
090	Are you...calling me the same as them?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
091	I don't want what you offer either! I cannot accept your way of thinking!
092	Ka...Kagura...will you reject it? Will you reject...me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
093	I'm...sorry.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0035
094	Ugh...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
095	...Goodbye.
096	?!
097	Goodbye...my precious...Kudan...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0028
098	!!! Uggaahhhhhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
099	Ka-Kagura...!!! Wh-why...?! Ackkkkk!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
100	Ca-Captain Kudan...!
101	Wh-why? You were the one thing...I needed to protect. Even you...will turn against me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
102	...Hwaahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
103	...Huh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
104	...Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
105	...?! M-my body...I can't seem to control it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
106	Kagura...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
107	Is this...truly the path I must take? Must I truly discard everything...to become the "supreme judge"?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
108	Ca-Captain Kudan...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
109	...I guess that means the world I must belong to is one void of love...and light.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
110	Very well. Then with delight...I will accept the darkness!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
111	In order to protect this world...I will gladly walk down this path! Hurraaaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
112	N-no! Kanon, run...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
113	Captain Kudan...it appears you seek power at the expense of discarding your own humanity.
114	Hurraahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
115	Kanon! Run!!!
116	What immense power. Yet, you appear so broken at the same time.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
117	Hurraahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
118	Ka-Kanon...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
119	I won't lose. I cannot afford to lose.
120	You have lost the most important thing that makes you human...
121	Hurraahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
122	I will lead this world!
123	I will build your ideal world that is void of sadness!!!
124	Listen to me, reincarnated Holy Sword Excalibur! Give me power!!!
125	...Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0012
126	Ugh?! ...Uggggghh...?! Aghhhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
127	Ku...Kudan...! ...Kudan!!!
128	On that day, all I could do...was watch as Wadatsumi was destroyed.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
129	Confronted with my immense powerlessness, I was overwhelmed with despair...and all I could do was remain standing.
130	Throughout that, the only thing I was able to protect...was Kagura.
131	Her existence...tethered me to this world...even as I was consumed with overwhelming despair.
132	Protecting her was the one thing that kept me going.
133	If I could not protect her, I felt as if I would no longer exist.
134	However...I came to realize that what I was doing was running away.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
135	I had to look into the future, not into the past.
136	What I needed to protect was not my vulnerable past self, but the future of this vast world itself!
137	I must not hesitate to obtain power! I must not turn away from the strongest of opponents!
138	If I were to stand aside, then who would save this world?!
139	Farewell...beautiful days...farewell...my beloved friends...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
140	For the sake of maintaining the balance of this world...for the sake of becoming the "supreme judge" who will protect the peace of this world...
141	I will gladly descend into the darkness!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
142	...!
143	Kudanstein...so he fell into the darkness after all!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
144	Waginau...hurry and go convene the Veda Templars.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
145	Do you mean...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
146	The voice of birth cries out...with the conception of a new era!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
147	!!! Understood...!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0003
148	The eternal river of history continues to flow through this world. So...you've chosen this path after all...heheh...hyahahaha!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0009
