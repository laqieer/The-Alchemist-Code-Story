001	This castle has already fallen! Surrender! Do not fight in vain!
002	It will not be in vain! If it allows my comrades to flee, I will give my life for the foundation of my kingdom's future!
003	Gloryyyy...to Wrathariiiiisss! Aghh!!! Hyggaaahhh!!!
004	Along with the Lizard Brigade knight's cry, an eerie black mist begins to seep from his body.
005	Then mist gathers into the shape of a human, then slowly transforms into a black knight.
006	Ssshhh... Hohhh...	VO_Kurokishi.Kurokishi_battle_0001
007	Huh? Wh-what is this?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
008	The black knight attacks, causing the knights of the Blue Flame to drop like flies.
009	What?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
010	The souls of the fallen Blue Flame Knights are sucked into the black knight's body.
011	Wh-what is that?! It's sucking something! What's going on?!
012	It appears they've, in fact, dirtied their hands with the power that lies beyond Alchemy—the power of darkness!
013	The power of darkness...?
014	It's what lies beyond power, the contract with darkness that cannot be undone.
015	By placing one of your five senses or a part of your flesh beyond the Door of Truth, you can gain a magnificent amount of power!
016	They obtain a magnificent amount of power at the expense of their flesh?!
017	Be careful! Their strength will be incomparable to earlier!
018	Ssshhh... Hohhh...!	VO_Kurokishi.Kurokishi_battle_0019
019	How can I win to someone who is that resolved?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
