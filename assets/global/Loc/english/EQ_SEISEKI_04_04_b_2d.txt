001	Huff...huff...huff...!
002	You're improving a lot, but your grasp on Alchemia is still weak. Clear your heart and improve your accuracy!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
003	And how exactly am I supposed to do that?!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
004	You'll have to find that answer within yourself. Let's go again!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
005	Ugh...ahhh!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
006	It looks like you reached the limit of your physical strength. Next, I'm going to fill you with despair, Kagura...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
007	Ughh....uhhh! Ahh...! Aaaahh...!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0042
008	Try to make both your physical and mental state break the limit!
009	Rising Sun!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
010	Ughhhhaaaaaaah!!!
011	... ...
012	I can't move my body. I wonder if I'm going to end up dying like this.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
013	Well...it can't be helped. I'm tired now, and I'm sure the others will manage the rest.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0030
014	You're right...it's unfortunate, but I guess that's the limit of your secret power.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
015	I'm sorry for raising your hopes, Lord Zain. But it's gonna be okay, right?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
016	You have Excalibur. Whether it be a Sacred Stone or the Mikaboshi, just do your thing and break it into pieces.
017	What are you doing, Kagura! Don't sleep in a place like this! Here, get up!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
018	Be quiet, Kanon!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
019	Unlike you, I'm actually using my head while fighting so I'm tired. Let me sleep a little more!
020	Understood.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
021	For you to say that much you must actually be tired. All right...I'll do the rest myself!
022	Hmph...it's true, you know?
023	You're really stupid, clumsy, and an idiot, but there's something about you that's strangely reliable.
024	Even without me, I'm sure you can take care of it real quick. I'm placing my chips on you.
025	... ...
026	Kudan...
027	Kagura...
028	I'm impressed that you got this far. You've done well. I'll take on the rest of the enemy. You can relax and take a rest.
029	It's true...Kudan will be okay. No matter how strong the opponent is, Kudan will definitely not lose.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
030	Yes...I will never lose.
031	...!
032	No...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
033	No! That's not it, Kudan! That power...you cannot get consumed by that power!
034	It...it's too late now!
035	He got up...even after receiving the full impact of the Rising Sun.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
036	Ever since that day...ever since Wadatsumi's destruction, I've been relying on Kudan...relying on his strength.
037	Whenever I would mess up, it would be Kudan would save me.
038	Deep within my heart, I always thought the others would do something to help me.
039	But...that's over now. No longer can I rely on other people's power...no longer can I seek his power!
040	...!
041	I have to do it...it has to be me!
042	I won't let Kudan fall to the power. Hyaaah!
043	Hyaaah! Huzzzaaahh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
044	Ack...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
045	Th-that power right now...was it really mine?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
046	Well done, Kagura.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
047	Lord Zain?
048	You've managed to completely inherit the Kagutsuchi.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
049	Ye...
050	Yeeeeeahhh!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0024
051	Heheh. Seriously. Your generation is just one spectacle after another.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
