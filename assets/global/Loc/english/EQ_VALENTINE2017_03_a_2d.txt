001	Phew! Honestly! Are these beans really that attractive?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0016
002	Maybe its effect is good for the monsters...	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
003	I thought the effect of cacao was pretty insignificant...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0045
004	All right...I...will use the red the cacao as the base for a chocolate and give it to Fraise!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0048
005	Eheheh...nice!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0008
006	I'll mix a lot of different types together...and give it to Fung and all my other friends.
007	For me, I want to eat one of each by myself. Also, I think I wanna pass out a little bit to my desert friends!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
008	... ...
009	Albea? You're not gonna give it to anyone?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
010	(Whoa. Brave move, Eve!)
011	There's no one in particular that I want to give to...so if I make it, I think I'll eat it myself...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
012	You won't give it to your family?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
013	(There goes Polin!)
014	...Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
015	You have a brother, don't you?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
016	Oh...well...but...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0027
017	(Right. They're totally brother and sister! This is the perfect opportunity to talk about it!)
018	(Seriously, they're always so clumsy, those siblings...I feel so worked up!)	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
019	Albea...you were looking at the courage cacao, weren't you?
020	We should use the chocolate that we make together as an opportunity to talk about those who are important to us.
021	... ...
022	(Whoa! Polin, way to go...)
023	Grrrrrr!
024	...! Let's go.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
025	Oh, come on! Polin was just in the middle of saying something really god!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0013
026	These monsters have no consideration!	VO_raaf.raaf_battle_0021
