001	Ugf... I can't believe it...against students...	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0043
002	Professor...please stop!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
003	I understand Alchemy is a forbidden power—that it is a sin to wield it.
004	But it is the Holy Guard who must decide on the verdict for one who has obtained this power. For the Royal Palace to take over this role...and in secret...
005	It's completely unacceptable!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0013
006	Especially when we a member of the Holy Guard currently visiting. Is this one of those adult issues?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
007	In any case, I will not stand to see my friend killed because of this!
008	Ack. I-if I had a choice, of course I wouldn't want to be involved in harming my own student.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0042
009	But you can't refuse because the headmistress ordered you?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0045
010	If you don't want to do it then don't! You're an adult! Act according to your own beliefs!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0015
011	!!!
012	You're following orders from above? All you're doing is letting people with money and power make decisions for you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
013	You're stooping down to those with power. You are giving responsibility for your own actions to someone else!
014	Children like you wouldn't understand!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0029
