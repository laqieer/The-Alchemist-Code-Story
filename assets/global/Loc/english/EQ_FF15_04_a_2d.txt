001	This is the King's Stew.
002	...It's delicious.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
003	(A hand cooked stew... How nostalgic.)
004	Heh. Who knew you could loosen up like that?	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0007
005	...!
006	Eat your vegetables, Noct.
007	...I seriously don't think this monster grass is edible.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_1029
008	... ...
009	If you're not gonna eat it, I can eat it for you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
010	...Fine, fine. I'll eat it.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0038
011	That being said, the monsters we encountered earlier were a breed that I'm completely unfamiliar with.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0011
012	Likewise, I've also never seen the monsters and soldiers we've just fought here either.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
013	Well, the world's a large place. Our two worlds may be connected in unexpected places.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0007
014	One can hope so. I would like to return as soon as possible.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
015	Oh, come on! I can't connect to King's Knight.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0028
016	You're way too addicted to that game.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0011
017	I won't be able to get my consecutive login bonus!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1018
018	I can't connect with mine either.	VO_noctis.noctis_battle_1030
019	May I ask what that is?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
020	This? Umm. I'm not sure how to explain it.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
021	It's a communication device...or was. In its current state, it's pretty much just a box.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0005
022	Isn't there a better way to explain it?!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0039
023	Never mind that. Look at the sky. It's the same as our sky in Lucis.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0008
024	It differs drastically from Crown City.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
025	Oh! I wanna go home!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0030
026	(I wonder how long it's been since I spent a night like this with others.)
027	... ...
028	Well, look who woke up on the wrong side of the bed again this morning.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0010
029	Let's quickly depart.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0024
030	Yeah, let's hurry.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
031	Love to do that, but it looks like we've got company.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0014
