001	Northern Pride - Inside the main hall of the Holy Guard's headquarters.
002	In other words...you're saying that it's not just Envylia and Lustburg...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0045
003	You believe that Greed Dike's power now spans to other countries as well?
004	Yes. Most likely, this invasion is only the beginning.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
005	I believe that eventually, all of Babel will be thrust into an unprecedented state, the likes of which we've never seen before.
006	That being said, we still haven't received a formal rescue request from either Envylia or Lustburg, have we?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1002
007	Isn't there a chance that it could all be a hoax? It's hard to imagine even Greed Dike making such drastic moves.
008	No...I think there's plenty of chance it's true. Lion Monarch Orion is a pretty messed up guy.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
009	I doubt he thinks much of turning the entire world against him.
010	I agree. When Kudan was alive, there was something he told me.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
011	Orion's actions stem from the number one priority of obtaining the Alchemy Source.
012	I don't think he pays much attention to how the other countries take action.
013	If we continue to wait for a messenger from Envylia or Lustburg to arrive, we'll lose the upper hand. It'll be more efficient to take action now.
014	Yes. Once things are set into action, it'll be difficult for us to meet like this.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
015	It's important that we gather together and make sure that we are all on the same page.
016	Hmph...I think you're overthinking this.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
017	We the 2nd Regiment will go and see what is happening in Envylia.
018	No matter what ambitions Greed Dike may be harboring, we'll scatter them before they have a chance to fester.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0008
019	Huh? You're planning on going with just the 2nd Regiment?!
020	Yes.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
021	Please, wait! We still haven't determined the extent of their power!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
022	Besides...I've heard rumors that Greed Dike has succeeded in the development of immortal soldiers.
023	I've heard this as well.	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
024	However...if rumors of Greed Dike's invasion are in fact true, then even now Envylia is in danger.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
025	The thought of Dilga and our other allies engaged in a desperate struggle at this very moment makes me uneasy.
026	But...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
027	It'll be all right. Once the formal rescue request arrives, we the 1st Regiment will immediately deploy as well. Will that be all right?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0020
028	...Yes.
029	As I was thinking of fortifying the protection of Northern Pride with myself and Seida while you, Captain Yauras, would command the mobile troops...
030	Very well. Captain Monzein, please lead an expedition to Envylia.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
031	Understood. Greed Dike...we'll show you what happens when you underestimate the Holy Guard!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
032	Um... Can I have a word with you?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
033	What is it?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
034	I'm assuming we'll get pretty busy, so I thought I'd ask you now.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
035	Last time we went drinking together, I won, didn't I?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
036	About that meal you owe me...when are you gonna pay up?
037	Huh? What're you talking about?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
038	A bet...?! Seriously, you two!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
039	N-no! It's not a big deal!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
040	It was just a cute little wager about guessing the gender of the next customer to walk in...
041	What are you talking about? Why would you make up something like that?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
042	Huh?! Hey, hold on a second! Are you gonna talk your way out of it?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
043	Stop speaking nonsense!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
044	Why would I bet on something as silly as that?! Gambling goes against the code of chivalry! I would never do anything like that!
045	Ah, there you go again! You were drunk out of your mind, so I had a bad feeling about it...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
046	Don't you think not fessing up to it and admitting defeat goes more against the code of chivalry?!
047	What did you say?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
048	What's this...? Stop arguing about such petty things.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
049	...It's highly inefficient.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0010
050	H-hey, wait!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
051	What's with all the condescending looks? For starters, I'm not the one who...
052	Enough! Do you understand what our current situation is?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
053	Agh...sorry...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
054	Seriously...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
055	Monzein...be careful not to let your code of chivalry sweep you off your own feet.
056	Huh?! Yauras...are you gonna ridicule my way of thinking too?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
057	No, that's not it.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
058	What I'm saying is that Greed Dike is the kind of country that will use every dirty trick in the book in order to obtain their ends.
059	Your straightforward honesty is sometimes easy to read...
060	I'm telling you to make sure your code of chivalry doesn't work against you.
061	So are you telling me to be deviant instead?! You gotta be kidding me! Using dirty means would be the same thing as abandoning my knight's honor!
062	Honestly! You really should try to listen to advice sometimes! If you end up messing up your priorities in order to fulfill your personal agenda...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
063	That's nonsense! I've always put the Holy Guard...and the future of this world first and above everything else.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
064	Your useless worrying is unnecessary!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
065	It's pointless now. Once he gets started, he won't listen to reason.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
066	Sigh... I understand why you're tempted to use the term "inefficient."	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
067	In any case, once an official request for support has been made, we'll send back up immediately. Please don't take too many risks.
068	Don't make me say it again. Your worrying is unnecessary.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0014
069	But...
070	We're racing against the clock now. There's no time to lose.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
071	Don't worry about it, Kanon. Who do you think I am? Trust the Great Thunder Axe.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0007
072	...I do.
073	Othima.	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
074	What is it?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
075	Once we get back, I'm gonna need some of your time. I've got to properly teach you about the code of chivalry.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
076	Agh... You always have to be on the winning side, don't you?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
077	Excuse me! I've received word that a messenger from Envylia has arrived!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
078	Welcome them and bring them here immediately!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
079	What about the food supplies for the Lustburg expedition troops?!
080	It's been taken care of! Commander Kanon wants a word with us! Hurry to the square!
081	I know, I know! Curse you, Greed Dike... Are you gonna turn the whole world against you?!
082	Northern Pride - Main room of the Holy Guard headquarters
083	We've received an official request for support from Lustburg.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
084	Kagura...I'll leave them to you and Captain Othima.
085	Unfortunately, it looks like it wasn't just a hoax. But...considering how you look at it, this might be a good opportunity.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
086	A good opportunity...?
087	If they hadn't instigated all of this, Kudan wouldn't have died. It's a good chance to get our revenge.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
088	No. I understand how you feel, but if we retaliate in bitterness, it will only serve to fuel the cycle of hatred.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0014
089	............
090	This invasion will inevitably spread through the world.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
091	If we don't stop it, there will be no future for any of us.
092	Also, in order to prevent creating another Captain Kudan, we must stem those feelings now, all right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
093	Hehe...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0007
094	Huh...? What's so funny?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0012
095	Seriously...somewhere along the way you really did turn into the Lord Commander.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
096	What are you talking about? Look at yourself, Kagura. You're the Captain of the 5th Regiment that can make any army turn tail.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
097	Who would've thought a day would come when we would lead the Holy Guard...I mean, you're still the same airhead that I first met at school.
098	...Likewise.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
099	Kanon...other than those from the 2nd Regiment, all of the members have been gathered.
100	Yes.
101	I'm sure all of you have heard already, but Greed Dike led by the Lion Monarch Orion have made their way to Envylia and the neighboring country of Lustburg.
102	There they have begun a large-scale assault.
103	Until now, there has never been a large conflict between Greed Dike and those two countries...this is a one-sided invasion.
104	Those from Greed Dike have yet to issue any formal statement. However...
105	As the suzerain country, Northern Pride has proclaimed this an act of aggression.
106	The act has been officially named the Lion Monarch's Charge and a formal state of emergency has been declared.
107	Following these orders...we of the Holy Guard have been ordained to quell this Lion Monarch's Charge.
108	Most likely, this invasion is only just the beginning.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
109	I believe that Greed Dike's invasion will expand to include Slothstein, Wratharis...
110	And ultimately Northern Pride as well.
111	We must do everything we can to stop it before it reaches that point!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
112	As we still suffer damage from the previous Wadatsumi expedition, we are still not at our full strength yet.
113	However, we have survived and overcome such severe situations before. We find strength in the justice that we believe in.
114	I believe that we can shatter the baseless ambitions of Greed Dike!
115	True justice is with us! We hold the light that leads to the future!
116	We, the Holy Guard, must shatter the biggest plot in all of history to rob us of our freedom...we must lead the people to a peaceful future!
117	Lion Monarch Orion...I refuse to let you do as you please!
118	Meanwhile...in the Greed Dike royal castle Dynam Dionysus.
119	We've received a report from our scouts. Having received a declaration of a state of emergency, the Holy Guard are finally on the move.
120	Oh dear...the "absolute justice" really does seem to be taking its time.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
121	Honestly, it's quite deplorable. Please leave it to me regarding their movements.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
122	I've already arranged to receive reports regarding each individual captain's movements.
123	There's no need to pay attention to all of the Holy Guard. What we need to focus on is Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment...and, more than anything...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
124	Captain Seida from the 3rd Regiment, correct? Very well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
125	Hmph... Did you receive word from the Templars?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
126	No, I haven't yet. Honestly...what are they doing...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
127	Never mind. They'll show up eventually.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
128	More importantly, Waginau...I would like a little of your wisdom. I just can't seem to suppress this blood that rages on the verge of madness.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
129	Please don't worry about that either. The moment we have long awaited will soon be upon us.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
130	Heheh! The time has come! Now is the time that we obtain the power to shake the laws of this world!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
131	Somewhere in this world - Hideout of the Veda Templars
132	We've received word that Vier has arrived in Envylia.
133	Acht will also soon arrive in Lustburg.
134	Tsk. Hey, when are we gonna get to move?
135	At this rate, my body is gonna grow lax. Hurry up and let us be deployed!
136	Our leader bases decisions on various factors. It would be wise not to make careless remarks.
137	Huh? Füry...are you gonna talk back to me?
138	...Stop it, Neun.
139	Shut up! Are you making fun of me, eh? I'll give you a good wallop!
140	I said stop it. Or...do you want me to blow your head off?
141	I-idiot...it was just a joke! Don't get all worked up...
142	A joke? I see...my apologies then.
143	More importantly, Neun.
144	"The goddess frowns on those who cannot eat the scraps that a dog will not." Do you understand the meaning of that?
145	Huh...? That we should value food?
146	No, idiot.
147	It means that sometimes we need to do the dirty work in order to reach our goals.
148	It may be annoying to do what Orion demands, but...
149	Endure it for now. If we overcome this mountain, it'll be advantageous for us.
150	After we handle this situation, we'll be one large step closer to fulfilling our long-cherished wish.
151	You don't have to say anymore.
152	As our leader, none of us question your wisdom. We just do what you tell us to do.
153	Heh. All right then, let's go. It's time we found our own "sky" in this Lost Blue.
154	The Emperor Orion of Greed Dike commences a simultaneous attack on both Envylia and Lustburg.
155	Regarding this as an act of aggression on a scale not seen since the devastation of Wadatsumi, Northern Pride announces a state of emergency.
156	Upon receiving this declaration, Kanon and the other Paladins advance to engage in battle on the very same day.
157	However, little do they know...
158	Behind this catalytic incidence lurks the strong will of one man.
159	Even this assault that will cause the entire world to quiver...
160	It is nothing more than a small glimpse of the earnest plan this man has spun throughout an eternity.
161	This will later be told down through the ages as the largest threat ever to have arisen in the continent of Babel...
162	This is the memory of the mad monarch bearing the name Lion. And of the great war he begun that would overturn the laws of this world.
163	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
164	Sacred Stone Memories -Lion Monarch's Charge-
165	The Lustburg expedition has completed its preparations. We will head out soon.
166	Hm? Oh, right. All right then, let's go.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
167	...? You don't seem to be in good spirits.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0006
168	No, it's nothing. I'm just a little upset about how unreasonably Greed Dike is behaving.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
169	It's all right. This is an emergency situation. I'm sure they'll accept it without any problems.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
170	Huh...?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
171	You're worried about being captured again, aren't you?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
172	Don't worry. Lustburg is in no position right now to behave like they did then.
173	Captured...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
174	Hey...! Hey wait, Captain Yauras! Don't...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
175	It's an old story. This guy was once mistaken for an intruder. He was restrained and stripped naked.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0023
176	Naked...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
177	Agh...seriously...why do women always say everything...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
178	Did you say something?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
179	N-no! I mean, who would've thought they'd restrain a captain of the Holy Guard?!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
180	On top of that, I was actually born in Lustburg, you know? Although I was abandoned at a pretty young age...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
181	Since Lustburg suffers from the Asmodeus Curse...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
182	It's quite normal for them to discard newly born boys, right?
183	Yeah. It's a hard country to live in as a man.
184	In any case...Captain Othima, I think that you're most qualified to lead the rescue mission to Lustburg.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
185	Kagura will go along with you so you've nothing to worry about. If something happens, please handle it, Kagura.
186	Yes, leave it to me.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
187	No way! So I'm pretty much just dead weight?! That's a little harsh...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
188	Stop nitpicking. Seriously...why don't you at least try to be a little more responsible?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
189	Your little act of declaring war on Greed Dike might be what spurred them into action, you know?
190	...Umm...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
191	Declared war...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
192	N-no...! There's no way something I said would've caused...um...sorry...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
193	I'm not sure of all the facts...but the Lion Monarch Orion engaged in dialogue with Captain Kudan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
194	It's believed that his talk regarding the "balance of world power" is what brought about all of this.
195	So you think he is after the Sacred Stones within each country?
196	Yes. As well as what many refer to as the eighth Sacred Stone, Mikaboshi.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
197	I'm not really sure of that.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0039
198	What do you mean?
199	During our previous Wadatsumi expedition...
200	I used my Kagutsuchi to seal the Mikaboshi to the point that it was on the verge of losing its power.
201	In its current state, the Mikaboshi is pretty much nothing more than a rock.
202	We'd be well aware of its existence long before Greed Dike finds it.
203	Right...you have a point.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
204	Have we received any word from the Saga region...or Gluttony Foss?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
205	Huh? Right now, we haven't heard anything that amounts to an invasion by Greed Dike, but...
206	Is there something that worries you?
207	If the purpose of Greed Dike's invasion is to destroy the balance of power in the world...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
208	There's a chance they would head to the Saga region...that's if they've picked up on information on a certain matter.
209	Of course. With that possibility in mind, I've already dispatched troops to the area.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
210	But, Seida, you have Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone stored within the Holy Guard, right?
211	I'm sorry, Kanon. After that fact was revealed...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
212	When we returned from the Wind Temple, I immediately changed the hiding place of the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.
213	Huh...?! Then you don't have it with you right now?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
214	Don't think badly of me. It wasn't that I didn't trust you or Captain Monzein.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
215	I just thought it best to be cautious.
216	No...of course. That was a wise decision.
217	In other words...there's a chance that Greed Dike may target its location then?!
218	No...that's not possible. I haven't told the location of Beelzebub to anyone.
219	Greed Dike is one thing, but not even the people of Gluttony Foss know its location.
220	Hmm. I don't seem to understand what the problem is then if Beelzebub is stored somewhere no one knows about.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
221	In other words...even if Greed Dike were to attack the Saga region, there's zero chance they'd obtain the Sacred Stone there, right?
222	Do you mean you're worried about Saga's safety? But...if that's the case, it's not just Saga. All countries are...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
223	No, that's not it. If Greed Dike were to uncover information regarding Matter, it'll be very problematic.
224	If they believe that the key to destroying the balance of power in the world is to seize something that harbors a vast amount of Alchemy energy, then...
225	I'm certain that they'll head to the Saga region.
226	Matter...? What's that?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
227	It's a type of Philosopher's Stone that the local Saga tribes refer to as the Crystal Quartet.
228	These are four holy crystals that harbor the natural elemental spirits of fire, water, wind, and earth.
229	Currently, they are being preserved by the shamans of each tribe.
230	Do you mean it’s a subspecies of the Philosopher's Stones? Do you think that Greed Dike will go after them?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
231	Individually, they lack the immense power contained in a Sacred Stone.
232	However...if you bring these four crystals together and their elements are combined...
233	It will invoke a large amount of Alchemy energy that will be enough to control Beelzebub.
234	What...?!
235	If it's that important...why didn't you say something about it earlier?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
236	I'm sorry. As long as Lord Waginau, who has connections with Greed Dike, is present in the council...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
237	I don't know who or where someone might be eavesdropping. I couldn't confide in you.
238	Well, that makes sense, but...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
239	How publically is the existence of this Matter known?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
240	I believe that most of the general public are unaware of its existence.
241	But the people of the tribes...most would be aware of it as a piece of lore.
242	With each of the tribes feuding against each other and its high potential for warfare...I doubt it will be even possible to get them all in the same place.
243	But if Greed Dike were to hear about this information...perhaps it would best for Seida to head to the Saga region.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1002
244	No. If we did that, it would thin out our defenses in Northern Pride.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
245	Right now, we can't afford to be without your vast capabilities of detection, Seida.
246	Right...I'm sorry. It'll be okay.
247	Even the likes of Greed Dike shouldn't be able to easily seize the four Matters.
248	We should still be able to make it on time if we detect movement in the Saga region.
249	But...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
250	Besides...when I confided in everyone that the Sacred Stone Beelzebub was with the Holy Guard...
251	Waginau and Orion were in the Wind Temple.
252	If they had heard our discussion...I'm sure Greed Dike will come after me.
253	If that's the case, then it would be most efficient if we strengthen our army in Northern Pride and intercept there.
254	Yes...understood. We'll consider dispatching new reinforcements to the Saga region as well.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
255	I'm sorry, Seida. You go protect Northern Pride as planned.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
256	Understood. Sorry for confusing matters at the last minute.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
257	No. I'm glad I was able to hear about the existence of Matter.
258	Well then, Captain Othima...head with Kagura to Lustburg and, if anything occurs there, we'll send reinforcements immediately.
259	No...more than us, shouldn't you be worrying about Envylia?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
260	Are you worried about Monzein? Don't be. I'm going to be heading there myself.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
261	Please don't worry. For now, I've had Basheeny accompany Monzein to report on matters, just in case.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
262	Yeah, about that...you know...he used to be a spy for Greed Dike, right?
263	Seriously? Are you still gonna suspect him? Can't you see that he's had a complete change of heart?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
264	Don't worry. In his current state, it doesn't seem likely that he's being dishonest.
265	Besides...as an ex-spy, he should know Greed Dike's behavior better.
266	I recommended him as the perfect resource for this matter.
267	No, that's not what I mean. I'm talking about old man Monzein, who hates things that aren't straightforward.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
268	I was just wondering if him and Basheeny might have a falling out or something...
269	You don't need to worry about that.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
270	I've told him that the reason why Basheeny went off about being an assassin for Lord Waginau was due to the effect of the volcanic gas coming from Ramproad Mountain.
271	Huh? Are you serious?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_1047
272	What do you mean...of course I'm serious.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
273	If I hadn't done that...there's no way I'd let the two of them travel together.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
274	W-wait, hold on a second... Are you telling me that Monzein, a full-grown adult, can't actually accept the truth?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0028
275	It's because he can't accept it that all of us have been going out of our way to trick him.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0022
276	B-but...no, that can't be...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys0027
277	What's the matter? You look pale...
278	Well, I...when he was leaving...I reminded Monzein that...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
279	He should forget about his past as a spy and learn to get along with him.
280	What...?!
