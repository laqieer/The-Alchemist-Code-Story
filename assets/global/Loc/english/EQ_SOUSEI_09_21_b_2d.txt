001	Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0043
002	Urk!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
003	This pressure is intense. Magil is supposed to be formless, but it feels like an iron wall pushing back on me!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
004	But I must endure this. This is what Ouroboros had been containing all this time!
005	Perhaps I can do something with Nero's power, since it shares the same source as Ouroboros'...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0037
006	But you've reached your limit. How long do you think you can possibly last if you push things any farther?
007	With all of the contracts you've already pledged, your fate is as good as sealed as it is.
008	Any more, and you'll—
009	You really want to know how long I can hold out? That much should be obvious!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
010	I will endure until Nimul completes the creation!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
011	...
012	I will now access the interior of the tower. I will unravel the mysteries of the dragons with my own two hands!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
013	So...this is the heart of Grand Excelsior.
014	Correct. And this is to be the final resting place of my soul's core.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
015	That voice, and this magil... Ouroboros?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
016	Yes, and no. I am the one you've opposed. I am the one you call God.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
017	And yet, I am also not.
018	I cast shadows upon the earth and give them self-awareness. They are I, and yet they are not. I am and am not the last vestige of the dragons.
019	Do you intend to stop me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
020	I am only here to observe. That is my purpose; why I was born, and why I exist.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
021	There is presently a need for more accurate information and more precise calculations to complete the reconstruction of this planet.
022	I am the ground, the sea, the air, and life itself. I have memory of every system that has ever existed, and I am the record of that existence.
023	Are you saying I should reference that record?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
024	There is no need. I will simply propose the proper seeds for the next creation. That is the sole reason I was made.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0039
025	All right, then. I want to know everything you have to tell me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0038
026	The Dragon Realm is shared amongst us. Close your eyes. I will engrave the results of my calculations and observances directly into your mind.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
027	...
028	This is...the entire world?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
029	The world we were born into, where we struggled to live day by day, and traversed from one realm to the next in search of a better future... And it's all this small?
030	Correct. The human race thrives in extremely limited numbers upon only a fraction of the seven Belt Regions.
031	So that should be the first order of business, then. To spread out farther, in order to become a more prosperous species.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
032	Water is the source of life. There should be vast oceans.
033	And the lands upon these oceans should strike a balance between abundance and harshness, to inspire human ingenuity and resourcefulness without quashing it or creating complacence.
034	Great forests can be used to harbor life, and...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
035	All of the Belt Regions should be unified into a single continent.
036	Let's put an end to the age of sin alone trapping the people of each land in isolation.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
037	Lastly...how will you determine the new Truth?
038	New Truth?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
039	Yes. Just as was ordered the usurpation of sin amongst humans in this world of mine...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
040	Just as the dragons forced the world into a shell to hold it together as it began crumbling beneath their talons...
041	What incorruptible Truth will you write upon your world?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
042	...How about...
043	That should be the bulk of it taken care of.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
044	I just hope that young Sulva is safe and sound.
045	He was a bit overzealous, wasn't he?
046	Considering the situation, I'd say he acted just as he should've.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0022
047	Anyway, what's next? We should be able to scale the tower now, if we wanted.
048	Whoa! Is this an earthquake?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
049	No, it's...a huge pulse of magil, shaking the ground?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
050	Shaking the world, is more like it!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
051	Guess the ceremony's already begun.
052	Urgh... Ahh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
053	The corruption just keeps getting worse.
054	I can sense that Ouroboros has been defeated, too. So what's causing it?
055	A-aaahh...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
056	I've reached my capacity as the Vessel of Purification. If the corruption keeps increasing here, I don't think I—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
057	No! That doesn't matter. I'll keep fulfilling my duty for as long as I can.
058	I have to keep going. I can't stop until Nimul concludes the creation of the new world. I can't stop until he fulfills his dream.
059	I must contain all of the corruption here. I have to cleanse the sins of that stone...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
060	If my Spiritbonding is limited—if my power as the Vessel of Purification is not enough—then I'll just have to tap into the power Nimul shared with us.
061	I, too, am an Alchemist now!
062	If you infuse it with the power born from a true desire to change the world, then yes.
063	I believe that this power can change the world. I know it can.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
064	I am not just fulfilling the role I was given. That's not why I want to protect this world.
065	I chose this path myself. I accept this way of fighting...this way of living! I accept all of it. It's the path of healing for this world.
066	So...let me hear your voice.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
067	Where...?
068	We finally meet, Ouroboros.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
069	So, you are Emmel. The sacrifice.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
070	I am. That's the path I chose, but not because I thought I could change the world on my own. I had something I wanted to protect.
071	Why have you pulled me back from the brink? The creation has already begun.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0016
072	The world will be saved, whether or not you expend further efforts.
073	I know. But...the world I want to save is a world with Nimul still in it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
074	Seeing him thrive, and smile... That is the world, to me.
075	A human body simply cannot withstand the burden of creating everything anew. The desire to bring a new world into being is, by its very nature, an act of self-sacrifice.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
076	I understand. But I wish to give my life in his place.
077	You wish to use Alchemy to sacrifice yourself, to save the very person ushering in this new world order?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
078	I do. Changing the world was never something I believed I could do on my own. So...
079	Could you lend me your power, just as Bianca entrusted hers to Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
080	What you suggest is tantamount to madness. To accept my power would be to surrender yourself to the Truth of the world that was.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0030
081	That would mean your soul being rejected by the pull of the new world. There would be no place for you within its torus.
082	But that's the only Alchemy at my disposal.
083	Ouroboros. Would you join me in watching over the new world that Nimul is creating?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
084	Very well, child of the old order.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
396	You may live on as a sacrifice. It is a strong decision.
085	And until such time as this new world falls to despair, I shall join you in watching over it.
086	Thank you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
087	I think I've finally gotten the hang of it now...my Alchemy.
088	It's different from Nimul's. This power is intended to prevent change.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
089	A day may come when someone is led astray by Alchemy's potential. The power I have can lead them back onto the straight and narrow through love.
090	"I am...Unifier of the Seven Gates!"	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0032
091	Humans begot despair, grief, and rage. And we've endured a painful, difficult punishment for them ever since.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
092	But it will be fine. All can now be forgiven.
093	I will take on all of that corruption...all of that sin.
094	...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
095	I... I made it in time!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
096	Ignacio?
097	Where's Nimul? And what's happening with the Ceremony of Creation...with the fight against God?!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
098	...I see. I understand now. It's all so clear.
099	Emmel?
100	Ignacio, I have a favor to ask of you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
101	What...?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
102	Someone's purified all of the corruption. Or rather, it seems as if they're attempting to seal it away.
103	But there won't be enough time to seal away all of it—not enough time to avert absolute calamity.
104	How can you say that so calmly?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
105	I am merely assessing the situation. If you wish to buy time for the sealing to complete, however, there might just be a way.
106	Is there?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
107	In this tower lies an artificial Dragon Realm formed by the merging of the seven cores of the Cursed Beasts.
108	And, of course, there is a part of me in there as well.
109	What in blazes are you on about?! Explain it so I can understand!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
110	I mean to say that in this place, and in this moment now that my princess has gone to rest, the Truth of the world can be...bent, a bit.
111	All of the corruption in this place, including the remains of the dragon princess, can be carted off to another dimension—the Fringe Dimension.
112	Carted off? Are you saying you can...take it there? But, won't that...?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0021
113	The current state of the world is the result of the sins committed by dragons, not humans.
114	The time has finally come for us to atone.
115	Which means the time has come for us to part, Seeker of Truth and Protector of Devotion. Even should reality not change, there will be no coming back from this.
116	But as the last of the dragons, it was a pleasure to see things through to the end with you—with humanity. I thank you for attending to my needs...to our needs...so thoroughly.
117	Zafeiris, wait—!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0027
118	"Fringe Dimensional Art, Nero. Activation."
119	I hereby give all I have to take this corruption to the Fringe Dimension.
120	Please, Zafeiris! You don't have to do this! Live on, for me, and for everyone else as well!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
121	I'm sorry. Please forgive me, my beloved child. Farewell.
122	Zafeiris, you aren't—!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
123	...
124	Ngh—aaaaaah!!!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0042
125	What are you doing?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0026
126	Stand down, Waginau! You'll get pulled into the spell, too!
127	What else am I supposed to do?! Do you think I'm going to just stand here and let you end it like this?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0015
128	Wagi...nau?
129	You're the one who showed me! The end of the dragons! What they were thinking... What they wanted... What they entrusted to us, and how they fell!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
130	You alone are left, and yet...you're going to throw that all away?! You're going to break your promise to her?!
131	Waginau...
132	I can't let it end like this, Zafeiris!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0013
133	You promised her! You promised!
134	That you'd see things through to the very end!
135	"Adhere to the dark commandments!"	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0043
136	Are you trying to open the path to the Fringe Dimension in my stead?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0025
137	Wait, Waginau! There's no way a human body can withstand this power!
138	You've only been able to realize the miracles you have through my control and your offerings!
139	Don't you dare underestimate humans, Zafeiris! Now, listen up!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
140	There's nothing worse than a parent who makes their own child cry!
141	Waginau...
142	I pledge everything! I pledge my entire world! Pure and blackened soul, please grant me the power to save another!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
143	Lastly, I give the gift of Alchemy.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
144	Oh?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
145	Anyone and everyone is to have the power to change the world. Happiness and prosperity are rights that all shall be afforded, in equal measure.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
146	That is the world I envision.
147	It is possible. However...
148	You have only ever truly seen people deal with crisis through fear and defiance. In times of peace and plenty, how will they stand against sin?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
149	It'll be fine. I know it will.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
150	I believe that people can reflect on their faults. They can make the choice to live differently, so as not to repeat the same mistakes again and again.
151	I see. If the creator of the new world believes so, then I shall accept it.
152	I do believe. I'm sure of it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
153	But there is one thing you should bear in mind, child of man.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
154	And what would that be?
155	No matter how righteous and pure the lives of these humans may be...
156	There are some Truths of nature that simply cannot be changed.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0037
157	Ghhk... I think I've reached my limit.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
158	But that should complete the process of creation. Now all that's left is to get out of here...
159	Rrg, my legs... I-I think I overdid it.
160	Nimul. You're back.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
161	Yeah. It's done.
162	What's that shaking?!
163	The tower has served its purpose and is now falling apart. We should get as far away from it as possible.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
164	But...Emmel and the others... We've got to make sure that they're okay!
165	We can pick them up on our way down. No one wants any more sacrifices.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
166	Waginau?
167	What is it?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
168	Umm... It's probably nothing.
169	(Did Waginau...always have such a stern look to him?)
170	Waginau, did you...?
171	Protecting you is my duty.
172	...All right. I understand.
173	Emmel! Are you okay?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
174	Ah, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
175	It's over, right? I'm so glad!
176	It is, but this tower's falling apart! You've got to get moving.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
177	Wait... What happened to you? What's going on?!
178	I'm staying here. There are still things for me to do.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
179	What kind of things could you possibly need to do in a collapsing tower?!
180	Well... This stone is called Grand Excelsior, right?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
181	It has the ability to absorb the sins of humans...and it's still continuing to do that, even now.
182	Someone has to stay here to ensure that it never stops, so that another age of corruption never comes to pass.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
183	...
184	Emmel... You can't... Please...
185	I have to, Nimul. I need to make sure the sins of the old world don't seep into the new one you've created.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
186	But then it won't mean anything! Nothing will!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
187	Everything that we've gone through...and you'll still be a sacrifice in the end!
188	You have to survive, Emmel! That was the impetus for my dream from the start!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
189	There has to me another way, okay? So come with us! Please! Please, Emmel...
190	I can't. This is the path I've chosen.
191	...Wait! Now that Alchemy can be tapped into by anyone, I can use it to take your place!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
192	Nimul, I'm so sorry... Ignacio, if you'd please.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
193	Hyah!
194	Em...ulgh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
195	...
196	Are you really sure about this?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
197	I am. Thank you for coming this far with us. You helped so much.
198	Never would I have imagined that someone like me would be able to see all this through, while you...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
199	Don't think like that. It pleases me to know that you'll live on.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
200	Zafeiris...
201	You could tell in one look, huh? I wonder how long it'll take the others to figure it out.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
202	I'm sure no one will protest even once they do. They'll realize that this is what Waginau wanted.
203	It may still be a shock to the system for many of them, however.
204	Zafeiris, I'd like you to look after Nimul from here on out, okay?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
205	That was what Waginau lived for, wasn't it? All he wanted was for you and Nimul to be happy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
206	So in his honor, I will gladly inherit that duty.
207	Then I bid you all good night. I will always, always be here, praying for happiness in each and every one of you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
208	...It's begun to fall. How do we get out?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
209	Hey there! You all okay?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
210	You're the only ones left in there! Do you think you can make the jump onto the ship?
211	If you can't, I'll help make it so you can!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0002
212	What about the others? What about my sister?!
213	We've already helped everyone else, you dummy! That's why we said you're the only ones left!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
214	There was a sudden lull in the magil, so we took that opportunity to pick, uh...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
215	...to pick everybody up.	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
216	...
217	Anyway, what are you waiting for?! Just hop on, already! We've got to get out of here, fast!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
218	Everything's changing around us!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
219	It's not just the view that's going haywire. The nature of the magil here is changing, too.
220	I presume this is...the creation of the new world?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
221	Oh! This is...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
222	Absolutely cannot believe you made it out of there alive.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
223	...
224	So this is the world you dreamed of, Nimul...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
225	A vast land full of life and nature... It is certainly idyllic, in its own way.
226	...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
227	Mrng...
228	How can I just...accept this?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
229	Nimul...
230	After all that, Emmel ends up bearing the burden of the creation on her own. It's exactly the outcome I've been fighting so hard to prevent.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
231	And the worst part is, I failed in eliminating both the Cursed Beasts and the corruption from the world. All I did is postpone the inevitable.
232	Is this really the world I've always dreamed of? It feels like such a...hollow victory.
233	How long must people continue to sacrifice themselves for some greater good? How long must people barter with their lives and livelihoods?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0019
234	Emmel!
235	Emmel...! Emmel!
236	How...? Why?! How could you...? Emmel! Agh! Aaaah! Nng... Why...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0021
237	But there is one thing you should bear in mind, child of man.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
238	No matter how righteous and pure the lives of these humans may be...
239	There are some Truths of nature that simply cannot be changed.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0037
240	How can this...? This...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
241	This is the Truth?!
242	This is the Truth of this world?!
243	Answer me, Emmel! Is this what you wish to protect?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
244	Emmel!
245	The world has been reborn.
246	The chaos from the process of creation has now quieted, and everything has settled, to such an extent that the people start to feel as though it's always been this way.
247	They begin migrating to new lands, either to enjoy the uncorrupted nature found there, or in search of new hopes and dreams.
248	Meanwhile...
249	Lady Emmel! Lady Emmel!
250	What is it?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
251	Another territorial conflict has arisen between the peoples of Acedia and Superbia. This time it's in regards to the ownership of the mines.
252	Understood. I'll head there post haste to mediate their dispute.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0037
253	Thank you, Lady Emmel.
254	...
255	Phew...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
256	You seem a bit spent, Lady Emmel.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
257	Is this what life is like when one is regarded as a saint?
258	I'm in no mood for your teasing right now, Nimul.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
259	...
260	Ha! I knew it. You don't much care for that name, do you?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0012
261	Honestly. I only agreed to take it because I, too, wanted to help ensure that the world remembered its saviors, Nimul and Emmel.
262	I still don't get why we have to be their representatives, though. I'm hardly tall enough for the role, you know!
263	That's what we all agreed on, Eulalia. Even the leaders of the former Belt Regions were on board with the plan.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0010
264	Yes, yes. I do understand. After such sudden and radical changes to the world, it's vital to have proper representation to help guide the masses. Still...
265	You have to remember, barely any of the townspeople can even recall what either Nimul or Emmel looks like. It's important, for the sake of history, that we give faces to the names.
266	A simple name on paper is quickly forgotten, but a picture is worth a thousand words, as they say.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
267	I just wish that the real Nimul could've been here, at least...
268	We all do.
269	But he simply wasn't prepared to accept the outcome. He wanted to believe that there's some way to save Emmel. And if there is, he'll move heaven and earth—again—to find it.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
270	To tell you the truth, I feel a bit left out, as it stands to be quite the adventure all its own.
271	And in the end, no one could keep him from going. He is the creator of Alchemy, after all.
272	Not to mention the "Child of God," and founder of this whole new world...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
273	...
274	You have plans for it, don't you?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
275	Hmm?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
276	The real Emmel pledged her life to seal away that stone...that amalgamation of all the cores of the Cursed Beasts.
277	The Grand Excelsior, was it?
278	Ah, that. Yes, I do have something in mind.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
279	I was thinking, perhaps we humans could rebuild the tower from the ground up.
280	And then we enshrine Grand Excelsior within it. It symbolizes all that was sacrificed—all the people who were lost—for our current time of peace, so it would seem a fitting monument.
281	That's a good idea.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0044
282	As for the name... I thought we might call it the Tower of Babel.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
283	Okay, perfect! The motorcycle maintenance is all finished!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
284	Bit surprised you'd be asking me to do this, though, if I'm being honest.
285	Well... Space-Time Manipulation doesn't work all too well in this world.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
286	We can still use it, but we can't seem to travel as far as we used to with it. It's much more limited.
287	I feel like that whole branch of magic is shrinking. In the future, it may only be possible to manipulate time for a single person.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
288	Guess changing the Truth of the world just has those kinds of side effects, you know?
289	Though, yours truly might've just come up with a loophole to get around that!
290	Hmm. So you're going on a trip, then?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
291	Yep!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
292	Nyx has been saying that we really need to seize the day, since our time on this earth is limited.
293	And he thinks it'd be a shame to spend what little time we've got just fighting.
294	I always knew he had kind of a pessimistic streak in him, but that in particular really struck a chord with me.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
295	I decided then and there that I want to show him...
296	That time is truly infinite. And that there's a meaning to all of our fighting, somewhere out there.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
297	So I'm setting off to find proof of that for him.
298	I see.
299	Well, if that's what you've decided, far be it from me to stop you! Just...be careful out there.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
300	Heh. No promises!
301	So what about you, Adaleigh? Seems like you've properly settled down here. You cool with just planting roots, after all that adventuring?
302	Far as I'm concerned, this is an adventure in itself. I plan to analyze and research the world from here, and develop new technology to help make life a little better for everybody.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
303	I'll be doing my part to make this new world flourish!
304	If I'm being perfectly honest, I kind of thought you'd be going with Nimul on his quest.
305	He's still out there looking for a way to save Emmel, right?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
306	He is. But I think it's okay for me to sit that out.
307	Because I genuinely believe, one way or another, that Emmel will come back.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
308	I don't know when, or even if I'll still be alive at that point, but she'll be back. Mark my words.
309	I know in my heart she will.
310	And if this world were somehow worse than the Belt Regions when she does, I don't know how I'd ever be able to look her in the eye.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
311	So that's why I'm sticking around here and trying to make the world a little better. I want to make sure that when Nimul and Emmel return...
312	...they'll know that everything they did really meant something.
313	Makes sense to me. Give it your best, you lovelorn old fool!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
314	You know, you should try falling in love sometime, too. You don't want to wind up an old maid like that mentor of yours, do you?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0003
315	...
316	Hey. What's with the quiet treatment all of a sudden? It was a joke!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
317	Just thinking. You never know what that might do to a girl like me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
318	Hmm? Huh? What do you mean?
319	I'm just saying, the witch's curse runs pretty deep. Anyhow, I should get going! Catch ya 'round!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
320	Wait. You're kinda scaring me. Am I gonna get cursed?! Wait!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
321	Hmm... Suddenly, my ears are burning.
322	Are you all right, Ambrosia? You should take some time to rest and eat a proper meal. Your research can wait.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
323	Oh, please! Pretty sure it just means somebody's talking about me. I ought to curse them!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
324	You really need to stop cursing people! Think of poor Minario.
325	The motorcycle man? Ehh, he only got what was coming to him.
326	Though I've kind of lost interest, at this point. Definitely have less energy to spare on cursing motorcycle men than I used to, at least.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
327	Well, that's probably good, since it looks like things are going to be peaceful for some time to come.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
328	Yes, I suppose so.
329	I'm sorry I couldn't bring Quence back with me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0036
330	Can't say I'm surprised. That's just the kind of person he was.
331	He always acted so self-important and haughty, and then to be more capable than me on top of that? Honestly, his very existence made me so mad!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0022
332	Anyhow, I'm sure he had a grin on his face until the very end, didn't he?
333	He did.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
334	Hmph. Of course he did. Showoff.
335	All that time as my senior apprentice, and he never once pushed himself to outrank me! He just went off and did his own crazy thing. And look where that got him.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0020
336	All right. That should do it.
337	Thank you, Yna.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0033
338	No worries. This is my trade, after all.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
339	So, you've yet to find Andechs?
340	That's right.
341	I searched high and low for him until the point of no return for escaping the tower.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0030
342	I've gone back to search the surrounding area many times since the new creation, but have found neither hide nor hair of him. No body, no personal items... Nothing.
343	Strange. That does have some implications, though, doesn't it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
344	Particularly when I consider his last message to me.
345	I have a message from Andechs:	VO_slba.slba_sys_0001
346	"You've done so well. You're a truly wonderful, upstanding knight."
347	He wanted to make sure I told you that.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0030
348	As last messages go, that one just feels...sloppy. It's very uncharacteristic of him. So I choose to believe that he left it, knowing he'd be coming back. And I'm going to wait for him.
349	I'm certain he's still alive...somewhere.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0007
350	I think there's nothing wrong with believing that. This is a new world of hope, after all. Your faith may very well be what's keeping him going.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
351	So what are your plans from here on out, Yna?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
352	Well, there's this man I know. He blows through here from time to time like the wind in the fields. I've met him a few times since the new creation, but it's been quite a while since I last saw him.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
353	So are you thinking of going off in search of him, then?
354	Not exactly. See, whenever we did meet, we'd always talk about things like the fate of the world, developing our various skills, our families... You know, just catching up with each other.
355	And I've come to really look forward to those little chats. I feel like if he had something new to say, he'd swing by again. So I plan to just keep living my life, and waiting for that next encounter.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
356	I see. So just enjoying life, and the promises of tomorrow.
357	Yep, that's the long and the short of it. Though I do wonder about that other man, too.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
358	Not so sure I look forward to his next visit quite as much.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
359	Welcome back, Waginau.
360	Thank you. How have things been since my departure?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
361	The blessings of Sephiron remain in our hearts and minds, and shall continue to dwell there even should the world change once more.
362	It pleases me to hear it.
363	Never forget that we Sephira are the rightful attendants of the Holy Order of Babel—the mediators of this land.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
364	In this role, we must always ensure our skills are well honed, without sacrificing our compassion. But we must also ensure we seize the day, and live for ourselves first and foremost.
365	Yes, sir! I shall take that to heart. For the Sephira, and all that we represent!
366	We couldn't find you this time, either... Just where are you, Nimul?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
367	I can't fulfill Waginau's purpose without you. I hope that we'll be able to find you soon.
368	...Mm, I mustn't give up.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
369	Through all his years, Waginau was led by the desire to bring happiness to Nimul and Emmel.
370	So I will do the same. I will work to fill Waginau's shoes as best as I am able.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
371	At long last...
372	I finally made it.
373	Though this is little more than a gate.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
374	Grand Excelsior... Emmel, with all the Cursed Beast cores sealed away in her body...is no longer here.
375	She must be on the other side. But I no longer have the power to open that door.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
376	Too much of me went into the Ceremony of Creation. I have almost nothing left...
377	No energy remaining to stand against the origin of the Cursed Beasts—the original sin.
378	I am no longer able to save anyone or anything. This is all I yet have to give.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
379	Alchemy was meant to be a manifestation of the very will to change the world...
380	And yet, it was lacking something. It wasn't enough.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
397	I am but a single person with a dream—a single person who imagined a new world. And in the end, what I had to offer just wasn't enough to save it all.
398	If only I'd realized...
381	The seven sins are not something to fight against. We need to accept them. We need the will to live with them.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
382	I fought and struggled through so much to change the world and bring about an auspicious future...but what I needed were seven wills.
383	As a result of my misguided actions, the world will surely fall into sin and corruption again. These Sacred Stones now scattered throughout the world stand as lures...temptations...invitations.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
384	They will give birth to many a tragedy as history continues to be written. And yet...
385	To whosoever inherits the art of Alchemy—the art to sculpt the future of mankind...
386	I humbly implore that you please rescue my sister from her eternal darkness.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
387	Time must always march on. Seasons come and go.
388	The seven Sacred Stones that appeared throughout the world would come to cast great shadows over human history, just as Nimul had predicted.
389	The shell of peace that had enveloped this world without sin would gradually be cracked and shattered by human will. And within that egg lay a new age of war and misery.
390	It is the dawn of the Alchemy Age. And in this midst of recurrent upheaval, humans have slowly forgotten about something very important.
391	It's the grave of the founder, Nimul. So this is where it's been hiding!
392	Upon it is inscribed, "Here, My Sins Are Sealed."
399	Is this very inscription Alchemy? Is this gravestone itself a seal to protect this sinless land?
400	No matter.
393	...
401	I have my own goals. I wish to make use of the Alchemy of this holy place.
402	And I do so in the name of absolute justice.
394	"Here, Our Sins Are Sealed. Such Is My Sin. And Such Is My Prayer."
395	"Here Lies Our Original Sin. May It Be Also the Hope for Tomorrow. —Nimul and Emmel."
