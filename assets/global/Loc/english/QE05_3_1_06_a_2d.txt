001	This must be the deserted house that we were told about.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
002	Yeah. This must be where we'll find that gang with the strange marks on their bodies.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
003	Let's go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
004	Ack! What is that putrid smell?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
005	That...is the stench of rotten flesh.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
006	Look at that wall, Logi.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
007	Was this diagram...drawn in blood? And these alchemic tools on the floor, I've seen them before!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
008	It appears that this place was some sort of laboratory.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
009	There are traces of many people frequenting this place. It couldn't be more than a day since this one died.
010	But all of this is so... This is nothing like the Alchemy that I know of.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
011	How can such an inhumane deed as this be called Alchemy?
012	...
013	This must not continue. We cannot let this continue! Who would do such a—?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
014	Waaaaaaaaaahh!
015	That voice! It came from the other room!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
016	Tch! We were too late.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
017	N-no!
018	Who are you? Why do you stand in my way?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
019	Why?
020	What?
021	Why did you kill that child?! Why?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0021
022	This worthless thing? I could barely extract any Alchemia from it.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
023	I simply rid myself of worthless livestock. That is all.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
024	Huzzaaaaaaaah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
025	Haaa...haaa...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
026	What...is this? Who is this man?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
027	A Sephira.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
028	What?!
029	You came in search of the Sephira. Am I wrong?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
030	This can't be! The Sephira are a people that value wisdom and compassion! They would never have a hand in such deplorable acts!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
031	How can you be so sure?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
032	It's been a long time since they were considered to be the disciples of mercy.
033	Even that was nothing more than legend and hearsay. Would it really be so surprising if this was their true nature?
034	B-but...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
035	It's time to make a decision, Logi Crowley.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
036	There is evil before you. An unforgivable crime is being committed.
037	But at the same time, these could be the people you were looking for.
038	...
039	What will you do? Turn a blind eye to their deeds for the sake of your mission, or—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
040	I will stop them.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
041	This is wrong. What they are doing cannot possibly save anybody.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
042	Are you sure of your choice? Even if it means sealing the fate of your mission?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
043	Yes.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
044	Hmph. Naive, but not bad. I'm glad that you were the first to find us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
045	Isidore...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
046	I'm sorry. That name I gave you was an alias. I am not Isidore.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
047	My name is Kamui. I'm the head of the courier guild known as the Fruit Peddlers.
048	I am the one who bears the truth of the Sephira in order to impart it to the next generation.
049	Kamui! Are you really one of the Sephira?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
050	I am, and so too was the man you just cut down.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
051	In this past one hundred years, without a place to call home, our people have split into two factions.
052	We, the Fruit Peddlers, chose to adapt to the new era, to the new land, with hopes for the future.
053	The others, the Collectors of Wisdom, are lost souls unwilling to accept the loss of Sephiron, and have instead chosen to do whatever it takes to revive the great tree.
054	So then...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
055	Yes. Their purpose is the revival of Sephiron.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
056	They will not shy away from any evil to accomplish that goal.
057	And this... This is the result, is it?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
058	I did not expect them to have fallen so low.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
059	Never could I have anticipated that they would be desperate enough to have a hand in blood-drenched, alchemical taboos.
060	As if you could understand! You were fortunate enough to have been blessed with Sephiron's final grace, Protector.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
061	From the shadows?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0028
062	This level of subterfuge—these are the skills of Wadatsumi!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
063	We have spent the past hundred years gathering wisdom from every corner of this continent.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
064	Slothstein's magic, Lustberg's witchcraft, Wadatsumi's chakra, Saga's Ouija, and now...Alchemy!
065	All for the sake of Sephiron's rebirth!
066	We exist solely for this purpose!
067	Here they come, Logi! They're stronger than they look. Do not hesitate to use whatever force necessary!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
068	Ah!
