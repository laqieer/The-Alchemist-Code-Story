001	Well... Now the monsters are gone, but...
002	Is it just me, or is the mood somehow worse than before?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
003	Yes, well... Some things were said that perhaps shouldn't have been.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
004	Chocolate might not be enough to mend this situation.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0020
005	We came here as a team. We can't afford to be fighting amongst each other! Right, Noah?!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
006	Please don't put me in the spotlight.
007	Emma has a point, but as things stand, I cannot hope to focus on the task at hand. So...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
008	I challenge you to a duel, Itsuki!
009	Oh?
010	If I win, you will take back what you said!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
011	Hmph. Fine!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0044
012	A d-duel?! Are you certain that this is a good idea?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
013	We might just have to let them work this out their way.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
014	All we can do is watch over them. Oh, my... Some Valentine's this turned out to be.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1023
015	This is not at all what Valentine's is supposed to be like.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
016	Pfft! True friends can be made by butting heads! Okay, you two, I'll be the judge.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
017	All right. Face each other, and... Fight!
