092	And Kagutsuchi will be the key to victory. Now, what of restoring the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
093	According to Mikaboshi herself, it will require a great amount of mental strength, but all I'll need to do is offer up a prayer in the proper place at the proper time.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
001	Then we're ready. With this, the path of our counteroffensive begins to take shape.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
002	In the end, we will not just have Kagutsuchi on our side, but Mikaboshi and Sumeragi as well.
003	And with all Sacred Three of Wadatsumi in hand, we cannot lose!
004	Oh! Do you have news of Sumeragi, then?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
005	Jubei is presently following the ancient Black Star legends.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
006	Jubei...!
007	Okay, so what do we know, exactly?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
008	Recreating Sumeragi is a relatively straightforward matter. It must simply be reforged with the same materials that were used to create it.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
009	In other words, with the horn of a demon that Mikaboshi and Sumeragi knew well.
010	I see! And that's what Jubei is after, so it surely won't be long now!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0046
011	The problem is, it cannot be properly reforged without the flames of Kagutsuchi to temper it.
012	Okay. So we need Kagutsuchi if we wanna return Sumeragi to its former glory. Got it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	But Jubei has helped us take a firm step toward our goal.
014	And you, Amane, were the one who lit the fire in her. I am not a true successor to the Black Star, so there is...far too much I didn't know.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
015	...! Another demon's horn exists?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0025
016	Yes. Though I didn't realize it myself until Amane said something.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
017	I don't believe it! If something like that exists, shouldn't it have been passed down among the leaders of the Black Star Clan, seeing as Sumeragi is in their charge?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
018	This information is known only by those with pure Rising Ashes and Black Star lineage.
019	...!
020	I don't know the precise details myself. I only put it together when I thought back to the message Lord Zeke left for Lady Celis.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
021	What message?
022	"The Treasure Blade, the Spirit Stone, and the spare lie deep within Wadatsumi."
023	...!
024	The true meaning became clear when Amane spoke of the origins of Sumeragi and Mikaboshi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
025	Kaede's broken horn was forged into the blade of a sword by Sumeragi, the younger of the twins.
026	Is there not some lore about Sumeragi that has been passed down amongst the Black Star clan?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
027	Until Amane said that, it hadn't even occurred to me.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
028	It seems neither Lady Celis nor Lord Zeke ever came to understand its true meaning, either.
029	While it is told that there is a way to repair Sumeragi should it be broken, there were never any concrete details about how.
030	There was only a map with a single unlabeled marking on it.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
031	So the truth only became known through the message, the map, and the knowledge of how Sumeragi came to be?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
032	Precisely. The message tells not of where to look, and the map tells not of what is to be found there. So without the tale of Sumeragi's creation...	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
033	One would have no idea to seek another horn there.
034	Then why aren't we moving? We need Sumeragi for our counteroffensive, don't we?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
035	Amane is yet to return. And we require the flame of the sacred art Kagutsuchi before we can reforge Sumeragi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0039
036	Think of how disastrous it would be were we to obtain the horn, only to lose it in a demon attack...
037	We move when the time is right. Sometimes, slow and steady truly does win the race.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
038	We cannot afford to fail. We must repair Sumeragi.
039	To cut down all demons that may oppose us!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0019
040	...
041	...!
042	Then this Jubei person is—	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
043	Searching for the horn. She will return soon, and when she does, we will reforge the blade.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
044	Just when I was starting to worry about how things were going, it seems the future is bright after all! Pretty great news, don't you think, Amane?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
045	...
046	There's been a lot of talk here about bearing burdens of responsibility and fighting for the future, and I feel like that's too big a job for just two people.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
047	Best make it an even three!
048	Amane?
049	Yes... We'll do this all together. We'll protect this land we love, as one.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
050	We are now well and truly upon the path to restoring the Sacred Three. With our collective wills combined, we will fight for those who cannot, and show the demons that our time is not yet through!
051	...But, what about Celis? Why isn't she here?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
052	...
053	Captain Ugachi?
054	I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you. I regret to inform you that Captain Celis of the Blade Fox...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
055	Is no longer with us.
056	What...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
057	Jubei investigated the area where Celis and Judius fought. She was...found at the bottom of a nearby cliff, and passed away only moments later. There was nothing anyone could've done to save her.
094	No... She can't have died... I don't believe you! How dare you joke about something like that?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
095	I'm afraid it's the truth. According to Jubei's report, the wound on her abdomen is what did her in.
096	This dagger...
097	A keepsake Jubei brought back with her. You should take it. I was simply holding onto it to ensure it wouldn't be lost.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
058	No... This can't be happening...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0022
059	Amane! Get ahold of yourself!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0019
060	...
061	Keep your chin up, rookie. This is war! Save the mourning for after we've saved Wadatsumi!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
063	H-hey! Captain Ugachi!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
064	This is what it means to be Blade Fox.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
065	If you have time to grieve, you have time to fight. That's the greatest gift we can give our fallen allies.
066	Don't misunderstand me. I'm not telling you to forget, and I'm not telling you not to grieve. Things are looking up for us now, but we wouldn't be here were it not for Captain Celis. We all need to bear this burden.
067	I understand.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
068	Just be sure you're not bearing too many burdens at once, lest your back break under the weight.
069	...?
070	Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. For now, let's just relish our small victories while we can. The Sacred Three are within our grasp.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
071	We have Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. Hopefully Logi Crowley will arrive soon, and we can make the trio complete.
072	Though I suppose we have no way of knowing if he'll agree to assist us, House of Rising Ashes or no.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
073	What do you mean?
074	He knows nothing of Wadatsumi, I would presume. Will he believe us when we explain the situation to him? And will he accept the role we expect of him?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
075	Even if it may mean losing his life?
076	But... I...
077	The amount of effort you've put into tracking down and coaxing Logi Crowley to Wadatsumi is plain to see.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
078	But the fact remains, he is yet to appear.
079	It would be best for us to prepare as though things will not go to plan.
080	But, that's such a bleak outlook!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
081	You've got nothing to worry about. Everything will be fine once he gets here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
082	You've been searching across the whole continent, fighting Greed Dike, and doing everything under the sun for the good of Wadatsumi...
083	So trust me. He'll be on board. Logi's a good guy.
084	You'll strike a chord with him, for sure.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
085	...?
086	Reporting! A ship from the mainland has been spotted in the ocean west of Wadatsumi.
087	And it bears the ensign of Gluttony Foss, not of Greed Dike!
088	!!!
089	Edgar! Could it be...?	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0003
090	What'd I tell ya? Ye have little faith!
091	You sure did keep us waitin', though, Logi.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
