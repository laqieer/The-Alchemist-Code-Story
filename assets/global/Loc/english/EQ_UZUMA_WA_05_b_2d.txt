003	Bestow...that form...onto me...oh holy mother...Sephiron!
004	That which is lost can never be restored, no matter how much we desire or miss it.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0015
005	Still...we must continue forward without fear!
006	Ack...ahh...hahh...Uzu...ma! If you belong to the people of Sephiron...you must understand...how I feel!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
007	My desire to seek...Sephiron!

009	Hey, you! Uzuma is trying to move forward with her life! Don't get in her way!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018

020	...No...no, no! I have not seen this fate! There is no way I would not have seen it!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0020
021	My divinations are never wrong! Miuna is not supposed to die!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
022	(There must be a way to save her!)
023	(My...hourglass...)
024	...!!!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_1011
025	This sand...! If it truly is the sand of life, then...!)
026	(Mother! Save Miuna!!!)	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0015
027	!!!
028	...Uzuma?! What are you...
029	"Descend from your supreme heights, oh King. From nothing to infinity, from infinity arises the light. Oh, blessed, blessed, blessed."
030	"Transform your candor. I seek his soul, 22nd in form...come!"
031	... ...
032	(Please! Miuna, open your eyes!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043

037	Miuna! Oh, I'm so glad!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_1019
038	You...saved me?	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
039	Thank you...Uzuma!
040	No. It was Sephiron that saved you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
041	(Thank you, mother. Farewell.)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0034
042	I owe you so much, Uzuma.
043	Thank you for saving me.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0033
044	No. I'm the one who must thank you.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
045	Thank you for saving me from those who unite wisdom.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0033
046	I'm sorry...it took so long for me to thank you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0035
047	There is strength in your voice now.
048	Yeah. I could grow to like you...the way that you are now.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
049	...Me too...no.	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0019
050	I have grown to like you very, very much, Miuna!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
051	...?! Jeez, you're so direct! You're embarrassing me!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0050
052	Heheh...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0008
053	Ahahaha...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0008
054	...All right, Miuna. Let's head out soon.
055	Yes, dad!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
056	See you, Uzuma.
057	Take care!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
058	You two as well...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
059	... ...
060	(I don't think I'll ever see them again, but I'm sure that Ku Yogi...that both of them...)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
061	(They'll shine brightly...until the very end.)
062	A delivery for you.
063	Here. A letter and a parcel.
064	Thank you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0033
065	Oh...congratulations.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
066	Huh...? U-Umm...o-okay...delivery completed.
067	Congratulations? What is she talking about?
068	(Congratulations on your wife's pregnancy. May you raise a lovely family.)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
069	A letter...I wonder who it's from. Oh, it's from Miuna!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
070	"Uzuma...are you doing well? You haven't returned to being the frightened woman you used to be, have you?"
071	"Dad died."
072	"We returned to the smithy right after we left you and he began work on the Sephirium sword."
073	"As far as I know, Ku Yogi died completing his finest work yet."
074	"It was just the kind of satisfying end as a blacksmith that he'd always wanted."
075	"Dad was able to accomplish this because you told us where the Sephirium was."
076	"Once again, I'd like to sincerely thank you."
077	"I will carry on dad's...Ku Yogi's will and his legendary craftsmanship..."
078	"I train as hard as I can every day to surpass him as a blacksmith."
079	"In addition to the letter, I've sent you a parcel as well. I made it using the leftover Sephirium. It's my way of saying thank you for saving my life."
080	"It is the first piece of work that Ku Miuna, the future master craftswoman has created. You better take good care of it!"
081	"Well, stay healthy. —Ku Miuna"
082	(Miuna's first piece of work. I wonder what it is...)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0044
083	...Oh. An hourglass...	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
084	(I can feel the radiance of the Sephirium.)
085	(Within this work of art...the lives of the people Sephiron...along with Ku Yogi's craftsmanship, continues to live on!)
086	I'll take good care of it, Miuna!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0034
087	Oh...	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
088	(The flower fluff...carrying the seeds of life...)
089	What beautiful light... The sun's...light of life... Another day with such good weather.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
090	I'm sure today will be a great day as well.
091	The sands of the hourglass continue to flow towards their end...
092	However, when the end arrives, one merely has to flip the hourglass for the sands to flow again.
093	Life exists within the flow, carried along and joined together in unison.
