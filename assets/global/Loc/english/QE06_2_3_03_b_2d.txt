001	…
002	What a lovely night.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
003	…!
004	Relax. Call me Mitsuha. That's what Koga calls me. Is something troubling you?
005	Oh...no it's nothing…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
006	There's no use pretending. It's written all over your face.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
007	…
008	…It's strange. I never thought the day would come when I could let my guard down around demons.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
009	…I'm no longer a demon--now that I have no horns. But I can't really call myself human either…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
010	…I don't know--
011	You don't know where you belong, huh? That's quite a human feeling to have.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
012	…
013	If you regret it, why did you remove your horns in the first place?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0001
014	I don't know... Impulse, maybe.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
015	…Hahahaha! That also sounds very human!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0008
016	I don't regret it though. I wanted to do it.
017	But now I have even more questions... Who or what am I…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
018	…You are who you are. Humans and demons are more than labels.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
019	When I saw you break off your horns, I thought, "Maybe peace deserves a chance." It's a difficult thing for me to articulate.
020	But…Maybe that's it… I feel like Koga taught me that.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
021	…I see.
022	So, try not to overthink it... I suppose you just need more time.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
023	I'm worried about my brother.
024	At first, I wanted to live so that my brother wouldn't have to carry such a heavy burden… That was my hope, anyway…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
025	But I may have only added to his burden… I'd never thought about it until now.
026	Koga is the same way. He's a man with lofty ideals and a penchant for steamrolling others… However, I'm fond of him nonetheless.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
027	The fact that his ideals are born out of lived experience, moves me all the more.
028	You thought the same, right? Otherwise you wouldn't be here.
029	…Yes.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
030	Then do not hesitate. Lift your head up high, and press onward… I’m sure Koga would say the same.
031	…You're right.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
032	*Chuckle* Who would've thought I'd be having this conversation with a demon… The universe works in mysterious ways!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
033	…
034	…Here.
035	Is this your horn--Why are you giving me this?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
036	I want to entrust it to you, in case anything ever happens… I'm sure it will be of some use.
037	...You don't mean--	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
038	…I hope that day never comes.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
039	…Indeed.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
040	…The stars are so pretty.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
041	They are. We look to them to illuminate our path… After all, the stars are the spirits of our ancestors.
042	Spirits?
043	Yes…spirits of those who fulfilled their purpose on this earth...and those who didn't--they are the stars that shine upon us.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
044	Life--it's all connected. Koga said so…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
045	Only the future knows whether your decision is right or wrong. All you can do now is move forward with conviction.
046	Isn't that right? It doesn't matter who or what you are. The glittering stars will still shine upon you.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
047	…
048	At the very least, Koga chose you. That should be enough to satisfy you, right?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
049	…Yeah.
050	…
051	Then quit dawdling and hurry up and go to him… It's pointless to keep worrying.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
052	This is just the beginning of your noble cause… You can count on me every step of the way.
053	The Wadatsumi of tomorrow, the one Koga has set forth, will be a place of happiness. It is my duty to protect that future.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
054	…Mitsuha.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0004
055	…
056	…Thank you.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0034
057	…Twinkling stars, please light the way--for me…and for Koga.
058	I hope…these days will last forever.
059	…Tamba	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
