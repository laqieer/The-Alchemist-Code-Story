001	Shake the entire world? What are you talking about, Vice-Captain Monzein?!
002	It's simple.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
003	The Sacred Stones that belong to the Seven Kingdoms contain the power to destroy this entire world.
004	After all, they're the reason why the Seven Kingdoms wield the most power over the continent.
005	That's why, right now, we should be following our original plan and heading to Gluttony in order to rendezvous with the 4th Regiment.
006	But I sense a sinister presence from the direction of the wind shrine.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
007	If the 4th Regiment had been in pursuit of that presence, it means they went the wrong way.
008	Furthermore, there's a possibility that they will inflict harm on the people of Alize.
009	I agree. I wonder if the enemy managed to successfully trick Captain Kudan and the others.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
010	There's a possibility of that, but you can also think of it this way.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
011	Those traces of battle and the coat of arms of the 4th Regiment may be a ruse that those being pursued by the Holy Guard have set up.
012	What?!
013	Their intention is to deceive us and split us up.
014	That's absurd! You're reading too much into this. For starters, we're not certain that the 4th Regiment was even chasing this sinister presence.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
015	We should focus on preventing the possibility of a Sacred Stone being stolen instead of following some uncertain theory!
016	That also falls into the realm of theories as well! Plus, the only proof you have is that coat of arms on the ground. It's not very convincing.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
017	You...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
018	Please, don't fight! Let's calm down and come up with a plan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
019	What do you think about asking the cavalry of Gluttony for support?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
020	If there are enough men, we won't have to split up at all, right?
021	They're often moving about these grasslands. I'll fly my hawk to see if it can find any of them!
022	Although that makes sense, in theory, the reality is a little more complicated. The Gluttony cavalry are not very cooperative towards the Holy Guard.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
023	Huh...?! What...why?
024	The reason is simple. I come from the bloodline of the Alize people's chief.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
025	What? The people's chief...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
026	... ...
027	B-but what does that have to do with this?!
028	Tsk. Here they come! Save the talk for after we defeat these monsters!
