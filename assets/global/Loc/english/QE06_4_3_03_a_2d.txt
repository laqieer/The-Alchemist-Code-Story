001	Wh-what?! What is this?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
002	I don't think you've ever seen us like this, but I'm sure you still recognize us, don't you?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
003	I'm Kaede's daughter, Mikaboshi, and this is my little brother, Sumeragi.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0002
004	This is some sort of ruse. Why would you two be here?! Wh-what even is this place?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
005	I dunno, but I have a feeling my big sister can answer that. Am I right, Mikaboshi?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
006	This is the world within the blade Sumeragi. It was impossible for you to enter this place before.
007	But this time, your horn was used to reforge it, and it's that intrinsic link which allowed us to meet here now.
022	It's all thanks to Amane's Alchemic power. Though, that does mean our time here is pretty limited.
008	Amane...	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0002
009	We don't need to fight. What we need now is to talk. So I made sure we had all the right people here for the conversation.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
010	I want you to remember everything. Together, we can return Wadatsumi to the way it's supposed to be. To the way you once knew it.
011	You know the potential this land has. I just need you to remember it!
012	I know no such thing! It is our prerogative to eliminate the humans and reconstruct this land as a country for demons. That, and that alone, is what Wadatsumi is supposed to be!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
013	...!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
014	Will you let us take care of this?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
015	I didn't think I'd ever see the day I could fight alongside you again, Mikaboshi.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0007
016	Make sure not to slow me down, though, okay?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
017	That goes for you, too.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0010
018	D-don't either of you dare stand in my way! If you do, I'll cut you down as well!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
019	We're not going to go down that easily.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0017
020	If words aren't enough to reach you...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0002
021	Then we'll be happy to let our swords do the talking!
