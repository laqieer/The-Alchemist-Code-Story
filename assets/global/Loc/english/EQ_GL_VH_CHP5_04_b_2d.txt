001	Get over there, you numbskulls! And make sure the power's thoroughly cut!
002	I swear, not a drop of competence to be found!
003	There, there, Master. They're scientists, not soldiers.
004	That said, this is quite the headache... We can fiddle with these robots all we want, but the directives remain a confusing mystery.
005	And Zheng Yi is as frigid as an iceberg. One wonders whether his bedroom is really a cemetery.
006	Keep trying. Apart from throttling him entirely, turning up scraps of instructions buried in some stinking ditch is all we can do about these useless robots.
007	Li Wang angrily kicks at a Construct's severed head, sending it rolling to a stop at someone's boot.
008	D-Director.
009	These "useless robots" will one day shape a perfect world, Li Wang. Have care what you utter.
010	I understand. My apologies, Director.
011	As they are now, however, they are little more than thoughtless killing machines.
012	Rather similar to humans, no?
013	...Perhaps.
014	Hm. The Core's true functionality is only a fraction of what I expected.
015	I take it that the directives you procured were not complete.
016	Rest assured that they will be, soon enough. I have received further pieces of the puzzle not two hours ago.
017	As you were, then.
018	Grimm gives the haphazard laboratory a look of mild derision.
019	You'd do well not to repeat this incident, Marshal.
020	Your promises to the Director were rather lofty.
021	Insufferable suit. As if he wasn't terrified of losing his precious master's affections.
022	Enough. We have more important things to clean up.
023	You! What are you gawping at? Get these directives installed!
024	(How was the Director able to figure out a robot's functionality simply by glancing at its severed head?)
025	(Wiser to keep dancing to their tune...for now.)
026	Several days later, at the outskirts of Greed Dike...
027	Strange...this has a totally different feeling from that little town we met in.
028	The closer it is to the capital, the more opulent and luxurious it gets. Pure posturing, of course.
029	I don't like this place. It feels so...oppressive.
030	The coast is clear. Should we split up?
031	There are multiple paths to our destination, but all are delineated by a deceptively simple waymark.
032	Follow these markers along the dirt path, and stick to the shadows.
033	All right.
034	Stay close to me, Eira.
035	Okay, Emmy.
036	That's amazing... It's so easy to miss these. They camouflage so well with the cobblestones!
037	Humans never cease to amaze me even after all this time.
038	If only it was merely pleasantry and none of the violence we're so prone to.
039	This way.
040	The still air brings to mind the musty aroma of long-dried flowers and a vague hint of steel.
041	*cough* What is this place?
042	Looks like something terrible happened here.
043	One of our safehouses. They have been in use for quite sometime.
044	This one hasn't been ransacked by Li Wang's men, at least.
045	Shion feels for something behind a creaking bookshelf, and retrieves a tiny key.
046	He fishes up a small lockbox from a hidden compartment beneath the floorboards.
047	This was as much as we were able to dismantle. The main Core was too large to conceal, so we salvaged its parts instead.
048	These look like...metal plates of some sort.
049	Hmm...Sister Atropos's components.
050	I wonder if that would help, though.
051	What do you mean?
052	Um...Sister Atropos is really resilient. Even without several components, she can continue functioning, but...it won't be the same, I think.
053	But she should be easier to stop, since she's just operating at a basic level.
054	That was close. I saw a patrol combing the fringes.
055	They must have been ordered to search for something.
056	Eira...don't like this place.
057	No doubt for these components. We should get going before—
058	Just then, the door opens abruptly.
