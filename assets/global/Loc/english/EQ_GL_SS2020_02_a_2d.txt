001	We're here.
002	*mumble* *mumble*
003	What's that sound?
004	*grumble* Stupid Sieg leaving me all alone again with just a stupid note ...
005	so what if he is just going to sort out some tiresome matters...
006	I'd be more than happy to accompany him!
007	Ah.
008	...
009	...
010	Blair! How lovely to see you again!
011	Hi Roxanne!
012	Oh, I'm sure you've heard from Soren by now.
013	In recognition of your contributions to technology and advancements in the field of automata, the Inventor's guild is pleased to invite you to join as a State Artificer.
014	In addition, you have also been granted tenure at the Artificer Academy, where you will be required to teach classes and have access to your own workshop for personal projects. We look forward to seeing your future advancements and discoveries!
015	Congratulations Blair! You've earned it.
016	Congrats!
017	Thank you!
018	I never thought I would achieve such a prestigious title. It's such an honor.
019	Mmm.....
020	What is it Roxanne?
021	Recently, I've gotten some complaints of some orphanage kids causing havoc.
022	Blair! This is a great chance to show the townsfolk what a State Artificer can do!
023	Don't worry! I know a thing or two about handling kids. Leave it to me!
024	Wait, Blair!
025	Annnnd she's gone.
026	Fufufu.
027	We have to do something about those old and unfashionable clothes of hers.
028	...
029	There are no actual rumors, are there?
030	Never mind that. Here's the plan...
031	...
032	Yeah? It's a pretty solid plan if I do say so myself.
033	I'll need a break after this...
034	That's the spirit! Now, let's go round up some abandoned Droids!
035	So, I'm assuming we'll need an army to pull this off?
036	Oh...just a handful will do. How about 30?
037	It's fine if they are missing a limb or two.
038	Oh!
039	What luck! There's a whole pile of fully intact ones here!
040	*Whirrrrrrrrrrr!*
041	Ugh, looks like I don't have a choice!
