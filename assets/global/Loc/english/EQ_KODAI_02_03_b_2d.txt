001	Hmph, they do seem stronger than normal... But they're still just beasts, and I can take them out all the same.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
002	GRUUUAAAAAAA!!
003	What a pathetic roar. You're about to die and that's all you can manage? You should be fighting with every ounce of your being!
004	...How are you this strong? Are you even human?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0003
005	Judging one's strength by their race is a bad habit of dragons, Schmeier.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
006	With enough training, anyone can reach this level.
007	I wonder...
008	But these beasts, they seem to have been corrupted by Magil somehow.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
009	They seemed almost like dragons. But there was some sort of stagnation within them.
010	You mean this is something even you've never seen?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
011	Well...I can't make any conclusions just yet. For now, let's just collect a sample and head back.
012	Sure, let's get back to--Who's there!?
013	Busted...
014	Umm, who are you exactly?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
015	I'm Carnet. I was just...hunting.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
016	Oh, are you out here cleaning up these beasts too? Sorry, but we already took out all of the ones in this area.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0035
017	That's too bad.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0007
018	Well then, I'll try somewhere else.
019	Oh, well, be careful out there!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
020	...
021	What is it, Matia?
022	...It's nothing.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
023	(That girl just now.. I could sense her bloodlust. It wasn't aimed at the beasts...but Schmeier.)
024	Come on, let's get back to town for our reward. We can talk about what's next after we get back.
025	All right. ...Should we bring something back to prove they're dead?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
026	...Heh.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
027	That's why I said I was gonna cut off their heads. Pretty efficient, right?
028	...
029	A dragon...
030	I had no idea any still existed in this layer.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0031
031	...I should probably report this back to Aedith.
