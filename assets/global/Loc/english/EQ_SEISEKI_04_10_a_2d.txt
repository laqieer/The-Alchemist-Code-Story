001	Hey...we finally made if halfway.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0009
002	I tried to say it in an exaggerated tone, but it doesn't really look that different...although I guess that's normal.
003	Hey...Captain Othima.
004	Hm?
005	Thank you for just now. If we'd continued on like this...
006	No need to thank me. We're comrades after all.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
007	Huh...?
008	I'm not very good at moving in groups, but I love my fellow knights.
009	Captain Othima...
010	You're a strange one, Captain...	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
011	Huh? Are you gonna take a shot at me for saying that? You're supposed to be moved to tears!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
012	I thought you weren't really reliable, but actually, you seem to read the situation far in advance. Yet, at the same time, there are some things you don't do well...
013	To be honest, I don't know what it is you're thinking.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
014	When you put it like that, I start to lose confidence about what it is that I'm thinking as well.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0011
015	Oh, sorry! I didn't mean it in a bad way.
016	Hahah. Don't worry about it. After all, my nickname is the devil's child.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
017	I'm used to people saying that they don't understand what I'm thinking.
018	The devil's child?
019	When I was a chid...I used to see things that I was better off having not been able to see.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
020	The presence of monsters is one thing, but I could easily see devilish fairies as well.
021	That's why I can also tell which humans are going to be attacked by goblins.
022	And I can also predict when a fire, earthquake, or storm is coming.
023	You can really do that?! That's amazing!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0046
024	You'd think, right? I would teach others these things out of the kindness of my heart, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
025	Eventually, they started calling me the devil's child who would attract goblins.
026	Everyone from my village came to hate me and I was eventually almost killed. By the way, this is the mark they branded on me then.
027	This...?! This mark is...the devil's seal!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
028	Teacher, what is that?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
029	It is a mark that is branded onto those who are deemed outsiders. It's the sign of an outcast.
030	I can't believe that someone with that mark would be within the Holy Guard.
031	You just asked me why I joined the Holy Guard, right? Well...
032	When I was nearly killed by the villagers, Lord Zain saved me.
033	...!
034	He didn't care about my nickname of devil's child or my brand. He treated me without discrimination.
035	He said that all children have right to build their own future.
036	In that moment, I decided that I would follow this mine.
037	I didn't know you had that kind of past. I'm sorry.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
038	It's fine, it's fine. It's in the past. More importantly, wait 3 seconds.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
039	Huh...?
040	3, 2, 1...here they are.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
041	Eek?! What's with this monster?!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0027
042	I've never seen a monster like that in this land before.
043	Most likely, it's the reconnaissance army of those trying to steal the Mikaboshi.
044	Steal the Mikaboshi?
045	Even the Holy Guard can't hide something as big as the Mikaboshi,
046	from the public for too long.
047	If there are any who have obtained the information and want to take the Stone for themselves...
048	Well, the Holy Guard will be a thorn in the side for them.
049	In that case...I'd throw at least this much in the path they're most likely to pass. I'd probably do that.
050	No...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
051	Well, even if we wanted to ignore them, when they're this big, it becomes difficult. We've no choice but to pass them by force!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
