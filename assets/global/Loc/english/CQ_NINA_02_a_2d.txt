001	Ngh?!
002	(Why did I stop?!)
003	Why do you hesitate? Show me your resolve!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
004	Eep! Aaahh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
005	I win.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
006	Ngh... I guess I really am weak.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
007	Not at all.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
008	Huh?	VO_neena.neena_chara_1005
009	You fight well and your talents are more than sufficient. However, you are lacking something crucial.
010	Would you tell me the reason why you wish to join the Scarlet Flame Guard so badly?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0002
011	I want to repay Sir Gerald for everything he's done for me—but I'm not good enough, and I don't even know what it is I'm missing!	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
012	I presume you are talking about the Sir Gerald who serves as the vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0005
013	Yes. Sir Gerald has helped me out a lot, and his father saved me once.
014	I don't think I could ever truly repay him for everything he's done for me, but I want to try.
015	I see. Miss Nina, what you lack is not strength. It is resolve...or perhaps I should say faith.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
016	For whom do you fight? For what purpose? What are the beliefs that drive your blade, and where is your resolve to see them through?
017	These are the things you lack, Miss Nina.
018	The proof lies in your halted attack during our fight.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0020
019	Huh? Th-that was just...	VO_neena.neena_chara_1005
020	I can understand your hesitation. It is something that we all face on the field of battle, many times over.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0005
021	However, the only means of overcoming your hesitation is conviction.
022	As I have said, this is what you lack—and that is why you lost to me. It was not a question of strength, but of resolve.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0002
023	Conviction...	VO_neena.neena_chara_1005
024	Your convictions have no justice to them.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
025	If you truly wish to join, you must show me proof that you have the conviction to stand by your principles.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
026	U-um!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
027	W-would you...keep teaching me? Please! I really, really want to improve!
028	I suppose I could. My squadron is due to leave on a monster hunt shortly. Will you join us?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0007
029	Yes! I'd be happy to!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0038
030	Good. Glad to have you on board.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0037
031	Y-you mean it?! Thank you! Thank you so much!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0033
032	Listen up, everyone. This is Nina. She'll be accompanying us on our mission.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
033	She's not a knight, but I'm sure you won't have any complaints about her sword arm. Treat her like she's part of the team!
034	Hi! It's lovely to meet you all!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
035	A therian?
036	She's a damn therian...
037	O-oh...
038	(I should've known...)	VO_neena.neena_sys_0030
039	(But...I can't afford to let this get me down!)
040	First, we'll head to the village that has been suffering monster attacks.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
041	The wastelands nearby are supposed to be rife with the creatures.
042	Recently they've gotten braver, and have started skulking around the edge of the village. It's only a matter of time before they assault the village proper.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
043	It is up to us to put down these monsters and restore peace to the village.
044	All right, let's begin. Be on your guard!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0012
045	Huh?
046	—————!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0028
047	(W-was that a scream?!)
048	Dilga! Someone's being attacked!
049	What?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0006
050	You might not have heard it, but my ears are more sensitive than humans'. There was a scream coming from that direction!	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
051	Lead the way, Nina.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
052	S-stay away! Stay back!
053	Huzzah!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0004
054	Are you all right?!
055	Y-yes, I'm... Y-you're...! You're a therian!
056	I...um...
057	(Just forget about it, Nina! Focus on what's most important here!)
058	I'll take care of this! Please, get yourselves to safety!
059	R-right... Sorry about that. You saved our lives! Please, protect our village!
060	Grrroooooorghh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
061	Captain! Another wave is coming!
062	These numbers are far greater than what we expected. You there! Run back to the capital and call for reinforcements!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0020
063	I want you and your knights to defend the village. The rest of the squadron will maintain a line of defense here with me. These fiends will not get past us!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
064	Understood!
065	As knights of the Envylian Guard, it is our duty to prevent any further harm from coming to these people!
066	For our nation and the people of this land!
067	Huzzah!
068	Nina, I'm counting on you to support us. Fight well!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0002
069	Right! Y-you too!
070	We've taken out so many of them, but...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
071	Grrroooooorghhhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
072	Captain! We have sustained heavy losses. We should momentarily withdraw and regroup!
073	You idiot! What do you think will happen to the village if we withdraw? We must hold fast until reinforcements arrive!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0015
074	But, sir—!
075	If I were to withdraw now and let this village be overrun by monsters, I would be breaking my oath to protect the people of this land and Envylia!
076	I would rather die than let that happen!
077	Dilga...
078	What does being a therian have to do with anything? What should be protected in this world but the joy and laughter of the people—of all people?
079	I will not stand by and watch someone's home be taken from them!
080	Now, you run along, and don't worry about me. I'm not going to fall here! Gwahahaha!
081	I...
082	I agree! We can't withdraw!
083	We're the only people who can protect this village!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
084	This village is someone's hometown! How would you feel if it was your hometown that was in danger? Would you stand by and watch it fall?!
085	Th-that's...!
086	Stand fast! This is what you have been training for!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0001
087	If you cannot even protect this village you're standing right in front of, how can you hope to protect the whole of Envylia?!
088	I will fight! Even if I'm left here to fight alone, I won't budge an inch!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0010
089	Hah. Well? Are your ears not burning with shame?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0007
090	The enemy has dwindled! Let's show them what our determination is made of!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0012
091	Huzzzzzzaaaaaahhhhh!
092	Huzzaaah!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0032
