001	Draconic Swipe!!!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0001
002	Grk...!!!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
003	Urgh... Y-you...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
004	Odd, your strikes seem to be losing impact... Are you too distracted to provide proper opposition?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0029
005	...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
006	You have lived your life burdened with the loss of your family.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
007	...!
008	This grieves me, but I can't allow myself to waver over it. What you are doing is wrong!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
009	The only thing I can do is make sure that what happened to you will never happen to anyone else!
010	Urk...!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
011	I won't let your suffering be in vain... For your pain, and for the family you loved!
012	Agh! Ughh! Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
013	Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
014	Agh?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0043
015	N-no... I can't...let myself...fall... Not here! Urgh...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0019
016	Please, look at me. Believe me when I say I will make sure the dream you once held becomes a reality.
017	Kanon...
018	Humans truly change in remarkable ways as they grow. Once a simple, kind girl who was inexperienced with the sword...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
019	Now a formidable swordswoman in her own right, able to empathize with the deepest of sadness, and committed to protecting the people of the world.
020	Th-that's overstating it a little bit.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
021	Ha! And humble! You are truly an exceptional successor, all that Zain and I could have ever hoped for. You have done well, Kanon.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
022	Captain Cadanova...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
023	Wh-what?! It can't be... Cadanova?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
024	Ah... Miu. It is wonderful to see you in such good health after all this time.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
025	No way! W-wait... Is this real?! Are you really...? Why...?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
026	It is something of a long story, so it might be better to put it off until later.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0035
027	Huh?
028	Child...of Yogi Ku...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0019
029	...!
030	N-now that...I think about it...he did say something...about a daughter...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
031	H-he's still breathing?!
032	This man is dangerous. Miu, stand back.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
033	Wait!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
034	What...?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
035	I just need a moment. I want to talk to him. My father once held this man in high esteem.
036	He said...that you were a man who cared deeply about the fate of this world.
037	After meeting you, my father defied the Lord Commander, and even as he neared death, he created that one last sword!
038	I need to know how you could have become like this. Explain to me how you could betray my father's spirit this way!
039	Miuna...
040	Will you betray him again by failing to face what you have done before the sword he engraved with his own soul? The sword that he trusted you to carry?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
041	...!
042	I...was once filled with purpose. My dream... That dream was what gave me life. That was all I had, but it kept me going. Once I realized it was impossible...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
043	My life...became a nightmare.
044	Realized it was impossible...? Something terrible must have happened to make you lose hope so completely.
045	Ha. You guessed it. There was a man that I believed could bring about the world I imagined...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0019
046	...but he disappeared from this world.
047	Wait... Are you talking about...Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
048	Ug...gh...! Nngh... This...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
049	At that moment...I realized that my dream would...never be more than just a dream.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
050	What was left of my hopes for the world...died that day...once that bright flame...had been extinguished.
051	Bright flame... Lord Zahar is...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
052	S-so then... What was left...for me?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
053	Only...b-battle... The never ending...cycle...of violence and death... Until I could finally...finally be reunited...with my family.
054	The final...path... The path th-that led to...Sol.
055	......
056	Step aside, Miu. I will deal with him.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
057	Huh?
058	The one who took Zahar from this world, and so the one who turned your dream to ash...was me.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
059	It seems that the three of us are intertwined by fate. The least I can do for you is to finally take your pain away from you...permanently.
060	W-wait! Please, this isn't what my father would have wanted.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
061	You, girl... I must...apologize to you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0035
062	Huh?
063	I...disgraced your father...with my actions. This is...the only path...to atonement...left for me.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
064	I...will not...force another...to sully their blade!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
065	Wait! No! Please, wait!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
066	Live by the blade, die by the blade... This is the path I choose! This sword which has been at my side through it all... It now gives me a clear path forward!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
067	Farewell!
068	No!!!
069	Miuna...
070	That fool...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
071	Huh?
072	My father, he... He forged that sword with the intent to keep that man from dying. My father wanted for him to live on more than anything.
073	......
