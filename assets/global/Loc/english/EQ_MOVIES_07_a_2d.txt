001	Where...am I?
002	This is the Darkness; the Darkness that lies...within you.
003	Why...was I...?
004	I-I thought...they were my friends. Liz...Edgar... Why would they do this to me?
005	Once...when we walked this land alive...
006	We used our powers to help the people. And yet...
007	Even in death, we are summoned. We fight, we battle and continue to do so...
008	And for what?
009	We Phantom Soldiers have never been allied...or had any friends.
010	We are only summoned...
011	And given orders...
012	And upon those we have fought.
013	Sometimes, in order to carry out the will of the summoner, we must battle with living men and women.
014	Sometimes, our opponents are fellow Phantom Soldiers; even those with whom we have pledged vows of friendship.
015	Sometimes... We are pitted against the sins that plague this land—even if it means that we must turn our backs on the way of the world.
016	None of it is by our own will. We are only used.
017	They have sought to use you, too, have they not?
018	You are no different to us... Such is the lot of a Phantom Soldier.
019	If you think we're wrong...
020	Then tell us. What is a Phantom Soldier?
021	I-I...!
022	I'm...useless. Totally...useless. So I... I...may as well be...put to use...
023	For the sake...of this world...
024	I... I will be...
025	Bwirr!
026	What is it, Flappy?! Can you sense Kasumi's Alchemia?
027	Bwirru!
028	Look! Over there!
029	Kasumi!
030	I...will be...killed. I was...killed. Destroy... I will be...destroyed!
031	No! Kasumi is being swallowed up by the Darkness!
032	What?!
033	At this rate...she will become like them! Like the other Phantom Soldiers!
034	Kasumi!
035	Tch! Get out of my...way!
