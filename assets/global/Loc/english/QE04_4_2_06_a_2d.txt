001	Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
002	He's gone... Georgios, we won't let your death be in vain!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
003	I've had enough of this!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
004	The dragon must have ingested Beelzebub again. It's probably back in the same place!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
005	You've got to come quick!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0020
006	What's wrong, Rega?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
007	The dragon... It's glowing a completely different color now!	VO_rega.rega_battle_0019
008	...?!
009	Its neck is flashing blue! Is it going to breathe fire again?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
010	No, wait! It's not fire...its water this time!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
011	What do you mean?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0026
012	Could it be a dragon in command of multiple elements?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
013	Ack! It's going to do it again! Let's get out of here!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
014	The village and the forest are going to be flooded!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
015	Dang it... We can't let any more people die! But we've got no way to destroy the core!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
016	No! The water's coming this way!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
017	Leave it to me! Freeze Over!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
018	Dangit!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
019	Can we really take the dragon down ourselves? Without Georgios? Are we going to be enough to get the job done?
020	How are we supposed to succeed in this?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
021	Mocca, it's coming this way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
022	Drats! There's no way we can avoid it!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
023	Fret not! You're in safe hands now. We will take on the dragon.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0035
024	Voda! Fuu! Tehre!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0047
025	Now then, shall we show them the true power of the Sprite Trio?	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
