001	Agh! H-he's strong!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0022
002	Enough, Logi! You're no match for him!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0018
003	W-wait, dad! Stand back!
004	What...?
005	I'll take care of this! Dias took down a Demon!
006	I need to become a knight like him as well! I made that promise to him!
007	Speaking firmly, Logi heads towards the black knight.
008	I promised him that I would build a peaceful world where Agatha could be happy!
009	I can't keep relying on Dias for everything! I will also do my part in bringing about peace! Huzzah!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0009
010	Ssshhh... Hohhh...!	VO_Kurokishi.Kurokishi_battle_0001
011	That black knight...!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0025
012	Huff...huff...! Dias... I'm going to keep my promise as well!
013	Exhausted, Logi collapses onto his knees. Zeke rushes forward and holds out his hand.
014	Are you okay, Logi?!
015	Ack! Forgive me, brothers!
016	The blood crystals of my people... These Philosopher's Stones must be delivered to Lord Sabareta, so that they may connect to our light of hope!
017	The 'light of hope'...! Sabareta called the ancient weapon 'the light of hope that will lead the world to chaos'!
018	So...the Philosopher's Stones are a source of power for the Demon after all!
019	We cannot allow this. All knights must dedicate their efforts to finding Sabareta as soon as possible!
020	Logi, you return to camp and get your wounds treated.
021	No, please let me go too!
022	That's absurd. Your wounds...
023	Both Wratharis soldiers and Dias are fighting this battle with heartbreaking resolve!
024	These wounds are nothing in comparison! I have resolved myself to take part in Agatha's rescue!
025	Very well. We must hurry. I will leave the Blue Flame Guard under your command. Dedicate all your resources to finding Sabareta and the Demon.
026	Yes, Sir!
027	Do not take any risks. Once you find the Demon, report back to me immediately.
028	Don't worry! I'm your son, dad! I will not let them resurrect the Demon! As for Agatha, I will do whatever I can to rescue her!
