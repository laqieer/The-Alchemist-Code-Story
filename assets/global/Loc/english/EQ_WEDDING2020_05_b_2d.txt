001	Hyaaaah!	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0032
002	Oof!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
003	Alright then. Now the villagers can live in peace.
004	Yes...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
005	I suppose the monsters didn’t really want to attack anyone.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
006	I hope the mine can get back to normal soon, too.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0005
007	…
008	What's wrong, Lucia?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0005
009	Ewan is still so radiant. I can't wrap my head around it.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
010	He is, isn't he? I think he finally realized his purpose.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
011	His purpose, huh?
012	(The miners, the bride and groom…and now Ewan…)
013	(Maybe…what makes you shine is following your heart...)	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
014	…to help someone else…	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0045
015	Never would've thought those bandits were the reason for the monsters…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
016	Don't worry. Once the forest returns to normal, the monsters will return to their natural habitat.
017	But in case they come back, don't attack them. Start a fire instead. They're afraid of flames.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
018	Oh? Will do! Thanks again for all your help. Please, take this as a token of our gratitude.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
019	Felicitite! Can we really have it?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0009
020	It's the least we could do. Once everything settles down, we can finally get back to work.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
021	Always remember "Safety first!"	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
022	Yes ma'am!
023	Yippee! I can make a wedding knife with this!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
024	Weren't you struggling to come up with a design?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
025	Yeah… Actually, I still haven't worked out all the kinks yet.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
026	I just can't seem to visualize anything that’s not a weapon.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
027	So, I'll stop fussing over that part and focus on the bringing joy part. That’s when ideas start to flood in!
028	Like seeing the smiles on everyone's faces as they use my wedding knife!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0008
029	Looks like you have all the inspiration you need.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
030	Yep! Until now, all I could think about was what kind of weapon I would make…	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
031	But it's also important to consider "who" I'm going to make it for!
032	Lucia…
033	Oh yeah! The more I talk about it the clearer it gets. I just know I'll make a wonderful wedding knife!
034	Alright! No time to waste! Gotta get started! And I need to do a few test cuts before I show you.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
035	"T-Test cuts?" What are you going to cut? Wedding knives should only be used to cut cakes!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0026
036	Wow... Glad to see her so animated!	VO_yuen.yuen_chara_1010
037	You seem happy, Ewan.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0001
038	Do I? For you to say that means you must be too.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
039	I didn't think I'd ever be carefree enough to fully appreciate Lucia's passion for weapon making.
040	…Yeah. I'm glad to see you've come around.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
041	If her appreciation of the world has deepened without her losing herself…
042	…Then I'm more than happy.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
043	Well then…I think I'll join the party after all.
044	Oh? What a pleasant surprise.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0044
045	Hm? Come on, a man is allowed to change his mind.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
046	Although, I do think weddings are a bit out of character for me.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
047	But if I go on saying that I get the feeling I’ll get chewed out. Besides...
048	I've got to see this through to the end--and see her creation bring a smile to everyone's face.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0008
049	Live, Love, Laugh, and be happy.<br>Wishing you all the best!
