001	This is the ruins of Fort Mugarde! Where's Agatha...? Agatha!!!
002	We meet again, boy.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0001
003	Sabareta!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
004	So, it was you not Zeke who led the Blue Flame Guard here. Well, that's somewhat anticlimactic.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
005	Where is Agatha?!
006	She's been imprisoned in a cell. It's deep within the dungeon and is crowded with monsters who've consumed Philosopher's Stones.
007	What—!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
008	My apologies, but I'm pressed for time. I must go and resurrect an ancient weapon.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_battle_0018
009	The Philosopher's Stones... You're planning on resurrecting the Demon!
010	Heheh... Will you save the girl first? Or will the Demon be resurrected first? We shall see.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
011	Sabareta, you...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
012	Is there nothing left for me to do?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
013	I know that this will bring sorrow and suffering to everyone. Yet, can I only observe helplessly from the sidelines?
014	Is there no way we can resist this tragic fate? Is this the end that the gods desire for us?!	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0014
015	No...! It can't be! As long as we are alive, there must be meaning to it all!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
016	We live, and so we are allowed to dream of a peaceful future!
017	Please stop this mistaken choice, this future that threatens to be stained with the cycle of sorrow!
