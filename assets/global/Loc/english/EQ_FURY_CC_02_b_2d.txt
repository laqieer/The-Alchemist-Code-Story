001	Tch...! Kill them!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
002	Now hold on just one second...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
003	Kill them! I'd rather die than be eaten by a demon!
004	Leafah?
005	Uwaaah!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0026
006	Please... May we speak?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
007	Yes, you may. In fact, please do.
008	Leafah.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
009	Yeah, that's me!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
010	I am not a demon.
011	Liar! What was that thing you were using to fight with, huh? I've never seen anything like that before! You can't hide the truth from me! You're a demon! A demon!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
012	No. I merely wield the magic rites bestowed upon me as a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi.
013	M-m-ma-ma-magic r-rites?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
014	There's nothing to be afraid of. See?
015	Ngh... H-huh? I feel...calm.
016	That was a spell to soothe the spirit. I can also create illusions, which I can use to show you the landscapes of Wadatsumi...like this.
017	They're...beautiful...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
018	I'm using my memories to give the illusion a sense of reality. That acts as a kind of anchor to the spell.
019	Creating illusions like this is part of my magic rites, and requires a lot of auditory and visual experience. That is why I decided to leave my home: to travel and study abroad.
020	Y-you're an o-o-occultist! You're trying to spread your horrible curses, the curse of Wadatsumi, across the continent!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
021	Magic rites might sound scary, but consider this. "Rite" is a homonym of "right", and a rite of passage is something experienced by children and knights alike.
022	I believe that what truly matters is not the form power takes, but the intent of the person who wields it.
023	Are we not examples of this truth ourselves? Look at us. You stay your hand, and I use my talents to show you pretty images.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
024	Nnrgh! I won't be swayed by your illusions, fiend!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
025	How can I make you understand?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
026	Y'know, I did get permission to bring her on the ship.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
027	No one told me she would be a demon!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
028	You're not even trying to listen, are you?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
029	Hah! Why should I let a filthy occultist attempt to deceive me, the future general of this nation?!
030	Leafah...
031	Oh, well. The coast isn't far now. I guess we can go.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0029
032	Go?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
033	The sea's calmed down now. See?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
034	Yes, but... No! Surely you're not suggesting...?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0040
035	Scared, are you? Of a little challenge like this?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
036	What about our luggage? I don't want to get my kimono wet, either! This is my favorite! My best one!
037	Now it'll be your wettest one.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
038	Let go of me! I'm sure we can talk this out with her! I just need time!
039	Like I said, some people won't listen no matter what you say to them.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0031
040	Ikasa, stop!
041	You know what they say: two's a company.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
042	Nooooooooooo!
043	A-after them!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
044	Ikasa! I'm not very good at swim—blbrf!
045	Ahahahaha!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0008
046	Don't laugh! I mean it! Ngh, my clothes are too heavy!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0012
047	So take 'em off.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
048	I told you, this is my favorite—blblblbl!
049	Ahaha! C'mon, grab on to me!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0008
050	Blblblblgf!
051	Hey, just look at me, okay? Don't worry about anything else. Take my hand.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0002
052	D-don't let go!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
053	I won't. I'm not leaving you ever again.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
054	Blblblgf! Wh-what was that? I-I couldn't hear you over the sound of me drowning!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
055	I know, I know. Just hold on tight, Button.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
