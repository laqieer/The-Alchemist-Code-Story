130	Horyaaah!	VO_rameses.rameses_battle_0004
001	Numu...mu...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_c
002	That should be the last of that. All that remains is to apply the antidote.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
003	Is everyone all right?
004	Ah, you two! Never have I been gladder to see you!
005	The townspeople said you all took off towards the orphanage, so we followed.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
006	That's the most enormous Ratty I've ever seen. I do hope I have enough antidote...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
007	Urgh... What happened?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0042
008	You drank a festival's supply of potions and then turned into a Ratty the size of a house.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0031
009	Waaah! Director! Thank goodness you're all right!
010	Ah, there you are, children. I'm sorry if I worried you.
011	Why did you drink all those potions? Didn't you think it might be a bad idea?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
012	I figured if I did, I could knock the whole carnival for a loop. Like one big pleasant surprise for everyone.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
013	My plan was to win the prize and use the winnings to hold a Halloween party for the orphanage.
014	All the kids have given up on going to the carnival. I just wanted to give them a pleasant surprise of their own this year.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0030
015	So it was really all for the children...
016	But why in the world did you drink so many?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
017	A lot of the townspeople had already taken one.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0004
018	I figured that just one potion wouldn't be enough to stand out, so I took as many as I could.
019	I hope you realize how irresponsible that was.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
020	Ordinarily, this is the point where you would face the consequences of all the trouble you've caused.
021	However, it is clear as day that you mean much to these children, and I am satisfied that you acted with their interests at heart.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
022	In light of your good intentions, I will grant you my royal pardon.
023	You mean...? Th-thank you!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0033
131	However! As the ruler of this institution, you have a duty to be more thoughtful. Look upon the distress your actions have caused your young subjects!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
024	Endangering yourself, no matter how noble your intentions, causes those who care for you to suffer. Never forget that.
025	I-I won't!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0005
026	Although, in this case, I must accept some responsibility myself for proposing this ill-advised contest.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
027	After all, a surprise is only pleasant if it is conceived of with consideration for the feelings of others.
028	The mark of a truly pleasant surprise is a smile on every face once all is over.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
029	A smile on every face...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
030	My, these are just beautiful! Is this your handiwork, Julia?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
031	Thank you. I feel more at peace already.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
032	What's wrong, Julia? You look a million miles away.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
033	An old memory just came back to me. Once, I prepared a vase of flowers for the woman I served, in the hope that she would find some joy in it.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
034	She was surprised, at first...but then she smiled and thanked me.
035	Then, seeing that, I could not help but smile too.
036	So those flowers were a symbol of the precious bond you shared... How wonderful!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
037	Perhaps you're right. At last, I think I understand what a pleasant surprise is.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
038	Finally, a smile.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
039	Ah...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
040	Oh right, something about... No glum faces in the presence of the radiance of the Successor of the Sun, uh... No, wait, seriously, what did I say? Never mind...
041	I'm happy to see you smiling too, Julia! And I'm sure the person you used to serve would be just as delighted.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
042	Blanchett...
043	(If Freed has been summoned as a Phantom Soldier, I hope he's having a good time, too.)	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0022
044	(I'd like to think that he no longer feels any kind of suffering... Although knowing him, I'm sure he's fine.)
045	Thank you, both of you, for being so considerate.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0033
046	There is nothing to thank me for. It is the duty of the Successor of the Sun to bring joy to his people!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
047	I also must admit... I did not like watching you always put the interests of others before your own.
048	I-I wasn't trying to do anything so noble.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0042
049	No. I have seen that nigh-fanatical dedication to service within you. It's all in your eyes.	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
050	I don't know what you mean. How could you tell?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
051	I am very familiar with it. Eyes like yours have directed their ire at me many times.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
052	(She trusted me with some things, but my dear sister always played her most important cards close to her chest.)
053	(Often do I find myself conscious of not getting too close and accidentally ruining one of her plans...)
054	(However, sometimes a little intervention is necessary, because I care for her.)	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
055	(After all, a little pushback is necessary for any healthy sibling relationship.)
056	If my beloved sister knew that it was my fault that everything had gotten so out of control, I'm sure I would never hear the end of it.
057	I am truly sorry, everyone! There are no words to express the depth of my remorse!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0035
058	Even I could not have resolved the mess I made without all of your help. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
059	...
060	What is it?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
061	Well, it's true that none of this would have happened if not for your contest, but...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0004
062	It was only because your enthusiasm was so infectious that we went along with the idea in the first place.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
063	Sure, you can come on a little strong, but when you really want to do something, you make it happen. It's so inspiring that I had to help.
064	Agreed. I certainly felt that way.
065	Yes. I'm sure no one has any doubts as to whether your intentions were good.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
066	Thank you, everyone.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
067	How blessed I am to have ever been surrounded by others who help me cast my radiance upon all. I could not accomplish all I do without them.
068	Yes... I suppose you are right. It is not about how well you serve, but how well you can support another, and how well they support you in turn.
069	(That sounds a little like Emmel and I...)
070	Julia, these flowers... You're the one who arranged them?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
071	Yes. I hoped that perhaps their loveliness might ease your heart a little...
072	A little? They're absolutely wonderful! They make my heart sing with joy!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
073	Thank you for thinking of me, Julia. I am truly blessed to have someone like you who cares for me and supports me as you do.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
074	A profound relief! We have delivered the antidotes to all who require them and invited the young ones from the orphanage to the carnival, safely navigating all troubled waters!
075	Well done, everyone. All that's left is to pass out sweets to all the children attending.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
076	At long last, we return to the town square where we will hand out the—hm? Where are the sweets?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
077	Oh, the sweets? Julia has—	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0004
078	Wow! Look at this! This paper cutout is super cool! It's just like the real thing!
079	Look here! If you tug on this bit, it looks like it's flying! It's like magic!
080	Blanchett's cutouts are quite the hit. I heard you were the one to suggest that we put them out for everyone to see.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
081	Indeed it was. They are truly masterpieces. It would have been such a waste for them to go unappreciated.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
082	Oh! Don't make me blush! I mean, I'm not complaining, but...
083	Julia, I have been searching for the sweets we prepared—	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
084	Oh, yes. I have them here. I thought it might be nice to wrap them up with some festive decorations before we pass them out.
085	Each sweet has been paired with its own unique paper cutout... How wondrous!
086	It was Julia's idea! The two of us worked together to make it happen, but she really deserves the credit for coming up with it!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
087	Not at all. All I did was to observe that it might not be exciting for everyone to receive the exact same treat.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
088	So then you came up with the brilliant idea of lending it extra fun and surprise by adding the cutouts!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0044
089	Yes. Blanchett's paper cutouts seemed like the ideal way to add a splash of excitement to something mundane.
090	We also topped them with pieces of fruit to add a little extra color.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
091	And my potion lets the children change the colors and flavors! Won't that be fun?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
092	Fun? Perhaps. As long as no humans turn into Lizardmen or some such...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
093	They won't! Where's your faith in me?!
094	Well... In any case, as long as it doesn't happen, everything should be fine. More importantly, all this must have taken a lot of time and energy.
095	Actually, it was unexpectedly enjoyable. These kinds of repetitive tasks seem to suit me rather well.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
096	Truly?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
097	Now that I think about it, I've always found comfort in this kind of work. I used to do things like cooking and cleaning for the one I served...
098	At the time, I just thought of it as part of my job.
099	However, now I know that I enjoy working quietly while imagining how happy people will be with the results of my efforts. It's like I've discovered a whole new side to myself.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
100	I see! I get that.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
101	Trick or treat! Give us candy or you'll get pranked!
102	Haha, okay! Here you go!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
103	Whoa, look at this! There's a paper thing on it! I've got a rabbit!
104	Check this out! My cupcake has a cherry on top!
105	...
106	It looks like everyone is having a lot of fun!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1004
107	Indeed! At last, this carnival reflects the glory of the Successor of the Sun!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
108	Hehe. Halloween really is quite fun, isn't it?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
109	!
132	!
110	What did you just say?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
111	Once more, if you would!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
112	Wh-what?! I don't think I said anything that strange!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
113	No! I mean, no, you didn't, but this is the first time you've said you were enjoying yourself!
114	Oh!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
115	Ha! I didn't think you had it in you to surprise me!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0008
116	Yes, that was certainly unexpected.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
117	Haha! Wonderful! It is decided, then. Of all the Phantom Soldiers, the greatest "pleasant surprise" of the day belongs to Julia!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
118	Agreed!
119	What?!
120	What reward do you demand of the Successor of the Sun? I will grant you whatever you wish.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
121	Reward? Um... I'm pretty happy with just everyone's smiles and laughter...
122	I forbid that as an answer! You must choose something that you want!
123	Something that I want?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
124	Well... If I must say something, I thought that teddy bear was...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
125	The one at the ring toss? Understood! Leave it to me!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
126	Uh... Are you sure, Ramses? You're not going to take out any more people with carnival rings, right?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
127	Of course not! I shall show you my superiority over that paltry little game!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
128	Nothing shall stop the Successor of the Sun from getting his hands on that teddy bear!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0023
129	Smile, have fun, and Happy Halloween!
