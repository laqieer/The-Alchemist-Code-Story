001	Well then, today I'm on drop duty so I need to train properly...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
002	Lizardmen wake up early in the morning.
003	As monsters, as villains, they take pride in their jobs while continuing to train intensively every day.
004	Well then...today there's a new protein available in Sloth! Maybe I'll go double!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
005	Before departing, the Lizardmen decide their placement by rock, paper, scissors.
006	The drop assignment is a popular one.
007	It's all about falling the right way and making sure the drop item is seen.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
008	All right, let's go! Wait, whoa! There's Milis!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
009	Yeah...maybe she'll mistake me for a water lizard and roast me whole...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
010	Struggling against his fears, the Lizardman fights today as well.
011	Even if he gets depressed, he doesn't forget his duty as a villain.
012	Mr. Lizardman, "Flowers that bloom are beautiful because they fall."	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
013	When I heard these words, they made me move forward.
014	Now that I remember, last year...the rookie Wratharis soldiers were saying something like that.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_b
015	Yeah, it was the day I was rewarded as a villain.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
016	Whoops, I can't space out! Training's over! Pump completed!!!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
017	No matter how many times I'm defeated or injured, we Lizardmen...no, we villains fulfill our jobs properly.
018	Without us villains, there would be no Quest Battle! Gotta do my best!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
019	Saying this, he flashes a smile.
020	As Lizardmen, we train our beautiful muscles and work hard!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
021	All right, let's go! How are everyone's muscles today?	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
022	(On point, on point!)	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
023	(Supporting us too!)	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
024	All right, let's go!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_b
