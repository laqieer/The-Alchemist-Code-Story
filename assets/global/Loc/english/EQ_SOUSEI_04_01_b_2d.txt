001	Grrrroooooaaarrrrgghhh!!!
002	Uuuugh...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
003	I'm sorry! Thank you for saving us, Lady Eulalia!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0035
004	Of course. I'm just glad everyone is safe.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0039
005	But under these circumstances, are the people of Suga safe?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
006	Yes. The last of the Great Nidhogg's divine protection still remains.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
007	But it will not last much longer.
008	The corruption has broken through Suga's barrier. We cannot count on its protection much longer.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
009	It was while searching for an escape route from the forest that I came upon you all here.
010	What is your status?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
011	We're at our limit.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
012	We escaped to the desert, but we ran out of all the provisions we'd brought.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
013	That's why, even knowing the dangers, we ventured into the forest...
014	We will help you. We've been blessed by the forest many years; we have stores in the village.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
015	You are free to take as much as you can carry...
016	Under the current conditions, you likely don't have much to spare. What about your village's casualties?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
017	Yes... We've had many Sinners appear; numbers like we've never heard of even in all our legends.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
018	The Cursed Beast Beelzebub must have truly awakened...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
019	But there's still hope! As long as we have Nimul, we have a chance!
020	Where might this Nimul be? I don't seem to see him among you...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
021	I do not know. After they left to appease the Great Nidhogg, communications with him ceased.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
022	Oh no...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
023	But he is fine. He must be. We must believe that, and hold our own.
024	In that case, we must do our best to stay alive.
025	Yes. Will you help us?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
026	Of course. We of Suga have never forgotten the help we received from the Sephira.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
027	In these difficult times, we will extend a hand of help to you.
028	Haaaaaargh...
029	That's...!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0029
030	It's impossible! Already?! Despite all our powers of purification, even cleansing the land itself?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
031	To be corrupted in such a short period of time...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
032	That is rather thoughtless to say. No, rather it is hubris...
033	The Cursed Beast has already awakened. The corruption it had stored has been released over the land.
034	The peace this land once knew is no longer.
035	How could you...!
036	Oh...
037	Julia? Why...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
038	...
039	He returns... Our king.
040	I must hurry and complete the role assigned to me.
041	You know what that means, don't you, Eulalia?
042	...!
