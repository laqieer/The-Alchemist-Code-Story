001	Hyahhh! Where did those cowards go off to?!	VO_laharl.laharl_chara_1003
002	Where? I thought the yellow rabbits were in the castle town.	VO_etna.etna_sys_0004
003	Yeah, but I'm also talking about the Phantom Soldiers we weren't able to defeat!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0016
004	Oh. Some of them did escape. Are you going to take them out as well?
005	Of course! If I were to let my opponents escape, it would ruin my reputation as Overlord!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0012
006	I'm not sure you have enough of a reputation to ruin, Prince...	VO_etna.etna_sys_0022
007	Oh, Prinny. For now, just scout around that area.
008	Ehh?! Me again, dood?!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0029
009	Hurry up and go, you useless bird!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0001
010	Useless...?!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0012
011	Oh, so that's how it's gonna be, dood! Fine, dood! I'll go, dood! I'm going, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_chara_1003
012	Hmph, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0017
013	Wasn't that...a  little too harsh?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0003
014	What're you talking about? I can say whatever I want to my vassal!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0012
015	I'm gonna go for a bit.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
016	Seriously...the prince treats us Prinnies way too roughly, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0030
017	...Yeah, he can be really abusive.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
018	Miss Rosa! Oh, you're so kind. Dood! If you treat me with such kindness, I'm gonna...dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0018
019	Dood...sob...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0019
020	Both the prince and Master Etna treat us Prinnies with such selfishness...always working is so hard, dood!
021	In contrast, are salary is super cheap! They're demons! ...Um, well, I guess they are literally demons, dood.
022	Hey, are you sure you don't want to become my pet?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
023	Mm... Miss Rosa, why are you interested in me, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0031
024	Well, you're cute and...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
025	And...?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0004
026	I think I can work you hard.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1020
027	So, you're gonna work me hard after all, dood?!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0027
028	...?! Wait. Over there.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0042
029	They're the ones we missed out on defeating.	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_1028
030	Miss Rosa! Let's defeat it on our, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0002
031	Then we can show the Prince that I'm not useless, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_battle_0014
032	You know, at the end of the day, you care about those people...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0011
033	Huh? What did you say, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0004
034	Hey, dood, what's that light?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0026
035	A-are they increasing, dooood?!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0025
036	An outbreak, huh? Hehe. I always love a challenge.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
037	Th-this looks like it's out of our hands now, though, dood...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0047
038	Pr-Prince, help! Doooood!!!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0018
039	Haaahahahahah!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0008
040	Th-that voice, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_chara_1011
041	I've come to save you, Prinny!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0001
042	Whoaaa! Prince, you came, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0019
043	I knew it. You're incapable of doing anything without me, Prinny!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0010
044	Weren't you just reflecting on how maybe you were overly harsh?	VO_etna.etna_sys_0007
045	Y-you, idiot! Don't give it away! Besides, that was because Almira was using the proximity of her mammary glands to force the words out of me!	VO_laharl.laharl_sys_0025
046	I just told you to "be honest"!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0007
047	Prince Laharl...when it comes down to it, I serve you, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0036
048	I'm gonna keep doing my best! So please...please...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0018
049	Give me a raise, dood!!!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0041
050	Yeah, that's not gonna happen.	VO_etna.etna_sys_0008
051	More importantly, more and more Phantom Soldiers are emerging from that weird light!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0027
052	Nooo, doood! I'm surrounded, doood!!!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0029
053	Hold on, Prinny! I can't raise your salary...but I won't allow anyone to lay their hands on my vassal!	VO_laharl.laharl_chara_1004
