001	Red gently cradles Berith in her arms, as if the greatsword was her only lifeline.
002	Spent from the violent confrontation in the depths of the underground facility, she only musters a tired stare at the people before her.
003	You're the one they call Red? Nice to meet you!
004	It seems like your wound isn't fatal. I think your friend saved you, there.
005	He...did?
006	I see...
007	Wait. Soren and Blair said she was shot point blank. She shouldn't have been able to deflect it.
008	It's true. I saw the bullet pierce her body.
009	Oh, the sword's alive! I think it must have taken some of the damage.
010	It's not just a talking object?
011	This isn't the time for jokes.
012	It's not! I have a vague idea what goes on with those weapons.
013	Wait, while you were sleeping inside a cryotube?
014	Master!
015	I meant that I could sense the Alchemia inside of them.
016	How do I explain it? It's like...they are connected, in a sense?
017	When you've got so much Alchemia rattling around, it's not hard to disrupt it.
018	So those weapons are more than just a twisted form of technology... It's almost hard to believe.
019	Then again, the shadow that emerged from our assailant's briefcase is definitely more a violent specter than some cleverly concealed artifice.
020	I'm not even sure what it is.
021	Theoretically, anything that can channel Alchemia can be thought of as "living", in a sense...
022	But as Blair well knows, mechanical objects and tools can process Alchemia, yet do not fall under such a classification.
023	So that begs the question: where do we draw the line?
024	Could it be that the source of the Alchemia in these weapons are...organic?
025	I'm not sure if this is related to their experiments, but...
026	Emrys pulls a small vial of green liquid from his pouch and proffers it to Minerva.
027	I slipped this out of a crate they had me retrieve.
028	I observed drug abuse among some of their lackeys. These appear to be psychoactive, but I cannot be certain.
029	Short of a laboratory analysis, I doubt it.
030	There must be hundreds, if not thousands of doses. The scale of their operations is frankly terrifying.
031	Ah...
032	That's...my medicine.
033	I...didn't want to take it anymore.
034	It felt bad, at first...but it feels worse when I take it.
035	My head...hurts.
036	Are these the doses that Eliza mentioned?
037	Huh. So they grabbed some orphans off the streets and made killing machines out of them.
038	What else did they make you do? What do you know about the project?
039	I don't know...!
040	She's telling the truth. You're scaring her!
041	Goetia killed Roxanne! They have to be taken down!
042	Sieg!
043	I understand your frustration, Siegfried, but terrorizing her won't solve our problems!
044	...
045	Emmy...
046	What is it, Eira?
047	Eira...help scary l-
048	No... Help Red.
049	You're sure? But...
050	All right. Let's speak to her. I'll be right behind you.
051	It's you... I remember you.
052	...Scary smell...gone.
053	Eira...believe Red.
054	I don't...understand. I... I hurt you.
055	I killed...and killed...
056	Eira shakes her head and holds out a small hand.
057	Red...scared...inside.
058	Goetia...bad people...make Red bad.
059	They're all I've ever known. That's right.
060	I think...I need to clear my head.
061	Where will you go? Goetia will come after you.
062	I can't stay here. You'll...be in trouble too.
063	And I can't go back, either. So...
064	Thank you, Eira.
065	Thank you for saving me. I know I...don't deserve it.
066	That's not true. There's a lot we want to ask, but...
067	If it's the drug, you're as much a victim as the rest. It's not your fault.
068	Take care, all right?
069	I will.
070	You've got to be kidding me.
071	Live and let live, Siegfried. Perhaps it is for the best.
072	Hmph...
073	Later, somewhere in the snowy fields...
074	What the- Did you see that?
075	Isn't that her? The demon girl?
076	Er... We're not equipped for this! Call for backup!
077	Y-you! Stay right there!
078	Have to...keep going...
079	Berith, wake up, please! I need your help!
