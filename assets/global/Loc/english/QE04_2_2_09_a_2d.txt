001	Wind Shaman...it's been a while.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0001
002	What are you doing here, Georgios?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
003	I paid a visit to Voda in order to coax the whereabouts of Beelzebub out of her. Unfortunately, she wasn't home.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
004	So I came to ask Fuu.
005	I'd like to ask the same of you. What are you doing here? This isn't your faction. Are you here with that Shaman from the Fuu faction?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
006	That's got nothing to do with you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
007	Tina!
008	Tina! Calm down!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
009	Heheh. Just as I expected. I am truly delighted to meet you again.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
010	They're after the Sacred Stone. It appears they've come to visit Fuu.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
011	The Sacred Stone! Fuu knows nothing about it. I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave this place!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
012	I'm certain he knows something about its whereabouts. My information comes from a reliable source.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
013	A...reliable source?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
014	Yes...from the Earth Sprite Tehre!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
015	...?! Why would Tehre give information to the Gluttony army?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
016	Oh? Perhaps that boy has formed an alliance with the Gluttony army.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
017	Voda!
018	Oh...so you're the Water Sprite Voda!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
019	What good fortune to encounter you here! Now, how about you tell me the location of the Sacred Stone?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0010
020	Heheh. I have nothing to say to a youngster like you. You'd best gracefully take your leave of this place.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
021	Unfortunately, I wouldn't have come all this way here if I intended to gracefully take my leave...take that!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0040
022	Heheh. You wear your thirst for blood on your sleeve. With such obvious moves, there's no way you can kill me. Hah!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
023	Whaaat?! I'm impressed, Voda.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0043
024	Tell me one thing: how are you connected with Tehre?	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
025	That has nothing to do with our current battle. If you don't focus, you may end up paying dearly for it.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
026	But it has everything to do with this.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
027	That boy is connected with the lot of you. Whatever the reason, it changes my motivation for this conflict.
028	I have only one thing to say to you: Tehre is an invaluable ally to us.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
029	Honestly. That little brat.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0017
030	?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0025
031	Aghhhh!!!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0025
032	Wow! She took out Georgios with a single blow! This is the power...of the Sprite Trio!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
033	General Georgios!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
034	I haven't got time to waste on you. There's a brat out there who needs a good lecturing from me.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
035	...! He's not finished yet! Voda! Behind you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
036	?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
037	Heheheh! You make me happy, Voda! How powerful you are, even without your Ouija!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0008
038	However, you underestimated me...and that is your downfall. Farewell!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0015
039	Noooo!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
040	Agh! Who are you?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
041	I am the Fire Sprite Fuu. If you think you can prance about this land doing as you please, lad, you're mistaken!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
