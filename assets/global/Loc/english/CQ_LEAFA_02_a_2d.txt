001	Everyone calm down! Tell me what happened?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
002	Calm down? How can we possibly calm down?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0013
003	You Greed Dike folks never change, even after the war ended. There's no use trying to talk.
004	You tell us to hand over the Mikaboshi if we know what's good for us? Who do you think you are?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0012
005	We can't participate in this meeting so long as people like you are present.
006	Everyone…just hold on!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
007	Only a tiny fraction of folks feel that way. I'm sure we can find a way for both sides to come to an understanding.
008	Why should we believe the words of those who laid waste to Wadatsumi?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0042
009	Ah! Well, you see…	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
010	...You have a point.
011	We invaded Wadatsumi--that is a sin we must make up for. That is my duty as general…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
012	…It doesn't matter what you say at this point…	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0010
013	…
014	…So you're not going to respond.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
015	You weren't directly responsible for the invasion of Wadatsumi.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
016	It's okay to point that out. Don't you think?
017	…How could I possibly agree with that?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
018	Greed Dike committed many sins.
019	As this nation's general and...as a citizen, I must carry the weight of those sins.
020	On top of that, I must face up to them.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
021	…You acknowledge past sins knowing you'll be denounced? And you still won't give up a dialogue with them, will you?
022	I believe this dialogue is necessary for the good of both countries and for the future of the region.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
023	There are still many people in Greed Dike who carry prejudices against Wadatsumi.
024	I can't criticize them too harshly, because I once thought that way myself.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
025	But I've rejected those unjust prejudices born in my country. I changed enough for Yomi to accept me, even though I'm from Greed Dike.
026	If Yomi and I can become friends, then maybe I can act as a mediator for both countries. That way I could atone for my country's sins.
027	…I'm trying my best with that in mind, but…	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
028	If I was just a bit stronger and a bit more persuasive, I’m sure I could--I could…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
029	…
030	…That's not a good way to think about it--not for you and not for those around you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
031	…Huh?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
032	Only thinking about what you alone can do is a dangerous form of hubris.
033	All people have limitations--things they can and cannot do.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
034	Choosing to ignore that fact and do everything on your own is, in itself, irresponsible.
035	I-Irresponsible?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
036	That can't be true! I'm trying to grapple with every problem and take responsibility.
037	And how is that working out for you? We're a long way away from reaching a solution.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
038	B-But…
039	A lot has happened for me to become Lord Commander. But there are tons of things I still can't do by myself.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
040	...Sure, if I could save the world by myself, that would be ideal.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
041	But nobody can do that on their own. I certainly can't.
042	…But I’m not alone. I'm not fighting alone. I've got friends who share the same vision of the future.
043	A person who once showed me the light, someone who shared my ambition, told me so.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
044	So don't hesitate to lean on others to fix the current situation--just like I reached out to you.
045	…
046	But…who can I reach out to…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
047	…Come on. Take a look around you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
048	…Huh?
049	There are plenty of people around you. Especially those you work closest with.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
050	Those I work closest with…? You mean…
051	General.
052	You guys!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
053	General! Let us fight for the future of our country!
054	…
055	Why not draw upon your resources?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
056	It would be pretty harsh to reject their offer, especially since they want to help.
057	…I'm sure you understand that, don't you? You've got people who want to help you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
058	…Alright. I'll leave the search for the extremists to you guys.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
059	But just search! Don't go overboard!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
060	Understood! We'll bear that in mind.
061	Status report! We just received information that an individual affiliated with the radical group is planning some kind of maneuver against the Wadatsumi people.
062	Possibly with the intention of breaking up the Wadatsumi faction.
063	I see… This cannot be ignored.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
064	Alright! Let's move out! Be on guard!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
065	Understood!
066	Hey, you got a sec?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
067	Yessir. How may I help you?
068	I've got a suggestion for your search…	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
