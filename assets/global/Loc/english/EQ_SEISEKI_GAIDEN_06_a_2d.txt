001	Kaya... Why are you so interested in ruins and ancient texts? Why did you want to be an archeologist?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
002	It's the only thing that can satisfy my curiosity. To put it another way...I don't feel attached to anything else.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
003	Even I think that's a troublesome trait...but it's fine. There is value in staying objective and observing from the outside.
004	It's the complete opposite of your way of thinking. You're always trying to embody the justice of the continent.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
005	Right. That's because that's what Cadanova and I were trying to achieve.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
006	Then you should leave. If you leave now, you can still make it back.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0021
007	I know that, but still...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
008	You don't need to take responsibility for this. This is something I want to do. I told you that you should keep facing forward, didn't I?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
009	I won't disappear...like Cadanova did.
010	I should say it clearly. You... You're afraid of losing me... Isn't that right?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
011	That's... That's not true!!!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
012	Can you really say that? You understand your duty and what you truly want to do...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
013	And yet you're still following me. You know what I mean. I know you do!
014	You...!
015	It's all right. I won't disappear. I'm just trying to walk a different path from you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
016	I see... That's something you need to witness and understand for yourself in order to move forward...isn't it?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0021
017	I didn't realize until now the shadow that losing Cadanova cast on your heart.
018	I...
019	Your stubbornness really is troublesome...but I think that's just how you are.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
020	However, it is something that you must overcome as Lord Commander. Although, I am sure you know that better than anyone.
021	I pray that you find that understanding within yourself soon.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
022	I...	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
023	Hehe. It really isn't like me to lecture. Let's hurry, Zain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
024	Hmm...
025	I've got a long way to go. I'm still not even as good as Cadanova once was.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
026	Yauras... What are you doing here?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
027	Lord Zain?! With Kaya...?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0025
028	Training alone? You've always been so ardent, Yauras.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
029	N-no, this isn't what it...!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_1047
030	Don't tell me... You're not always training when you're not out on a mission, are you?
031	My blades could never touch Cadanova...and now he's gone.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
032	That's why I have to at least surpass the Cadanova I fought that day. If I can't, then I'm not as magnificent as they say at all.
033	This is promising. You're trying to move forward, aren't you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
034	Yauras...
035	Are the two of you...on a mission?
036	That's right. We're in the middle of a very important mission.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
037	Yauras... Will you bout with me?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
038	With you, Lord Zain? What's this all of a sudden?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_1047
039	I'm the man who fought Cadanova as his equal. I'm sure there's no one better for you to test yourself against.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
040	Zain...
041	I see... Lord Zain, would you do me the honor of sparring with me?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
042	Of course. If you're trying to move forward, I want to support you with everything I have...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
043	But not as your Lord Commander. Yauras... Let us fight as the friends who sparred at the volcano!
044	I understand! All right... Zain, here I go!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0037
045	Heheh, they both have such fire. I suppose I'm a spectator, then.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
046	Come, Yauras!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
047	Hyaaaaah!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0032
