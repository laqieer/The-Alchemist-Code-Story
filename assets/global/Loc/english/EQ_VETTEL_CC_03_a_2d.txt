001	Ah, excuse me! Please carry that over there! Yeah, and turn it this way. Yup like that, next, uhm...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
002	Please set up a rest area over here. Do we have enough blankets? Well, in that case please—
003	Agh, this is the worst! Why did they have to find a ruin now of all times?! Right when we're spread so thin?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
004	Now we gotta prepare for the Holy Order and the Paladins to arrive too, argh!
005	It's about time I go to meet them. I'll have to guide them to the ruins, after all.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
006	Hold on! You're going by yourself?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
007	Everybody is already busy enough with rebuilding and keeping the peace. If I take anyone along, it will only increase the burden on everyone else. I'll figure it out one way or another.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
008	...One way or another isn't exactly great either, though. Don't you see the issue here?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
009	Here's the ruin entrance.
010	I'm sorry for making you come out here on such short notice. I know the Order and the Holy Guard have their own reconstruction efforts to deal with.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
011	Don't worry about it. This is our job. Besides, your men are just as overworked as the rest of us.
012	We will head inside to investigate. Please wait outside.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0010
013	Haha, don't mind him. It's really an honor knowing that you are guarding the entrance!
014	...So basically, they don't want me to follow.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
015	This place looks pretty ancient, though. Wonder what's inside.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
016	Huh?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0020
017	Oops, you caught me. Should have expected nothing less from the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
018	My, my. Did I catch you trespassing? That isn't like you.
019	Ah well. I guess this makes things a little more interesting for me!
020	Ngh—!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
021	Nn... Or maybe not...? Hm...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
022	Well, well. You still have the energy to be distracted mid-fight? Did I make it too easy for you, Ren?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
023	Huh?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
024	Hyaaaaaaaah!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0007
025	Whoa!
