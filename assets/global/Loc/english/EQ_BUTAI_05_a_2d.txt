001	Keep your guard up! Their numbers are thinning! We can push through!
002	I should have expected nothing less from the Holy Guard. This shall be entertaining.
003	Tch! Not now!
004	So, who will die first? In fact, I would not be opposed if you were to all try and attack me at once. It would make killing the lot of you that much easier.
005	Don't worry about the soldiers. I will have them stand aside. I won't let them disturb our fun.
006	You dare belittle us?!
007	Sure of yourself, aren't you?
008	Then you won't mind if we take advantage of your kind invitation.
009	No matter what happens, we will not divulge the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones.
010	Hahahahahaha! I have no interest in what you know about them! The Sacred Stones will come to me eventually.
011	It is more important to me that I eliminate you, the Holy Guard!
012	Now come, Paladins! Let me show you the meaning of strength!
013	Huzzaaaaahh!
014	Hmph. Disappointing.
015	What?!
016	Got you!
017	Weaklings!
018	What?! Not even a scratch?!
019	Huzzzaaaah!
020	Seida! With me!
021	Right! Stormwolf Fang!
022	Hmph!
023	No...!
024	H-he's too strong!
025	Is he really human?!
026	You are better than I had expected. Unfortunately, you are still no match for me.
027	Tch!
065	Not even the so-called Great Thunder Axe can hurt me.
066	I'm not done yet! If we leave you to your vices, more innocent blood will be spilled! Lives will be lost!
067	We will not allow you to trifle with the lives of others! My chivalrous code forbids it! For that is our absolute justice!
028	What a bold claim! The absolute justice of the continent? When you are so weak? Don't make me laugh!
029	Nnrgh!
030	Justice must be strong! The weak cannot be righteous! Strength and justice go hand in hand!
031	That is not true! Your power cannot be justice!
032	That's right. We won't let you be the one to define what justice is!
033	Hmph! Maybe try to strike me even once before you object to my words!
034	The weak can do nothing against the power of my justice!
035	Wait!
036	That voice...
037	Ahem...!
038	Watch flowers bloom in spring. Skip work during the day and work nights instead in the summer. Make a campfire from dried leaves in autumn, and sleep in on the cold days of winter.
068	Appreciate the subtle differences in how wine can taste depending on the scenery before you.
039	Kudanstein... What are you on about?
040	There used to be a man who would protect this country for reasons as simple as those.
041	He loved this country, and died dreaming of the day in which it could be called safe again.
042	Nonsense.
043	You're right. Just some absurdity from a fool.
044	But our cause is one that protects even such absurd nonsense.
045	Your sense of justice is fragile. I'll prove that to you, here and now.
046	Hah! Then show me, Kudanstein!
047	I see that I was not mistaken in my assessment of your strength! Still, you are nothing before me!
048	You're probably right.
049	What?
050	I would not be able to defeat you alone—but I am not alone!
051	Miracle Kanon Slash!!!
052	Sorry to keep you waiting, Captain Kudan!
053	You're late.
054	H-huh? Are you trying to be funny?
055	You think one little girl added to your ranks will make a difference?! Enough with your jokes!
056	She's not alone, either.
057	4th Regiment Paladin Kagura, reporting.
058	4th Regiment trainee Basheeny, reporting.
059	Our strength is different from that which you would call strength. It comes from our bond, which connects us because we choose to be connected and to support one another.
060	This is the power of the Holy Guard!
061	Hmph... Hahahahahaha! What power?! You call this bond powerful?!
062	You flock together because you are weak! The weak will bend their knee to the strong! This has been proven time and time again throughout history!
063	Our justice would defend those who are forced to bend their knee. We will not lose to you!
064	Then prove it, Kudanstein!
