001	Squeak! Ethan isn't in this compartment either!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
002	Jeez. Ultimately, we had to make our way all the way to the front compartment.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
003	I'm deeply impressed that you've managed to get this far.
004	I'm assuming you're the one in charge?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
005	Another Alkaroid version I've never seen before! Most likely, it's the newest model!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
006	Indeed. My existence still has not been released to the public yet.	VO_aj4000.aj4000_sys_0037
007	My name is AJ4000. Do not put me in the same category as the Alkaroids you have faced until now.
008	Yeah. You're clearly different than the others. Stand back, little lady.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
009	O-okay!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
010	I've heard that you are a skilled gunslinger. I very much look forward to seeing you in action.	VO_aj4000.aj4000_favorite_0002
011	So it comes with a gun, huh?
012	You may be an android, but you seem to exude that unique gunslinger vibe. Looks like you might actually be a pretty decent match.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
013	Ethan is up ahead, isn't he?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
014	Who knows? Perhaps you should pave your path ahead with that gun of yours and find out yourself.	VO_aj4000.aj4000_sys_0007
015	I'll do that!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
