001	"Instant Tanuki Teleportation!"	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0009
002	Owwww!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0042
003	Ouch... Shoot, that didn't work either... I can't travel to the place I'm thinking of like I'm trying to!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
004	If I can't, I'll never become a special soldier!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0016
005	I have to become a special soldier so I can protect Rin... I have to get stronger!
006	Hey, Hayate!
007	Whoa!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0020
008	Oh, there you are. That soldier you look up to, Nowaki, is back!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0004
009	Really?! He's back? He finished his guard mission at that human village? I'm glad it went well...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
010	Sounds like he won't have to the leave the village for a while. Why don't you ask him to watch over your training?
011	It's not every day you get the chance to have him teach you in person.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0007
012	What are you talking about?! Training is something you do alone. It's not something you rely on others for!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
013	Well, sure, but... You're not getting anywhere with that technique on your own, are you?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
014	Urgh...	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0019
015	I think it'd be better if you asked Nowaki for help rather than trying to go at it alone. I'm sure he'll be able to teach you to get it right, no problem.
016	Besides, you're trying to become a special soldier that can travel to human settlements like Nowaki, right? Then...
017	That's the point! He didn't need any help when he saved me that time I was surrounded by dozens of monsters.
018	I want to become like that. A strong man that can fight alone... That's why I've gotta try to do this by myself.
019	I see... Well, if you that's how you want go about it, that's fine. Just don't push yourself too hard.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0016
020	But I gotta push myself! If I don't, there's no way I can become a special soldier like him.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0010
021	I have to get stronger fast.
022	Ow ow... Haa... It's no good. I can't remove it... How did I get caught in a trap like this?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
023	I'm hungry...and thirsty.
024	All right, what trick should I play today... Wha—?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
025	Whoa!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0028
026	You're a person?! You scared me!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
027	What are you doing in a place like this? You're stuck in a trap? Are you okay?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
028	I-I'm fine! I can get out of this all by myself. Ouch!
029	Ah! You'll only hurt yourself if you do it that way! Let me do it!
030	Huh? W-wait, you'll get hurt—	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
031	If you do this and put this here... There you go!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
032	Y-you got it off. I couldn't even get it to budge.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0020
033	(I'm always getting saved by other people... Not just Nowaki, but now this girl! I've still got a lot to learn.)	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0021
034	Hehehe. Amazing, right? Your foot probably hurts, so let me treat it!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
035	Thank you. You're amazing. Being able to remove traps by yourself and even giving first-aid...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0034
036	Really? Hehehe, thanks!
037	Oh... U-um, what's your name?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
038	Rin! What's yours?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
039	H-Hayate.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0006
040	Hayate, huh! That's a cool name!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0009
041	Cool?! N-no, it's not cool or anything—	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
042	Is that your stomach growling?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1009
043	N-no!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1009
044	Being hungry can make you feel kinda helpless, right? Good job enduring that on your lonesome!
045	I-I didn't feel helpless!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1002
046	Really? There's no need to push yourself! I hate being alone myself.
047	I don't have many friends in the village.
048	Maybe because I only have one tail? No one wants to become friends with me...	VO_rin.rin_sys_0030
049	And I became alone in the village... I was lonely and I hated it.
050	...
051	Oh, but there's a human girl I'm friends with!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
052	A human? You've met humans?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0005
053	Yup! I love humans! They're interesting and they play with me.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
054	Is that all right? It's not dangerous or...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
055	It's fine! They're all kind, good people!
056	And if I go to the human village, she'll be there with me. So I'm not lonely at all now!
057	Although, I do get a little lonely when I have to leave their village.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0011
058	...
059	Oh! Oh no! She's waiting for me right now! Well, see you later!
060	Wait! S-she's gone...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0003
061	Lonely, huh?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
062	I swore to myself that day that I'd never let her get lonely.
063	Doesn't matter if it's a human village or anywhere else, I want to be with her. I don't want her to feel lonely.
064	If I could go to the human village with her, I could make sure she isn't lonely on the way there and back.
065	Plus, I want to protect Rin from the dangerous grasp of humans who make traps like that one.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
066	But in order to do that, I have to master this technique as quick as possible!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0021
067	Oh, I lost it. Where did it go? Oh, it's Hayate!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
068	Wha—?! R-Rin?!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0020
069	Oh, wait! I want to ask you something!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
070	A-ask me something?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
071	Oh, good. It stopped.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0030
072	I heard something strange a little while ago. So I chased after it and popped out here. Did something happen to go past?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
073	S-something? Like what?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0005
074	I don't know what it was! That's why I'm curious about it. I followed it and here you are.
075	Maybe it was from you? Although, it did sound like much a smaller animal... By the way, what are you doing here, Hayate?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
076	Huh? Oh, um... Training.
077	Training?! Are you practicing a Gyobu tribe technique?! I wanna see! Try doing something!
078	What?! But I'm still working it out...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0026
079	Besides, training is something you don't show to other people. So no!
080	What?! Come on. It'll be fine to show me just a teensy bit!
081	Or are you having trouble with it?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
082	Gah!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0019
083	N-no, that's not the case. It works sometimes.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
084	Isn't there someone who has already mastered it? Get that person to teach you! Have them tell you the trick to it!	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
085	What?!
086	You work hard, so I'm sure that if someone teaches it to you, you'll be able to do it!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
087	...!
088	I think it'd be better if you asked Nowaki for help rather than trying to go at it alone.
089	Relying on someone else makes you weak!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0021
090	Huh?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
091	Training is for improving oneself. It's meaningless if you don't do it by yourself!
092	It has to be that way... If I can't be a strong man who can fight alone, let alone a special soldier!
093	Hayate...
094	I'm going to go train alone... Don't follow me.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
095	W-wait, Hayate! Ow!
096	A-are you okay?!
097	Hehehe... I fell.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0011
098	Are you hurt?!
099	I'm all right... Whoa!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
100	What is a baby Ratty doing here? And it's hurt!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0005
101	Grrrrrrrrrrrr!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0003
102	Numu!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0020
103	Did those monsters attack it? It's all right now, tiny one!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
104	I'll defeat any bad guy who picks on the weak!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0013
105	W-wait! It's dangerous to go in by yourself!
