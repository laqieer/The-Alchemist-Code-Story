001	So what are you going to do next?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
002	You told me you had unfinished business on the outside, right?
003	I can't imagine you meant just hiding out like this.
004	Yes... Actually, I have friends I want to meet up with, but...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
005	I don't think that would be a good idea right now. I'm already being targeted, so I'd just end up putting the two of us in danger.
006	Besides, I don't even know where we are right now. It's like we're moving blindly.
007	...Well whoever they are, it sounds like they're important to you.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
008	They are. They're my hope. The future of this world depends on their journey.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
009	...Then how about a diversion?
010	A diversion?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0039
011	There are ways you can help your friends from afar as well.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
012	If you can attract Ophioneus' attention, that should take some heat off your friends, right?
013	And if they focus on me, that gets you what you want too?
014	You got it.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
015	I understand what you mean, but how would I even go about doing that?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
016	We start a rebellion.
017	...We what?
018	I told you, didn't I? I've got an old acquaintance here.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
019	Knowing him, he'd jump at the chance.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
020	Well done, Carnet.
021	Thanks to you, those filthy beasts will think twice before attacking our streets again.
022	What a crap job. How about something a little more tasteful next time?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0030
023	Oh, I know, I know, my angel. But when I need something dead, I can always count on you.
024	It was only because I was shorthanded that I assigned you such a grubby task. I already have something much more extravagant in mind for your next job.
025	More extravagant?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0039
026	Yes. The next target is…a dragon!
027	A dragon…
028	(He's avoiding trying to explain about it…)	VO_karne.karne_sys_0044
029	Sounds interesting. So what exactly is the plan?
030	You can ask about it from this gentleman here. Right? You are…?
031	I'm Shahel. Thank you very much.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
032	Those who are dissatisfied with the present reign, those who doubt its benefits, and those who desire the benefits of strife.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
033	They exist in any generation.
034	If these people were brought together and formed one organization…
035	Even Ophioneus would have no choice but to act on a situation like that.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
036	I see…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0045
037	In that sense, the Sloth Layer is very convenient.
038	A melting pot of all the worst parts of humanity, as I've explained before.
039	That's right. Actually…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
040	There are safety concerns around here.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0020
041	But as long as there is human activity, there is a degree of law and order. Though…
042	There is Big Heaven, the casino run by the extremely wealthy Aedith in the middle of Redington.
043	So taking control of that establishment means taking control of the city.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
044	You're not thinking of raiding it, are you?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
045	I must ask, do you think I'm only capable of violence?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
046	No, that's not what I meant.
047	We'll discus it at some point, but the center of this town is that casino.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
048	So we need to take control of it.
049	That man Aedith is a hardcore gambler. If we lure him, he could be controlled.
050	Really?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0030
051	Yes, really. I bet my entire fortune and lost everything once before.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
052	Hmm?
053	It was after that the owner of the inn helped me out.
054	I'd like to ask you something.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
055	Yes?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
056	You're trying to say good things about this city, but it seems you just want revenge against the city taking your money.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0003
057	What are you saying, Schmeier? If you lose, it's only natural to fight and take back what is yours.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
058	So, let's go. We'll take this town and make Aedith suffer with embarrassment.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
059	Hm… Looks like I made an odd choice for an ally.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0030
060	H-hey, that girl…
061	It can't be. Matia? When did she come back to the city?
062	All eyes are on us.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0042
063	You're right. But why?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
064	(She didn't cause a scene at the casino before, did she?)
065	Is this seat taken?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
066	It's you…
067	Didn't you say you retired from gambling?
068	I remembered there was a little more left to do.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
069	So you're here to play for a bit? Seriously?
070	It's not like I'm a beginner around here.
071	I'll make sure you'll be left with nothing.
072	Is that a dare?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0008
073	Hm? Hmmm?
074	(This is not what I was expecting…)
075	Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
076	How the…? How is she doing this?
077	Um, you think you'll win this?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
078	Yup.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
079	You have cards drawn, then the total sum of the numbers shown on the cards must be the closest to the target number.
080	So it's a game of chance?
081	It is, but it's not only about luck.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
082	It's also about when to pass and how far your opponent is willing to go. Strategy is important.
083	And like this…	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
084	I won again…
085	This is just like what happened a decade ago.
086	As for passing, how do you know when to do that?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0016
087	The opponent's intuition. I'm never wrong when reading their minds.
088	Seems like a waste of your talent, is it not?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
089	Oh, that's a bust for you, isn't it?
090	Grr…
091	You're no match for me.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
092	Could you call over the Casino's manager, Aedith?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
093	Grr... Ugh... Dammit...
094	Seriously... don't bully the employees you used to work with, Matia.
095	Aedith. So good to see you finally.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
096	You're always bringing trouble with you. What is it this time? Money issues?
097	Well, I'll lend a hand. Alright?
098	As always, you're a man with a good choice of words.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
099	That's part of my job. That's how I got to the top. So, are you here to lose again?
100	Is that what you think?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
101	No, as you're not a woman who looks toward death without a plan. I know that well.
102	After all, we're friends who have each other's backs.
103	Your backs?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0039
104	Back in the days as a free mercenary, this guy was my partner of all things.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
105	It seems you've brought a beautiful lady along with you. You're a dragon…
106	I assume that the reason why Matia is here is because of you.
107	Yes, I actually have a business meeting!.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
108	Business meeting?
109	Schmeier, what are you talking about?
110	Well, I'm just not reckless to have my fate decided by gambling.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
111	A fair deal would be much easier. Isn't that right, Aedith?
112	I see. You want something, so what are you willing to do for it?
113	What I want is land. I'd like a place where I can continue my research and without bother from others.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
114	And in return, I'd like to offer my services to better everyone's lives.
115	Is that right?
116	The development of this city is amazing! But because of rapid development, there are some things that have been unattended.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0009
117	The structural integrity of roads and buildings. The upkeep of waterworks and sewage facilities. The development of distribution…
118	There are many things to consider, correct?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
119	Of course. But we humans don't live as long and aren't as strong as you dragons are.
120	And Magil is not as well served as with you.
121	So, what's the problem? The advantage of humankind is that we outnumber everything else.
122	Even in a disadvantageous environment or inconvenient situation, we can adapt to it.
123	That's the spirit of the people of the Sloth Layer.
124	But isn't there something you'd like to be more convenient?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0045
125	I can give you the ideas and technology to develop even further. Would that be a consideration?
126	Miss dragon. I'm sure that the dragons were skeptical about dragon technology falling into the hands of humans.
127	Only dragons should be using that tech, right?
128	Well, that is true. But…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
129	You must have thought it was unreasonable too.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0003
130	…
131	I can see it within the city. Even this establishment is using dragon technology.
132	The land was abandoned by the dragons. That is true…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0044
133	You're not thinking about dragonkind, but instead thinking about your own desires.
134	Any dragon would find this offensive to see.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0016
135	And you're different from them?
136	Of course. My purpose is having a coexistence with you humans!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0038
137	…
138	She's got quite a mouth…	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
139	That's my honest thought. My goal is to have peace. And for that…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0008
140	In order for the dragons to continue to live, they need the "Shell of the World."	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
141	…
142	Sounds interesting. That really touched my soul, dragon girl.
143	Really? Then…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
144	Really… It would've been so much nicer to have met you three days ago…
145	Huh…?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
146	! Schmeier! Get down!
147	They're aiming at us…?
148	No, they aren't. But…	VO_matia.matia_battle_0022
149	I can't see them… Are they after us, Aedith?
150	Personal brawls are forbidden in the casino. You were the one who decided that, remember?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0014
151	Yes, exactly as you say, Matia. I'm just being irrational, that's all.
152	My life is at stake here. And I'm not the only one. The lives of everyone on this floor as well.
153	What…?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0025
154	As you say, Lord Aedith.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0037
155	Schmeier the runaway… If you could kill her with your own hands…
156	Ophioneus will surely recognize the autonomy of this land.
157	You're that high elf…!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0029
158	Yes. It's a pleasure to see you again, Schmeier.
159	Lord Aedith.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
160	I know. Go, Carnet!
161	Understood.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
162	Schmeier, get behind me! First, we must figure out the sniper's position!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0019
