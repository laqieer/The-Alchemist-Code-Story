001	What is this? It's no different than fighting the Discarnate Power!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
002	Do you mean to tell me you've taken countless lives in your efforts to produce this...monstrosity?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
003	What a terrible word to use for such an outstanding creation! This is a proud achievement of my nation's ingenuity.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
004	And we didn't take lives, per se. We procured test subjects.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
005	What about Celis?
006	She was a most excellent subject indeed. Our research would have never reached completion without her efforts.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
007	Greed Dike has always treated the lives of Wadatsumi's people as nothing more than playthings to be ground underfoot!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
008	But, in the end, all is for Wadatsumi.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
009	No... None of this is for us. What you're doing is unforgivable!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
010	Amane!
011	Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Tigris!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
012	Tch!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
013	Come now. We wouldn't be able to call them weapons if they could be taken down by such paltry techniques as that, would we?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
014	Are you truly telling us that countless souls have been crushed to create these things? That's no achievement. It's unconscionable!
015	And you will not get away with it.<br>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
016	Another futile effort.
017	Amane, behind you!	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
018	Huh?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
019	Amane!
020	It's fine. My sword took the blow. But this is getting out of hand, fast.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
021	The Blade Fox has outlived its usefulness. Ah, but maybe it could perform one last task in service of my weapons!
022	With the completion of the Dismortants, Greed Dike will finally realize its long-held ambitions.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
023	And what ambitions would those be?
024	That's no concern of yours. All you need to know is the power of the Dismortants—a power with no weak point, which you cannot possibly overcome!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
025	No. We can overcome it. There is a weak point.
026	Is there, now?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
027	The secret art of Kagutsuchi, combined with the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi and the Treasure Blade Sumeragi...
028	If the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi were all in our possession, then—
029	Which is why I intend to eliminate those pesky variables from the equation. After dealing with you two, we will collect the Sumeragi from its resting place in this castle.
030	We've also learned of a survivor from the Rising Ashes bloodline who allegedly wields Kagutsuchi. But the means to acquire that art has been lost to time, so we give that rumor little credence.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
031	Nonetheless, if we can procure the Sumeragi, we have determined that all variables will have been effectively nullified.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
032	Everything in the palm of your hand, is it? Presumptuous is putting it lightly.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
033	I beg your pardon?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
034	You have severely underestimated the strength of the human spirit.
035	Spare me your theologizing. There are no spirits. Thorough analysis and repeated experimentation are the only things in which to place one's faith without playing the fool.
036	You're wrong. You're so wrong! I know, because...I've been entrusted with a spirit beyond my own. And I intend to see that trust through!
037	Then embrace your feeble ignorance and perish where you stand!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0003
038	Amane!!!
039	What?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0027
040	Presumptuous indeed.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0007
041	You!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
042	I may be late, but fortunately, it seems I haven't missed the party altogether.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0035
043	Jubei! But, you're—	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
044	No. It's okay. She's an ally.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
045	I am. I hope that you are able to see past my prior transgressions and accept my aid.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
046	Additionally... Amane. I have been entrusted with a mission, which I intend to see through as well.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
047	So let us swing our swords together as one. That is the only way to repay the faith that's been placed in us!
048	!!!
