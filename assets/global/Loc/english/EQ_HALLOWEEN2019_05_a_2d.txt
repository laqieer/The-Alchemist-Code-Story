001	Look at yourselves. Are you not ashamed?
002	A little...
003	Halloween comes but once a year. I understand the compulsion to let loose.
004	Yet even so, that does not entitle you to just do whatever you want!
005	You're right. Sorry.
006	Halloween is supposed to be an event that children can enjoy! As their elders, you ought to be setting a better example.
007	Yet here you stand, squabbling among yourselves and behaving poorly. How can you expect the younger generation to do anything different?
008	Yeah, what she said!
009	Children...!
010	Halloween is meant for us kids, but lately you grown-ups have been taking over! What kind of Halloween is that?!
011	What the hell do you think you're doing?! You'd better pipe down and do as you're told, squirts!
012	My, my. It is rather shameful to see an adult turn to anger when they're unable to find the words to defend themselves.
013	Mei Fang!
014	Whose side are you on?!
015	Side? It is not so simple a matter as that. I am merely conceding that there is something to what the children are saying.
016	Is that not so, Rosa?
017	Heehee... You're right. After all, I haven't done anything. I'm just the one who listened to the bleats of these poor little lambs.
018	Poor little lambs?
019	Why is it okay for the grown-ups to do whatever they want on Halloween, but not us kids? That doesn't make any sense!
020	So, since the grown-ups have hijacked our Halloween, we're gonna make a new Halloween of our own! And this one'll be decorated in red and black!
021	Well said, my friends, well said. I will aid you in bringing your lofty endeavor to fruition as your very own Dark Angel of the Night!
022	What do you think you're doing, Rosa?! Inciting these children to misbehave is a serious offense!
023	Now, doesn't that sound deliciously naughty? I thank you for recognizing me as the sinful blasphemer I am!
024	Numa!
025	The time has come for a new Halloween, one gleaming in shades of crimson and pitch black! We will shape it with our own hands, and it will be ours!
026	Numu...nu...num...numyua!
027	Wh-what's wrong with that Ratty?!
028	I dunno, but here it comes!
