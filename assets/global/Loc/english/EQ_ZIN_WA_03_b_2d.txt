001	Hm...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0016
002	Sen, have you come around?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
003	Medicine man...?! I'm sorry! Please, put me down! I can walk on my own!	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0021
004	No can do! You still haven't recovered from your sickness. Stay quiet for now.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
005	But...!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_1019
006	Yeah, Sen, if you don't stay quiet your fever will go up.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
007	Okay...
008	By the way, we're through the mountain...is your village coming up soon? The night's going to fall soon.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
009	Um... Oh! I can see it! My village is right there!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0016
010	Ah! There's the Elder!
011	Sen...! Where did you go while you were sick?! Who are they?
012	Elder, this is a medicine man! He can heal Demon's Blood!
013	A medicine man? This fever is incurable!
014	Elder...that's not true. That is a curable sickness. I wish for you to take me to the sick.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
015	No!
016	Huh? Why?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_1049
017	Elder! Please! Please let these people into the village!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0022
018	What is not allowed cannot be allowed! Whether he a medicine man or not, we do not let outsiders enter our village! That is...
019	The law of our village.
