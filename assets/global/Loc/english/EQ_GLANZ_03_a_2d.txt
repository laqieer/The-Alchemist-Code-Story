001	This concludes my report.
002	...
003	What is it?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
004	It seems this noble in question had been raiding several ruins.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0004
005	And yet he had far fewer Philosopher's Stones than we expected in his possession.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0031
006	If I remember correctly, it was the chief of the Unicorn Knights that delivered the stolen artifacts, wasn't it?	VO_neville.neville_sys_0003
007	It was. He sent the carriage. Are you suspicious of him?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
008	...
009	I heard a little rumor that you grew quite close to those thieving little girls.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
010	Something about promising to give them some lessons?
011	I...haven't formally accepted anything.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
012	You should. And if you don't mind, accept another mission for me.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0003
013	...
014	Hello, Glanz. Such hostility in the air, isn't there? The castle guards...and Neville...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1001
015	I noticed. I suppose it would be wise for an outsider like me to get out of here quick.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
016	Glanz... Is there any chance of you reconsidering my proposition?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
017	If it's about me becoming one of the knights, I—
018	I understand... I just wanted to try my luck.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
019	War is coming, and I wanted to have someone I could trust beside me.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
020	I just wished that could be you.
021	To be honest, I would like that. I did not hate fighting alongside you.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
022	And yet I assume you found a reason to continue to do otherwise.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
023	I'm sorry.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0035
024	Just remember. You shouldn't say things like that to someone you've turned down twice.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
025	Oh no. I almost forgot Neville is expecting me. I will see you again, Glanz.
026	Say, is Freed back from his mission?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
027	...
028	He died.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0018
029	Oh... I had hoped he could tell me more about this.
030	What is that? A key?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
031	I do not know either. Anastasia... Do you think Freed found his own reason to rush through life?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
032	Who knows? But would he have been saved if he had?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
033	There is no deliverance. You know that, Anastasia.
034	That's enough for now. Let's take a break.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
035	All right!
036	What?! No! I can still fight!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
037	Don't overdo it.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
038	I'm not! I need to get stronger so I can protect my family, the Unicorn Knights!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
039	I can't have the Chief protecting me all the time! That's just not right! I have to be stronger!
040	Besides, I can't make Rochelle take care of all the fighting! That's not right either!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
041	All I'm saying is any further exertion is counterproductive.
042	Huh?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
043	Haphazard training won't make you any stronger. When it comes to training, it's quality over quantity.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
044	Urrgh! But still...!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0017
045	I know... I understand how you feel. I...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
046	What is it?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0005
047	Glizzy likes earnest little ones like you, because she is sparkly-shiny.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
048	Did you call me little again?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
049	Just know that overexertion is never good.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
050	All right, fine! We're done for today! I'll go get the bath ready!
051	Training over. I'm going to sleep.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
052	You didn't even do the training.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0003
053	G'night...
054	Okay, I guess I'm the pillow again.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
055	I wonder... How long has it been since I saw someone sleep so soundly?
056	I can't remember what my little sister looked like asleep. I was always out on a job while she slept.
057	She would always be awake by the time I got home. Smiling and waiting for my return.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0007
058	I'm fine, don't worry. I believed those words. I had to believe those words.
059	That's why I never knew.
060	I-I'm sorry! I'm so—Cough! Cough!
061	Aah, shut it! You coughin' like that's makin' me sick!
062	Don't you know how miserable I already am?! How pathetic it is that I can't fight for my country?! Dammit!
063	Wha—?! What are you doing?! Stop!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
064	Ngh!	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0019
065	I never knew...
066	Rina was fighting her own battles while I was out dirtying my hands.
067	I didn't know, and yet I felt like I was the one protecting her.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0018
068	We're family. Of course I'll protect you. It's just what I do.
069	Some soldiers are forced into retirement after being wounded in battle. Our father, for example...
070	His deep feelings of patriotism turned into resentful obsession... And I stained my hands red with his blood.
071	This world is filled with such cruel turns of fate.
072	...
073	This world truly is a stifling place, isn't it, Freed?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
074	Huff... Okay! Bath done!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
075	No, you are not! You just got in!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
076	Why not? I'm clean now.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
077	Why, she says...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0025
078	Oh, don't even try. She really hates bathing. Even Helza telling her how important it is to warm the body properly couldn't change her mind.
079	Baths are boring. Not fun.
080	Fine... But look at this. I've got this ball, see? I'm just going to drop it into the bath...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
081	Wha—?! It's actually...sparkly-shiny! Whoooooa... It smells good too!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0024
082	Cool! What is this?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0024
083	And then if you do this...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
084	Wah! You shot water from your hands! So, like this?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0046
085	H-hey! Cut that out!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0022
086	Geez... I didn't expect you to have so many bath items on you, Glanz.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
087	Yeah... Well, my little sister didn't really care for taking baths either.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
088	So to make sure she took proper baths, I tried all sorts of things and... Well, I got into it myself.
089	Oh, you have a little sister?
090	Had. She's had health issues for a long time and passed away a few years ago.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0005
091	S-sorry... I didn't...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0035
092	It's fine. Anyway, I didn't think I'd get to take a decent bath around here. This is nice.
093	Glizzy likes baths?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
094	I do. No matter how dirty you get, a bath washes you clean. I really don't like being dirty.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
095	Hm...?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0044
096	This hot spring was Helza's favorite. Chief said that's why we have our hideout here.
097	Sounds like something she would do. She did love her baths.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
098	...
099	Rochelle?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
100	I'm overheating. I'm getting out.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
101	Overheating? You haven't been in for that long, though.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
102	Wait, Rochelle! You have to dry your hair! You're gonna catch a cold!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
118	Wha—?! Did you see that?! Someone was there! A peeper?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0026
103	(Was that...Rochelle?)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0025
104	Ishuna, you go back to where everyone else is. I'll go check it out.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
105	Good work. Here's your pay.
106	Is this it?! This isn't what we agreed on!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
107	We got rid of that minx on your behalf, didn't we? We just took our cut from this. That's all.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
108	Well, that's...true...but still!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
109	(Got rid of that minx...?)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
110	We like you a lot better than the last chief. You're much easier to get along with.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0007
111	As long as you keep bringing us information we want, we'll have something for you in return. You work for Envylia now.
112	Rochelle? Wh-what are you doing here?
113	I hate icky-stickies. But Izzy... She believes in you.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0014
114	I'm a black and white bear that can't be with people. Helza still believed in me. And you killed her.
115	What is this?! Who is she?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
116	I fight for those who believe in me.
117	So... I'm going to pummel you all.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
