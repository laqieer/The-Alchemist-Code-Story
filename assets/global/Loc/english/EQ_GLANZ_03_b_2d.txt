001	Hrgh...!	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0025
002	I hate to kill a child, but you've seen too much. So long, kid.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0030
003	Who...?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
004	Glizzy. What are you doing here?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0025
005	I just happened to pass by. You really do make a lot of noise, it's hard to miss.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
006	Who the hell are you?
007	None of your business. Well, I believe the tables have been turned. Do you still wish to continue?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0010
008	Tsk!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0016
009	So... You're working with Envylia.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
010	I-I just did what I had to for the sake of the Unicorn Knights.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
011	I don't care what your motives were. But you should know that General Neville is aware of this.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
012	Y-you don't mean... You're Wratharis's...?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
013	I'm glad you understand.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
014	R-Rochelle! Help me!
015	I-I just wanted to protect the Unicorn Knights! You understand, don't you?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0018
016	Enough... I get it.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0039
017	I loved the Unicorn Knights.
018	Helza believed in a bear like me. It was the first place where I belonged.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0018
019	I hate icky-stickies. But...because Izzy believed in you...
020	Rochelle...
021	...
022	I don't like you.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
023	But I didn't hate the Unicorn Knights.
024	The Unicorn Knights are why Ishuna wanted to grow stronger. The Unicorn Knights...and you.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
025	You need money to protect women and children who have nowhere else to go. I understand that.
026	...
027	What do you want to do, Rochelle?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
028	I want to avenge Helza.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
029	I can do that.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
030	But...Izzy and the others need him... Probably.
031	I can't do it. I can only fight, but fighting isn't enough to make a home.
032	Hmph... This is an ugly world.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
033	This world is icky-sticky.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
034	...Swear to me that you will never ruin this one place these girls can belong.
035	...
036	Rochelle?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
037	I don't belong here anymore. I can't tell Izzy.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
038	...
039	I let an enemy of Wratharis go. Even though I know I wouldn't be able to ignore Anastasia if she were to request help.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
040	I'm now a traitor. I don't belong anywhere anymore either. I guess I never did.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
041	I only had this one.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0018
042	Rochelle, we're in the same boat, aren't we? Why don't we team up?
043	Glizzy and me! Best mercenaries! Heh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
044	Besides, I need a pillow.
045	Is that really all I am to you?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0007
