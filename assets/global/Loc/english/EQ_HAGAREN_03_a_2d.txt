001	Engine's fried. Well, putting five people on a motorcycle and going full speed will do that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
002	...
003	General, you doing all right? I'm sure it was a bit of a shock, being betrayed like that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
004	At least we were able to minimize casualties on both sides.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
028	All I can think is that we only made it this far because of you and your motorcycle...
005	Looking on the bright side, eh? Not my style, but power to you. I respect that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
006	General Toritoh, I maintain that arrogance is one of your less admirable qualities, but trying to prevent your men from needlessly losing their lives is worth my re-evaluation.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0044
007	Colonel Mustang... That was a pretty arrogant thing to say, yourself. Maybe your ego is smarting after losing to the alchemy of all those soldiers.
008	If anyone lost face, it was me. I was born with power beyond that of any normal human. That is why they made me General...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
009	But power is all I have. When it comes to technique or skill, I am no equal to you. Without my alchemy, I wouldn't even be a match for Edgar.
010	So you were born with it...? I've heard plenty of stories of people who wanted the power that comes with alchemy and were destroyed by it in the end...but being born with it must have its downsides, too.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
011	No, I've been lucky. I have never experienced any real hardship in my life; not until recently, at least.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
012	Who could've expected to find someone like that embedded in the Holy Guard? How are we gonna deal with that blond shrimp?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
013	Just to be safe... You should know: if you ever meet my brother for real, you'd better not call him that.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
014	G-got'cha. So General, what're you gonna do? It's not like you can go back to the Holy Order.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
015	I'll report him to the top brass. They won't tolerate such disrespect from an outsider. I expect they will punish him severely.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0005
016	I wouldn't, if I were you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0015
017	That's a terrible idea.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0030
018	I wouldn't recommend that course of action. We still don't know who's behind this. With your temperament, you could end up taking the heat.	VO_riza.riza_sys_0016
019	When you don't know who your enemy is, it's better to lay low for a while until you get a better idea of how to handle them.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0005
020	I see... Very well, then.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0022
021	I'm quite the traveler, so I know some good hideouts...but we can only run from the Holy Order for so long.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
022	Perhaps my Phantoms can be of use.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
023	Your Phantoms? Are you going to use them to fight?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
024	No. I have certain Phantoms who are skilled in negotiation and the gathering of information. If I were to employ them...
025	Well, they might not be all that useful, but even Edgar is doing his part by facilitating our escape by bike. I wish to do whatever is in my power, as well.
026	In that case, be my guest. In the meantime, we'll get rid of... some pests.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0044
027	To think the Holy Order's sinister reach extends this far! General, we'd better find you a safe house as soon as possible.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
