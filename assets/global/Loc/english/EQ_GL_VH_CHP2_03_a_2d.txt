001	Shortly before the attack on Roxanne's manor...
002	Whew... I thought I'd never get rid of that lady.
003	I guess fame's a massive double-edged sword.
004	Well, it is hard not to notice a dashing young man like yourself coming into the city.
005	Uh, good day, sister.
006	Oh, don't look so surprised. I heard everything.
007	A Holy Guard, no less! Hmhm...hardly a common sight.
008	Hah, well, I could do without some of that attention.
009	Returning from a mission?
010	Just en route to a friend's place.
011	Speaking of which, I'm late enough as it is.
012	A beau of yours? You did say she would throttle you.
013	It'll go double because we have guests, so yes.
014	(I wonder when was the last time I saw Soren...)
015	Well, you must be in a hurry...
016	...But I'm afraid you're not invited to the main event, so you'll just have to entertain me instead.
017	Oh? Not bad, Prince Charming!
018	You knew.
019	Hard not to be a little wary when a woman of the cloth takes an unhealthy amount of interest in a man.
020	Sticks out like a sore thumb, in fact.
021	Smart AND sassy. I'm going to enjoy this.
022	Hmhm... Very well. As a reward, you may call me Nesha...
023	...If only to beg for your sweet release later on.
024	(S-She's strong!)
025	(This chain—it's almost too fast to be real!)
026	Eyes up here, darling!
027	Where'd she—
028	Too late.
029	What?!
030	Shion!?
031	Are you all right?
032	Heh... I'm getting a case of déjà vu.
033	Just like back in Sakris Village, wasn't it?
034	How unexpectedly romantic.
035	Ah well. I don't mind having a third join in...
036	The more the merrier! Ahahaha!
