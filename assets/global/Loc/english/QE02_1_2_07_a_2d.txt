001	This road is reasonably wide. I guess it's the main street.
002	It should lead to the center of Real Heaven.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
003	That's where the Don Taras Family's mansion is supposed located, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0010
004	I'm sure the Neo Victor district that Ron mentioned should be up ahead!
005	Yeah, we're getting closer to the little lady...huh? Wait, stop!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
006	Why are we stopping, aye?! Fiona is nearby!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0029
007	Look at that thing lying on the floor.
008	That's the wreckage of a Guard Droid, aye!
009	It is, right? Whoa. Who could've pulled that off?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
010	It's no easy take to turn that droid into a scrap of metal.
011	You think it's the Don Taras Family's doing, aye?
012	Who knows? But, if it was them, we may not be able to carry out our rescue that easily.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	That idiot. He's seriously trying to infiltrate the Don Taras Family's mansion.
