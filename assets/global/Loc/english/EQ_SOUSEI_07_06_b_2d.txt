001	Grrraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_benika.benika_battle_0025
002	Grrr, I can't get close!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0022
003	The corruption is too dense! The magil of this sin is so thick even its density creates pressure.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
004	Then would purifying her through Alchemy work? I have to get close to Benika to try!
005	No, that wouldn't work. If she takes any more damage than this, she'll...
006	Grr... At this rate, we won't be able to stop her!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
007	Skree! Skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
008	That baby dragon is...sucking the corruption out of Benika?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
009	Then this should work!
010	Benika, wake up! You cannot lose to this level of corruption.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
011	Is that...? Yna...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0019
012	You still have to accept my birthday present to you!
013	A dagger?! What are you planning—?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
014	Aaauggghhhh!
015	Hah...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0019
016	Yna, what did you just do?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
017	Something I learned with in the future.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
018	This dagger is imbued with the same spell as the one on the Gear of Judgement.
019	It stripped the sin magil from Benika's body and sealed it.
020	I see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
021	Does that mean...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
022	Was that the technique that allowed you to defeat a Cursed Beast even without the ultimate gear?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0045
023	Although it may be different from the power we aspire to, it appears to be another type of worthy power.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
024	What do you plan to do now, Lord Kubera? Will you be relinquishing your quest for the ultimate gear?
025	We will need it eventually, to vanquish a god. However, it is not necessary at this time.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
026	If it is possible to slay Mammon with their method... There is still time to ruminate.
027	Until then, we shall survive on and search for our path, my friend.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
028	Good grief. You are as soft-hearted as ever.
029	Heh... I suppose it is the privilege of the powerful.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
030	Wait... Something is wrong.
031	Hm?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0027
032	Yna... Big brother... I'm...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
033	It's all right. You have nothing to worry about.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
034	I see. I... The corruption... I'm sorry for causing you trouble again.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0035
035	It's only right that a brother saves his little sister.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
036	Yeah...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0004
037	.........
038	Oh, that's right! Where is Luke?!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
039	The young dragon? Over there—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
040	Rrrrrr...	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
041	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0052
042	This magil...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
043	Luke?!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
044	Grrraaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0028_b
045	There's no mistaking it. It's the same as when Nidhogg succumbed to corruption!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
