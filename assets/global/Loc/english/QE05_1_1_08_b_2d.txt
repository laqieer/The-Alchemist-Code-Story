001	This is... No... It's... It's terrible!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0021
002	These people were cut down from behind as they fled.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
003	At least they have not lit this entire place on fire.
004	Fire?
005	Why would they...? There's no need for such brutality!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
006	Hisham...
007	We have finished verifying the situation. It is true that all the villages in the area have been assaulted by the Royal Army.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
008	We have testimonies from the few survivors we were able to find.
009	Hm...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
010	The harbor had already agreed to ally with us.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
011	They have secretly been preparing to declare themselves to our side.
012	Ceclidis mobilized his forces to wreak vengeance against the harbor as soon as he found out.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0016
013	We separated from our main forces to protect the harbor, some of us setting out this way to secure the road and prevent reinforcements from reaching the enemy.
014	So, thinking we were those reinforcements, you attacked us.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
015	I am coming to understand why you rebels—ahem, I'm sorry, the Liberation Army—are so aggressive.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0045
016	As you should! Those bastards destroyed innocent villages nearby just because the harbor chose the South!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
017	What?! So the official military force of this country set fire to the homes of its own people?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0027
018	Yes! We can no longer let the North wreak havoc upon our homes!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0013
019	I thought you were opposed to us knowing your country's affairs?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
020	Paladins of the Holy Guard, do you not represent justice?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
021	If you will not help us, then at least stay out of this civil war! Justice is on the side of the Liberation Army and General Leordas!
022	That soldier was not mistaken.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
023	We, the Holy Guard, stand for absolute justice.
024	We must pass judgment fairly and without bias, never favoring one side over another.
025	Unless, of course, justice would be best served by siding with one side or another.
026	We, the scouting legion, will now fulfill our role as Paladins! Prepare for battle!
027	Lord Waginau...
028	Kamui and Lady Teona, my apologies. I release you from your duties as bodyguards.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0035
029	You will receive payment another day, but for now, leave this place as soon as possible.
030	(Leave this place? With such tragedies unfolding before us?!)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
031	(There is a message from King Narol that I must deliver home, but...)
032	No, I will go with you. I cannot stand by and let such atrocities continue.
033	I have a responsibility as a citizen of this country.
034	Please allow me to help.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
035	Very well. I would be honored if you could lend me your spear for this battle.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
036	As a citizen of this country...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
037	Kamui...
038	Hisham. You go along with these villagers to someplace safe.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
039	We'll be back soon, okay?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
040	Okay. You two be careful.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
041	Are you sure? Do you not have your duties as a Sephira?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0003
042	I do. However, I cannot turn my back on this.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
043	How very noble of you. I suppose we are lucky for that.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
044	Then let us go! Raise the flag of absolute justice! We now march as blades that protect the innocent!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0007
