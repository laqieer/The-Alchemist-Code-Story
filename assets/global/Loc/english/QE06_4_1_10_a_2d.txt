051	I see. So your resolve, then, is to inherit everything they were.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
001	That's correct.
002	Wonderful. If anything should reaffirm my convictions, that would be it. You are indeed a man fully worthy of my trust.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
003	Pardon?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
004	We've divulged so much in such short order, it would be foolish of us to expect you to immediately accept and internalize it. These things take time, after all.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
005	And yet, you are putting forth a genuine effort to listen, to understand, and to empathize with our plight.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
008	Those are the markings of a truly trustworthy ally. And I do believe I am not alone in recognizing this.
009	I think we are all more than pleased to accept you into the fold. Thank you, Logi, for your consideration and your support.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
010	No, thank you, Amane. I pledge, with unwavering resolution, that I will bring peace back to Wadatsumi.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
011	Well, you're sure nothin' if not earnest, Logi!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
012	Perhaps you could learn a thing or two from him.
013	Hey, I'm plenty earnest too, thankyouverymuch!
014	You certainly do have...virtues all your own, I'll give you that. I thank you for being here as well, Edgar.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
015	So your motivation here is to help restore the way of life these people have lost? That's as Logi a sentiment as I've ever heard.
016	You think so?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
017	You've always had a soft spot for such things. I seem to recall a certain promise about you, me, and Dias enjoying my stew again someday.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0037
018	Oh!
019	Like Celis always said, "Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life."
020	Clearly, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0008
021	Heh. I guess you got me there.
022	With your arrival, the tides truly have changed here. We can finally bring back Kagutsuchi and restore Sumeragi.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
023	It's no longer a hopeless endeavor. So tell me, Logi, are you committed to learning and mastering the sacred art of Kagutsuchi?
024	You can count on me!
025	How is he to do that, though?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0031
026	The first step is to restore Mikaboshi to its original, complete state.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
027	Oh, is that...Mikaboshi? What are you going to—?
028	Mikaboshi's consciousness presently resides within me. I will now transfer it to this stone.
052	Ngh!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
053	Still not enough? I must...concentrate. I must...dive...deeper.
029	Ah! What is this?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
030	It's like I'm losing a portion of myself I've grown very attached to. But, no! This is no time for empty sentiment!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
031	I must say farewell here, as much as it pains me to do so.
032	Return, Mikaboshi, to where you belong!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
033	...!
034	But even after you've returned, Mikaboshi...let's continue to walk together. This is not your journey or mine, but ours.
035	Let us take the first steps toward saving Wadatsumi, hand in hand.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
054	Are you sure that's what you want?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
055	I know it's what's best for Wadatsumi, but choosing this path may cost you more than you've ever lost before.
056	Are you still willing to take my hand, despite all the risks?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0003
057	Absolutely.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
058	Doing so will fulfill not only the wishes of all the people of this land...
059	...but my wishes as well.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
060	Thank you, Amane.
036	What... What just happened?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
037	I'm truly grateful to you, Amane. I've become whole again.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0034
038	No thanks are needed. This is all for the sake of Wadatsumi and the wellbeing of its people.
061	Besides, I'd do anything for a friend. And you are, unequivocally, a true friend.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0008
039	Amane? Who are you speaking—? Ah!
040	Who in the...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
041	Wha— Wh-who was that?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
042	There we have it. We've successfully restored one of the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi, the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, to its rightful state.
043	Captains Ugachi and Jubei, may I entrust you to keep things under control in our absence?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
044	Not a problem. You just focus on attaining Kagutsuchi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
045	This isn't the first time I've had to wait on you, and I don't like it one bit, so get moving already!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
046	You know what needs to be done.
047	Right!
048	Let's do this, then, Logi. We must seek out the lost sacred art of Kagutsuchi.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0002
049	Of course. In the name of restoring peace to Wadatsumi...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
050	I will make certain to master that art!
