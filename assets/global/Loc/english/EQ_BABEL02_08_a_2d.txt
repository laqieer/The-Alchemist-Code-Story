001	...
002	...
003	What do you want already?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
004	Eek!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
005	You've been following me around ever since you got here!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
006	If there's something you've got to say, then spill it already, squirt!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
007	Um... Well... Er... You see...	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
008	Aaah! You're so annoying! That shy attitude of yours, I don't like it at all!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
009	Thank you for saving me!	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
010	Eh?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
011	I-I...always wanted to thank you, but I didn't have the courage.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0010
012	I wasn't trying to save you, you know!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
013	I just couldn't stand that slimeball's guts!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
014	I just wanted to thank you...no matter what.	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
015	You're sure you don't want to go home? You've got one, right? Somewhere to go back to.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
016	No. I don't want to go back.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0039
017	Why not?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
018	Because! If there's someone out there wanting to take my power...then they'll hurt gramps and nana to get it!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0019
019	Huh? What's that?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
020	This is Woody.	VO_mea.mea_chara_1003
021	Did that doll just move?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0026
022	Bunnies, you can come out, too.	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
023	Whoa...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
024	This is my power.
025	You're...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
026	Wow!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0024
027	Just like me...
028	So pretty!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0044
029	What did you say?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
030	Ila, they're so pretty! Hey, um... Can I see it again?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0008
031	You think they're...pretty?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
032	Yep! Woody, you want to see it again too, don't you?!	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
033	He-hey, hang on a sec! This isn't an exhibit, you know!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0021
034	What? Oh, but I wanted to see them again...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0022
035	Tch. Scram already!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
036	Wait up, Ila!	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
037	Don't follow me!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
038	We have returned.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
039	We're back...
040	Welcome back, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0008
041	I'm glad to see you're safe. Did you find anything new?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0005
042	I was wrong.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
043	...
044	My apologies, Lord Zahar.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
045	Now's not the time for apologies. Scour the land; investigate any leads thoroughly.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
046	There's a hoard of Philosopher's Stones somewhere. Split into groups and find it!
047	Understood.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
048	Where is Letitia?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
049	She's underground.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
050	...
051	What's wrong, Spica? You look down.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
052	I failed.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
053	Lord Zahar said he was wrong just now, didn't he?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
054	Yeah... A lot of other stuff happened, too...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
055	I see... Huh? What's that you've got there? Is that a squirrel ornament? Why's it missing its tail, though?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0005
056	Lord Zahar...gave it to me.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
057	What?! You got it from Lord Zahar?! That's great!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
058	Yeah, but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
059	But...?
060	It feels like Lord Zahar's going to drift some place far away...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
061	He's got to. He wants to destroy the current status quo in the world and create a completely new one.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
062	He'll have to do some harsh things, and do some even scarier things to reach that goal. He's said it before, hasn't he?
063	You can't replace the status quo unless you're prepared to tear the world asunder.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
064	I get that... At least, my brain does, but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
065	Spica, if you ever decide to leave Shadow Messiah, I'm coming with you!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
066	What? I'd never leave.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
067	I'm going to protect you, so all you need to do is keep chasing Lord Zahar, full speed ahead!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
068	Silma...	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
069	You love Lord Zahar, don't you? You made the decision to come here, so you could help him, right?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
070	The world Lord Zahar wants to build will have a brighter future than any we could've ever had in this one. We've got to help him in any way we can!
071	Yeah, you're right.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
072	It doesn't look like it worked.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
073	No, what about this one?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
074	...
075	We still don't have enough.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
076	It seems we'll need an absurd amount of Philosopher's Stones and alchemy to create a Sacred Darkstone.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
077	How many decades would that take us? Despite our longer lifespans as elves, would we even be able to accomplish it in our lifetime?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0018
078	Hmm... Our only realistic option would be to enter into that Contract with Darkness.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0022
079	However, the price for any power gained through such a contract would be...steep.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
080	Nor would it give us the everlasting power we seek.
081	Indeed. We continue gathering the Philosopher's Stones and creating the Sacred Darkstone.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
082	As you command.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
083	We need to increase our numbers. Have Corvus find us some new blood.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
084	What would you like done with Mia?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
085	Nothing. We let her decide what she wants.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
086	However, if we let her continue to abide with us, she will grow to be another seed who inherits our will...
087	Leave her be for the time being.
088	...
089	What is it?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
090	You look a little tired.
091	I feel fine.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
092	You don't have to hold back for my sake.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0037
093	...
094	It's not time yet, my dear sister. I still need you by my side.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
095	No, you don't.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
096	...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
097	Do it. Drink up my dark elf blood.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
098	Are you anxious that my half-elf body will not hold?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
099	We have no idea what will become of a half-elf like you who has become a dark elf. This is all I can offer you for now.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
100	Thank you for your concern, my dear sister.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
101	Mmm...
102	What have I just seen?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
103	...
104	Letitia, Spica just dashed off somewhere. Did something happen?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
105	I wouldn't know... Was that all you wanted to ask me?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
106	No, my disciple has something to discuss with you.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
107	...
108	Letitia, what are you going to do about Mia?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
109	Nothing.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
110	Send her home, then.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0041
111	Does she want to go home?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
112	No. She says she doesn't.	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
113	Then, no.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
114	Why?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
115	It is Lord Zahar's wishes.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
116	Excuse me?
117	Don't tell me you plan on making her one of your test subjects, just like that researcher did!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
118	No. I have no such intentions.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
119	But you're continuing his research!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
120	He simply had the wrong approach, and unlike him, Lord Zahar would never conduct such inhuman experiments.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
121	But—!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
122	Ila....
123	I...
124	Do you not trust Lord Zahar's judgment?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
125	No, I trust him... 'Course I do.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
126	Then obey his wishes.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
127	...
128	Ila, leave it already. I'll talk to Lord Zahar about it. You don't have to worry about Mia anymore.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
129	There's no point confronting Letitia. She thinks of no one else except Lord Zahar.
130	I'm fond of Lord Zahar, too. I want to help him for saving me, but I really can't stand Letitia.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
131	Report for Lord Zahar! We have located a massive Philosopher's Stone, which we believe to be a natural phenomenon, in the Woods of Mystical Nights!
132	Splendid news.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
133	Lord Zahar, allow me to go in your stead.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
134	No, I'll go personally. Ila, Spica, and Silma may accompany me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
135	The Holy Order must already have their sights on a Philosopher's Stone of that magnitude. We leave immediately.
136	Um, Lord Zahar!	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
137	What is it, Ila?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
138	Uh... Where...is Letitia?
139	I ordered her to guard our stronghold.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
140	Then...maybe...I should stay back, too!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
141	Ila, have some faith in her.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
142	Uh...
143	Do you hear me?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
144	Yessir...
145	Ila, you must trust us. We would never harm your friend.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
146	Friend?! That's... That's not what I'm worried about!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
147	Hm. Ila, if you're that concerned for Mia, then the quicker we finish this, the quicker we get back. Understand?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
148	Understood!
149	We're heading out now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
150	How are we supposed to find the Philosopher's Stone in the middle of this dense forest?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
151	Fret not, Corvus. If the Philosopher's Stone is truly as large as the report stated, it should be releasing a fair amount of alchemy.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
152	Ila.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
153	Yes, Lord Zahar?	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
154	Release your alchemy.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
155	What? Are you sure?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
156	Yes, go ahead.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
157	All right, here we go then.	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
158	Well? Do you sense anything?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
159	Something's...calling me...from that direction.
160	Enough.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
161	I see... You're using your alchemy to resonate with the stone.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
162	Indeed. It wouldn't have worked had the stone been of the usual size. We'll head in that direction.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
163	Phew...
164	We've come pretty far. Ila, are we still not there yet?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
165	Hmm... I think we're getting closer.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
166	Ah, that way! We're almost the—	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
167	Grrrrrrr...
168	...
169	What's that noise?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
170	There's somethin' scary lyin' in wait here!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0026
171	What do you mean by..."scary"?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
172	Aaaaaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
173	What...?!
174	What's going on?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0026
175	We're under attack! It's the Corpse!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
176	Are you kidding?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
177	An ambush?! That's cheating!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
178	Heh heh... All's fair in war. We've got you now, Zahar!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
179	...
180	Lord Zahar! More are coming from this way, too!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
181	GRAAAAAAGH!
182	Is this beast the "somethin' scary" from before?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0022
183	Wait, Corvus. I can sense the Philosopher's Stone... I think it's coming from inside!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
184	Don't tell me—!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
185	You filth... You made the beast swallow it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
186	Gahahaha! This is the end for you, Shadow Messiah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
187	GRAAAAAAAGHH!!!
188	Ugh! Argh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
189	G-go away.... Aaaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
190	I'll come save you!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
191	Spica, pay the dead no mind.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
192	But...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
193	Focus on defeating the enemy standing before you! Survive, at all costs!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
194	O-okay.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
195	You're not leaving this place in one piece!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
