001	It seems like you guys are too inadequate to handle my love!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0016
002	This is where your life ends. I will not allow you to cause any more misfortune in this world.	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_0012
003	St-stop! Don't get any closer...I'll cut this doll!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
004	You! How dare you hold the doll of "that man" hostage! You coward! Hey, don't move!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0029
005	Are you being...serious?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0026
006	Of course! That doll is really important to me! It's both family and friend to me!!!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1004
007	If so, why bring it with you into battle?! If it really is family...then why did you place it in that scum's care!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
008	He-hey, shut up! Who are you calling a scum?! Also, both of you, stop ignoring me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
009	...Now!
010	...I'm taking the doll back.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
011	Agh...owww...! So, your carelessness was intentional...tsk! You'll regret that!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
012	Well, that was out of character...	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0031
013	It's important to have something to hold onto. I know that well. Still, I'm surprised you picked up on my movements.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
014	Well, I assumed you were playing your own version of "hard to get"♪	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
015	It really all is some kind of romantic game for you, isn't it? You're a real piece of work.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
016	Wh-what?!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0026
017	It's that man's doing. He made it explode so that we wouldn't be able to chase after him. Still, the Demon has been prevented from entering the market.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
018	Aswald, what are you doing?! Let's go! If you hang around observing the Demon, you'll be buried alive!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0014
019	Stop ordering me around.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
020	I'm not ordering you or instructing you! I'm worried about you! Come on! Hurry!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1008
021	...I see. You're right. Let's go!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0020
022	Now...all that's left is to finish off that man.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
023	Wait. Did you think I'd let you do that? You seem to have forgotten, but I still happen to be his bodyguard.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0002
024	Right...I forgot about that!!!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
025	A little too shallow...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0042
026	Heheh... Well, you're still no match for "that man," but you were able to handle quite a bit of my love!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0023
027	That man? Are you talking about that doll?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
028	Yes. It happened when I was fighting against the Envylia soldiers as a mercenary.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
029	The moment I tried to take out the commander..."that man" appeared...with his rippling muscles and that scar across his face!
030	Hey, wait... Is this going to be a long story?!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
031	Heheh. Did you let your guard down? I finally managed to get you from behind♪ I guess playing hard to get finally paid off!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0008
032	So, you imitated me in order to invite my attack...yet, you still have a lot to learn.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0044
033	Huh...? My body...it's numb...I...can't move!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0025
034	It seems like the poison is finally taking effect. You purposely allowed me to inflict that wound, didn't you?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
035	My mission was to conceal the existence of the Demon...and to take out that man.
036	You were not part of my mission. You knew I wouldn't kill you.
037	All I did was place a little trust in that "efficiency" of yours.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
038	Besides...you want that man eliminated as well, don't you?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
039	...Well, I would prefer if more orphans like me didn't show up.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1010
040	...I see. You as well, huh? What's your name?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0020
041	I'm surprised you're interested in me... I'm Dorothea. Next time, I'm gonna beat, Aswald♪	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
042	...Next time we meet, I won't go easy on you...Dorothea.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
043	Sigh... Playing hard to get, huh?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0030
044	I guess you can't judge a book by its cover. There are those who fight and live like she does.
045	...Hehe. This is the first time I'm giving a girl's name to one of my dolls.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
046	Well then...let's see if I can regain my mobility before the shop closes!
