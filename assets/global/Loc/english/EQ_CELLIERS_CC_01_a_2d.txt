001	Here, mister! The accessory you asked for.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0005
002	My, why thank you, Celliers! My wife will be over the moon.
003	Are these all new pieces? They're all so wonderful! Just looking at them soothes my heart.
004	Eh heh heh, and don't you forget it!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
005	Mielikki, hush!
006	All the crystals here are super special. Celliers worked extra, extra hard on them, after all.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
007	Huh, then what're you the one bragging for, Mielikki?
008	Whatta you expect, I'm proud to call Celliers my friend!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
009	Besides, I'm as big a fan of his crystals as anyone!
010	True, there is something special about Celliers' crystals. Craftsmanship like that is sure to bring anyone good fortune.
011	Right you are. Ever since I decorated my shop with ornaments Celliers made, more customers have been coming in... Maybe they have some sort of power!
012	S-surely you exaggerate.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0050
013	Am I? I'm serious, you really are amazing. More people have started coming to our remote hamlet, guided by your crystals.
014	The village is more lively than ever, thanks to you, Celliers. You have our gratitude, truly you do.
015	I second that sentiment! Selling them to peddlers has spread talk of your crystal craftsmanship far and wide.
016	At this rate, you could even become the greatest crystal craftsman in all of Babel! Keep up the good work!
017	You hear that, Celliers?! The greatest crystal craftsman in Babel!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0046
018	K-knock it off, already. The business world isn't so lenient. I don't know a thing about it.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0015
019	So, too, do I lack common knowledge. It's hard for me to talk with customers who come from the outside world...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0022
020	Even now, I'm just getting by with the help of you and the villagers, Mielikki. Without you, I—
021	Well no worries on that front. After all, you and I will be together forever, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0037
022	I've got a front-row seat to all your hard work. We're in this together!
023	Mielikki...
024	Still, no need to be so impatient. That old geezer said to take your time, didn't he?
025	...Yeah, you're right.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
026	The people who hurt me are long gone.
027	"All those related to the experiment have been exposed." That's what Michael said when he came to check up on me, after that incident.
028	"You're safe now, live your own life. Take it slow—look to the future, don't let your awful past bind you."
029	That's why I want to make my way in this village, one way or another. I may be inexperienced now, but if I work a little harder...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0032
030	Hey.
031	Oh! Y-yes, sir! What can I do for you?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0027
032	Can you show me your crystals?
033	My cry—? Oh, r-right. Our current selection is everything you see here.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
034	......
035	I see.
036	That customer also came from outside the village. He just bolted after a bit of window shopping... Think he's broke or something?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
037	Who can say...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
038	Oh, that reminds me, Mielikki. What even brought you here today? Was there something you needed, or...?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
039	That's right! Yeah! I came to get you, Celliers. Come on, follow me!
040	Wha—hey, you're gonna yank my arm off!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0043
041	Tah-daaah! Behold, my flower bed! Look at all my beautiful blooms!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0008
042	Whoa, you're not kidding... They're so beautiful. And so big, too.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0009
043	I've seen these before, in a book. "Crystal flowers"... Rare specimens whose petals glisten like crystal.
044	But these flowers are incredibly difficult to raise, if I recall...
045	Is that right? I just gave them some TLC—plus a reasonable amount of water—and they turned pretty as a picture!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
046	Wow... You really are incredible when it comes to growing flowers, Mielikki.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
047	Oh!
048	Ah jeez, back again already?! I guess they really must smell a treat. Always attracting the wrong kind of admirers.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
049	Shoo! Stay away from my flower bed, you!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
