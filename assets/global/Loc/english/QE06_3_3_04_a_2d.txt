001	...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0018
002	Captain Tanosuke, he seems to be addressing you, specifically. Do you know what he's talking about?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
003	...
004	Oh, dear. Is it possible your comrades don't know? How delightful! I suppose it isn't the easiest topic to broach. But to think, such a high-ranking officer of the Blade Fox...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
005	...could have demon blood flowing through his veins!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
006	?!
007	...
008	Knowing this, can you all treat him just as you always have?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
009	Captain Tanosuke?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
010	I wasn't trying to hide it. I just didn't think it was relevant to our mission.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0035
011	Tanosuke!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
012	I'm sorry, Commander Ugachi.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0036
013	When the people of Wadatsumi became demons, some were twisted into creatures like me, while others didn't change much at all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
014	That's true. But as long as we've got that forbidden power inside of us, the blood in our veins is still demonic. Nothing can change that.
015	Didn't know what to do other than suppress my demonic blood and live a normal life. Never turning into a demon, but no longer really feeling quite human, either.
016	I'm just a half-breed halfwit.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
017	Unfortunately for you, I have very good hearing, and I happened to catch you mumbling something about...not be able to come back if you used your full power? That's when I knew.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
018	Tch.
019	Why won't you just show your true nature already? Those like you who do not fight wholeheartedly have no right to stand among the Blade Fox.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
020	Oh, you think too highly of me. When am I not doing my best?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
021	I will force you to fight with all your might if I must.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0012
022	So that's what that was all about.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0020
023	I'm sorry, Captain.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0036
024	You've always said people shouldn't meddle in strangers' affairs. Is that why? Because you were trying to hide your own true identity?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
025	I'm sorry to you too, Azami.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0035
026	Why would someone born of a demon join the Blade Fox, though? That's the burning question in my mind.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
027	Because even a halfwit like me has hopes and dreams. I couldn't just isolate myself from other people, human or demon. My heart's a little too big to live the hermit life.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
028	All I've ever wanted is to be around others. To laugh, share a meal, and then take a well-earned nap afterwards.
029	That's more my speed.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
030	Oh!
031	I just thought it was really good. There's something special about sitting at a table with friends you've fought alongside against certain death. Not to mention the nap afterwards.
032	D-did you eat something funny?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
033	Harsh... Look, all I'm saying is that it doesn't help to overthink things. To overcomplicate matters—	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
034	It's a very bad habit we humans have.
035	(The pieces are all coming together now. The truth about Captain Tanosuke has been lurking within those casual asides of his all along!)
036	It all makes sense now...
037	I'm really sorry, Amane.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0035
038	Captain Tanosuke, you're... You're a stupid jerk!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
039	Oh, dear! Sounds like trouble in paradise for the Blade Fox. I suppose you can't accept him now after all, can you? So, what ever will you do?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
040	I'm just scolding him for all the apologizing he's doing! What happened to the Captain Tanosuke I know—the leader who pays lip service to the top brass while secretly goofing off with everybody?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0012
041	I don't care if your blood is human or demon or anything else! I've come this far with you by my side, and I'll tell you right now, I trust you, Captain Tanosuke! Just the way you are!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
042	Amane...
043	That's right. The ones we should be fighting are the ones we always have: the demons who threaten humanity. Our blood merely sustains our lives; it doesn't define it.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0005
044	I, for one, can't let him off so easily.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
045	Captain Ugachi...
046	Don't misunderstand me. I'm not referring to your half-blood status, but to you not coming clean with me from the start!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
047	Every one of you is just so stubborn, I think you've taken ten years off my life from all the aggravation!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
048	Sorry, Commander Ugachi.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
049	Looks like your little anecdote didn't quite have the desired effect, Paragon. Nothing has changed. You are still the only one here we cannot abide.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
050	That is...disappointing, to say the least.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
051	But I wonder if you'll still be so accepting should I manage to coax him into revealing his true demon nature. Let's see what it takes, shall we?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
