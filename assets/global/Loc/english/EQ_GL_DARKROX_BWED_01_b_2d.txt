001	That's all of them.
002	(Huh. The archives are a lot bigger up close...)
003	(Not that I had any cause to come here. Usually it'd be Rox-)
004	...
005	You're here early.
006	You know you can leave it to me here, right?
007	Rox?
008	Did you forget who I am?
009	Someone has to expose the seedy underbelly of Slothstein.
010	Not you, though. You'd just go in and yell and brandish those swords of yours.
011	Probably kick over a shelf or something.
012	Heh...
013	Siegfried stares at the woman before him, lost in a haze of memory.
014	I never said goodbye, did I?
015	And all the other things.
016	I just thought you'd come back, eventually. You're always the one harping on me for...
017	...Those are some weird things to say to a stranger.
018	...!
019	Do I remind you of someone?
020	Her. Well...Roxanne.
021	But you don't remember, do you? A name is all you have left.
022	I didn't come here to be insulted.
023	...I'm sorry.
024	A frigid moment of silence passes between the two.
025	Black Rose, correct?
026	Yes. And I'd prefer you use that over...that other name.
027	Now, we don't have much time, so we should get going.
028	The woman jerks her head towards the steely building.
029	Stay close and don't take anyone out if you can.
030	That'll just make things more difficult.
031	Wait. Why are you helping me?
032	What were you hoping to find inside?
033	What really happened that day...when your mansion was reduced to rubble.
034	Then we're on the same page.
035	Goetia never told you, I wager.
036	They would have lied to me, anyway.
037	...
