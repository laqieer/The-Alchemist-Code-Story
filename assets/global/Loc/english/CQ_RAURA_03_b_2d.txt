001	Crap, we gotta get outta here! This chick's crazy strong!
002	And don't forget "beautiful."	VO_laura.laura_sys_0010
003	What the...Laiya, that was amazing! Your strength is incredible! So cool! Are you some sorta knight or something?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
004	Not quite. I used to be a fighter in the Gluttony Foss Colosseum.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0039
005	Colo...sseum?
006	It's somewhere you can rely on your own strength. But once I fought my way to the top, I... I couldn't take the pressure, and I ran.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0004
007	But now I feel like I'm being blown this way and that. Your flowers, though, they're so firmly rooted in place. It's as if they were calling out to me.
008	Tell me, how is it that you are able to give your all for the sake of these flowers?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0001
009	Huh? I-I guess it's because they're so pretty. I just like them.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
010	You like them...because they're pretty...
011	...I'm going to be the best! Not just the strongest, but the prettiest too!  I'll be the cutest, strongest girl you've ever seen!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0037
012	...Heheh.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0007
013	Hey, don't laugh! I'm not some kid, ok?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
014	No, that's not it at all. You just remind me of my protege, is all.
015	You know what you like and what you want, and you don't let anything get in your way. She's the same way...
016	...Ah, that must be it. It's because you're following your own path that you're able to give it your all. Both of you. That's what lets you shine so brightly.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0006
017	Your protege? So what's she like?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
018	Her name is Shayna. She has the strength to defeat any foe, and the looks to win over any man.
019	She's a star as dazzlingly strong as she is cute... There really is no other way to describe her.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0004
020	Wow, Shayna sounds incredible! I can tell how much you care for her, Laila.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0045
021	...! Of course I do! After all, I'm her number one fan!
022	Well I guess you'll be heading off to see her then, right?
023	I...I suppose you're right. After all, I'm acting on my own now. Why shouldn't I go see her?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0025
024	But...is it really alright for me to see her as I am now? I still feel this emptiness inside me...	VO_laura.laura_sys_0030
025	C'mon, what are you talking about? When there's something you want, you just have to go for it!
026	...!!
027	I see... Freedom is more than freeing your body. It means the freedom to be true to your feelings...	VO_laura.laura_sys_0006
028	...I've made up my mind. I'm going to Envylia next. To see Shayna.
029	Are you sure? All the way to Envylia? That's pretty far...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
030	I know, but...	VO_laura.laura_sys_0037
031	That's...what I want to do.
032	...
033	...Wow, if only you could see your face right now, Laila. You're beaming like the sun!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0024
034	I am. Strong and beautiful...as the sun.
035	And while the sun may set for today, it will rise again, as brilliantly as the blossoms of your flowers.
036	Well, may we meet again, erm... I don't think I ever got your name.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0031
037	It's Mielikki!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1024
038	Well then, may we meet again, Mielikki. I'll be sure to include you in the tales of my travels I tell to Shayna.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0007
039	I doubt she'll believe I met someone so much like her.
040	Thanks! And be sure to give her my best!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
