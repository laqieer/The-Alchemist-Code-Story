001	That woman... It can't be! Is that...the Thunder Wolf, Langhao?!
002	The Thunder Wolf? The most likely candidate to succeed the empire, whose power only the winner of this very tournament can hope to match?! Why would she be here now?!
003	So, you're Langhao. They say you're the most powerful of the potential successors.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
004	You dare speak my name? That is a privilege allowed only to those who are worthy!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
005	(Ngh. She's strength incarnate! I can't drop my guard for even a moment.)
006	You...are just as I expected.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0003
007	Wh-what's that supposed to mean?
008	It means you're boring me.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0030
009	Wha—?! Ack!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0022
010	Hmm?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
011	Apply a little pain and it starts, is that it? You've been stealing his life force all this while, but when your host is at death's door, you give a just a drop of it back.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
013	You want to keep using him, don't you? Not even a single drop of his blood is allowed to spill by another's hand. You really are greedy.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
026	What are you...?
027	You seem to prefer hiding in the shadows of others, but do you truly wish to keep your relationship with Mammon in the shadows as well?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0003
028	...!
029	There are many successors in attendance, you know. Why don't you tell them, here and now, what little secret you've got hiding within you?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0008
030	S-stop!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
031	If they find out, another assassin will be sent. Another person will suffer because of me!
035	I don't want to respond to those who have been kind to me by killing them! Not anymore!
032	So you choose to endure it alone? Fancy yourself a tragic hero? You really are insufferable.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0012
015	If you don't want them finding out, then you'll have to stop me. And I won't go down easy.
016	C-curses! Rraaaaaaghh!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0032
017	Ahaha! You should have fought like this from the start!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0023
034	Shut up!
018	Haaa...haaaa... No!
019	No!!!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
020	Why are they fighting like this? This is just a tournament! Are they trying to kill each other?!
021	One of them will probably pass out soon from the blood loss. Please just let this end...
022	I see. Now I understand. This won't be enough, will it?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
023	Fine, then.
024	Gah!
025	In honor of your steadfast fighting and bravery, I'll let you go. But just for today.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
