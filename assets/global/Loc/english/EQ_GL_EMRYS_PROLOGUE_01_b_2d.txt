002	Those with no bite should learn not to bark.
003	...Is it over?

005	Hey, that's pretty good. The damage is minimal. You're stronger than you look.
006	I wouldn't have stepped in this fine establishment if I couldn't handle myself.
007	You certainly can. You have anymore surprises up those sleeves of yours? Maybe your search may not be so futile after all.

021	Sure, keep it to yourself. Simpler for me.
022	I can find the "Broker" for you.
023	But, I will need you to help me out with something first.
024	Quid Pro Quo. It's fair this way, isn't it?
