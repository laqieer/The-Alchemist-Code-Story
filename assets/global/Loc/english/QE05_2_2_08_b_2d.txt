001	Whew, we made it outside of the village.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
002	Yes, however...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
003	What?! The village has been completely overrun by the Jam?!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
004	With Sephiron gone, it was only a matter of time before we lost the village, but...now the Sephira have no home to return to.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0028
005	Kamui...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
006	Yet, I must live on, as I was instructed. I must do what I can to ensure that I can manage that.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
007	General! How is the battle going?	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
008	Teona? It is good to have you back with us.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0027
009	So Waginau is no longer with us.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0022
010	I'm afraid not.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
011	Frankly, the battle is not going particularly well. Ever since those creatures—the Jam, you said?—appeared, we've been losing soldiers rapidly.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
012	Our forces simply cannot stand up to these creatures in battle.
013	That can't be!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0020
014	So, Kamui, you are a Sephira... Your people must have had some way to guard against these creatures.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0001
015	I'm sorry, but with Sephiron lost, there just isn't a way to defeat such a large horde of the Jam.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
016	Ah... That is unfortunate.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0027
017	Then I have no choice but to call for a full retreat. Sacrifice a few so that the many may escape... That is the only path left to us if we are to survive.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
018	I cannot imagine that Ceclidis will simply let us go.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0028
019	You are not incorrect. Ceclidis is indeed a man of cruel, vengeful nature. Even if we retreat, I know he will just hunt all of us down.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0005
020	The only thing we can do is leave some of our people here, doomed to certain death, in order to draw his attention until the rest have escaped.
021	We'll have to find volunteers. We're running out of time, but at least people will have the chance to say their final farewells this way.
022	Has it really come to this?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0020
023	...
