001	That's the Gilrack Ruins. We'll have to walk right into the awaiting enemy. Keep your guard up.
002	U-um, wait! I feel it's too dangerous to charge in from the front, without knowing the enemy's strength.
003	Maybe we could divide the enemy.
004	What do you mean?
005	Our main force can draw as much of the enemy as they can to the front. Meanwhile, a separate battalion can go in from behind. That way we can attack from both ends.
006	At the very least, we should be able to confuse the rebels.
007	If we're to make our way around the enemy unnoticed, we'd need the separate battalion to be a small one. It would be dangerous.
008	I'll go. I should be able to make up for the lack in numbers, right?
009	Logi!
010	... ...
011	Father, I'll go! I doubt anyone will be as effective as us two!
012	Hah. Very well. The two of you will lead the separate battalion and make your way around from the back. Make sure the power does not consume you.
013	Yes, Sir!
