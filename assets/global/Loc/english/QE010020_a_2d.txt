001	We managed to sneak into the ruins. We've confused them, just as you planned. Well done.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
002	Wait, Dias. Look, over there. There's light of some sort.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
003	Is that an excavation site or something?
004	An excavation? What're they excava—?
005	An ancient, abominable relic.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
006	?!
007	It is, so to speak, the key to Wratharis's resurrection—the light of hope that will lead the world to chaos.
008	Sabareta!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
009	So, you've decided to show up! Let's finish this!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
010	Well, I doubt you'll be able to suppress this man's long-standing grudge.
011	Saying this, Sabareta summons Caesar once again.
012	!!!
013	Go, General Caesar. Destroy them to your heart's content.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
