001	...Seriously? That girl was brought here, too?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
002	That girl?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
003	Ah, don't worry about it. Let's leave that for later...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
004	(I knew it. It really is the Orc Lord... And he's headed straight for this village.)
005	...
006	Everyone, listen up.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
007	From a different point on the timeline, huh? What a complicated situation.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
008	Agreed...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
009	So basically, these guys were plucked from the time where we were still fighting them, right?	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0045
010	Yeah. In other words, it's the same orcs that later became our friends.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
011	This is tough... I can't think of a way to settle this without fighting them.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0016
012	(I'd rather find a way to save them all and return to our world together...)
013	Answer: Taking back orcs that have ingested large quantities of Alchemia will have strong adverse effects on our world.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0010
014	...
015	Benimaru, evacuate the villagers to a safe place together with Creto.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
016	We'll keep in contact via Thought Communication when the orcs arrive. Get back as soon as the villagers are in a safe place.
017	Got it. Are you going to be okay by yourself? You're still not back at full power yet...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0004
018	I can hold them off until you guys return.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0007
019	Besides, I want to make sure that not a single one of these kind villagers dies at their hands.
020	I don't want to saddle the orcs with more sins for them to regret when they come back to their senses.
021	...Understood.
022	Well then...
023	...
024	...
025	Yikes. That's over 200,000 of them! I'm glad I ordered the others to evacuate the village first.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0016
026	...
027	Hey! You there! Listen up!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
028	I don't want to fight you! I want to find a way to return to our world together!
029	So please, stop eating and listen to me! We can still find a way to save you!
030	Did they hear me?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
031	...
032	Hunger...
033	I knew it. No luck there.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0030
034	(So it's exactly as Ouroboros said then...)
035	That will be impossible. They've already devoured and absorbed too much Alchemia from this world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0039
036	Taking them back with you would bode ill for your world.
037	Answer: Taking back orcs that have ingested large quantities of Alchemia will have strong adverse effects on our world.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0010
038	...Guess fighting is our only option left. I just have to hold out till Benimaru and the others return. Huh? Wait...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
040	(They already absorbed too much Alchemia... Is that the only problem? Because if that's the case...)
041	Albea?!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
042	Were you planning to take on all of these orcs by yourself?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
043	Well, at least slow them down, maybe?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
044	Aren't you putting yourself in a lot of danger?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
045	I guess, but this is just one of my responsibilities as the ruler of the Jura Tempest Federation.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
046	Besides, I just had a great idea. So leave this to me.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0010
047	...Show-off.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
048	Huh! Show-off?! You mean cool, right?! You wanted to say cool?!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0026
049	No, I meant show-off. Someone who doesn't even consider the feelings of the ones he left behind and just runs off by himself...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
050	It frustrates me, since it reminds me of the past.
051	However, I understand why some people choose to do that.
052	So I've decided to join you here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
053	Albea...
054	The strength of our prey is our own! The strength of our prey is our own!	VO_orc.orc_battle_0003
055	Let's go!	VO_riml_b.riml_b_battle_0010
056	Haaahh!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0007
057	Ngh! Their power is overwhelming! At this rate, we'll—	VO_albell.albell_battle_0022
058	Albea!
059	Hell Flare!	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_1041
060	Looks like we got here just in time.
061	Benimaru! You've recovered enough to use Hell Flare again? Nice going! I knew you could do it.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0046
062	All these battles have taught me how to manipulate Alchemia. I'm finally getting the hang of it.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0008
063	The villagers are safe, so all that's left is dealing with these guys. Let's do this!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
