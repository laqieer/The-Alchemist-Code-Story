001	Haaah!	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0007
002	Whoa! The two of you are pretty tough!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0044
003	This is nothing to a Sosenko swordsman.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
004	Oh man, I totally wanna show off the techniques that Hakurou taught me, too... Too bad I can't hold a sword like this.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
005	I've got to figure out how to recover quickly... First I need to figure out what the laws of this world are.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0030
006	At the same time, somewhere else...
007	Yesss! The food here is soooo good!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0024
008	Mmm! I was all cranky about being hungry, but nothing clears your head like some good food!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0004
009	I guess I should go find Rimuru now, though...	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0006
010	Huh? Oh, whoa! That smells great, too!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0025
011	Welcome! Welcome! Get all your Gluttony Foss specialties here! Fresh, steaming, and delicious!
012	We've got meat on a stick, pickled plums, and the ever-popular Colosseum Apple Pie!
013	...
014	Oh, right!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0031
015	You don't get to hop worlds every day! I should pick up some snacks and souvenirs for Rimuru! Great plan, me!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0032
016	I better taste 'em all so I can pick the best ones! Souvenir selection is serious business!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0007
