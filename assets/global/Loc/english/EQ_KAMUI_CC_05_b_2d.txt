001	Using alchemy to purify appears to be more effective than I expected.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
002	(Yet it's still not as effective as Spiritbonding. In that case, I'll have to make up for it somehow...)	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
003	Ah! Damn—	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0019
004	"The source of compassion sways as gently as the Mother's rocking cradle..."	VO_malta.malta_battle_0007
005	What... This technique... Spiritbonding?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0026
006	Gosh, you're as reckless as ever.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
007	I can't take my eyes off of you, not even for a second.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
008	Malta?
009	Why? But you—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
010	You used Beelzebub, didn't you? That's probably why.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
011	Beelzebub is the antithesis of Sephiron. Awakening it brought the remnants of me, a druidic priestess, back to this land temporarily.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
012	Malta, I...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
013	It's okay. You don't have to say anything.
014	You're going away, aren't you? The longest journey you'll ever take.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
015	...
016	But I see... This time you came to report to me, didn't you?
017	Then I forgive you! After all, what kind of big sis doesn't appreciate that sentiment?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
018	I'm sorry.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
019	Don't you mean "I'm off"?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
020	Travel as much as you want, learn all the things I don't know, and bring back a lot of souvenirs!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
021	I'm sure it won't be me who greets you, but...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
022	Still, this is your home.
023	Yeah, I know.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
024	Very good! Well, then... Goodbye, Kamui.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
025	I wish you the best on your journey. Safe travels.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
026	Yeah.
027	I can't think of a better send-off.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0008
028	I'll go with you. To see the future of this world.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
029	Really?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
030	Yeah. I'll join you on your journey.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
031	That's reassuring. Thank you, Kamui.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
032	No, thank you. You're not the only one benefiting from this arrangement. Don't worry about it. Oh, by the way...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
033	If you want to leave the kingdom, you'd better take the sea route. The Fruit Peddlers have a ship docked at the port right now.
034	Times change in the blink of an eye.
035	The past, not allowed to remain in place, is dredged up and swept away in the great river of time. And yet...
036	...the vow we made that day is still in my heart.
037	Even if the proper succession is cut off, everything is connected to tomorrow.
