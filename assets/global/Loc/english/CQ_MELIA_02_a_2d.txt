001	Are we going to practice here today?	VO_meria.meria_sys_0031
002	No. After what happened last time, I've given it some thought.
003	The reason why your performance may be taking a while to improve is that the size of the instrument may not suit you.
004	The...size?
005	You and I have noticeably different body sizes, Melia.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0004
006	I realized that it might difficult for you to play an instrument that has been made to fit my body size, so...ah, here it is now.
007	Oh, if it isn't Gato? What's the matter? Are you already going to acquire a new instrument for yourself?
008	No. Today we are here to choose one for her. Melia, this is the peddler I often procure musical instruments from.
009	Oh, an instrument for this kid?
010	There are a lot of different kinds...both large and small! Oh, this instrument is beautiful!	VO_meria.meria_sys_0044
011	True. It's a fine specimen, however...it's also too big for you, Melia.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0031
012	I believe this one suits you better.
013	Sigh... But this one over here is more...beautiful. Are you sure I won't be able to play it?	VO_meria.meria_sys_0016
014	Hmm. Well, it is too large in size for you, but do you like it that much?
015	Yes...!	VO_meria.meria_sys_0004
016	Hmm... I feel like it's somewhat counterintuitive, but it may be best to use the instrument you've taken a liking to the most.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0049
017	Then can I use this one?
018	Yes. We'll take this one.	VO_meria.meria_sys_0004
019	Great doing business with you!
020	Well then, try and do your best with that instrument today.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0007
021	Eheheh. I'm so happy with this instrument!	VO_meria.meria_sys_0008
