001	Reiner...? It's you, isn't it? If it is, then please...! Please stop! I hate this! I hate this so much!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
002	That is why we must get back to our world as quickly as possible. Without us, it's defenseless.	VO_reiner.reiner_battle_0019
003	You...! You sound just like my dad!
004	Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0019
005	There! Take this! Quad-Assault!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
006	Haaaa... Haaaaa... Dangit all... This is tough, alone.	VO_reiner.reiner_battle_0019
007	No! I-it's really him. That...really is Reiner!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
008	I can't believe it... A human that can turn into a Titan? That's crazy!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
009	Heh. It's crazy to us that a human can fight a Titan like that without using omni-directional mobility gear.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
010	Listen up, Reiner! If you threaten the safety of this continent, then I will have to cut you down! And I won't be going easy on you, either!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
011	I won't let you!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0015
012	Come on, Judith. Get out of the way.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
013	No!
014	Why?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
015	I owe him my life, and you are my enemy! Need I say more?	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
016	I won't let you touch him either, Levi!
017	If you make a move, I... I won't fix your ODM gear!
018	I can't just let him go! He's a danger to Babel!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
019	That's what you always tell yourselves, isn't it? If something looks even a little dangerous, or if it's taboo, you put it down, even if it's not doing anything bad!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0013
020	How can you call that justice?!
021	I'm sorry, but if something even has the slightest chance of endangering Babel, I will eliminate it, no matter how small the danger may seem.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
022	We lost too much during the Lion Monarch's Charge. For the sake of our future, we... I...need to be more careful.
023	I don't expect you to understand. Your father's blood is on our hands, after all.
024	Yet so far as I can see, there's no reason for you to be protecting that Titan, so, please... Step aside.
025	He's not a Titan! He's Reiner! He has a name and everything!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
026	Besides, it's like I told you: I owe him my life! I'm not going anywhere!
027	Why are you being so stubborn? He's not even from our world!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
028	What does that have to do with anything?! He's here now! We've gotten to know each other!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
029	He's just as human as you and me!
030	Ah!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
031	Nnngh!
032	Get out of my way! I'm gonna save him!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
033	You idiot! Do you know what you're doing?!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0001
034	You may think you owe him your life, but he just tried to kill you! He's a Titan!
035	...
036	Judith. Are you sure you want to do this?	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
037	Even I don't know the right answer here.
038	I...!
039	Just keep in mind that this is a big decision that will directly impact the future. Be sure not to make a choice that you'll regret, Judith.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0016
040	I-I...!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
