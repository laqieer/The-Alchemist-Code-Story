001	Haa... I really hate this.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
002	There's nothing worse than having to go out in public, of all places... Ugh.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
003	I only agreed to help out because they needed someone. So why...how...did this happen?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
004	Neica...	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
005	Didn't you have fun decorating and painting the Easter eggs with us?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0010
006	I definitely did!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0008
007	Well... I can't say that I didn't enjoy doing all of that, but...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
008	Besides, an Easter Festival sounds like so much fun, doesn't it?! Aren't you excited?!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
009	Haa...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
010	I heard that there's going to be an Egg Hunt, a Spoon Race, and even egg rolls!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0045
011	Yep! Aren't eggs just amazing?! You can do so much with them!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0023
012	Haa...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
013	Hmm... I thought that if you put on a costume, you'd start getting into the spirit of things, but it doesn't seem to be working.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
014	Maybe the clothes aren't for her?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0001
015	The clothing doesn't have much to do with it. Neica has trouble leaving the house, so the moment we tried to get her out of her comfort zone, we'd already lost her.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
090	Come to think of it... Neica, didn't you say something in your letter about stalkers harassing you and giving you trouble?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0030
091	Yeah... They've got my house surrounded, and they keep ambushing me. They shout things at me like, "Don't hide your Neica Powers from the world!" It's been horrible...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0017
092	O-oh, no! That's terrible! I had no idea...!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0025
093	Well... I wasn't brave enough to refuse, so they did succeed in dragging me out with them a few times...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
094	Oh, Neica...
095	Haa... Why does Easter even exist in the first place?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
016	That's a great question! I've never really thought about that before. I wonder why...	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0031
017	According to an ancient text in Gluttony Foss, the revival or recreation of what is known as the Festival of Plentiful Harvests is what led to the creation of this event!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0037
018	Furthermore, eggs and bunny rabbits are apparently considered symbols of the plentiful harvest!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
019	Then, you know... A little while back, everyone was saying that it would be your powers, Neica, that would make Gluttony Foss bountiful again.
020	Someone even dressed up like you, and wore clothes patterned with eggs and rabbits...
021	And that's how the tradition of casting magic on the Imperial Easter Egg came to be!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0009
022	Now, instead of praying for a good harvest, most people are more excited about what costume the person playing Neica will wear, and about watching the magical ceremony!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0045
023	Wow! Pam, you sure know a lot!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0044
024	Heheh... I'm not finished! Apparently, something very special will be resurrected over Easter!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0023
025	Huh? Like what?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0002
026	Umm... Well, that's not the point! All that matters is the hopeful story of "the resurrection of something dear!"	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
027	Right...	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0045
028	Haa...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
029	Anyway, it sounds like I don't actually need to be the one to cast the magic, since someone else is playing the role for me.
030	Besides, I can't just go around letting people know that I'm the real Neica. They don't understand Phantoms—they'd be scared witless!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
031	Pfft! Witless, schmitless. You're already here for the Festival, and you're participating.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0010
032	It goes without saying that you should be the one to show up onstage!
033	Are you even listening to me?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
034	And you were the one who made the Imperial Easter Egg, weren't you?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0001
035	That means you should totally be the one to finish it off with your magic!
036	You know what they say: work once begun should not be left undone!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0010
037	You said it, Fujika! And you know what, Neica? Sometimes it's important to stand your ground!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0046
038	You gotta put your all into those prayers for a bountiful harvest and the resurrection and cast your magic on the Imperial Easter Egg!
039	Cause the main event of this festival is all about you! You don't get to be the center of attention very often, so why don't you just enjoy this occasion to the fullest?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0009
040	Ugh, I'm telling you I don't want to!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0040
041	Casting magic surrounded by huge crowds of people... I feel sick just thinking about it.
042	At least let me do it where nobody can see me...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0027
043	Dressing up and using my powers in front of everyone... That's just too much to ask from a homebody like me.
044	Well... If you really can't do it, then I guess that's that. It's such a shame, though. The star of the show was finally here in person and everything.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
045	Hmmm... It seems to me that drastic action is required! Let's go and have a look at the stage, and try and get you excited about standing up there!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0012
046	You're totally right! Come on, Neica, let's give it a go!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0031
047	I'm telling you, it's not that simple.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
048	Off we go!
049	H-hey! There's no need to push! Jeez...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0015
050	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! How are you enjoying your Easter so far? Well, get your thinking caps on, because it's time for the long-awaited Egg Hunt!
051	Our staff have put their all into hiding these adorable little Easter Eggs all over town! Happy hunting, and good luck!
052	Haa... Everyone looks like they're having a great time. Can't I just watch them as an innocent bystander?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
053	Wow! Check out the stage! It's amazing!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0024
054	The Imperial Easter Egg is so pretty!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0024
055	So, think you'll be able to enjoy yourself a little up there, Neica?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0008
056	Ugh...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
057	For the main event, you get to stand up there and use your powers on the Imperial Easter Egg in front of—	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
058	Ughhh... You're giving me a stomachache. Huh...? That's strange.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
059	What's wrong?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0006
060	That egg... I didn't make it.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0021
061	Wh-what?! Are you saying it's a fake?!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0050
062	How can that be?! The right one was up there this morning, wasn't it?!
063	Calm down, Pam! It probably just rolled off somewhere.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0026
064	Something that big doesn't just go missing!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
065	I guess so... I mean, the very fact that someone put a fake one up there probably means that something is going on.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0043
066	Not to mention that I enchanted the egg so that it wouldn't move, just like the Easter superstitions say to.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
067	Speaking of enchantments, I detect traces of magic being used here... Do you think a talented conjurer could have removed your magic, Neica?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0045
068	No... The way to remove it can only be found in a certain ancient document, and not many people even know that it exists.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
069	Besides, I've never heard of anyone wanting to interfere with this festival. Isn't that strange?
070	You seem flustered, ladies. Did something happen?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
071	Huh?! T-Te...
072	Te... Te—Teona?! Wh-wh-what are you doing h-here?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0028
073	We're here as security. We've blended in among the crowd of onlookers to prevent any trouble from occurring at this festival.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
074	Every year, there has been at least one case of a big fight breaking out over who found an egg first, and things like that.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
075	R-really?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0011
076	Everything looks fine for the moment, however, so we have simply been enjoying ourselves perusing the stalls.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
077	So... Why don't you tell us what's going on with you?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
078	W-well... We just discovered that the egg Neica made has been...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0018
079	H-how is that possible?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
080	This is quite the surprise.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0044
081	Lotiyah! Let us help them!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
082	Of course!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
083	All right. First thing's first, could you please describe this missing egg for me?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
084	Sh-she's so close... Too close... I can't believe I'm standing so close to T-Te—	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0047
085	Ahem. Neica...?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
086	I actually get to meet her...to talk to her. I need to calm down. I need to—	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
087	Erm... Neica? Are you listening to me?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0011
088	Y-yes! A description! Of the egg! Well... It's about the same size as whatever that man over there is holding!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0028
089	You there! Halt!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0012
