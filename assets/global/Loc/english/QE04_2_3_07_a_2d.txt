001	Fuu, we've returned.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
002	Shh! It seems like he has visitors. Let's wait here for now.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	That's just not true. I've explained it to you over and over again.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0030
004	But, if Voda hadn't come here then there wouldn't have been any conflict.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
005	Exactly! Thanks to all this uncertainty, my child is afraid to leave the house.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
006	I heard there were others as well. With all the damage that the Jam are causing us, we can't afford to deal with any other problems!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
007	But you've misunderstood what happened. Because those others were here, you were able to avoid further damage. Why can't you understand this?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
008	It doesn't change the fact that we were scared to death!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0018
009	We just want to live a life of peace. Please, don't let them near our village again!
010	Please, Fuu!
011	... ...!
012	We've returned, Fuu.
013	Ah. Well done. I thank you. Did you hear what the villagers said?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
014	...Yes.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
015	I see. My apologies. I was the one who requested you to patrol the village and exterminate the Jam for the sake of the village.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
016	Even if you and Voda work together...perhaps the villagers won't be able to adapt so suddenly.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
017	Well, I did anticipate that the gulf which existed yesterday wouldn't disappear overnight.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
018	Still, it surprised me to see how much our presence made the villagers anxious.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
019	For a time, you may have to suffer such responses... I truly apologize for this. Will you be able to endure it?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0035
020	Of course. I'll endure anything for the sake of protecting Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
021	Um... Is there anything I can do to assist?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0001
022	Tamis...you asked the same thing before, but you mustn’t worry yourself about such things. You should be preparing yourself for the days ahead.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
023	I know, but...with everything that Mocca and the others are doing...I wish there was something I could do to help as well.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
024	Besides...if only I was able to restore the Wind Matter, the people of Saga would be able to live in safety, but...because of my lack of power...
025	That's not true. Tamis, you're fulfilling your role as the vessel for the Wind Matter brilliantly. It's my lack of power that's the problem.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
026	Not at all! Sorry...I didn't mean it that way...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0022
027	Mocca and I will find a way to succeed...I promise you. So, Tamis, please don't worry about it too much.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
028	Tamis, you just need to prepare yourself and wait for when the moment comes! Right, Tina?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
029	Yes. I promise that we will revive the Wind Matter...and protect Saga's future. Please, just wait until that moment comes.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
030	... ...Okay.
