001	Agh...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
002	You've already lost. Surrender.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
003	I...will never succumb to Alchemy! It's power only gives birth to sorrow!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0026
004	...Captain Vettel.
005	Power must be accompanied by empathy, or else it will never lead to true peace!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
006	Empathy without power will only lead to death, Vettel!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
007	Stop!!!
008	We made it in time.
009	Chloe!
010	Ka...Kanon!
011	Vettel, I'm surprised you managed to endure so long against such dark Alchemy.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0043
012	Cadanova! Let me go! I can still fight! I need to stop him!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
013	You rest. Leave this to those of us who can wield Alchemy!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
014	Hyahhh!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
015	Foolish Paladins... Why do you protect the Holy Order of Babel?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
016	The Holy Order is a symbol of peace in Babel. It's destruction would throw the world into darkness and confusion!
017	The Holy Order advocates peace, yet behind the scenes they monopolize Alchemy while fortifying their power and status.
018	You Alchemy-wielding Paladins are nothing more than tools to fulfil their corrupt desires. Why can't you realize that?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
019	It's true that some may be corrupt. However, there are many who truly seek peace as well! What about the young knights that you yourself trained?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
020	As long as the smallest fragment of evil exists, it will continue to spread throughout the world!
021	In order to destroy the Corpse, the entire Holy Order of Babel must be dismantled!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
022	The Corpse...?
023	Open your eyes! History is simply repeating itself, and they're the ones making the rules!
024	Then, I'll fix the corrupted Holy Order of Babel.
025	I regret wasting my time trying to convince you. Very well then...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
026	In order to change the world, I will obtain further power! Uck...uckkkkaaaah!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
027	Huff! Huff! Huff!
028	Zahar! Did you just sign a contract with the darkness?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0021
029	Hahaaaah! Heh...heheh... So this is the forbidden power. Not bad.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
030	Tsk! Thus, the ultimate Black Knight is born.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
031	Haaah!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
032	Ack!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
033	Heheheheh! Flame Dragon King!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
034	Incredible! Even after Zahar signed a contract with the darkness, Cadanova still manages to hold him off.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
035	At this rate, I won't have enough strength! I need more! Paladins, give me your power!
036	Im-impossible!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
037	Ugh! Aghhhhh!
038	Wh-what's going on?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
039	He's stealing Alchemia Particles!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
040	Uckkkaaahhh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
041	Agh! His power is increasing more and more!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
042	Ca-Captain Cadanova!
043	I'll take your power as well!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0008
044	Ahh...!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
045	Ack...!
046	Aghhhh...!
047	Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
048	Chloe!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
049	Uckkkaaahhh! Power! Give me power!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
050	Give me immense power to purify this world!!!
051	Ch-Chloe, I-I promised that I would save you!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
052	Ka-Kanon!
053	Stop, Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
