001	Najam! Why? Why didn't you kill Ryle?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
002	...
003	Najam! You will address this matter immediately!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
004	Dahab. Why didn't you tell me the client was dead?
005	Ah, that. Well, you see...
006	The intermediary is obligated to keep tabs on the client and target alike, and promptly inform the assassin of any complications that may arise. That is as much a part of our doctrine as anything.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
007	You should have known the client's status by the time I started the job. So why, then, was I not informed?!
008	Mistakes...do happen. Sometimes, secure communication can be difficult in a pinch.
009	You didn't hear anything from me, however, so you should have simply kept your focus and completed the mission. For you to come back with your tail between your legs like this is shameful.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
010	Zalam Gaim looks to its star for guidance. But after this abysmal showing, your light is going to be flickering out now. You do realize this, don't you?
011	...
012	It looks like the order is largely standing behind Dahab now.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
013	I see. With the master so ill, I'm sure everyone must be uncertain of their future.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
014	Zalam Gaim is all we have. If the order crumbles, we have nowhere else to go.
015	Perhaps Dahab's way is right. If his guidance is the support everyone needs...
016	You can't be serious!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
017	Sakani, you would do better without me. Your standing in the order will only worsen if you continue to associate with a fallen star like myself.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
018	What are you saying?! I will always stand by your side, Lady Najam! Now and forever!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
019	You're still the star I look up to. That hasn't changed.
020	Am I, now?
021	News of your failure will definitely send waves through the order...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
022	But it won't change who you are. You're still an important figure to us all. You're still a star that shines down on us.
023	All this talk of stars...
024	(Have I really done anything worthy of that title? This whole time, I've just taken jobs and completed them, my only goal being to protect the place I call home.)	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
025	(That's why I always scoffed at the Najam title given to me. It's never held any meaning or value, as far as I was concerned.)
026	(I wonder when it began to mean so much to everyone else...when I began to be held in such high esteem...)
027	To be honest, Lady Najam, I'm a little scared of what Zalam Gaim is becoming. I barely even recognize it anymore.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
028	Of course, when push comes to shove, I believe we should do what's best for the order.
029	But...is this it? Is this the direction Zalam Gaim should be headed in?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
030	...
031	Your strict adherence to the rules sets you apart from other assassins' guilds. It's practically what you're all about.
032	Seems to me like your whole system is in danger of collapse when you make an exception like this.
033	...
034	Sakani...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
035	Yes? What is it?
036	Would you do me a favor?
