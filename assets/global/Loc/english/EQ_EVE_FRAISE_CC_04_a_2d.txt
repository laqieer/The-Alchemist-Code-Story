001	Putting your life on the line to protect others with your sword… Fighting with pride for your people…
002	It takes a certain kind of person to do that... Geez, knights are so rad.
003	If only we had a group of knights who took care of our people, too...	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
004	"The Lustburg Knights"...or something like that…but that would never fly in a magic-centric place like Lustburg.
005	What I think is important doesn't necessarily mesh with the real world.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0030
006	Sometimes what you think is important doesn't necessarily mesh with the real world, honey. It can be sad, even painful.
007	There's a lot you can't do. So, you do what you can.
008	What can I do now…?
009	Fraise!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
010	Rachel…You caught me at a bad time.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
011	Oh…um…I didn't--	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
012	It's alright. You don't have to pretend… Vic already told me. I've gotten weaker…and I don't seem to be myself.	VO_frayze.frayze_event_1003
013	I saw the match and thought how cool knights are. Everyone fights with pride.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
014	Everyone stands by their convictions... That's why you're all so strong and cool!
015	…
016	…Eve is really strong and cool, too!
017	Moa told me that, lately, Eve's been drawing the attention of the witches because of her efforts to find a way to break the curse.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
018	They think she's on a fool's errand because she hasn't found any clues yet and keeps hitting walls.
019	But she won't give up. That's because she loves you too much.
020	…
021	She's stubborn enough to go through all that and yet she cried when it came to you! You can't just let it end that way…	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_0019
022	…How could you call yourself a knight?
023	…!!!	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0019
024	…That explains a lot.
025	...I thought if I kept my distance, she wouldn't have to suffer. I thought I was protecting her.
026	…I had no idea what was really going on.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
027	..Um, Fraise!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
028	I have a plan--a way to bring a smile to Eve's face… Will you help me?
029	…
030	Making others smile is a knight's duty… If there's anything I can do, I'll gladly lend you my assistance.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
031	…!
032	Let's go, Rachel!
033	A knight who ignores the woman he loves when she's in distress cannot call himself a knight of Envylia.
