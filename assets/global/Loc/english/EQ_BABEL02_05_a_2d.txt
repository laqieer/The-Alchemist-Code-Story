001	Are you okay?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
002	Did you save me?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
003	I did. You've been through much, but you can rest easy now. Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
004	(Ever since that day...)
005	Thank you... My name's Spica. Um, what's yours?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
006	Zahar.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
007	(My world was always full of light. Although, it wasn't warm and bright like the sun...)
008	(You gave me meaning. You showed me how bright and precious it could be—)
009	(The light at the heart of the darkness.)
010	Spica, you've done well to come so far. I name you a sworn knight of Wratharis.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
011	Serve our glorious country to the best of your ability.
012	O-of course! I vow to devote my all to its glory.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0047
013	Captain Zahar, the meeting's about to begin. You're expected to oversee the training of the new recruits after.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
014	Right. I'm heading there now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0037
015	Spica's got a good handle on everything, don't you think? Ms. Strategist?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
016	It's her duty. She wouldn't be here if she weren't good at it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
017	I'm just admiring your wisdom in recommending her to be Captain Zahar's armiger.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
018	I appreciate your flattery, Vice Captain.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
019	What's your honest opinion of her?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
020	She simply wants to be useful to Captain Zahar. I made certain of that before having her promoted.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
021	Is that how you truly feel?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
022	What would you have me say? What merit would my honesty hold for you?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
023	You never change, do you? Are you sure she's suited for what comes next? She's fawning over Captain Zahar all the time.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
024	Do you think I would do anything without reason? She has a role to play in all this.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
025	All of this, is for Lord Zahar's benefit.
026	You really don't change.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
027	I will take that as a compliment. Regarding Envylia's new Scarlet Flame Guard...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
028	We've had more skirmishes with Envylia than usual these past few months.
029	...
030	(Captain Zahar hasn't changed at all since we first met.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
031	(Oh, I shouldn't be daydreaming. We're in the middle of a meeting!)	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
032	Moreover, Envylia has formed a new knight order—the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
033	Each knight under their command is said to be a master of combat in their own right.
034	How does their purpose differ from the Blue Flame Guard?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
035	Their purpose? Well...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
036	Captain Zahar, this file contains all our intel on them.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
037	They were originally a band of mercenaries that were promoted to an official knight order under Envylia's banner.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1003
038	Former mercenaries, hmmm?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
039	However, they have a separate chain of command from Envylia's main forces, and have been granted the right to act independently.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
040	Hmm...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
041	...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
042	Captain Zahar, we've faced them before, back when they were still the Scarlet Legion.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
043	Do you think they will be a hindrance to our plans?
044	Heh, worry not, for nothing shall stop Zahar from fulfilling his destiny.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0010
045	I suppose we'll face them in battle again. Perhaps they'll show us their "iron will" this time around.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
046	Captain Zahar, how come you've fought this Scarlet Flame Guard before?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
047	Spica...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
048	Ah! My apologies. I shouldn't have asked a question so far above my station.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
049	No, pay it no mind. I will tell you all about it some day.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
050	Your services are no longer needed for the day. Go home and rest.
051	Yessir...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
052	Your assistance was much appreciated.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
053	You're welcome, sir! Excuse me.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
054	I still don't understand what you see in her.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
055	Heh. I see nothing, Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
056	Oh...?
057	You have to see the whole picture, Corvus, and all the roles that each piece might play in the future.
058	Of course. If you say so.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
059	Letitia, how is our progress?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
060	Everything is proceeding according to plan, but we are still short.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
061	We need power enough to surpass the Sacred Stones scattered about the land.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
062	We need to create a Sacred Darkstone.
063	"Dear Silma... Today, Captain Zahar complimented me!"
064	"The work's really tough, but his words alone are enough to keep me going."
065	...
066	I have to give it my all again tomorrow!	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
067	(One day, Captain Zahar sortied out into the battlefield to face off against the Scarlet Flame Guard.)
068	(I was given a different mission, so I wasn't able to fight alongside him.)
069	(It pained me not being by his side, but there wasn't a shred of doubt in my mind that he would win and come back to us.)
070	(That was all I could think about.)
071	(Once the battle had ended, he returned to us safe and sound).
072	(Although I believed in him, seeing him come back in one piece filled me with such relief.)
073	(However...)
074	Captain Zahar, I'm relieved to see you back safe and sound.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
075	...
076	Is something wrong?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
077	I've finally met someone who can thrill me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
078	Someone who can...thrill you?
079	I will use everything in my power to obliterate him! Hahahaha! Until we meet again, Vettel!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
080	Capt...?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
081	(That was the first time I felt afraid of him.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
082	Spica.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
083	Y-yes?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
084	Ready my equipment. There is to be a large battle soon. I want my gear ready by then.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
085	A large battle? Yessir, right away.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
086	Hahahaha!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
087	One of us should've accompanied him into battle.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
088	Captain Zahar's obsessed with Vettel, of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
089	Heh heh, we should consider it a blessing.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
090	Vettel will be but a stepping stone for him.
091	A stepping stone for him to rise to even greater heights.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0010
092	(Finally, the day I dreaded arrived...)
093	(There, stood the Envylia army.)
094	(They deemed Wratharis a danger that had to be eliminated. If we were to lose...)
095	Vettel, I know you're waiting for me out there! I long to hear your screams of terror! Heh heh.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
096	My left eye's throbbing again. The shadows whisper to me. Something bad is about to happen.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
097	Vice-Captain, our top priority in this battle is to protect Captain Zahar.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
098	I am aware.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
099	Come, Vettel! I shall make Gilrack into your grave!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
100	For the glory of Wratharis! Yaaaaaaaaaargh! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!
101	For the glory of Envylia! Yaaaaaaaaaargh! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!
102	(I must protect Captain Zahar!)	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
103	Zahar!!!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
104	Let us finish what we started, Vettel!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
105	Exactly what I was thinking!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
