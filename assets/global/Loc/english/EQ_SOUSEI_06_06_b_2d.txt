001	Tch. I guess it's my loss. You brought some strong allies.
002	Right? Invidia's Shield Maiden.
003	Y-you know me?	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
004	Of course I do. I know all of you.
005	You are the young Engineer of Acedia.
006	...
007	And you are the Space-Time Manipulation twins from the Luxuria Belt.
008	...
009	...
010	You two are priestesses from the Gula Belt, and of course you are a knight from the Ira Belt.
011	...
012	...
014	...
015	And finally...
016	Our dear pursuer. How's the whole carving out your own path going? Did it never feel a little too easy to you?
017	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
018	Did you never wonder why everything was going so swimmingly?
019	How convenient it was that an airship popped up right as the Gula Belt was enveloped by Beelzebub's corruption?
020	Or how you just so happened to stumble across the Gear of Judgement in the Luxuria Belt?
021	Who was it that helped repair your ship in the Acedia Belt?
022	Then who helped you decide your next destination? Gave you a goal to chase?
023	No, most importantly—
024	—what of those ever so useful Gears of Judgement? Always a new one. Just in time to save the day. Who has been making them for you?
025	They really are convenient. Right, Yna?
