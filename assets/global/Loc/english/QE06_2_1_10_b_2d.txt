001	…Nghh…
002	Oh! You're awake.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0006
003	…!
004	I keep telling you to take it easy… How are you feeling this morning, Sleeping Demoness?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
005	…Don't call me that.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0013
006	Yeah, that wasn't my best. How about Rampaging Demoness?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
007	..!!
008	Time out! Time out! Just calm down. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0013
009	It'd be a shame if you went berserk on me now. The food's almost ready!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
010	On today's menu, we have wolf meat in sweet vinegar sauce! Here, have a bite!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
011	…
012	What's wrong? Hurry before it gets cold!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0005
013	The thought of eating human food--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
014	I thought you'd say that! Lucky for you, this isn't just for humans. It's perfectly edible for demons, too!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
015	That's not the point…
016	You're right! It's not just that demons can eat it. It also comes with a flavor guarantee!!
017	Well…to be honest, you're the first demon to try it, so "guarantee" might not be the right word!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0006
018	Would you just…
019	Yes, indeedy! You're the perfect demon to try it! Ahh! I'm so excited!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
020	Listen to me!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0012
021	Of course we can talk all you want after you eat! Chefs can't help wanting to improve their dishes!
022	…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
023	I kinda forced fed you earlier, but I need to know what you think about the flavor. Here, just try some.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
024	…Excuse me?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
025	Huh?
026	Did you just say you force fed me…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0001
027	Well, yeah! You kinda flew off the handle, so I had to do something.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
028	A demon's survival instinct is pretty amazing. Once you had some food in your mouth, you just swallowed it automatically.
029	You must've had that outburst because you were hungry. You calmed down once you had some food, and then you lost consciousness… You sure gave me rough time--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
030	…! And I ate it?
031	Sure did! It's the fruit of my labor. I've always wanted a demon to try my food. I never expected I get the chance this soon!
032	I mean, I could have done without the rampaging, but all's well that ends well, right?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
033	You're lying! I'd never eat something a human--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
034	It's the truth. You calmed down after you ate it. That's the only reason this place is still standing.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
035	…
036	I've got some cleaning up to do later, but--c'est la vie.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
037	…That's…impossible.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
038	What is?
039	Demons only devour humans.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0030
040	Most demons, maybe. But not you.
041	…
042	You can try to deny it, but your body is screaming, "I want to live!" Besides…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0002
043	Who says demons only eat humans, anyway? I bet it was someone who never tried anything different.
044	What's the point in trying different things?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
045	"Eat to live, not live to eat."	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0008
046	…?
047	In other words, only eat what you need to survive… If you don't eat something now, you'll die.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
048	Chefs don't just cook food, they provide nourishment! So, go on. Take a bite!
049	I don't need to hear this nonsense!!
050	Quit acting tough--you can hardly move. You don't scare me at all. Besides…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
051	You're irritable because you're hungry. I bet you won't feel like fighting on a full stomach.
052	…
053	That's the key to peace. Humans and demons won't need to fight if everybody is fed.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
054	Are you...out of your mind?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0001
055	Nope. Quite sane. Go on, before it gets cold.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
056	…I'd rather not.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
057	…
058	…*Sigh* Guess we're doing this the hard way.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
059	…Don't come near me!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
060	Be careful or you'll faint again, Sleeping Demoness.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
061	I told you not to call me that!!
062	Don't make me do any more heavy lifting.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
063	I'm not even that heavy!
064	Please don't go berserk again, okay?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
065	I don't have control over it… But it's a necessary instinct. At least I think it is.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0030
066	You think so?
131	I'm not evil. The people who stole from me are the evil ones.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
132	I'm not trying to take anything away from you. So, just eat up.
067	…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
068	You've got to live in order to see your brother again--to keep your promise, right?
069	…Even if that means killing you?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
070	If you want to devour me, go ahead. I don't plan on dying that easily.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
071	…
072	Made up your mind?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0005
073	I…
074	Hm?
075	…I don't know how--to eat.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
076	…Huh?
077	…
078	Bwahahahaha! That's right! I guess this is the first time you've ever seen something like this!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
079	…Don't laugh!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0012
080	Sorry, sorry. That was rude. Open up! I'll feed you.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
081	You're joking…?!
082	It's fine. Ready? Here comes the airplane!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
083	..Wait--Oof!
084	…!!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
085	Don't spit it out! Chew carefully. Savor it. And swallow it in one gulp!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
086	…!
087	Don't fight your body's cravings. It wants to live.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
088	…!!!
089	…?
090	How is it?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
091	…I think…I ate it.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
092	Of course you did! You think I'd make something you couldn't eat? Tell me how it tastes already!
093	…Hmm, I don't…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
094	Tell me.
095	…I don't know. It's the first time I've tried something like this.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
096	Damn! And I was sure you'd like it… What can I add to make it better?
097	…H-Hang on! I just told you this is all new to me. You can't expect me to describe it all of a sudden…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
098	If it were really good, you just say, "That was delicious!"	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
099	It doesn't matter whether you've tried it before. Here, have another bite!
100	And let me know your thoughts!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
101	Easy for you to say! Wait! Give me some space--!!!
102	And?
103	Back up, already!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0012
104	Attagirl.
105	…Don't expect any thanks… But I feel a little better.
106	…That's good enough for me.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
107	See, you can show gratitude after all.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
108	That wasn't gratitude. It's just--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
109	Next time you lose your strength because of hunger, stop by and I'll make you something even tastier.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
110	Are you crazy?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0030
111	Crazy for cooking, maybe! Y'know, watching you eat I thought--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
112	You might not have said the word "delicious" but you sure looked like you enjoyed it.
113	…!
114	Your face said it all, even if your words didn't.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
115	I hope to see that face again. And next time, I'll make something so delectable you'll have no choice but to say "De--licious!"
116	Don't hold your breath.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
117	I'll make you eat those words.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
118	…So long. May we never meet again.
119	...We will. I'm sure of it.
120	Next time, I'll make your taste buds jump for joy.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
121	Now then, how can I get her to say "delicious?" Maybe more salt?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
122	What's that intoxicating aroma I smell?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0009
123	..Oh, it's you.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
124	Is that any way to address a member of the Wadatsumi royal family? You're as ill-mannered as always.
125	I should expect as much from a man who spends his days cooking in a place like this.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
126	Let's cut to the chase… What do you want? I doubt you're here for a meal.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
127	Shrewd as ever--I like that. Let me be blunt--	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
128	Koga… I've come here to make a request.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
129	Will you join the Phoenix Brigade?
130	…!
