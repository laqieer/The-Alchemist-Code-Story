001	Aga—! Huff...huff...! The pain...is getting more violent! Ack!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
002	Does your arm hurt, Dias?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0003
003	Lord...Gabirond!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
004	Let's go. The situation has changed. We must hurry now.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
005	What's going on?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
006	I've determined Captain Zeke's hidden motives.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
007	I know this will be hard to believe, but it appears he is eyeing to overthrow the king of Envylia.
008	Wh-what?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
009	I could hardly believe it myself, but the truth was thrust upon me.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0017
010	Wh-what happened?! Explain!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
011	After you left, I began to question Captain Zeke again.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0004
012	I asked him for what reason he sought to make peace now. In response, Captain Zeke drew his sword against me.
013	My father drew his sword...? I can't believe it!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
014	(He says that, but he's totally eating this up!)
015	It appears he wasn't motivated by the guilt of having slaughtered the people of Wratharis.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
016	At the center of everything...
017	Was his tremendous ambition to use Agatha as a shield in starting a revolution while acting under the pretense of promoting peace!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
018	Are you sure...?! My father admitted to that?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0021
019	Time has changed Captain Zeke.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
020	(Holy crap! He's just going to believe everything I tell him?! Is he hypnotized right now?!)
021	We often had conflicting views, but I respected him as my comrade in our support of Envylia.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0016
022	It's extremely regrettable. The old hero of Envylia seems to no longer exist.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
023	Father...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
024	(Now I'm curious... How much would he be willing to believe...?)
025	Not only does he plan to overthrow the king, but to take the his place on the throne and build himself a harem!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0021
026	A harem?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
027	Father... Have you lost all sense of honor?! Why can't I have a harem?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
028	(Oh, man. This is great! Okay, how about...)
029	He's even claiming to that he wants to start dressing up as a magical princess!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0046
030	...
031	(Uh-oh. Did I go too far?)
032	A princess?! Have you seen a mirror before, Father?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
033	(He bought it! Wow! What won't he believe?)
034	He's even admitted to being an alien from a distant galaxy.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
035	An alien?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
036	And he's part mermaid!
037	Mer... What?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
038	His beard is fake!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
039	No!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0028
040	He's an idol groupie!
041	Oh, I already knew that.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
042	What?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0025
043	Huh?
044	(Wait, that's true? He's a groupie?!)
045	(Urgh... I have to think of something that'll really blow his socks off!)
046	Zeke has been practicing a cheer for when Agatha becomes an idol one day.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0020
047	What?! Is that how he sees her?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
048	You've gone too far, Zeke!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
049	Yeah... You're pretty special yourself, Dias.
