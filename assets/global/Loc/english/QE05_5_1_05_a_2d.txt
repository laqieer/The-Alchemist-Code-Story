001	Kamui's back!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
002	Yes! He is now with General Adelbert, discussing our next move.
003	They would like for you two to join them, to go over the plans for what lies ahead.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
004	Absolutely! Let's go, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
005	...
006	Mocca?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
007	Huh? Ah, right...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
008	Kamui! I'm so relieved you're safe!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0009
009	Sorry to worry you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
010	I'm...sorry, Kamui. Marie was... We...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
011	Adelbert already filled me in. This is an alarming turn of events, but we still have a chance.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
012	Is that true?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
013	I still can't believe what you told me. Would that really keep the Jam at bay?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
014	I'm sure of it. The only issue is where to gather the materials needed.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
015	Kamui! You're back!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
016	...
017	Tina, Mocca, perfect timing.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
018	There's a way we can take the fight to Ceclidis. To do so, we are going to need your help.
019	Our help?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
020	First, let me share what information I was able to gather from the royal capital. It's about what causes the propagation of the Jam.
021	Is this about those microscopic creatures? The ones devouring Alchemia and amplifying their curse?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
022	Right. Their curse takes on the form of microscopic creatures, which spread.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
023	That's where their weakness can be found.
024	They have a weakness to exploit?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
025	Though I'm still not sure how effective it will be.
026	But at least it will change the fact that the power of purification is the only weapon we have against them.
027	And this weakness is...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
028	Dehydration.
029	Are you being...serious?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
030	Absolutely. I believe moisture is imperative for their growth and multiplication.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
031	That is why experiments regarding the Jam were conducted in Saga.
032	That land is saturated with the blessings of nature, and has an abundant source of water. Saga is perfect for the Jam.
033	Come to think of it, the Jam we fought in the desert were nothing compared to those that ran rampant in Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
034	The "Wind" Ouija was able to eradicate the Jam, much like our purification.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
035	This must have been because the element of wind, with its power of circulation, drained the Jam of their moisture.
036	Even if that were the case, what could we do? Draw Ceclidis out into the desert?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0002
037	No, he intends to perform the resurrection ceremony. He won't leave the Sephira village ruins.
038	Then do we use fire? Wouldn't that evaporate the moisture out of the Jam?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
039	There's an easier method. We just need a drying agent.
040	Drying...agent? Like, those things merchants use to keep their products from going bad?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
041	Exactly. With that, we wouldn't have to go through the trouble of starting any fires. All we would have to do is throw it upon them.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
042	Even soldiers without powers of purification or Alchemy would be able to fend off the Jam.
043	But to deal with all the Jam, we'll be needing a large quantity of drying agent.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
044	What about the ports?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
045	What do you mean?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
046	This country imported loads of limestone to be used for fertilizer and construction mortar.
047	There should be a large stock of lime at the port, should there not?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
048	Limestone? Does that work as a drying agent?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
049	It does. Heat treated lime absorbs moisture and can ignite.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
050	That sounds...very useful.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0045
051	The port of Gluttony Foss has been active, even though... No, especially because of this country's internal conflict.
052	Both the Liberation Army and Gluttony's army have been in desperate need of supplies.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
053	The port has been instrumental for both armies in gathering and stocking supplies.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0002
054	Then here is the plan.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
055	We will head for the port and gather supplies, then move on the offensive.
056	I'm starting to see a ray of hope, but...	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
057	Is this about the morale of the troops?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
058	Yes. The loss at the royal capital has caused morale to drop significantly.
059	We may not be able to expect much from them if we force them to march now.
060	Then I will march with them. I will rally them until my throat bleeds.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0005
061	Would that be of some help?
062	Your Highness?! You mustn't! Your wounds are not yet healed!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_favorite_0001
063	I'm fine, Adelbert. This is nothing compared to what Marie is having to endure now!
064	You will be putting yourself in danger. Are you sure?
065	I am the Liberation Army's banner. How can I expect any soldier to follow me if I do not stand at their head?	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0001
066	I know I am powerless. I have no aptitude for leading an army, nor any means of saving anyone. I depend on all of you for everything.
067	Yet still, I am a member of the royal house of Gluttony Foss.
068	I have responsibilities that only I am capable of executing, and the people will not follow me unless I take these responsibilities on with my life on the line.
069	Am I wrong, Adelbert?
070	Adelbert, his Highness' will seems to be set in stone.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
071	Your Highness... As you wish! I, Adelbert, will dedicate all that I am to your protection!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0005
072	Thank you.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0034
073	All right then. Tina, Logi, and I will head to the port to secure the materials we need. If everyone else could prepare for the offensive...
074	The Blue Tongues will help with the delivery of the drying agent.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
075	If you would, please.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0041
076	I...I will...
077	Mocca, I would like for you to go with the Liberation Army.
078	B-but I'm like a torch to a moth! I'd be attracting too much attention! Surely I'd be putting all of them in danger!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
079	I was actually counting on that.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
080	You were?
081	By having you travel with the Liberation Army, I'm hoping the enemy's attention will be focused on them and away from us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
082	You should be the perfect distraction to prevent the enemy from obstructing our efforts.
083	Besides, there is one thing I'd like for you to do.
084	Th-there is?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
085	Let's go! Tina, Logi!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
086	We will head to the port through the night! We must deliver the materials to the Liberation Army before they reach Sephiron!
087	We will not detour even if monsters stand in our way! We'll cut straight through them!
088	Got it!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
089	You can count on us!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
