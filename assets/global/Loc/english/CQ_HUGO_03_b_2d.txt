001	Hell yeah! Right on the money!	VO_hugo.hugo_battle_0004
002	Sharp shooting, as ever! Mission's accomplished, so now we just have to get out of here!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0009
003	Ugh! Dang it! I was careless!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0043
004	Regroup! Don't let them get away!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
005	Vivi! Are you okay?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0001
006	It's...just a scratch, but... Ow.
007	Ladies first! Go on ahead!
008	Don't you treat me like a damsel in distress!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0012
009	I'm not! I ran in without getting a good grasp of this place's layout! I need you to guide us through!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
010	Hahaha... In that case, I think you're using "ladies first" wrong.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
011	Whatever. I'll watch our back, so get moving!
012	We're almost out! Keep going!
013	Hehe, if only others could see you lending me your shoulder like this... Then they'd see how compassionate you can be.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
014	If you'd intended to, you could have seriously wounded our comrade, but I know you purposely kept it to a minor injury. You didn't want...to—
015	All right, all right, but that still doesn't change the fact that I shot one of you guys. If others can't forgive me for that, then so be it.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0017
016	Jeez, it's like I'm talking to a brick wall.
017	Ow! Don't drop me like that!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0029
018	This should be far enough. You only took a little scratch, right?	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0022
019	What? No, this is a serious wound. Ooohhh, owowow... The pain...
020	Oh, please.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0031
021	Vivi! Are you hurt?!
022	We saw it all! You helped Vivi walk all that way... I had you all wrong, Hugo! I'm deeply moved!
023	Wh-what the hell? This is weird.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0015
024	We were wrong about you. We heard what you did, and we just jumped to conclusions about you.
025	But...through this mission... Seeing your actions... We know now that you're a good person!
026	Aaaahhh, shut up, shut up! It's over and done with, so forget about it!
027	That sense of humility! So humble!
028	Th-the job's done, right?! I-I'm going home!
029	Hugo!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0003
030	What?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
031	Not a bad feeling, is it? Hehehe!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
032	Haaah... Fine! Hey, you guys!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0038
033	Yes?
034	Look... I'm sorry for leaving my post like that... And sorry for hitting you, earlier...and about shooting your friend.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0035
035	Hugo!
036	N-no hugs! This is weird! Vivi! Stop laughing and get them off of me!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0025
037	Hahaha. I'm just glad to see you making friends!
038	What do you mean? You're not saying you hired me for this job to...?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
039	You just looked so lonely while working on your gun.
040	I did not!
041	Oh, just admit it!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0023
042	Tch! You're such a damn meddler!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0016
043	You could be so popular if you wanted to, you know? Regardless of how scary your face looks!
044	My face has nothing to do with any of this!
045	Hugo! Let's go drinking sometime!
046	I go for sweets after a job. That's my routine. Speaking of which... Where's my payment?	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
047	Vivi? Where did she go?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0025
048	Hey! You said you got your hands on a rare sweet treat! You haven't paid me my share, yet!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0001
049	Hahahaha! Aw, how cute. Getting so mad over sweets...	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0008
050	Vivi! I'll get you for this!
