001	Haa... Haa... Haa...	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0111
002	"Wratharis' Deadly Trio" isn't just a name after all. You guys can really fight!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0112
003	Haa... Haa... Right back at ya, Neville.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0090
004	Haa... Haa... Never mind all our bluster; when was the last time the three of us crossed swords like this?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0066
005	It sure has been a while. Kind of takes me back.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0113
006	I'd heard of you two, Caesar and Vlad, long before we came together as a trio, but still always thought I was the most suited to be our leader. I had so much confidence in myself!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0114
007	I always thought the same of myself, too.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0091
008	But once we got together and the fighting started, that thought disappeared. We fought as one.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0115
009	For me as well, I never wanted to be the best among us; I just wanted us, as a singular unit, to be the pride of Wratharis.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0067
010	It was never about showing off our strength to one another.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0092
011	Exactly. Everything we did, we did for the land we loved.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0116
012	Hahaha. That's it! That face... That's the Neville we all know and love. General Neville the Ice Snake, in the flesh!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0068
013	Cool and calculating, but with a burning passion for his homeland hidden beneath the surface—the kindhearted yet resourceful general who will lose to no one!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0069
014	Absolutely. This Neville could make people forget about any past blunders through sheer force of will alone!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0093
015	My biggest blunder wasn't being defeated in the tutorial, though.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0117
016	The fact that I couldn't protect Wratharis to the end when it was engulfed in the flames of war... That is the deepest scar I bear.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0118
017	To make up for that failure, I will pick myself back up and hone my strategies, no matter how long it may take or how hard I must train.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0119
018	That's the spirit!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0070
019	But I can only put all my battle plans into action through the strength lent to me by that noble-hearted bolt of lightning...	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0120
020	General Vlad the Thunderer, I owe it all to you. Going forward, will you still have my back?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0121
021	Aye, you can count on me any time.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0071
022	And if you're not content with just me at your back, worry not...	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0072
023	Because here is the man whom I—or rather, whom all the people of Wratharis—can rely most heavily upon!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0073
024	Our great and righteous leader whose heart burns with fury for the sake of peace and justice throughout our noble homeland: General Caesar the Demon Flame!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0074
025	But alas, even the combination of clever strategies, fierce generals, and warriors who support their country wholeheartedly from the frontline and rear alike was not enough to save our Wratharis.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0094
026	I blame my own lack of strength for that. I swear never again to turn my rage on you two in defeat, but rather to protect our shared dreams to the bitter end, with both of you at my side!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0095
027	Huzzah!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_neville_2021april_0001
028	Whew. Maybe it's because we haven't had this much action in a while, but I must say, I feel oddly invigorated right now.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0123
029	I feel the same. It's almost as if some strange spirit has fallen upon us.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0076
030	A spirit? Now that you mention it... Neville, I do believe you heard a voice earlier that neither of us could perceive. Are you...all right?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0096
031	I am. I don't hear it now, but I feel like even when I did, it was on our side. That voice unleashed something within me that I believe gave us the push we needed to fight with all our might.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0124
032	Hahaha. Perhaps it was the voice of the player, as a collective, holding out for us—looking forward to our debut so much that they simply couldn't wait any longer!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0077
033	In that case, why are we still hanging around here?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.caesar_2021april_0097
034	Yes, we've already betrayed the collective playerbase's feelings enough for one day, I think. For 307 lines of dialogue, in fact!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.vlad_2021april_0078
035	Well, then, shall we go? Let's show the world the might of Wratharis' Deadly Trio once more! All for one, and one for glory! Or something...	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_03_b_2d.neville_2021april_0125
