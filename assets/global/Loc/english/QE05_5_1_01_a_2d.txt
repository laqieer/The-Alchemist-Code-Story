001	Hmm... Ngh...
002	I-is this...an altar?
003	Y-you...!	VO_mary.mary_battle_0019
004	Rise and shine, druidic priestess.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0007
005	Tell me, how does it feel? What is it like to lay your eyes upon the origins of your decimated tribe?
006	Why did you bring me here?! What are you planning, Ceclidis, you madman?!
007	Well, now that is no way to greet someone. Have you no manners?
008	You ought to show some respect to your king, even if it's only superficial.
009	Wh-why did you bring me here?
010	To sacrifice you, of course. I mean to follow suit with your people's ancient traditions.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0010
011	What?!
012	The druidic priestess has always been the vessel in which the Alchemia of the land is collected.
013	You are naturally attuned to Alchemia, even capable of containing the powers of the Sacred Stones within you!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0008
014	There is none other than you who can perform this duty!
015	The Sephira... How irksome they have been, time and time again.
016	But I must praise them for successfully imbuing a living human being with qualities comparable to my Shadow Excelsior.
017	A heretical deed if there ever was one! Do you not think it only natural that your Sephira tribe fell to ruin?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0011
018	How dare you! You were the one directly responsible for their fall!	VO_mary.mary_battle_0019
019	Hmm, what a powerful glare. Defiance, anger, hate... I can feel them all emanating from you.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0006
020	Let me hear your lamentations as you are ceremoniously sacrificed!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0008
021	What?!
022	Dear host...
023	What?
024	Blood... I need more blood.
025	This land of greed must be filled with more tragedy and scorn.
026	The resurrection ceremony... To revive Cryphone, we will require many more sacrifices.
027	We've leveled the entire royal capital and it's still not enough, eh? What a glutton you are.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0011
028	A half-hearted awakening would be meaningless. We will need great power to take what we must from the Holy Order.
029	Hmph, very well. What use do I have for soldiers in the coming battles, anyway?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0010
030	Devour your fill and prepare for the awakening. Try to take as many of our enemies with you as possible while you're at it.
031	Of course.
032	Have you not caused enough death?! So many of your own people...and yet... What are you planning on accomplishing?!
033	Is it not obvious?
034	I will become the supreme ruler of this continent! I have desired nothing else for over a hundred years!
035	Haaahahahahah!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0023
036	You monster!
037	(He's mad! How can we hope to defeat such a terrifying monster?!)
038	(Seriolde... Please, run away! Everyone, you must flee!)
039	The enemy forces are routing! This is our chance to push through!
040	Something is not right.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
041	General? Is something wrong?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
042	This is too easy. Yes, we have disheveled their formations and the desert's climate is on our side, but...
043	These are elite commanders of Gluttony Foss' military. It's hard to believe they would break so easily, under any circumstances.
044	You mean this could be some sort of ruse? Has our invasion of the royal capital been exposed?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
045	I'm not sure, but it would be best to take precautions. Send a message to every division! Avoid excessive pursuits! Prepare for the enemy's retaliation!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
046	Yes, Sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
047	The enemy has eased their assault! Now's our chance for a counterattack! General!
048	...
049	General? May we have your orders?
050	We've been engaging these desert rabble for three days! If they continue to pressure us like this, the troops' morale will...
051	...
052	General...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
053	Hehe... Gahahahahahaha!
054	G-General?! What is the matter?!
055	Wh-wha—?!
056	The time has come! Children of Gluttony Foss, you will now become the groundwork for my survival!
057	Wha...? No!
058	S-stop! No! I don't want to die! Aaaaahh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
059	G-General, look!
060	Tch! Sound the retreat!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0042
061	Leave your weapons and supplies! Just run! Touch that dark mass, and you won't survive!
062	Ceclidis, you monster! You dare sacrifice your own troops like this?!
063	That was the main force of Gluttony's army! Further invasion of the desert would be impossible without them!
064	Wha—?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
065	General?!
066	Pull yourselves together! We have no time to waste! Just go on without me!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
067	B-but...!
068	Hahaha! Not bad! Your reputation does you no service, Flame-Armed General!
069	You're the ones who betrayed the Sephira... And you, Ceclidis! You have my cousin Marie, don't you?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0001
070	Exactly! The ceremony can begin at any moment, but we still need more blood! Give us your life!
071	Huzzaaahh!
072	You fool! Did you think spineless back-stabbers like yourselves could defeat me?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0017
073	What are you doing standing around?! All of you, get back!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
074	R-right away, Sir!
075	Hahaha... Hahahahahaha! You are the fool, Georgios!
076	What?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
077	Th-this can't be!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0025
078	We are eternal! The strength you pride yourself on is as nothing before our might!
079	Ngh! You would go so far as to abandon your human form?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0028
080	Everyone! Save the General!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
081	No, don't! Stay back, or—
082	I'll devour you all!
083	Waaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
084	How dare you!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
085	Hahaha! Resistance is futile, humans! Lay down and become my flesh and blood!
