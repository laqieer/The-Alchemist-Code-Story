001	You've lost, Bianca.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
002	Why will you not inflict the finishing blow? I am the priestess of Ouroboros, the very first member of the Infinite Serpent...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0005
003	Because you want me to kill you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
004	...!
005	Did you really think I wouldn't notice?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
006	You were the one who avoided clashing with Ouroboros before—yet here, you initiated the fight yourself.
007	That alone raised a number of red flags for me...
008	And brought to mind several possible reasons for this situation we find ourselves in.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
009	I believe the key to the Ceremony of Creation is your very life.
010	The Ceremony will start with your death and proceed through an incalculable litany of sacrifices, ultimately leading to the renewal of the world. Am I correct?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
011	...
012	This entire encounter came across as forced—as staged. It was obvious some unseen scenario was being laid out for us.
013	You're rushing to get it finished. You're desperate. Why?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
014	...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0027
015	See, I told you it wouldn't work.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
016	Shahel...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
017	You must understand, Bianca. Humans are curious creatures by nature. They live to seek the truth.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
018	Show them a riddle, and they will give their everything to understand it, then build a belief system out of the answer when they do. It is their greatest joy.
019	He has already resolved himself to his own ideals. Your plan was doomed to failure from the start.
020	What you should have done is ask him if he was prepared to fight against his loved ones. Then you might have gotten somewhere.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
021	I hesitate to even play into your little games, but...what are you talking about?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
022	Precisely what I said. When we first spoke, I believe I told you, no?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
023	That a mysterious group of people had occupied these lands?
024	And the one who leads that group is the Vessel of Purification herself...your sister, Emmel.
025	Wh-what...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
026	She even killed me! Such a wretched thing to do, no?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0010
027	Killed?! What are you talking about? You're right here, alive and well.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
028	Oh, actually, I'm sort of a colony of beings. We're called high elves, but originally, we were all just...me.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
029	A copied existence?! What are you, exactly? A dragon? Or perhaps something they constructed?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
030	An excellent conjecture. I'm the caretaker of the territories of the sevens sins, and the being who has inherited the dragons' will.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0009
031	They created life in the image of humans, and the resulting group that came about was all me.
032	The diversity amongst my progeny was just something I added later, for a bit of fun.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0008
033	I don't care who or what you are!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
034	Is Emmel really here? And did she really take over the Infinite Serpent?!
035	Oh, yes. And she was quite delightful, if I may say so! Though naught but a powerless human, she stood bravely against a Cursed Beast, gained a party of companions, and completely upset the balance of everything.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0037
036	She declared quite passionately that she would take on the role of the sole sacrifice to save this world.
037	...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
038	If you wish to stop her, you'd best hurry.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
040	Right now, she is in the process of synchronizing with the Cursed Beast Lucifer. I imagine the procedure is nearly complete, at this point.
039	So even if you don't go, I'm certain she'll be along to see you soon...if only to stop you.
