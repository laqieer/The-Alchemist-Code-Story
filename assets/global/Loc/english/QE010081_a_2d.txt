001	Hey, Logi...assuming you do catch up with Sabareta, what will you do then?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0031
002	...Huh?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0005
003	You don't plan to kill him, do you?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0005
004	...Why do you ask?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
005	That man...I don't think he's a bad person. He went out of his way to prevent the death of innocent people.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0007
006	Burdened with the deep despair of Wratharis, he channels their anger in battle...but I don't think he's lost his pride as a knight.
007	After having crossed blades with him...I've come to think the same.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0045
008	He wants to change this Alchemy-shaped world.
009	His methods are wrong...but I'm beginning to think our hopes are the same.
010	Yes! That's why I would like to realize our hopes together with him...	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0023
011	Our hope of peace between the two countries of Wratharis and Envylia!
012	If we can work together with them, I think we can change this world...no, I'm certain we can!
013	Yeah! To do that, let's meet him again! Let's come together and convey our hopes to him!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0006
