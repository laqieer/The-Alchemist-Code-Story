001	Foolish.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
002	This world is no longer our garden to tend.
003	(Who is it? Is someone there? No, that voice can't be...)
004	We are the already departed. All that remains of us is a decaying skeleton that clings to the old ways of the world. Nothing can save it...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0030
005	...Zafeiris. Have you, like Nidhogg of long ago, reached the peak of madness...?
006	(What? What are you talking about?)
007	Hmm? Well...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
008	So you have finally set foot in this domain, you who will pierce the world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
009	(What are you saying?)
010	Somehow, it seems that as yet you are a being that cannot even properly breathe in these lands. But you will learn.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
011	At any rate, by your own hand, the ways of this world are already being rewritten.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
012	(What?!)
013	I thought of you as little more than specks of dust, an unexpected occurrence of chance. I thought you would be easy to brush off.
014	Somehow, it seems that I was wrong.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
015	(I don't understand! Please, explain so I can understand...)
016	I can only tell you that I have no more reason to get in your way.
017	Should you deny your sin, that is also a choice the world has made...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
018	And I will wait here, until the moment you arrive to turn your blade against me.
019	(Wait!)
020	Huh?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
021	Where...am I?
022	So you're awake, Nimul.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
023	Yna...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
024	Ah, apologies. It seems that I nodded off in the middle of my work...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
025	It seemed like you were having a nightmare. I know how that feels.
026	Never mind that. How far have you gotten?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
027	Just finished.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
028	Our first collaboration since the Dragonslayer. The gear of judgment that will defeat the Beast of Gluttony.
099	It's called...hm...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
100	The gear of judgment until now have borne names of the stars that glitter in the heavens...
029	Let us continue the custom. How about...Sagittarius?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
030	Sagittarius... I see.
031	Now our preparations are complete.
032	That reminds me. Adaleigh and the others came by a short time ago.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
033	It seems that the airship will also be ready quite soon.
034	I see. Then let's check everything out.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
035	I've finished gathering all the materials you requested. Other than that...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
036	No, this is enough, Minario. Thank you.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
037	I'm sorry. I know I requested some materials this region needs for its recovery...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0036
038	Don't worry, I understand your need for them. Besides, you all are the great heroes that saved this region!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0007
039	Plus...my Father caused quite a bit of trouble for you all.
040	I don't think this makes up for it, but hopefully it will go some way towards paying back the debt I owe you.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
041	Oh...
042	All right then. Truth be told, I'm mostly pleased to see that you survived all that, Minario.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
043	When the tower fell, I really thought you were done for.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
044	Unfortunately for you, I'm not that easy to kill! My motorcycle was customized with the ability to fly, after all.
045	Well, it can't keep it up for very long, but...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
046	You serious?! What engineer did you find to add that kind of capability to a machine that small?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
047	Ah...
048	Icona!
049	Hey, lookee here! Minario, what happened? What's with your face?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
050	Don't you give me that! What did you do to my ride? You have no right to tinker with it!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0012
051	Oh, that?
052	Don't freak out. I just added a fun little trick to it! Isn't a flying motorcycle awesome? It can't fly for long, but...flying motorcycle, Minario!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
053	I managed to rig something up using magil in the Stone of the Gods.
054	I heard from witches of the Luxuria Belt it was possible, so I was just itching to try it!
055	That doesn't mean you can go and experiment on my motorbike!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0017
056	Hey, it's your fault for not taking the proper security measures to protect your valuables.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
057	Then again, I'd be able bypass whatever you set up... It's me, after all.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
058	Ugh, this girl!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0013
059	Simmer down. I'm sure it'll be useful someday, so try getting used to flying while you have the chance, okay?
060	Really, just how much of all this did she predict would happen?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0016
061	Minario?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
062	Ah. Um. It's nothing.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
063	Oh, you two are finally here! We've been waiting.
064	Nimul! How are the preparations on your side?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
065	We've completed the weapon to defeat the Cursed Beast.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
066	Nice. We just finished getting all the new equipment on the airship.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
067	The Cursed Beast Captivity Protocol, Valley of Siddim, that Icona used is one of the new functions we've got.
068	With it, there's no need to rush the Cursed Beasts with no safeguard!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
069	But that means a jump in the magil that the airship uses as a whole...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
070	Where are we getting the extra from?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
071	Well, I'll tell ya! If you're planning to use our magil to make up for the change, I'll mummify you in a flash!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
072	Well, that's why I'm wanted to have the Stone of the Gods...
073	Still... It's not perfect, but it's what we've got.
074	I see. So we've acquired new weaponry, but there is a limit to how much we can use it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
075	Exactly. We can't waste what we have.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
076	But that is far better than having nothing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
077	Hey Nimul, whaddya got there? Is that the weapon for dealing with the Cursed Beast?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
078	Yes, it is.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
079	It's a bow? Can anyone here even use a bow?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
080	Wait, Waginau, right? You look like the kind of person who knows how to do archery.
081	My apologies, but I have no skill to speak of in archery.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
082	Nimul. As you ordered, I've procured as many rations as I could.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
083	Good. That'll be a big help.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
084	Rations?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
085	Just before we were driven out of the Gula Belt Region, it was largely devoured by corruption.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
086	The Sephira possess the power of purification and can protect themselves from the corruption that fills the land, but...
087	Things are quite different when in comes to food. Sephira cannot consume anything that is corrupted.
088	According to my calculations, the reserves we took when we left the village will soon run out.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
089	In addition, I'd like to give these rations to the people who escaped to the desert.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
090	I see! That's a wonderful plan! You can't do anything on an empty stomach!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
091	Right. Though this will be a bit out of our way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
092	As chief of the Sephira people, I want to protect not only Emmel, but them as well.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
093	I can understand that, but who is supposed to use the bow?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
094	Regardless of how much food we've got, if we don't deal with the Cursed Beast then there's no point, right?
095	Yes. Well...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
096	There's someone I have in mind suited to wield this bow.
097	Her name is Eulalia.
098	She is a shrine maiden who guards the Forest of Suga. I've heard that she has a disposition comparable to Emmel.
