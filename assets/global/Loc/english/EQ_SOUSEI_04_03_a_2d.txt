001	Both the few Sephira that have come to try their luck in the forest and the people of Suga have been sheltering here.
002	The Great Nidhogg's divine protection still remains, so corruption can't come here so easily.
003	According to what I've heard, most of the Sephira are still in the desert.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
004	I see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
005	It's Lord Nimul! Such a famous personage, here among us?!
006	Lord Nimul! You're safe!
007	Warriors! I am glad that you're safe as well.
050	Yes! Everyone we left in the desert... I can't say they're perfectly safe, but they've avoided what might be a more perilous situation.
051	I see. I'm relieved...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
052	We've come bearing supplies from other regions. If possible, we'd like you to relay some to those taking refuge in the desert...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
053	R-really? We hadn't expected such a boon! Everyone will be so grateful!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0046
054	Everyone! Lord Nimul is very tired from his long journey. Please give him some space and allow him to rest.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
055	O-oh, right. We all got too excited...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
056	I'm sure that we'll have time to ask for more details later. For now we'll bring the good news of your return back to the villagers in the desert.
057	Please do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
058	Well then, Lord Nimul. This way.
059	Ahh! That was so exhausting!
060	I couldn't handle that much longer... I'm still young, but my back is killing me...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
061	You're just like always. Ever the sheep in wolf's clothing...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
062	I'm the priestess of Suga!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
063	It's expected that such a symbol acts a certain way to bring everyone together.
064	If I don't keep up the formality, people will start treating you like they always do because you're such a doofus.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0011
065	Hey...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
066	Really? But it seemed like everyone trusts in their illustrious Lord Nimul! Total leader vibes!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
067	Right now we're in quite trying times, but usually a visit from Lord Nimul elicits certain kinds of reactions.
068	Something like... "It's that good-for-nothing again," wasn't it?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0008
069	Ohhh... I kinda wanna see that...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
070	Please, cut it out. My reputation doesn't need any so-called help from you!
071	You're just as exhausting as ever, Eulalia...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
072	You've really gotta loosen up, Nimul! This is why it's so hard for people to like you, you know!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
008	...
009	What's wrong, Waginau?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
010	Nothing. Just confounded by the spectacle in front of me...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
011	The Eulalia I remember was extremely polite and obedient. The gold standard for a priestess, if you will. But now...
012	But now you've got this! It's fine, isn't it? She's fun!
013	I suppose... Yet I feel reluctant to take on another Mira...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
014	Hey! Whaddya mean by that?
015	Come to think of it, Nimul, weren't you traveling with Emmel? Where is she?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
016	Ah... I suppose I might as well start my story from there.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
017	Eulalia, please listen. We need your help to save Emmel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
018	I see... Emmel was taken by some horrible person. This is awful! We need to go help her right away!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
019	Rushing in with no plan is a death sentence.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
020	That man Zafeiris... He is extremely powerful. If we add that to the threat that Beelzebub poses...
021	We simply don't have the power to take them both on.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
022	Indeed. Facing a Cursed Beast is already a battle of life and death...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
023	But adding the variable of an enemy we know little about puts us at an even more severe disadvantage.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
024	First, we must seal the Cursed Beast.
025	If Beelzebub is forced back into dormancy, we could purify the corruption that has taken over this region.
026	If we manage that, then we might regain the advantage over an enemy like that who is powered by corruption.
027	That's why you need my help?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0045
028	It is.
029	Someone like you, whose strength is comparable to Emmel's, should be able to reawaken Sephiron. That should allow us to put the Cursed Beast to sleep once more.
030	What? We're not gonna beat it?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
031	Zafeiris seems to have an uncanny connection to that beast. Defeating Beelzebub outright invites the possibility that he will strike back at us for attacking it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
032	(And defeating it will force Emmel to have to seal it away. All to save this region from corruption...)
033	(For now, I just want to buy some time. Just enough time to find a way to truly destroy the Cursed Beasts...)
034	Nimul?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0005
035	Ah... it's nothing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
036	For now, our first step is doing something about the corruption of this region.
037	And you need me to awaken Sephiron to do that?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0044
038	Yes. Can I count on you to do it?
039	Of course.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
040	I never wanted Emmel to carry this burden alone!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
041	I shall perform the rites in place of the priestess of Sephiron!
042	All right then, let's—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
043	What's this?!
044	I'm sensing the magil of the Sinners?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
045	That's not all! My connection to Nyx just got cut off!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
046	An attack!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
047	Finding the hidden village of Suga was quite some effort...
048	But there is no escape for you anymore. All life in this region will fall to the sin of Gluttony...
049	That...is all that we desire of this world...
