001	Ugh! These wretched beasts! There's no end to them!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0019
002	We have to do something to neutralize the scent of the Purple Cacao...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
003	I think I may have just the thing!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
004	It's a new medicine I concocted just now in the carriage, and this seems like the perfect opportunity for a trial run. Here goes nothing!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_battle_0001
005	Aroog?	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0001
006	What? What's happening?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
007	I've been experimenting with different means of counteracting the Rainbow Cacao's effects since that girl first ran into us, and I'd say that was a rather successful proof of concept, wouldn't you?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
008	That's incredible, Lizzy! Your medicine completely canceled out the effects of the Purple Cacao!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0046
009	So, now that the ace up your sleeve has been removed from play, are you finally ready to give up, you miscreant?! Hand over the Rainbow Cacao!
010	I'm afraid can't do that. If I do, the other court mages will know what I've done!
011	Um, I'm pretty sure they're going to find out, regardless...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0039
012	But I should be able to get away with it, as long as there's no evidence!
013	This Rainbow Cacao is as good as worthless if that medicine has neutralized all its effects. So I might as well just throw it all away!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
014	...!
015	She actually dumped it! What a recklessly catastrophic thing to do—particularly for a witch!
016	Don't worry; I've got this!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0009
017	Caris?!
018	Caris, wait! That's a cliff edge over there!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
019	Don't worry about it! There's no road my bike can't handle!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0004
020	And...gotcha!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0004
021	She actually caught the bag?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
022	Caris! Are you okay?!
023	Of course I am! And so's my bike, and the cacao. Everything is under control!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
024	It looks like I can even head back by way of the cliffside roads down here!
025	Thank goodness you're safe, but why would you even attempt something so absolutely foolish?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
026	I just wanted to help! Simple as that.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
027	There's this one passionate merchant I know who really wants to make sure everyone can always get the things they need, you see. And she needed a hand, so I gave it.
028	Caris...
029	That shouldn't have even been possible! This is absurd...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0020
030	So, yeah! We took down the operations at the black market and captured the head of the whole scheme! Not bad, eh?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
031	Indeed, you've done a remarkable thing here. We're deeply indebted to you.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
032	It's hard to fathom the lengths some people will go to for Rainbow Cacao. We really must tighten our grip on it even further, so no such incidences ever occur again. Do you not agree?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
033	I think we may have to, since so many have been hurt by it—be it directly or in.
034	If I may interject, I really don't think making the distribution laws stricter will actually help solve anything.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
035	And what makes you say that?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
036	Well, there are a lot of people who need Rainbow Cacao for one reason or another.
037	They need it so badly, in fact, that they're willing to pay any price and risk buying it from illicit sellers. No matter the restrictions, this will continue happening.
038	It very well may, but the fact remains that Rainbow Cacao is extremely dangerous—Purple Cacao in particular, poisonous as it is.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
039	Oh, you don't have to worry about that anymore. I made some medicine that can fully neutralize the cacao's poison.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
040	What? You've concocted an antidote?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0026
041	If handled properly, Rainbow Cacao can be used to make all kinds of cosmetic goods, remedies, and topical creams. For example... Well, if you'll indulge me, may I see your hand? Here. This is good for the skin.
042	Oh, my! It doesn't feel greasy at all, and my skin looks so smooth and supple now. I feel...calmer, as well.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0045
043	W-wait, I want to try it, too! Can I have some on my hand?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0003
044	Sure! The effects of Blue and Purple Cacao work together quite harmoniously, no?
045	I've discovered that mixing Blue and Green Cacao creates an effective painkiller, as well.
046	I even took this rare opportunity to try mixing things like energy drinks through an infusion of pure Red Cacao!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
047	I had no idea Rainbow Cacao had so many potential uses...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0045
048	This is nothing! Lizzy can make tons more cool stuff with it, given the chance. Right, Lizzy?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
049	Easily. Rainbow Cacao is largely uncharted territory at present, so the potential remains for a whole world of possible combinations!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
050	See? I'm sure there are lots of people who could benefit from the cacao's effects in lots of ways. It could improve so many lives!
051	So I really want to see Rainbow Cacao made available to the general public, to ensure that those who need it can get their hands on it without having to put themselves at risk.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
052	...
053	For what it's worth, I think it's a good idea too. Legalizing it would instantly see a drastic reduction in the crimes and incidences you've all had to deal with because of it, if nothing else.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
054	I mean, all this drama only started after you tightened your grip on it, right?
055	Well... I suppose having an antidote that can neutralize its poison would all but eliminate the number of severe illnesses we've been seeing of late.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
056	It would be easier to manage and regulate its sale, too, if it were legal in some capacity. And we wouldn't have to devote so many of our resources to tracking down the underground markets.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
057	...
058	Realistically, we can't overturn all the distribution laws around it just like that. Great care must be taken in the handling of such dangerous magical materials, particularly due to its strong effects.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
059	However... I believe it is a process we should begin. You've made it clear to us that it's in everyone's best interests.
060	Oh! So, you'll do it, then?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
061	Once we figure out and stabilize a means of managing Rainbow Cacao, it should be possible to make it available for public use and consumption, yes.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
062	But in order to get things started, we will need to do more research on the antidote you created.
063	Of course! And if you can make something even more effective than what I came up with, I'd love to see the formula!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0037
064	Yay, we did it! And we couldn't have done it without your medicine, Lizzy. You're a real hero, you know that?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0009
065	When in the world did you even have time to make all of these things?!
066	Margaret asked me to while we were en route to corner the witch. She suggested I try creating some common household products like cosmetics using the bits of chocolate left behind in the peddler's carriage.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
067	It was Margaret's idea?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
068	Excuse you! You don't have to act so surprised, you know!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
069	No, no, I believe I do. You actually asked Elizabeth to do something for you!
070	What happened to, "Oh, no, I could never trouble Lizzy with anything"? Asking her to make something that's not even medicine, no less! That's monumental. Earth-shattering, even!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
071	Well, I guess when you put it that way, you're...not wrong. I really wouldn't ordinarily say anything that might bother Lizzy or cause her any trouble.
072	I just wanted to see Rainbow Cacao in the hands of the people so badly, it kind of overrode that instinct!
073	Huh. So when all is said and done, you're still a merchant at heart.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0045
074	That she is. And besides, it was no trouble for me at all! I loved working with the cacao.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
075	(And I loved that Margaret felt comfortable enough asking me to. It was indeed the first time she ever has, I suppose!)
076	I definitely want to try making more after the Rainbow Cacao is legalized, though!
077	I'll be counting on you for a good stock to work with, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
078	And I won't let you down! I'll gather up the highest quality Rainbow Cacao and deliver it right to you!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
079	Hey, all!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0002
080	Word is you had quite the time dealing with the black market problem! Glad to see you're okay, though. We finished our job as well.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
081	And now that our contract is finished, we were thinking of making some Valentine's Day chocolate and exchanging it with one another. Would you care to join us?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
082	Ooh, sure! That sounds like a lot of fun!
083	I'll make some chocolates with Lizzy and bring them over later!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
084	Great! We'll see you then!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
085	Uhh, just for the record, you're not allowed to bring any chocolates filled with weird medicine, okay?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
086	Suzuka! That's mean! There's nothing "weird" about Lizzy's medicine!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0012
087	Wow. Not even going to deny the possibility that Elizabeth might fill her chocolates with it?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
088	Of course not! And I wouldn't try to stop her if she did. I could never stand in the way of her dreams like that!
089	...
090	Hmm... You know, using Rainbow Cacao to make medicine is all well and good, but perhaps I'll spare some of it to try making chocolate instead, just this once.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
091	I have just the right amount with me, since they allowed me to keep some for medicinal research purposes.
092	And I should have a good recipe now for making chocolate with energy-boosting properties, so the opportunity is almost too good to pass up!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0010
093	Wow, that sounds awesome! Let's try making some right away. And while we're at it, let's fill some of them with medicine, too!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0024
094	That's a good idea. If we pad the recipe out with regular medicine, we'll be able to make a lot more chocolate overall.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
095	Uhh... Are you being serious right now?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
096	Oh, hey! There's another idea!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
097	Since Caris helped us out so much today, let's give her the honor of being the first person to try our chocolates after we make them!
098	...!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0027
099	That sounds like a lovely gesture! First, we can make some with—	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0009
100	H-hey, you know, I think I'm gonna go make chocolate with Suzuka and the others. Byee!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0027
101	Oh, she's gone. That's too bad.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
102	Ah, well. That's okay. Now I can be the first one to eat your chocolate!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
103	Really? I won't give you any medicine-filled ones, then. I promise.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
104	So, Lizzy, what kind of chocolates are you thinking of making? All comers are welcome, as far as I'm concerned!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_1030
105	I'll eat every last one, and I bet I'll be feeling super duper happy and energetic after I do!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
106	You have been the only one for me.<br>Happy Valentine’s Day with <br>lots of love!
