001	Soren! What are you doing?!
002	The forbidden art... How is a child like him able to wield it?
003	You- you have got to be kidding me. This must be some kind of trick!
004	Don't just stand there! Do something!
005	Ugh...!
006	...
007	Hey, hey, go easy kid!
008	I don't know what kind of powers you have, but stay the hell away from me!
009	Oh no, you don't. You are not flouncing out of here like nothing happened!
010	You've already got the children! What else do you want to do? Kill me?
011	I'd rather shoot myself than suffer at the hands of Alchemy!
012	Look, we're not going to kill you! Dang it... Soren, get a hold of yourself!
