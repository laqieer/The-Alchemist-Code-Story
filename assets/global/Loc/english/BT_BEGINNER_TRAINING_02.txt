001	My name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between Truth and the World, the Observer of Destiny.
002	I've heard the cries of your soul, wishing for the strength to fight.
003	If you so desire, I shall grant you the knowledge necessary to fight as an Alchemist of great ferocity!
004	Very well, then. Listen and learn.
005	I will now teach you about Magic and Elements. Magic skills that a Mage can acquire each have an associated Element.
006	Elements are comprised of Fire, Water, Thunder, Wind, Light, and Dark. They all have advantages and disadvantages in relation to each other.
007	For example, Fire beats Wind, but is weak against Water. Water beats Fire, but is weak against Thunder. Keep that in mind when facing enemies.
008	Light and Dark are effective against each other. Damage is increased in either direction, which you will need to be aware of in combat.
009	Another thing: Magic requires Cast Time before its effects take hold.
010	If an enemy is especially evasive, target that Unit and begin Casting. The Magic invoked will be keyed to that target.
011	Be warned, though, the area of effect for that magic will move along with the target. It is possible to catch your own units in the crossfire.
012	Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!
013	You see? The damage of a single skill can change depending on the Element of your enemy.
014	Even enemies difficult to defeat with Physical Attacks alone can be overcome if you understand Magic and Elements.
015	Things may become complex with the Elements of each Unit, Skill, and Enemy coming into play, but the logic remains the same.
016	Hehehe, I accept pudding as an expression of gratitude.
017	If you are ever in need of more wisdom, feel free to visit.
