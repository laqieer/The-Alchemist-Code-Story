002	W-what happened here... There are fallen trees everywhere. It looks like a hurricane hit this place...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0020
003	No, look... Claw marks. And it looks like some of these were slammed down too. Monsters did this. But...why?
004	Mer... It's not totally blocked off, but it's definitely in the way. Stand back a sec, Ravi. I'll take care of this.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
005	Wow... You moved those huge trees like they were sticks...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
006	Yeah, 'cause I'm a black and white bear. Grr!
007	Black and white bears sure are impressive creatures...
008	...Huh? Ravi, pipe down a sec. I can hear something.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
009	It sounds like...singing?
010	Numa numa, yay! Numa numa numa, yay!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0002
011	Growwwr!
012	...
013	...Well they're having fun.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
014	Yeah, no kidding. They're all singing and dancing around the tree...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
015	And look at all those snow sculptures… It's almost like these Rattys and wolves are having… a holiday party?
016	Oh no! They saw us!
017	Numa numa!?	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
018	This isn't good, Ravi. They look really upset. They think we're here to interfere with their party...	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0019
019	Huh!? Wait a sec! That's not why we're here at all! We just heard some noises and came to take a look…	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0026
020	NUMAAA!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
