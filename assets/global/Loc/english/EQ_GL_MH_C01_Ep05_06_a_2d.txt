001	*Whiirrr...* *Beep*
002	Looks like there's an entrance there.
003	The ruins here sure run deep. Think we should head in?
004	The Constructs seem unlikely to engage us as long as we do not interfere with whatever they've been directed to do.
005	But I would not dismiss the possibility that there may be armed guards waiting within.
006	After all, it's highly probable someone—our mysterious, magnanimous noble, most likely—is already one step ahead of us.
007	I'd say we've been pretty lucky, catching the Constructs mid-transportation. We might not get another chance like this again.
008	Yeah, you're right. Everyone, look sharp. We're going in.
009	Cold air permeates the hallway, a far cry from the humidity of the forest outside.
010	It's pretty chilly in here... Wonder what's up with that.
011	This place looks like a maze...
012	Hmm. There are a number of adjoining hallways to the entrance.
013	Without the guidance of the Constructs, I'm afraid we'll be heading in blind.
014	I wonder where they went. It's a little scary how quickly they've disappeared.
015	Mm... Ugh...
016	Soren? You don't look too well.
017	...!!!
018	Good work. Thank you for sending the results. I'll follow up later.
019	(That voice... sounds really familiar...)
020	Ah, (...), Sector 2A requires your attention. Something has interfered with the processes.
021	I'll be over in a minute.
022	The footsteps begin to recede somewhere to the left, followed by strange, mechanical ambient noises.
023	(I didn't quite catch the name, but... Sector 2A?)
024	Soren! Soren, can you hear me?
025	Huh? Uh... Yeah...
026	You were clutching your head, and then you zoned right out. We thought you were going to pass out again.
027	Well, my head doesn't hurt that much this time... I had a vision, though.
028	A vision?
029	I heard voices. One of them was really familiar, and there was mention of a certain "Sector 2A."
030	I don't know why, but I think I know where that is. Or maybe where it used to be.
031	Soren walks to the intersecting hallways and points down the left side.
032	I suppose my hypothesis about your amnesia is correct.
033	Yeah... But I'm a little afraid of my past. What if I was a terrible person?
034	I doubt it. You might have lost your memory, but I don't believe that would affect your personality very much.
035	A terrible person probably wouldn't care about animals or help kids in Slothstein sewers.
036	You'll be fine, kiddo. But you have to tell us if your head hurts again, alright?
037	I will.
038	We're probably being watched, so we should tread carefully.
039	Indeed. Let us proceed with caution.
