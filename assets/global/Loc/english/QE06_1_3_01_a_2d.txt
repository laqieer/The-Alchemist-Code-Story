001	Why?! Why did you let it get away?! We could have defeated the Demon Paragon here and now!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
002	Calm down, Amane.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
003	We wouldn't have been able to kill it.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
004	What do you mean? Were we not winning?
005	We were. We inflicted mortal wounds over and over again.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
006	And yet, we could not kill it.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
007	Huh...?
008	Weird, isn't it? It had nothing to do with toughness or vitality. It just can't be killed for some reason.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
009	I'm not sure I understand.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
010	Thinking in circles isn't going to solve this. We were exhausted, and so we were lucky it decided to leave.
011	It will come for the castle again. That's when we'll settle this.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
012	It also mentioned some very curious things. We will have a talk later, Celis.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
013	Yes, I suppose we will.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
014	We also need to discuss countermeasures for the Demon Paragon. If it is alive, then we can kill it. There must be a way.
015	For now, let us go back to base and reorganize. It is about time for a meal, anyway.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
016	But first, we'll need to dispose of the remaining enemy forces in the castle town. We can't allow any more people to get hurt.
017	Indeed.
018	Can't be...killed?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
019	That's impossible! I...!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0021
020	Azami.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
021	...
022	What's the matter, Amane?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
023	No, it's... It's nothing.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
024	...
025	Besides, it's the humans who tyrannically wielded their ideologies over us first.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
026	Captain Tanosuke. What exactly are demons?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
027	What are you saying all of a sudden?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
028	I always thought of demons as simple monsters that hungered for human flesh. But the Hidden Ogres and Demon Paragon were not at all like that.
029	They said it was for Wadatsumi's peace. I mean, of course I'm against letting demons take over this country, but...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
030	It said...that it was humans that wielded their ideologies against them first.
031	Amane.
032	Do they hate humans the same way Azami hates them?
033	Demons must be eradicated.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
034	But I... I don't know how to put this...
035	I know what you're trying to say, but there are no answers to the question on your mind.
036	You're not really good at thinking in the first place.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
037	But I'm serious about—!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
038	Let's go home. That's all we can do for now.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
039	I...suppose so.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
040	There is one among you who uses a strange art, am I correct?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
041	You were the one!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
042	...
043	What does it all mean?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
