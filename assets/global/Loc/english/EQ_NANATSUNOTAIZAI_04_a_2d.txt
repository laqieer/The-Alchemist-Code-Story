001	I think we're out of harm's way now.
002	Thank you, Olga.
003	...
004	Elizabeth...
005	We will fade into the shadows. If anything happens, we will be guided by your light.
006	Why do you have to make it so difficult to understand what you're trying to say?
007	...
008	Elizabeth, what are you feeling so down about?
009	Meliodas...
010	Hawk, is it a sign of weakness to believe?
011	You're not actually taking what he said seriously, are you?
012	Even in a different world, I will always believe in Meliodas.
013	But does that trust lose its power if we are not in our own world?
014	Don't be stupid. Even if the world around us has changed, everything else about us is the same, right?
015	I am me, Meliodas is still Meliodas, and you're still Elizabeth!
016	So let's go find something to eat!
017	...
018	(Meliodas... Where could you be right now?)
019	(No matter what world we're in, I always want to be at your side.)
020	(Meliodas...)
021	(I can't despair. I have to stay strong.)
022	Grrrrrrrr!
023	Ah!
024	Don't worry! We're here now!
025	Drawn here by your light, I shall once again swing my dark blade. The darkness within me tells me to do so.
026	Thank you so much, both of you!
