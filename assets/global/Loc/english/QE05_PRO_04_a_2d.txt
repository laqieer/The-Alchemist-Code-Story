001	Haa...haa... She's too fast! I can't hit her!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
002	You cannot defeat me. Quit while you can, little boy.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
003	Why you...! Freeze Over!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0006
004	You can't just insult people like that and not expect to be—huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0010
005	She's...gone?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
006	Why do you keep on fighting despite such a clear gap between our skills?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
007	Behind me?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
008	What is the reason you become so emotional for his sake? Is this Dias so important to you?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
009	He is!
010	...!
011	I am who I am thanks to Dias!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
012	Even if Dias never notices me, I want to be helpful to him!
013	What...? Who is this Dias to make you care for him so? What is so great about him?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
014	I've got you now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0002
015	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
016	A magic circle...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
017	It doesn't matter how fast you are if you walk into my trap! Now it's my turn!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0010
018	She foresaw that I would attack her from behind?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
019	I cannot afford to lose! I have to protect Saga now that Tina isn't here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
020	Icicle—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0008
021	Too slow.	VO_amane.amane_battle_0011
022	Wh-what is this?! Black ribbons?! Whoa, whoa, whoa!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
023	I did not expect you to set a trap at the same time as I was doing so. I'm impressed.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
024	Is this...Ouija?! No, it's different. What is this?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
025	This is an ancient art lost in time. There are few left alive who know of it.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
026	Urk...! Ugh, w-wait, what do you plan to do?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
027	Like I said, I have no intention of bringing harm to you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
028	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
029	I have something I must ask Dias Crowley. I only wanted to know what kind of person he is before meeting him.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
030	Dias...Crowley? Wait, I think we've had a misunderstanding.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
031	A misunderstanding?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
032	Right! The Dias I know is Dias Elysion!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
033	I'm so, so, so sorry! I had the wrong idea!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
034	That's right... He calls himself Dias Elysion now.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
035	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
036	When he was in Envylia, his name was Dias Crowley.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
037	Dias? In Envylia...? He never mentioned that.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
038	Besides, "Crowley"? Isn't that the name of the great sinner Zeke?
039	He was not a sinner!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
040	Eek!
041	Zeke Crowley was the successor to a noble bloodline, falsely charged with trumped-up accusations!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
042	What are you talking about?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
043	I've already said too much. This does not concern you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
044	B-But...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
045	Someone is coming. I do not want to involve anyone else in this. Excuse me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
046	W-wait! Could you at least untie me?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
047	Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
048	Yeah?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
049	After fighting you, I am now sure of this.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
050	Lisbeth Finn Lustburg, you are definitely more flat-chested than I am.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0008
051	E-excuse me?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
052	Train yourself diligently. Though I am not sure what you could do to improve your...condition.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
053	Wh-wh-wh-what?! I hate you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1015
054	What is her problem?! Has she never seen herself in a mirror?!
055	I just... I can't even!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1007
056	What are you wailing about?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
057	Can you believe it?! That girl was so rude! How can I not get worked up—huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
058	I was wondering why you hadn't returned home yet. I don't remember assigning you this sort of training.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
059	V-Voda! Can you unbind me from this—wait, be careful! That dangerous girl might still be around!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
060	Dangerous girl?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0025
061	I do not sense a hostile presence here.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
062	Really?! But she was just here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
063	Tsk, tsk. In any case, Tamis, Fuu, and Tehre should be arriving soon. Make sure you clean this place up before they arrive.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0017
064	Wha...? Wait! Voda?! Oh, come on!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
065	This is bad! The mob is about to reach the congressional plaza! Please, we need reinforcements!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
066	Be sensible! They're about to raid our headquarters! Our chain of command will collapse if we weaken our defenses here?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
067	Then...what should we do?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
068	It was unwise of them to declare their withdrawal from Saga so soon.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
069	It's clear the administration never expected the riots to grow to such an extent.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
070	Lord Dias! Lord Dias Elysion!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
071	Who's there?
072	P-please wait, Lord Dias!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
073	Well, well. I was just mulling over how I could express my gratitude for your help, since I could not find you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
074	Thanks to your assistance, I was able to complete my inquiry. Thank you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0034
075	Huh? W-wait, please! Where might you be going?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
076	Where? I do not understand the point of this question.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
077	Will you not save us? Will you not help subdue this rebellion?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
078	You expect me, a member of the Holy Guard, to help you? Why?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
079	Wh-why?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
080	The people have intensified their democratic efforts in the wake of the military's debilitation. I understand how the nobility like yourself would feel threatened.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
081	However, this is something you brought upon yourselves.
082	Wh-what?!
083	If I am not mistaken, this rebellion began the moment Gluttony Foss declared its withdrawal from Saga.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
084	Was it not the nobility that persuaded the people that it was necessary to take the fertile lands of Saga?
085	Have you heard of the phrase "you reap what you sow"?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
086	B-but...we—!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
087	Then again, the roots of the people's rage are from the perceived loss of the benefits that were to come from the conquest of Saga.
088	What this means is that both sides of this conflict are guilty of causing strife for the sake of their own greed.
089	You dare ask the honorable Holy Guard to wade into this mess?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
090	Urgh...! E-even so, please! Without your help, we're doomed!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0019
091	You may, of course, endure being shamed publicly for your lack of grace and request the Holy Guard to mobilize.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
092	But for this, you will have to negotiate directly with our headquarters in Northern Pride.
093	P-please! Wait, no! Nooo!!!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
094	What a waste of my time. Even Gluttony Foss does not know the location of the Sacred Stone, Satna.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
095	Though that one account of the hidden tribe that holds the secrets of the Sacred Stones' origin was quite the interesting read. It may be worth investigating further.
096	This Sacred Stone must have guided me to Gluttony Foss for a reason.
097	Asmodeus, do you wish for me to contact this desert tribe?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
098	Dias Elysion... No, I mean...Dias Crowley?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
099	Who...?!
100	You know my old name. Who are you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
101	There is no need to be on guard. I only wish to ask you a few questions.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
102	Some questions?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
103	The man you once called brother, Logi Crowley... Where is he?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
104	What?!
105	Do the Corpse know where the Mikaboshi has gone?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
106	You?!
107	You even know the Corpse exists.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
108	You know too much. Clearly, you have delved too deeply into our secrets... This is the end of the line for you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
109	I would rather avoid unnecessary combat, but...fine. This will save me precious time!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
