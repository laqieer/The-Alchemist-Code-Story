001	I was different, too. According to some, I was out of my mind.
002	On your feet!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
003	Northern Pride (Reminiscence of a Memory)
004	Geez! I can stand by myself, officer. No need to fuss over me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
005	Othima, you lack the awareness befitting a knight. Do you ever consider the consequences of your own actions?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
006	During the previous mission, you completely ignored the agreed-upon strategy, and as a result our ranks fell apart. Normally, you would be disciplined for such misconduct.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
007	I'd argue that an ambush was the right choice. I just looked at the situation and adapted accordingly.
008	There's no need to get so hung up on a plan, is there? Why shouldn't we avoid unnecessary losses where we can?
009	Knights of the Holy Guard are supposed to fight fair.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
010	So that's why you punished me with combat drills instead of sticking me up in front of the committee, huh? Well, this has been great, but I—	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0016
011	You're not done yet. One more round!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
012	No, thanks. Unless you're planning on paying me overtime?
013	A true paladin isn't motivated by financial gain.
014	Ugh. Spare me your idealism.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
015	These are the noble principles passed down through generations of—!
016	Sheesh. And you believe in that stuff? You're way out of your mind.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
017	Now listen here! We wield our blades in service to this world, to achieve peace!
018	Cool.
019	Othima... Do me a favor and take a look around you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
020	Around me? What, here?
021	Amidst all these people who are ceaselessly fighting for justice, you are the only one who—	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
022	Quick question.
023	What?
024	Sure, I could work all day, but if my inner equilibrium starts to crumble, who's going to pick up the pieces? You ever think about that?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
025	...
026	What sort of justice would that be, huh? Who's that gonna save?
027	Everyone—the world.
028	Well, why don't you start with the people right in front of you?
029	Excuse me?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
030	You haven't given a single one of my strategies a shot.
031	But what would a rookie like me know, right? Guess I shouldn't have bothered with all those late-night strategy sessions, huh?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
032	I was different, too. According to some, I was out of my mind.
033	I wanted to become a light that would illuminate this world, right down to its darkest corners. But a vague goal like that wasn't getting me anywhere.
034	I think, at some point, I lost sight of where I was, and where I wanted to be.
035	"Be sure to praise your subordinates."	VO_zain.zain_sys_0045
036	Northern Pride: Archives (Reminiscence of a Memory)
037	"Try to be as specific as possible when you deliver praise. For this, a compliment sandwich can be very effective. First, praise your subordinate, then explain where they can improve, and, finally, follow up with another compliment."
038	Hmm... This book is very informative. I should make some notes.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
039	Shh!
040	"Make sure you listen to your subordinates. Be attentive and empathetic. Never interrupt them, or reject their side of the story without listening to it first." Whoops... I'm guilty of that one.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
041	Excuse me, could you please be quiet while you're in the archives? This is meant to be—	VO_shion.shion_sys_0003
042	I'd better write this down, too.
043	Could you please—?
044	"Is there light within you?" Y-yes! This book really speaks to me. I've got to write that down—this is excellent material.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0024
045	Would you please keep it d—	VO_shion.shion_sys_0001
046	"The light within our hearts is our greatest treasure. Cultivate your light, for the brighter it becomes, the more fulfilling your life will be. Many brilliant and glorious days with your peers await you..."
047	This is literary gold!
048	What is with this guy?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
049	"A warm smile is most effective when dealing with those who are reluctant to open their hearts or speak their minds."
050	A smile? I should practice. Teeth, or no teeth?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0031
051	Bam!	VO_shion.shion_battle_0001
052	And... smile!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
053	How's this guy still smiling after getting a book thrown at him?! I don't even think he noticed!	VO_shion.shion_sys_0025
054	Aha! It answers my question here: "Lift the corners of your lips and show your teeth. Remember to always make eye contact when you smile." I guess it's more like this, then?
055	Have another!	VO_shion.shion_battle_0004
056	This feels right... Cheese!
057	How many books do I have to hit him with before he notices me?! It's like he's made of stone!	VO_shion.shion_sys_0042
058	I should write this down, too.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
059	...
060	Aaaahhh! Where did you come from?!
061	Shh!
062	O-oh! Right. Sorry, I'll try to keep it down.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0018
063	...
064	Did you need something, sir?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0006
065	I... Ahem. Nothing.
066	Surely you've seen your fair share of serving girls, noble paladin? You should have no reason to stare.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0044
067	M-my apologies. It's just... I didn't realize the archives even had a caretaker—and I don't believe we've met.
068	Come to think of it, why did you bother coming all the way out here?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
069	Whatever it is you're looking for, you'd have a much better selection in the knight-appointed Grand Library, I'm sure.
070	I-I wanted to be alone... away from prying eyes. This place is nice and quiet, and—	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
071	In other words, you figured you'd be alone because there's nothing here but old books no one has a use for anymore.
072	And because nobody in their right mind would come to this moldy old broom closet when they have a much nicer option. Does that sound about right?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0031
073	I-I, um... Yes.
074	And I'm sure it wouldn't have mattered to you if a lone archivist saw what you were doing. In your mind, you were as good as alone.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0045
075	L-look, let me help you tidy up these—
076	That won't be necessary.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0039
077	But—
078	We can't have you getting your fancy clothes all dirty.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0015
079	It's my fault they're all over the place.
080	I couldn't possibly burden our future Lord Commander with such a trifle.
081	But you're happy to throw books at my head?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
082	That's your fault, for being so grating on the ears.
083	I'm sorry?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
084	It wasn't a great first meeting.
085	All your muttering. It was painful to listen to.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0013
086	Do you remember it as well as I do?
087	Ahem. That was rude of me. Begging your pardon, sir.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0003
088	You were always so full of resentment; quietly smoldering away in that dimly lit place.
089	Seeing that, I found myself wishing...
090	What's your name?
091	That I could find a way to shine some light upon the darkness that surrounded you.
092	Why are you asking?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0006
093	How did you come to be here?
094	Why do you want to know?
095	Are you going to answer every question I ask with another question?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
096	Do you interrogate everyone you meet like this?
097	I-I'm sorry?
098	Are you going to ask if there's light within me next?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0031
099	I-I...
100	Books can't tell you everything, you know. Besides, you don't really care.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0010
101	You showed me just how poor I was at conveying my own feelings.
102	It's all nonsense, anyway. Light like that doesn't exist.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
103	You helped me realize how passive I was being, failing even to light my own darkness.
104	Hello, Lord Commander-To-Be. What are you doing in a place like this?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
105	Greetings, Vice-Captain Kaya.
106	There's no need for that. That title doesn't feel like me at all... Though I can't say I hate it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
107	What are you doing here?
108	I believe I just asked you the same question. I've got some research to do, if you must know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
109	Hm?
110	...
111	Ohh... I see.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
112	What?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
113	Well, well, well.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
114	What?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
115	Could you do me a little favor?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
116	What's this?
117	My resignation.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
118	I was jealous of Kaya, for being so capable of honestly expressing her feelings. That's why I was always lost for words when it came to changing her mind.
119	Deliver it for me, will you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0041
120	...
121	I didn't want anyone to notice my shortcomings. So I put up a bold facade in front of my subordinates, and took great pains to look good in front of my peers. It was all born of vanity—envy...
122	These burdens were so heavy, I couldn't cope alone. You were the only one I could turn to.
123	Huh? You're asking me?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0012
124	I... suppose I am.
125	Your worries are way too abstract. I don't see how I'm supposed to be any help.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0031
126	You're one greedy guy, you know that? Trying to get others to explain things you don't even understand yourself...
127	G-greedy?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
128	You come at me with no specifics, no ideas of your own, no consideration. I don't believe for a moment that you're even the least bit motivated to figure this out.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0005
129	And to top it all off, you're turning to a lowly serving girl for aid? That's not just pathetic, it's ridiculous! Do you do all your consulting with the help? Who do you turn to for financial advice—the kitchen staff?
130	Do you talk to your plants, too? Let me guess—this is all just a little game to make you feel superior to me, isn't it? Well, if it is, go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back—you've done it!
131	I mean, it has to be a joke—though it's not a very funny one. You don't know the first thing about me, yet you're trying to "light up my life"? Give me a break!
132	I didn't meant to—	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
133	It's bad enough that you don't even seem to realize how presumptuous your way of thinking is.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0010
134	Wh-what do you mean?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
135	Do you really think that chasing off the darkness is enough to save people?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0006
136	I'm sure wanting to light up the world is a very noble mission, but who are you doing it for? What areas will you target? And how do you plan on going about any of it?
137	You can't answer any of those questions, yet you still go around spouting your intentions like you've got it all figured out. It's the very height of arrogance!
138	Arrogance...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
139	If you're offended by my words, or feel that I am out of line, then go ahead and punish me—but I won't take back anything I've said.
140	Because whatever you may think, it's reckless to go on about lighting up the world when you don't know the first thing about it!
141	Besides... it's not like it's possible, anyway. Not everyone can bask in your saving light.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0020
142	I...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
143	Forget about it. I'm leaving.
144	Your name.
145	What?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0025
146	You still haven't told me your name.
147	Why do want to know so badly?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0003
148	I want to call you by name.
149	Excuse me?
150	I just... really want to know. I want to understand you.
151	You're so simple-minded...	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
152	Hm... I suppose I have been a bit presumptuous.
153	A bit?
154	And... smile!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
155	Wh-what are you grinning at me like that for?!
156	"A warm smile is most effective when dealing with those who are reluctant to open their hearts or speak their minds." I... read that in a book.
157	Hah.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0010
158	"Lift the corners of your lips and show your teeth. Remember to always make eye contact when you smile." It's in my notes.
159	Haha. You're such a weirdo.
160	P-perhaps... but it worked.
161	What?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0012
162	It got you to talk to me.
163	...
164	Gosh, you're annoying to listen to.
165	I...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
166	You called me greedy. Presumptuous. Arrogant. Reckless.
167	You're giving me a headache.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0020
168	And you were right.
169	Oh? Is this my farewell party?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
170	Northern Pride (Reminiscence of a Memory)
171	No.
172	What? Didn't you deliver my resignation letter?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
173	The Lord Commander rejected it.
174	Darn.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
175	Don't lose hope, Kaya. Just hang in there a little longer.
176	Hm? What do you mean?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0004
177	When I become Lord Commander, I'll create an environment where you'll be free to quit anytime you want.
178	Oh?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
179	I'll perfect the Holy Guard to the point that even the Church's top brass will accept your resignation without question.
180	Hmhm. I see.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
181	Already planning how we're going to abuse our authority, are we?
182	I'm going to bring light to the people of this world, one at a time.
183	Uh-oh. Somebody doesn't know how to keep their public and private affairs separate.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
184	Of course, my topmost priority will always be achieving peace for the continent.
185	Sounds exhausting. Are you sure you can handle all of that?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
186	You'll see. As Lord Commander, I will author a new chapter in the history of Babel. In fact... perhaps you would consider remaining with us, for a front-row seat by my side from which to observe it all?
187	Ahahaha!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
188	Dang, that was smooth!
189	Interesting... But I have my doubts. Prove to me that you have what it takes.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
190	A bout, then.
191	I thought knights of the Holy Guard weren't supposed to fight among themselves.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0014
192	Consider it a part of your training.
193	Hmhm... Oh, you big, chivalrous fool...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
194	Othima?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
195	Yeah, yeah. I'm in.
196	Two against one? Really, now?
197	It's the Lord Commander's prerogative to utilize his subordinates.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
198	Pfft. Coward.
199	Ngh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
200	There'll be no holding back, then. For either of us.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0037
201	Yikes. Is it too late to run?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
202	No time like the present. Let's get this sparring match underway, then.
203	Ready, Othima?
204	Nope. How about I quit, instead?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
205	Kaya is exceptional in all she does, it is true.
206	I'm getting closer and closer to drawing up my own letter of resignation here.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
207	If Kaya remains with the Holy Guard, all of our workloads will be lessened significantly.
208	Including yours and mine.
209	Will I be able to take a vacation?
210	Oh, yes. Plenty.
211	Okay, then I'm back on board!
212	Since when did you become such a skillful manipulator?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
213	Since I got serious about becoming Lord Commander. I've been working on myself—is it paying off?
214	Perhaps. It's too early to tell—more observation required.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0037
215	And... smile!
