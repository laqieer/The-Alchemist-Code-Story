001	...!!! You...!!! How dare you attempt to defy my magic...with your abominable power!!!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0025
002	This power isn't abominable! Alchemy has helped a lot of people until now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
003	However, it will now save me! That power will kill me and remove me from my throne!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
004	No matter how eloquently you arrange it, Alchemy is nothing more than a harmful power!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0017
005	I will save you too!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
006	I came this far with the desire to have everyone in this country laugh and live together!
007	You want to save everyone? That's nothing more than a fantasy.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0026
008	To save someone means to abandon another.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
009	A queen understands that deeper than anyone. When someone with unrealistic expectations gains an incredible power...it guarantees the country will perish!
010	Wh-what?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
011	The vermin have ascended this high up?! They're going to freeze!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
012	More...insects, I need more of you!!!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0015
013	The vermin were all being manipulated by you...just like Salomo was!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
014	Don't get the insects involved!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
