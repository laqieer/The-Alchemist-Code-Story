001	Wooow! It's so beautiful!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
002	Whoa...it's a lake! And it's frozen solid! It's not that often you see something like this in the forest.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0024
003	I think we have no choice but to walk over it. It looks strong enough, but it we fall really hard...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
004	Wi...will it crack?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
005	Then let's slide! Like this...yeah!	VO_alma.alma_chara_1011
006	Whohoooo! See, you try it too, Liz? It's fun!
007	Wow! Look at Alma go! Skate, girl, skate!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0009
008	Well, Alma has incredibly good balance. Still, I'm amazed she can skate so well with just her boots...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
009	Me-me too...eeek!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0002
010	Th-thanks! If I'd fallen on my bottom...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
011	You would've fallen into the water and frozen to death! Here, hold my hand. Let's go slowly, okay?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
012	Ohh...Thanks a lot, Rebecca.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
013	Ohh...this is scary...but, I don't know why, Rebecca...looking at your face makes me feel less anxious.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
014	If you worry too much about falling, your feet will get tangled and you'll fall anyway. Just keep your head up.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
015	Okay...sorry, Rebecca. I've really been a third wheel for you today.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0035
016	Honestly. I can't even leave you alone for a minute...I've never met someone who evokes my sympathy as much as you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
017	You make me act without thinking about whether my actions benefit myself or not.
018	Acting without thinking about whether it benefits you or not...maybe that's the kind of feelings men carry where they marry at the risk of becoming an insect.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
019	You might be right. People seem to act on affection and love even before they have a chance to rationally think about it.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
020	Maybe you can end up falling in love even before you're conscious about it...not that it's something we've experienced yet.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
021	Huh? But, if that's the case, then Rebecca, do you have feelings for me...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
022	...! I-I was just, well...hey, Alma! What're you doing?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
023	Wheeee! Wheee! And then...twirrrl!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
024	Wha?! Did she just spin around four times and a half?! No fair. I'm so jealous.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
025	Um, Liz? If you want to skate that badly, well...I can teach you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
026	Huh? Really?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
027	Alma's too intelligent for her own good. Her teaching methods are too abstract. It was like that before...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
028	What do you mean?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
029	When we practiced with the Broom Ace. You fell a lot like you are now.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
030	Ah...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
031	When you have a painful look on your face, it hurts me as well, so I'll try my best to help you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
032	...Thanks!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
033	All right then, first, your center of gravity...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
034	Heheh. Just as I thought, the competitive Liz and the nurturing Rebecca...of course they're compatible.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
035	If I show off like this, the two of them try to practice.
036	It's still a little awkward, but the two of them are getting along well.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
037	There can be love between friends too. There's nothing wrong with more love. It makes everything much more fun!
