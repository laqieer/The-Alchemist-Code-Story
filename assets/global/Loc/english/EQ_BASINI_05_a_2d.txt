001	I'm afraid your flight ends here, Lord Commander.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_1016
002	So you've come, Lord Waginau.
003	To think you would manage to defeat Irene! I confess, I underestimated your capabilities.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
004	What have you done with her?
005	You of all people should know what happens to Corpse operatives who fail to complete critical missions.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
006	What are you trying to accomplish, that the life of one of your most loyal followers is worth so little?
007	Nothing I'm prepared to divulge to a Lord Commander who abandons his duty.
008	You have abandoned the Holy Guard and stolen Excalibur. As a member of the Holy Order, I cannot allow such crimes to go unpunished.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
009	Why are you so fixated on Excalibur?
010	The future of the world depends on it. Its light must be entrusted to a more suitable Lord Commander than you.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
011	Things are as I thought, then. As long as I elude you, you cannot advance your plans.
012	Well, you will not elude me any longer.
013	Not so fast!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
014	You think to resist me with such a pitiful display of the power of darkness?
015	Urgh...	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
016	I admit, the strength of the Holy Guard exceeded my estimations during the Lion Monarch's Charge.
017	However, it was only your vaunted 'bonds' that made that possible. Now that you are alone, you have no greater strength to call upon.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
018	What is it...you really want...?
019	I have pursued my purpose for eons untold. We could wait for eons more, and you would never understand...for I am darkness itself.
020	We are the light that guides the world...but you lay beyond the reach of light. Is that what you are saying?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
021	It is indeed.
022	Then, if the light cannot guide my way...	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
023	I will gladly plunge into darkness.
024	So this is that 'resolve' you keep raving about. What a pity that it won't change how this will end.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
025	Won't it? I've seen more times than I can count just what resolve is capable of.
026	I cannot defeat you, but I can ensure Excalibur stays beyond your reach...and that's just what I intend to do.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
027	In our friends' names, the three of us swore to protect this world! To honor my vow, I will embrace any darkness!
028	If you imagine I'll hand you the catalyst for Nimul's reincarnation, you are gravely mistaken!
029	Nimul's—?	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
030	Not quite right, but not far off, I take it. Well, that's all I needed to know.
031	Urgh!
032	Your arrogance got the better of you, Lord Commander. At last, Excalibur is mine.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
033	Not yet.
034	That voice...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
035	Irene. What an unexpected pleasure.
036	So, you dealt with the men I sent after you. I should have expected my favorite servant would be tenacious.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
037	I don't serve you anymore.
038	It is my own resolve that has brought me here.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0004
039	Irene!
040	I thought you held human resolve in contempt. Now you're so desperate to show it that you'd leave Corpse?	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
041	I still believe that Corpse has defended the order of the world...but now I realize that there is another way.
042	And that is resolve?
043	I don't know...but I want to find out.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
044	Irene...
045	Basheeny. In the name of preserving order, I will fight by your side.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
046	Thank you, Irene!
047	You do insist on making a nuisance of yourself, don't you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
048	Protecting the order of the world is my raison d'etre, no matter whom I serve.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
049	And anyone who threatens it does so at their peril, no matter who they are.
050	You would ally with your own would-be assassin, former Lord Commander?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_1016
051	Irene's past doesn't matter to me. I may never shine bright enough to illuminate the world...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
052	But I am still the symbol of absolute justice. I know my duty is to defend order, and I know who threatens it.
053	So that is your resolve, then.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
054	I want to understand it better. For my own sake, for the sake of order, and for the sake of world peace.
055	Two creatures of darkness are no threat to me.
056	Ugh!	VO_irene.irene_battle_0019
057	Irene!
058	Foolish. Do you have time to be worrying about her?
059	No! You will never take Excalibur!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
060	Your own fixation on this sword blinds you to your surroundings.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
061	Wha—?!
062	Basheeny!
063	Nrrghh!	VO_irene.irene_battle_0025
064	Irene... Why...?
065	Basheeny... Excalibur... You're both safe... I'm...glad...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
066	My, what an uncharacteristically noble sacrifice. Although now that I think about it, you don't feel pain, do you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
067	No... This pain I feel. But I can bear it.
068	Excuse me?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
069	I must protect Basheeny...even if it costs me my life. For the sake of order...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
070	And...I don't want...to see him hurt...
071	If he says...human resolve can defend order...then I'll believe him... He's stronger than me, after all...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0031
072	Irene...
073	Is this...what compassion feels like? What a strange thing...resolve is...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0008
074	Excalibur... It's glowing?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
075	Of course... The power of compassion sealed within...during the ritual of succession...has been awakened by your kindness...
076	I feel strength flowing into me from Excalibur... So this is the power of compassion!
077	...It cannot be. Compassion between wielders of the power of darkness cannot possibly awaken Excalibur.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
078	So that I might defend the order of this world... Excalibur, grant me your light!
079	Do you truly believe this will be enough to stop me?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
080	I will stop you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
081	As many times as it takes...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
082	To keep this world in balance.
