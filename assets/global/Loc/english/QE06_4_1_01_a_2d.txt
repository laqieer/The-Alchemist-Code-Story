001	A way to restore Sumeragi?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0012
002	Yes. The broken sword is currently kept in Castle Aquila Rubrum.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
003	But it is tightly secured with layers of protective wards. There wouldn't be such rigorous security unless it were feared someone may one day succeed in restoring it.
004	...!
005	Is there not some lore about Sumeragi that has been passed down amongst the Black Star clan?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
006	I think I may have heard something. But...could it really be true?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
007	So there is a way, then?
008	It seems hard to believe, but based on what we learned from Lady Celis and the legends passed down through the Black Star Clan...
009	I believe another demon's horn may exist.
010	That's it!
011	You must find it, Jubei.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0041
012	The issue is, I cannot say with any certainty that it will be able to restore Sumeragi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
013	Why not?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
014	I have some concerns regarding the horn, based upon the Black Star Clan legends and Mikaboshi's memories.
015	I believe it may be Tamba's horn.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
016	What?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
017	Even if we find it, we don't know what effect making use of its power might have on Tamba.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0035
018	It may do nothing but strengthen our enemy. We must proceed with caution.
019	If it truly is Tamba's horn, I would like to believe his deepest intentions have not faltered.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
020	His intentions?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0006
021	The Tamba I saw within Mikaboshi's memories initially held a great hatred toward humans. However...
022	By coming to understand Koga and Kaede's points of view, he overcame that hatred and desired instead to cooperate with the humans. It was only later that Malice once again warped his perspective.
023	Tamba, at his truest, does not wish for humanity's destruction.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
024	He simply wanted to protect that short-lived time of peace... That's what I believe, anyway.
025	We can't risk making things worse, however, out of little more than hope and belief.	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
026	Which is why we must act now.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0006
027	Amane...
028	It won't be long before the Discarnate Power, Tamba, and Judius begin purging Wadatsumi of humans.
029	If we don't move quickly, we'll lose our only chance for a counteroffensive. So I'll go, and recover Mikaboshi.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
030	And I'll bring Logi Crowley back with me as well. That's why I need to rely on you, Jubei.
031	We must restore Sumeragi and return peace to Wadatsumi!
032	...!
033	(It is just as Amane said. We must save Wadatsumi from the demons.)
034	(It may be a foolish wager, but we must make it all the same.)
035	So it really was true!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0022
036	It shouldn't be possible, but here it is. Another demon's horn.
037	To whomever this belonged, my apologies, but I'll be borrowing this horn. Please lend me your strength.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0035
038	Let us bring peace to Wadatsumi once more!
039	Eek! Y-you're one of the Blade Fox Corps!
040	...
041	Welcome back. How did it go?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
042	I destroyed a village, just like you said to.
043	You rather took your time, however, didn't you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
044	...
045	Those who remain will be powerless. They will be exterminated sooner or later. Don't you think you should commit yourself to the desolation already?
046	...
047	...!
048	You dare to hesitate, still?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
049	Of course not! I just...
050	Huh?! What was that?
051	What is it?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
052	...
053	(The Discarnate Power failed to sense anything? Then what could I be feeling?)
054	(It's like a part of me has been awakened somewhere. This feeling, it's...)
055	If you're so concerned, why don't you go see what it was for yourself?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
056	You...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0002
057	Of course, if you're hesitant to confront whatever it might be, you could always just give me back my body.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
058	I do not hesitate.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
059	Then why am I able to talk to you right now?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
060	...
061	What is it you want? Do you want to exterminate them?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
062	Or do you want to protect them?
063	Shut up! You don't understand anything!
064	I rather think I do. I've seen some of the memories you keep inside you. Besides...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
065	I'm a demon too, remember.
066	Then you should understand that as a demon, I must do this.
067	Is that really how you feel? Or is that how someone else expects you to feel?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
068	...
069	You, of all people, should know the high price of leaving an opening.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0015
070	Shut up! Don't pretend like you know what you're talking about!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
071	...
072	(Tamba's will has faltered. Is this my chance?)	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
073	(No, this is something different. I must wait for his will to be completely gone, leaving his body as nothing but a shell.)
074	(If that body is able to host Tamba's will, then it would surely be a suitable vessel for the Demon King as well.)
075	(I must not act impetuously.)	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
076	...
077	Excuse me.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0036
078	What are you doing here? I was not informed you would be visiting.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
079	I come with urgent business. I believe you'll want to hear it.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0016
080	I find it difficult to believe that something so urgent could happen in Wadatsumi as it is now.
081	What if I told you the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi was taken from Greed Dike?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
082	?!	タンバ・神鬼
083	The Sacred Three of Wadatsumi: the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi, the Treasure Blade Sumeragi, and of course, the sacred art of Kagutsuchi...
084	Sumeragi is broken, and it's said the art of Kagutsuchi has been lost, so it's unlikely we'll need to worry about either of them...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
085	But if Mikaboshi were to be returned to Wadatsumi soil, it would become another variable we'd be forced to deal with.
086	It seemed best to inform you of this development.
087	And just why would Mikaboshi be returned to Wadatsumi soil?
088	Oh, I suspect you know. And I think you also know who might orchestrate such a maneuver.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
089	...
090	Mm. Another variable to take into account, indeed.
091	One can never be too careful, no? No matter how insignificant the problem may seem. At any rate, that is all I came to report.
092	So, you expect us to deal with the situation while you watch on from the sidelines, is that it?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
093	I said nothing about dealing with this. I simply inferred that you should take note, and take heed.
094	Semantic nonsense. It's the same thing.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
095	Not at all! Allowing an unknown variable to exist makes our plan less likely to succeed. Therefore, it seemed only wise to keep you abreast of the situation, thus making the variable known.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0016
096	...
097	I'll take care of it. It's no problem.
098	Ah, a sensible response. I'm glad someone here was able to provide one. All is for Wadatsumi!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
099	You'd see us exterminated in one go if you could. But I assure you, things will not progress as you expect them to.
100	We will have the last laugh!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
