001	Tch! Who would have thought I'd be halted like this?!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0021
002	It is because you never accepted my modifications when you were alive that you have been defeated now as a Phantom.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0022
003	Heheh. Looks like you're pretty adept at modding things. Still not gonna let you lay a hand on my bike, though.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
004	Besides, we were lighter.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0010
005	Lighter, eh? I guess my motorcycle's pretty heavy, but still...	VO_charis.charis_sys_0005
006	Isn't her mech gear heavy, too? It doesn't look that much lighter than my bike.
007	I think he's talking about our weight.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
008	Wha—?!
009	Hey! What do you mean by that?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0012
010	You trying to say I'm heavy?! I can shed a few bullets worth of weight, if that's what you mean!
011	Calm down! Stop shooting at me! Nobody's saying you're fat! You just have some bigger...parts than she does!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0026
012	What...? Did you just...? That's sexual harassment!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0013
013	Your cannon was what was really weighing us down, you great big lug!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0016
014	What?! You have something to say about my baby girl?!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
015	Are you forgetting that you were only able to go so fast because me and my girl were blowing all the obstacles out of the way for you?!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0010
016	I could have finished the race in five seconds had I not been weighed down by your cannon!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0017
017	Daisy, might we not cross the finish line already?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
018	Oh, yeah! Sure!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
019	Team Mech Gear pushes past the quarreling Blonde Sloths and finishes first!
020	We did it!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0034
021	Not bad, little savage.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0006
022	We're done here, right? May I take my leave?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
023	I must retrieve that loincloth, lest it get blown away by the wind.
024	You're...really going back for it?
025	Congratulations, Daisy!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
026	Thanks, Teona!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
027	This proves that I can be number one, right?! Leema will take me back, right?!
028	So... You think you're number one, do you?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
029	Teona?
030	Heheheh...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
031	Daisy... You're not number one yet.
032	No way!
033	You've grown considerably since fighting those monsters yesterday.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
034	You can now expertly handle your mech gear in battle, even with all the upgrades Reagan applied to it.
035	However, you mustn't forget that in this arena stands the Arena Champion herself! That's right... You cannot be number one without first defeating me!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
036	What?!
037	Now, Daisy! Show me your real strength!
