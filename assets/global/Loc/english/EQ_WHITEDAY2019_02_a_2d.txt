001	Tch! You'll regret this!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
002	I already do. I regret that I wasted my energy against a bunch of weaklings, that is.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0008
003	Hey, you. Yeah, you! I have a bone to pick with you. Did you even listen to a word your brother said?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0002
004	Huh?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
005	He told you to take it easy, because you're not used to being a Phantom yet, and he doesn't want you getting yourself into any trouble.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
006	So what? There was no way I was gonna lose to a bunch of cowards like those idiots. I'm strong enough to keep myself out of trouble, and I could've taken them on without your help.
007	Can't argue with you there. You're talented, I'll give you that. Just what I'd expect from Fraise's little brother.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
008	Tch. Cut that out, will you? I'm way stronger than my brother, because I'm not wrapped up in all that sentimental crap.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0012
009	In fact, it's downright insulting to compare me to a sleazebag like him. Getting all worked up over a stupid convention like White Day... That's low.
010	Hahah! A stupid convention, huh? You must feel very strongly about it!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0010
011	I'm just telling it like it is. Love and passion only serve to make men weak.
012	A stupid...convention?
013	I think it's about time you grew up!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0014
014	This day means a lot to your brother!
015	How can you go around calling something so important to him "stupid"?! You don't know anything!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0012
016	Wh-what the hell are you yelling at me for?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
017	Y'know... I can't really say I agree with you, either, Gino.
018	Tch. Then I guess that makes you a sappy loser too, doesn't it?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0010
019	You keep saying that, but it's not all about love and passion. It's more like... How should I put this?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
020	Some men, like myself, find strength in the love they hold for another.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
021	I'm thankful to the woman who made me strong, and I draw strength from that gratitude.
022	Basically, White Day is just a nice excuse to show your appreciation for someone you care about.
023	...
024	Fraise is grateful to Eve, and that's why he's celebrating today. There's really nothing bad about it.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
025	Kevin...
026	Hmph. What a joke.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0017
027	What?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0016
028	He's always been strong, and if he had devoted himself to swordsmanship, he would've just kept getting stronger and stronger.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
029	But then he started getting friendly with that woman, got caught up in his feelings for her, and grew weak!
030	Ugh! You...! Just because you don't care about love, that doesn't mean that nobody else should! Don't force your beliefs onto others!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
031	What is up with you, anyway?! You keep calling Eve "that woman." What has she done to deserve that?
032	Nothing! Absolutely...nothing. She's done nothing wrong. I know that.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0013
033	He's the one to blame. Letting himself go all soft... There's nothing to be gained from beating someone like that.
034	Someone's gotta bring him to his senses, and it's going to be me. I need to go up against him and win, fair and square, when he's at his full strength.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0019
035	Ah, crap. I was hoping to talk him down, but it looks like it had the opposite effect, huh?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
036	Aaarghh! Wh-what are these things?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
037	Argh!
038	Numa!
039	What the hell?! What are all these Rattys doing here?!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0026
040	Please! Help!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
041	Hmph. Perfect! This gives me a chance to show you what I can do!
042	I've trained hard, day after day, doing everything in my power to strengthen myself so that I can surpass my brother. Watch and learn!	VO_gino.gino_battle_0040
