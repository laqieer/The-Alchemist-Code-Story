002	That must be the headmistress. It'll be somewhat of a hassle if she sees me.
003	Salomo...in your current state, even if men were to be given these rights, it still wouldn't make you happy.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
004	What?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0026
005	Right now, you're not capable of loving anyone!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
006	...!
007	Even if you could freely choose a woman, if you don't really love that person, you'll end up as an insect without having obtained anything!
008	You don't know what you're talking about!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0032
009	Salomo...you hurt people too easily.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
010	People who wound others so easily either don't love anyone or only love themselves!
