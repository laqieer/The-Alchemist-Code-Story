001	...
002	Then answer me, Godwolf. Will I be able to liberate my people from sin?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
003	Can I remake this world?!
004	...
005	They who do not stoke the fires of their will have no choices in this world.
006	What do you mean?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
007	If thou hold'st fast to thine will and thine might, it may be...possible.
008	Wh-what?!
009	My powers...can free us from sin!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
010	Alas, should the fires of thine will flicker, in mere moments the flames would spread...
011	And in all likeliness devour the very world.
012	What?!
013	This world would crumble under the weight of new sins.
014	Nimul... The future that awaits is thine to determine.
015	(With this new technique...I will obliterate sin from the face of this world!)
016	Chief.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
017	What is it, Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
018	You have guests.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
019	Sup, Chief!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
020	Adaleigh...and Yna. What are you two doing here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
021	I came to thank you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
022	To thank...me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
023	And I was thinking of setting out soon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
024	I...see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
025	Well, maybe not that soon. Not, like, right now. It's just that Yna here said he wanted to come with me, so I've started thinking about it.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
026	The blade on which I am currently working will soon be complete. Once it is forged, I will accompany Adaleigh.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
027	So you're leaving, too, huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
028	I am interested in learning more about the metal processing techniques of the Acedia Belt Region, and discovering for myself the materials that can be found there.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
029	I wish to broaden my horizons.
030	It'll probably be another tough journey—but at least I know I can come back now!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
031	And I'll be back, for sure! So make sure you complete that new technique of yours before then, yeah?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
032	There's no question about it. That is the power that will reshape this world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
033	Right. I'm going to improve the Engineer Soldier; make it stronger than ever. Then, together we can—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
034	Yes. We will make this world a better place.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
035	...
036	(Nimul and Adaleigh... Working together, they might really be able to change this world.)
037	...
038	Yes...? What is it, Yna? Surely you don't need to bid me farewell.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
039	Why do you detest me?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
040	What?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
041	I am asking you why you detest me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
042	Hmph. It is easy for a wanderer like yourself to abandon this place.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
043	...
044	I am sworn to protect the people of this village and their chief.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
045	I simply don't have the time or the patience to spare for someone like you. That's all there is to it.
046	I knew it. It must be you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0012
047	Oh? I have no idea what you're talking about.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
048	H-hey! Yna! Don't you walk away from me! Hmph. What a wretched man.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
049	...
050	Lady Emmel...? The Godwolf Ceremony was concluded safely.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
051	So... Please don't look so glum.
052	I'm not sure I agree. Can we be sure everything is fine?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
053	My brother might have been made chief, and my bond with Sephiron and her powers has, indeed, been rekindled...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0029
054	But... Oh, Nimul. What was he thinking?
055	Did he really mean all that? What he said about...changing the way of the world?
056	Lord Nimul... Ever since he was a child, he has seemed focused on things faraway, distant from this world.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0030
057	I cannot claim to understand anything that he was thinking, but there is one thing I know.
058	Yes...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
059	He would never do anything that would bring you suffering.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0008
060	Really? How do you think I felt during the ceremony?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
061	He disrespected the avatar of our guardian deity.
062	I was terrified that he would bring divine wrath down upon himself... No, upon all our people. I felt like my heart was going to burst in my chest.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
063	...
064	Despite all that, he's now our chief. He needs to prove himself dependable.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
065	Not only to spare Waginau the trouble, but also...
066	For your sake, Julia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
067	L-Lady Emmel! As I have said, I—	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
068	Hm...?
069	Lady Emmel...? Ah!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
070	Aahh!
071	Stay back, my lady!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
072	Identify yourself!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
073	...
074	Lila?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0028
075	What?!
076	What have you done to them, you fiend?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0020
077	...
078	Wh-why would you do something so terrible? What could you possibly hope to achieve?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
079	Answer her!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0001
080	...
081	I do this for the sake of this world.
082	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
083	You...are the Vessel of Purification.
084	Ah!
085	You...will be next.
086	Lady Emmel! Run!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
087	Nngh!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
088	Julia! No!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
089	M-my lady... Leave this to me! You must...run...now!
090	B-but I...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
091	You won't escape me.
092	Ngh... Hrngh! This power...!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
093	Run, my lady! Flee! Before it is too late!
094	C-come with me!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
095	I cannot!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
096	I cannot protect you and fend off this fiend at the same time. He is far too powerful.
097	Hurry, my lady! Please!
098	Be safe, Julia!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
099	Have no fear. I will not allow myself to be so impotent as to abandon my duty before I have seen it done!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
100	You're not going anywhere!
101	Huzzzaaaaahhhhh!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0032
102	Out of my way!
103	I won't...let you!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0004
104	How did you get here? This is the village of the Sephira—a sacred land only accessible to our people!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
105	What do you want with Lady Emmel?!
106	I have no reason to answer you.
107	Then you leave me no choice... Huzzahhh!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0001
108	Hrnngh!
109	As Lady Emmel's protector, I will show you no mercy!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0014
110	Arrghh!
111	What is your purpose here? What do you want with Lady Emmel?	VO_julia.julia_battle_0012
112	How did you come to be here?
113	Answer me!
114	With the power of darkness at my command, it was a simple matter to infiltrate your village.
115	The power of...darkness?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
116	Hrrghh!
117	No...!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
118	Nnrgh...	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
119	It's over.
120	What is your purpose here?! Why...? Why would you do something like this?!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
121	The world must not be changed. I will put a stop to any who attempt to alter the way of this world.
122	Wh-what?!
123	There is only one reason for me to take up my blade.
124	And that is, as I have said, to protect this world.
125	You...?!
126	That was quite a show, Adaleigh.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
127	Heh. It was the least I could do for you. I felt like I owed you something.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
128	This airship will traverse the Dark Barrier, and go on to be the medium that links all of the belt regions.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
129	Yeah...eventually. Not sure when that will happen, though.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
130	This is the new model, you know, but it was still a close thing. I barely survived the trip.
131	The old model never would have made it through that barrier.
132	I'm gonna need to make some improvements.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
133	I suppose you'll be handling that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
134	I'll need to revise the airship's blueprints. Otherwise, I won't be able to get the budget for making the Engineer Soldier.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
135	What do you mean?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
136	Well, over in the Acedia Belt Region, we need our airships.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
137	People get that, but...they don't feel the same way about my Engineer Soldier. It doesn't get the same level of support.
138	Why not? That Soldier of yours is immune to the corruption. It can fight without fear of becoming Fallen!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
139	They know it can fight...but they don't want to resort to fighting. They're just waiting for the earthquakes to stop on their own.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
140	The Engineer Soldier just isn't what they're looking for.
141	Adaleigh...
142	But since coming here, I've finally been able to prove that the Engineer Soldier is useful!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0016
143	I'm gonna tell everyone back home all about it, and make them see that the soldier is worth having around!
144	Sounds like you're in for a rough time, even after your voyage is done.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
145	Well... Yeah. It's gonna be that way for a while.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
146	But not forever! Right, Nimul?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
147	Right. I have every faith that things will get better.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
148	(If we can just eliminate sin...I can finally free Emmel.)
149	(I must lead this mad world into it's rightful form.)
150	Hm...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
151	Ah!
152	What's wrong?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
153	...
154	Show yourselves!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
155	Argh!
156	Nnrgh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0022
157	Waginau!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
158	Be on your guard, Nimul! They are not to be taken lightly!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
159	Tch!
160	What is going on?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
