001	Those aren't even ripe yet!	VO_raaf.raaf_chara_1007
002	Why did they have to fight back? They messed up the cacao! Even Mr. Lamp is angry!
003	Well, at least we caught them.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1015
004	We'll go and hand these thieves over to the authorities.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
005	We'll be back soon!
006	Okay! Well, that's a relief.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
007	Hmph. See? You humans are despicable, thieving off of each other like that.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0010
008	You should all reflect upon yourselves and your own deeds before judging demons.
009	How dare you...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0013
010	I am born of a house of proud warriors. How dare you speak of me as if I am as lowly as those thieves!
011	Whatever. Warrior or thief, you're all just humans to me.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0012
012	What did you say?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
013	What's your problem?!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0029
014	This is not good.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0029
015	They're getting more hostile by the minute.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0030
016	Noah, go and get the cacao from the warehouse!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
017	All right!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
018	Okay, that's the cacao taken care of. Now to just... Hey! Suzuka! Itsuki! Both of you, calm down!
019	Being born of a house of warriors is my greatest honor! How can I stay calm when she berates my honor so?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0017
020	What are you so proud of? Once you've left your home country, the only difference between Wadatsumi warriors and the rest of you humans is that you have a different name for your swords.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0010
021	How dare you!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
022	People from Wadatsumi are all the same! You're nothing but a bunch of narrow-minded fools, bound hand and foot by your insignificant traditions and biases!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
023	I've never been gladder than after the destruction of Wadatsumi! I've never been so free!
024	You...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
025	Suzuka! Please calm down!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0028
026	Let go of me, Eve! I cannot forgive her! How dare she speak of my home and countrymen like that!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0013
027	...
028	That was pretty harsh, Itsuki.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
029	...
030	That's easy for you to say. You've never been persecuted by Wadatsumi.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0022
031	I was.
032	...
033	...
034	Eve! I brought the Orange Cacao! But, um...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
035	M-monsters?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
036	Well, as you can see, I attracted some unwanted attention. Help!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
037	Noah! There's some Purple Cacao mixed in with the orange!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
038	Wha—?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
039	Oh, right. We hadn't gotten around to sorting the cacao by color yet.	VO_porin.porin_chara_1009
040	...
041	I... I just grabbed the big box, and... And...!	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
042	Noah, calm down! Here, take this silver spoon!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1011
043	I... I feel much better now. Thank you, Emma. Now, let's take care of these monsters!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
044	Okay!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
045	Oh! Suzuka, Itsuki! Monsters are headed your way! Sorry about that!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0019
046	Wait here, Itsuki.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
047	Huh?
048	As a samurai, I must fulfill my duty.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0010
049	You don't think I can handle it? This is my job, too, you know!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0029
