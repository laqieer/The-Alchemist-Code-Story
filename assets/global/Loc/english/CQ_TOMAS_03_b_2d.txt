001	Phew... I'm so glad we won...
002	Hmph. Like I said, fighting on land and sea is different. Someone like me who understands that won't lose, no matter the circumstances.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
003	You’re amazing, Gormalas! If you're this strong on land, you must be crazy strong on the ocean!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0024
004	Hoo! It gets me excited about the idea of going to the ocean!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0046
005	It's like you weren't listening to me at all.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
006	No, I was totally listening! That's why I'm so into the idea! I've never seen any kind of ocean, blue or violent, or whatever else.
007	...
008	I had no idea that the ship could rock so much that you wouldn't be able to sleep!
009	There's so much I still don't know about the world! I'm getting pumped just thinking about it!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0008
010	Heh. You're an interesting kid.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
011	Hehe...	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0023
012	So, about my pay for fighting...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
013	Fons and Reeves, was it? I'm sure we can work something out.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
014	You might not know this, but Tigferes can fetch a pretty price on the market. Just hand them over and I'll call it even.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_chara_1001
015	That's why you offered to lend me money?!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0020
016	What did you think it was for? I told you that you might regret being so darn innocent.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_1017
017	I just thought you were a good guy...	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0021
018	I warned you about that, didn't I? I'm a pirate. I take what I want.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0008
019	Fons and Reeves are my family. I won't give them to anyone, not even you!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0015
020	Guess we have to do this the hard way, then.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0044
021	Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
022	Get back, you two! I'll take care of this.
023	Heh. All right. I like that look in your eyes.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
024	Someone with eyes like that wouldn't be cowardly enough to flee from the sea.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
025	Eh. I'm over this. See ya 'round, Tomas.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0011
026	What?! Where’re you going?!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
027	How can you just be over it after all that?! Was this a test or something?!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0031
028	Gormalas! Hey, uh... Thank you!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0033
029	I definitely wanna go to the ocean one day! Everything you said just made me itch to get out of here even more!
030	I'm gonna get stronger, and taller, and then I'll become tough enough to beat even you, Gormalas!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0032
031	He's gone... Can't even see him anymore.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0030
032	It was pretty nice that he finally called me by my name at the end, though.
033	Grr?
034	Yeah, you're right. I gotta train and study more!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0005
035	Grr!
036	Yeah! Let's all go to the ocean together someday. Maybe we'll see Gormalas there!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0032
