001	Are you all right?! Give me a damage report! Hurry!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
002	Agatha, are you okay?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
003	Yes...father protected me. What about you two?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0042
004	Somehow. Agh... We were dangerously close to being wiped out completely.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
005	In any case, there's a chance that Sabareta will target Agatha. Focus on protecting her.
006	Ye-yes, Sir! But why Agatha?
007	I'll explain it to you eventually. More importantly, I'm concerned about what exactly they've unearthed from the ruins.
008	For an excavation of that scale, I doubt their aim was to find Philosopher's Stones. I think they were trying to unearth an ancient weapon.
009	An ancient weapon?
010	Once, in this continent of Babel, there was a highly advanced civilization, who made full use of Alchemy.
011	Unfortunately, a dispute occurred amongst the kingdoms that seem to have led to their destruction.
012	Hm. How disappointing. I guess that means that the past isn't much different than the present.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
013	Even as technology evolves, the way people think doesn't evolve very much.
014	At the zenith of their evolution, they began producing weapons using the forbidden art.
015	The main force of power between the kingdoms began to shift to Alchemy.
016	Finally, at the end of the fierce conflict between the Alchemists, they produced the ultimate weapon.
017	And that was this ancient weapon?
018	Yes. An ancient weapon born out of high-level Alchemy. It ultimately devoured the world in flames.
019	The introduction of this ancient weapon brought an end to ancient civilization.
020	So you're saying that something that terrible has fallen into Sabareta's hands?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
021	A light of hope that will lead the world into chaos...that's what he said. If he meant the ancient weapon, then that's no pipe dream.
022	Captain, we've tracked the Lizard Brigade! They appear to be headed towards Envylia!
023	I see. That doesn't bode well! We leave immediately!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
024	Dad?
025	This was a trap to distract us. Their true aim is Spandau Castle, where the king is!
026	What?!
