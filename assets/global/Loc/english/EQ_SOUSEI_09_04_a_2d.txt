001	Haaa...haaa...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
002	The city is—?!
003	It's quiet now, but... Look. So many areas appear almost as if they've been...gnawed on.	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
004	Nimul...	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
005	Where did you go, Nimul?
006	Wh-what's⁠—?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
007	It's...a tower...?
008	Huh. So that's what the Infinite Serpent has been hiding up its sleeve.	VO_kvense.kvense_voice_0019
009	Kinda underwhelming for a trump card, though.
010	Huh?
011	I'm just saying, isn't it supposed to, like, pierce through the Shell of the World? Sure don't see it doing any of that.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
012	It's got some serious magil behind it, don't get me wrong! But, like...enough to change the whole world? I have my doubts on that one.
013	Then again, I guess if this is the best even the dragons could do, it's...fine. Good on us for accomplishing even this much.
014	When you get right down to it, even the dragons failed to defeat Ouroboros and gave up, in the end.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
015	So what you're saying is...
016	That this thing is suspiciously unimpressive, which means it's probably not done showing its true colors yet. Gonna be hell in that vortex from here on out, I suspect.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
017	We're still going up there, though, aren't we?
018	Yes. Because that's where Nimul is.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
019	But how do we get in? Can Space-Time Manipulation do the trick?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
020	Eh. I mean, we could try, but with the magil all messed up like this, we could wind up getting ourselves thrown anywhere. Even the future.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
021	If you're really raring to get lost in the space-time continuum, I'm up for it, but I'm assuming that's probably not ideal.
022	Then our only option is to go on foot, I suppose?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
023	Yeah.
024	Got that, traitor?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
025	Gonna play nice and show us the way? I bet you know a shortcut. There's no way there isn't one. Otherwise, you'd have had a pretty rough time transporting resources.
026	...
027	You listening? Don't forget that you owe me your life, and I fully intend to collect. Prove yourself useless to me, and your life is forfeit. You got that?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
028	Senile old fool.
029	Sorry, come again? Recently, my hearing has been acting up. Must be these old ears! I'll need you to speak a little louder.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
030	...There's a hidden underground path. That's your best bet. If it still exists.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
031	Thank you, Ignacio.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
032	...
033	Ignacio?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
034	I know. I won't betray you again. I couldn't even if I wanted to, since you confiscated my gun.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
035	(What kind of purgatory is this? I'm still alive. It's ridiculous.)
036	(I should have died. Now that I've sullied the name of Ignacio, I'm nothing more than an altar of shame.)
037	I bet you're wishing you'd just died, aren't you?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
038	...!
039	Don't act like a baby.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
040	I mean, what kinda plan is that, anyway? Just throw a tantrum, then die so you don't have to deal with the repercussions?
041	I know you think of yourself as some kind of villain, like I did. You were hoping to just get your dirty deeds done, then leave this world behind, huh?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0012
042	...
043	This...is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
044	Where...? I was...being controlled by Bianca, and...
045	And then...aah! What's happening now?! Where am I?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
046	There's...nothing? Absolute nothingness... Is this a dream?
047	You are within yourself, in the deepest parts of your soul. Even the Primordial Serpent cannot extend her influence this far.
048	Is that...Sephiron?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
049	Yes. Greetings, Nimul. It's been a long time.
050	Within myself... Have you been here the whole time?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
051	Ever since you established your connection to the Godwolf.
052	I must say, I did not expect you to do something so rash as to take the cores of the Cursed Beasts into your own body.
053	I couldn't think of any other way at the time. I had to do it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
054	And as a result, the tragedy of the Superbia Belt finally found its feet.
055	...You're filled with hatred. Why? Is it the betrayer, Ignacio? Or the mastermind, Bianca?
056	Either way, it is understandable. Both have strayed greatly from the path.
057	It is not wrong to resent them, and for that to curdle into hatred and anger. That is what it means to be human.
058	...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
059	No, I...
060	In the end, I am angriest at myself, Sephiron.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
061	Oh?
062	It was my choice to begin this journey.
063	It was I who wished to change the world. No one else.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
064	The truth is, part of me wanted to destroy this world for what it's done.
065	Then why not accept the Ceremony of Creation?
066	Because the Ceremony of Creation is not the result I set out to achieve.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
067	I wanted to save everyone. I wanted to change the world, without harming the people in it. That's what I've been seeking all this time.
068	I can't make the choice to change the world by erasing everything that came before.
069	The future should be built on our past, step by step, inch by painstaking inch.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
070	I see. That is an answer very characteristic of you, Nimul.
071	And I intend to make the most of it. I will not compromise my principles.
072	When Bianca stole my body from me, the light overflowing from within me disappeared for just a moment. She has the ability to control that power.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
073	That's what I need most right now.
074	...For some time now, I've taken notice.
075	You and your sister are rather unusual. You are emotional beings, as all humans are, but you are somehow able to make cool-headed decisions as though you were not.
076	There was a brief moment where you seemed on the verge of giving in to your emotions, but now there's no sign of that in you at all.
077	I just don't want to make the same mistakes again.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
078	And yet, Nimul, as I said... It is only human to be emotional.
079	It is the root of humanity—their sin and heart alike. Those who abandon that truth lose what makes them human.
080	Do you understand?
081	I'm not concerned with any of those finer points. I have a promise to fulfill...a wish that I must see granted.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
082	Very well. Then at least allow me to give you some advice.
083	Bianca's true nature lies in giving, rather than stealing. She cannot directly possess your body and make it do her bidding—not in the way you are thinking.
084	Rather, it is through sharing her magil that she was able to take indirect control of your body.
085	Are you saying...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
086	What is once shared cannot be taken back to share again. As such, once you've regained control of your body, she is unlikely to retake it, for lack of magil.
087	She almost certainly does not have enough power at this point to try again.
088	...! Then I must regain consciousness!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0026
089	Yes. I will assist you in your waking. It is time.
090	May I ask why you're helping me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
091	I've chosen a path that no Sephira has embarked on before. And yet, you've come to my aid, despite all the risks and uncertainties. Why?
092	For one simple reason.
093	I love you. All those who bear the mark of the sephirah are my beloved children.
094	Goodbye, my wayward son. I pray that the end of your journey yields something better than what once awaited us so long ago.
095	...
096	Thank you, Sephiron.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
097	Shell capacity at 86%. Perhaps it's time to take this a little more seriously.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0016
098	I never expected a bit of castoff could display so much power.
099	What did you consume, little one?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
100	Haven't you been paying attention? I'm only borrowing this.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0012
101	It did not occur to me that there was so much magil available on the surface of the world. That data, too...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
102	I see. The Cursed Beasts.
103	The seven dragon pillars of the world, collected within a single human child... A potent combination.
104	In order to defeat you, a source of magil that exceeds yours is necessary.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0002
105	Such a source does not exist in isolation. That's why they failed. However...
106	If one were to collect the sinful magil that humans create unconsciously...
107	In other words, the seven Cursed Beasts who collect and store that abundance... Yes, combined, they would be more than sufficient to rival your power!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
108	——...
109	That you are Fallen is proof positive of the veracity of this plan.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
110	This little egg is nothing compared to the power of human ambition.
111	Finally, the time has come. The dream shall see its end. Surrender, Ouroboros!
112	Access to Gula Belt confirmed.
113	Access to Luxuria Belt confirmed.
114	Access to Acedia Belt confirmed.
115	Access to Invidia Belt confirmed.
116	Access to Ire Belt confirmed.
117	Access to Avaritia Belt confirmed.
118	Access to Superbia Belt confirmed.
119	The central pillar of the Shell of the World falls here, today. Prepare yourself, Ouroboros.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0003
120	!!!
121	The light they left behind... The conclusion they could never reach... Let me show you the power of the seven dragons!
122	"Polluted waters of the Shell, hear me now! Breach the containment walls!"	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0032
123	The scale of this magil...! Do you intend to take over the very Shell itself? Will you take control of this body overflowing with corruption?!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0042
124	How many hundreds of layers will you pierce with a single strike?! Human sin truly is a power of almost unimaginable scope...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0043
125	Goodbye, my true self. With this, the mistakes we once made shall be wiped clean.
126	Haaaa...	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0030
127	The deed is done...I dare say.
128	It's a stroke of luck that it could be finished before the Shell was pushed to full capacity.
129	Next, upon my authority, I should be able to dismantle it altogether...	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
130	Not quite. It's still holding together more than you'd think.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
131	H-huh?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
132	Wh-what?! The corruption that had corroded the Shell is—
133	Eeek!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0025
134	...
135	Nng...	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0019
136	Gnrgh...
137	Why...? How...? I should have...overwhelmed you completely...already...
138	Indeed, sinful magil is not something that was originally designed to exist within the Shell. That was rather clever thinking on your part. However...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
139	I suppose you hadn't considered what effect there might be from having already been corrupted.
140	Wh-what?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0020
141	The sinful magil I used...is already contained within you?!
142	I am the administrator of Truth in this world. I am this world and this world is I.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0038
143	The dirt, the flowers, the wind and stones, the ground itself...
144	The people. All of it is I.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
145	What?!
146	I grant that there was meaning to be had in their journey.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
147	To challenge the gods, to challenge the Truth of the world, and in the process exorcise the darkness within the Belt Regions... It gave me the opportunity to recalibrate.
148	I determined that people were worthy of my governance. And to that end, I accepted some of the corruption into myself.
149	You... No! That can't be!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0012
150	Wait... What? How?! The magil supply from the tower has stopped!
151	I've taken control of your cunning little tower. We share the same abilities. Did you really not consider that possibility, either?
152	No...!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
153	You truly do deserve commendation for devising such an innovative surprise attack.
154	However, for you to face me when you are me... That was your mistake and your folly. That was your downfall.
155	If Nimul stood here now instead... Well, things might have ended differently.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
156	I can...still fight!
157	Beelzebub?!
158	Fitting, isn't it? I created it from the template held within the corruption I absorbed. It's not quite the real thing, but I think it'll be more than enough for you.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
159	Urk...!
160	Grooooooarrrgghhh!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_a
161	I-it...hurts...
162	I came so far... And yet... I'm...sorry...
163	Grooooooooooaagh!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_b
164	...!
165	No... I can't give up yet!	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_battle_0022
166	You're right. We can't give up. Dying here would only render all our sacrifices up to this point null and void.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
167	Huh? Nimul—	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0025
168	I'm taking it all back, Bianca. My body and my battlefield!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
169	...
170	Everything has spiraled completely out of control. Everything I've worked for has turned out nothing like I'd intended.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
171	So I can't stop now. I will take down God with my own two hands if I must. I will rewrite the way of things.
172	I'll remake the world! That's what I'm here for!
173	All right, then...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
174	Heh. I've only now just realized that I'm in the same situation as Waginau. Even I have to admit, things have gotten rather interesting!
175	He overcame the control of the castoff. Humans truly are full of surprises.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
176	So, you finally turn your eyes to me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
177	Hmm?
178	You've always cast your attention on Emmel rather than me, much as you've always had your sights set on the world rather than the people in it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
179	You are not mistaken. That was indeed where my interest first lay. The future of the world, and the sacrifice that would be required to bring it into being...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
180	In fact, it would not be inaccurate to say that that was the only thing I was interested in for a time.
181	But that's all changed now, child of man—child of humans born upon a bed of our own built-up sins.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
182	You may hold your head high, for it is thanks to your stubborn refusal to submit to fate that I have fallen this far.
183	?! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Envy!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
184	She blocked that torrent of corruption without even needing any help from a Cursed Beast core?!
185	...!
186	(This is no time to be analyzing the situation! I need to get myself out of danger first!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
187	...
188	Urk...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
189	She's too powerful! I can't do this on my own...
190	Wait! That vision just now...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
191	Bianca? Is that you? That light... Did you send it...to me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
192	This is the end for you.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0007
193	I have no other choice. I have to try it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
