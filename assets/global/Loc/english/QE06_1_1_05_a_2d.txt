001	I've heard your report, we've delivered that child to base, and I would love to take a nap right abut now, but...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
002	You seem to be having trouble swallowing this situation. You have any questions? I'll answer what I can.
003	What...was that? I've never heard of people turning into demons!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
004	What exactly are demons?! What are we fighting against?!
005	Whoa, slow down. All right, let me answer one at a time.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
006	Demons are...well, demons.
007	Do you think an answer like that will suffice?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
008	Not at all. You interrupted me before I could say more. You'll be losing points for not being able to listen.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
009	What...?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
010	Also, watch your attitude. That's another point reduction.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
011	Wh-what are you doing? This isn't the time for that!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
012	It most certainly is. Did you forget? You're in the middle of your trial.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
013	I'm...sorry.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
014	Good. Now, you've studied the history of Wadatsumi, correct? There are three major variations of demons. They are?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
015	Pure demons, half-bloods born from a human and a demon, and...demons that used to be human.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
016	Exactly. Though currently there are no confirmed cases of half-bloods due to concentrated efforts made in the past to eradicate them.
017	I've read there was a time when those who were not human were ostracized.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
018	Good, good. Glad to hear you're a studious one. So then, what do you make of what you saw today?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0044
019	A demon that was formerly a human... It can't be that Demon's Blood, the pandemic that nearly destroyed Wadatsumi is...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
020	Negativity, or in other words, corruption can consume people. Those who have been corrupted turn into demons it reacts to some factor found in the people of Wadatsumi.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
021	That is what we call Demon's Blood. But now...
022	We've confirmed that those bit by demons will turn as well.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
023	To be more specific, the sentient pure-bloods can amplify the corruption within people to turn them into demons, while the "normal" demons can bite people to turn them.
024	That's about it, really.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
025	I...see.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
026	Is it safe to assume that this is information the common people do not know? That only the Blade Fox are aware of this truth?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
027	That's right. To avoid a massive panic, we've issued a gag order on the matter. Only members of the Blade Fox know this.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
028	So then, some of the demons we have fought against could have been...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
029	Yes. They could have once been an important person to someone.
030	That's horrible!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
100	This is information only disclosed to those whom we are sure will continue fighting as a member of the Blade Fox after learning such a truth.
101	There is a regulation that none of you have been told of. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.
031	Do you still want to join the Blade Fox? Do you still wish to fight for the people of Wadatsumi?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
032	...
033	I see you don't yet have an answer to those questions. Strange, since I seem to remember someone hollering about being the one to bring peace to Wadatsumi...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
034	I still stand by those words.
035	Hmph. Then let me ask you this.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
036	Why did you go against regulation and turn your back to a demon?
037	Because I heard that girl calling out for help.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
038	Did you not think of the possibility that one of the other students could die because of your actions?
039	You don't mean...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
040	Fortunately or not, no one died, but there were casualties. But the possibility existed.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
041	If I must choose between regulations and a voice calling for help, I know which is more important to me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
042	Are you saying I should ignore a life I have the chance to save?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
043	Let one demon go and a hundred lives are lost. Remember that. Your actions were dangerous.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
044	And it caused unnecessary casualties.
045	Wh-what?
046	Wh-what the...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
047	I told you. Casualties.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
048	I-I...!
049	If only I had been there...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
050	Urgh!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
051	Bind!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0001
052	Now, you do it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
053	Me?
054	You know the regulation. A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
055	But I...!
056	What's the matter, Amane?
057	Even if they've turned into demons...I just can't!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
058	Even though you had no problem cutting down that little girl's mother?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
059	...
060	Amane.
061	"I hate demons."
062	"Demons must be eradicated."
063	(What is this overwhelmingly dark feeling? It's different from before...)
064	"Unforgivable."
065	"They took everything from me."
066	Amane?
067	...
068	Demons must be eradicated.
069	That's right.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
070	...
071	Urgaaaahh!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0028_a
072	Forgive me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0035
073	As your proctor, I should disqualify you from this trial.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
074	But, personally, I don't disagree with your instinct to save the girl and your compassion.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
075	Or with why you would hesitate on this matter.
076	Captain Tanosuke...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
077	I do not regret anything I did. But it is true that all of this tragedy is a result of my own actions.
078	What am I to do?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
079	You must live. You are not allowed to die.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
080	Huh?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
081	To pay for the harm you've done, you must bring peace to Wadatsumi. Wasn't that your mission?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
082	It is.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
083	Then you must live.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
084	Thank you, Captain Tanosuke.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
085	Aw, don't thank me. It makes me feel weird. I get all sneezy when people thank me!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0027
086	Achoo! Achoo! Aaaahchoo!!!
087	Wha—! I was being serious!
088	Those of us who survived should at least be smiling. Don't you think?
089	I see...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
090	...
091	Is something the matter, Captain Tanosuke?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
092	Ah, it's nothing.
093	?! Another demon!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
094	So you've noticed. The trial is still going, you know?
095	Oh, geez!!! That freaked me out!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0028
096	You weren't expecting a fair fight on the battlefield, were you? You should learn to never let your guard down.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
097	Need a hand?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
098	Back off! I can handle it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
099	Demons must be eradicated!
