001	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
002	Grr... Grrraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0002
003	It's working! We halted the Cursed Beast! Now!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
004	Got it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
005	My corporeal form shall be the key! My ego shall reach the great plains, and overturn the cosmic principles!
006	Take all of my magil, and dispel the fog of Lust!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
007	...
008	Huh, surprisingly abrupt once we got it going.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
009	But I will show you no mercy. You will die knowing the pain of all the people that lived in this region.
010	Rrrraaaaaahhh...!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0019
011	Hm? Still have the strength to—	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
012	A...lone...
013	The Cursed Beast is speaking?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
014	Sad... So sad... Why am I...alone...?
015	Tch! If you can speak, then tell me! What are you?! Why must you ruin our world?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
016	Rrraaaahh! Aaaaahh! Rrrraaaaaaaaahhh!!!
017	There's no point. It's just spilling out the sin it has borne until this day.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
018	No... That is not the sin of the Cursed Beast.
019	How do you...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
020	I know, because that sin is mine.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
021	It only makes sense. I am the only human living in this region that can bear the sin of Lust.
022	Those cries that you hear are mine. They're the wails of the little girl I left behind long ago.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
023	Ambrosia...
024	But I'm no longer alone.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
025	Sleep, my past. You are no longer needed in this region.
026	Grrrroooooaaarrrrgghhh!!!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_a
027	What is this?
028	This must be the core of the Cursed Beasts. The accumulation of every sin, the source of that outer shell we saw as its physical form.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
029	Such a small thing...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
030	Small, but still dangerous. Do not touch it. Though defeated, it is a Cursed Beast.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
031	If we humans were to touch it, we would be easily corrupted by sin.
032	All we can do is seal it away somewhere where it cannot be found or reached.
033	We cannot completely destroy the Cursed Beasts?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
034	If there was a way to do so, I would be glad to know of it. Vexing, but this is the best we can do for now.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
035	That's fine for now, but someday we'll have to... What...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
036	Wh-what?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
037	It's the same thing we saw in the Gula Belt Region!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
038	The corruption that was within the Cursed Beast is being unleashed now that it has been defeated!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
039	Tch! We've come too far for this region fall to sin now! Waginau, lend me a hand!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
040	Right! We'll have to purify as much of this corruption with our Spiritbonding as we can!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
041	Nngh... Hrrgh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
042	It's not as bad as the Guardian Dragon, but it's too much for just the two of us...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
043	...
044	Emmel?
045	I-I'm... I'm really sorry, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
046	What are you doing?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
047	I am the Vessel of Purification, charged with calming and suppressing the Cursed Beasts.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
048	With Asmodeus weakened so, my powers of purification should be able to quell this corruption.
049	I beseech the supreme...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
050	The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!
051	Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads.
052	Save us, the lost souls!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0032
053	No, Emmel! Don't touch that!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
054	Please...let this work!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
055	...
056	Hmph. So you repel Lust, mortal?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0012
057	So it wasn't just a dream.
058	But...why?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
059	Hm?
060	Why did the people of that region have to suffer such misery?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
061	To lose their humanity for falling in love, with those left behind suffering such loneliness...
062	What was the point of such relentless suffering?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
063	There was no point.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
064	That can't be!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
065	To search for meaning in this universe is a futile deed.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
066	All that exists in this universe is the Truth I lay upon it.
067	Then our lives... Our existence...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
068	That said...
069	What...is this...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
070	Defeating the Cursed Beast gave your lives meaning.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
071	Such unintended meaning...
072	Take heed, mortal. The road you have chosen is an untrodden wasteland.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
073	To disavow sin, to punish it... What awaits you in the end is only loss.
074	Loss?
075	You have disavowed Lust.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
076	Then you chose for the warmth of others to be dispensable. The pleasure of touch, gratuitous.
077	Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
078	W-wait! I still have questions!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
079	Huh...? Where am I?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
080	Emmel! You're awake!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
081	Mira...?
082	Nimul! Your sister's awake!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
083	Is she?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0026
084	Ow...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0042
085	Hehe, what are you so panicked about?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
086	Of course I'm panicked! I don't care if you're the Vessel of Purification! Don't you dare try to take on all that corruption alone, ever again!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
087	One wrong move and you could have... You could have....!
088	(Oh, I...)
089	Please don't worry me like that again.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
090	I'm sorry, Nimul. I didn't mean to worry you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
091	Well? How do you feel? Any fever?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
092	...?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
093	(I'm sure Nimul touched me... But I felt nothing?!)
094	Then you chose for the warmth of others to be dispensable. The pleasure of touch, gratuitous.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
095	Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.
096	(Could this be what she meant?)
097	No fever... Good... Hm? Is something wrong?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
098	Oh, I'm fine! Really!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
099	(If this is all, then I'm still okay. I don't want to worry him anymore. I have to hide this.)
100	(I'm okay. I wasn't meant to be here in the first place.)
101	All right! Is everybody ready?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
102	Leaving so soon, are you? How heartbreaking.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0022
103	Forgive us. You've all done so much for us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
104	Oh, stop it. We were able to accomplish our goals thanks to you.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
105	Mira, Nyx. Take care.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
106	You too, Ambrosia. Make sure you're actually in bed when going to sleep, okay?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
107	Also, please be sure to eat well.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
108	Do you two think of me as a child?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
109	Are you sure about this?
110	Sure or not, Libra's attached to that metal box already. It'd be such a hassle to remove it now.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
111	With Asmodeus gone, winter is ending in this region. Though I can't speak for the other regions...
112	Surviving shouldn't be a problem here anymore.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
113	Thanks to that, a huge weight has been lifted from my mind.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
114	What do you plan to do now?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
115	I expect I'll just start researching some other subject. There is still so much to be discovered.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
116	That should keep me occupied for a few centuries.
117	Your concept of time is...daunting.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
118	Well, you don't have to worry about me. I'll keep myself occupied some way or another, but if you want...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
119	You are welcome to visit anytime! I consider all of you my apprentices now!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
120	I can't seem to recall learning anything from you.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
121	Well, magic isn't for everybody. I almost pity you.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0002
122	What?! Hmph! It's not like I'm jealous or anything! My machines are way cooler!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
123	Hahahaha! Well, good on you!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0030
124	So your next destination is...Acedia Belt Region?
125	Yes. According to Adaleigh, the airship is in serious need of repairs.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
126	It's really held up through a lot. Once we get there, we'll need to give the airship a total overhaul.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
127	Let me give you a bit of advice, boy.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
128	What?
129	Sloth does not only mean laziness.
130	Huh? What do you mean by that?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
131	Supplies and luggage are loaded. Is there anything else?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
132	I'll be right there!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
133	Well, goodbye, I guess.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
134	Thank you very much for your assistance, Miss Ambrosia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
135	Anytime. Be good.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
136	Although...
137	Are you sure about this, Winnick? That was your first love, was it not?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0002
138	We have come to realize.
139	Realize what?
140	The world is so very large. We did not know this.
141	So, we are not yet worthy. Must learn more.
142	If that's what you believe, then that's what you should do.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
143	And you, Ambrosia? Still fear love?
144	What...?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
145	Don't get the wrong idea! I'm not scared of falling in love!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0012
146	I just... You know! I just haven't met the right person yet!
147	Ambrosia... I think your fear of commitm—ow, ow, ow!
148	Seriously...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
149	So judgmental...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
