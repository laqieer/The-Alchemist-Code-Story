001	Ugh...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0031
002	...Captain, are you okay?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
003	Silence! I'm thinking right now! Don't speak to me!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
004	Aye aye!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
005	(Why did I lose to a muscle head like him...I don't understand.)	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0016
006	Captain! Sunken ship detected on our starboard front! It looks like it's been there for a while!
007	What? Aye, men, commence investigations immediately!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0026
008	Captain! There's a cave in the location that it's been stranded! There's air inside...
009	Maybe the sunken ship was aiming for this cave? I wonder if there's treasure...
010	All right. Let's head to the cave.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
011	Captain! We've found treasure!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
012	Look! There are good-sized treasure boxes!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0009
013	There's antique jewelry...and gold...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0008
014	Hm? Look at this... Is this the strange cloth that muscle head was wearing?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0025
015	What's with this warmth...and enveloping light?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0024
016	Whoooaaa!!!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0027
017	Ca-Captain...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
018	A certain resort site located near the south-east of Greed Dike where appearances of monsters have been reported.
019	The resort site has had trouble coping with them and now provides security from the successful Phantoms of the year before in order to ensure security.
020	Phew! Security is a surprisingly easy job!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
021	Last year was pretty tough though.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
022	Last year, it wasn't really the monsters who were tough, you know...	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
023	...I agree.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
024	Those really troublesome pirates showed up!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
025	Pirates...?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0025
026	Yeah, but, the loincloth...	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
027	Rin, you don't have to remember it!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0014
028	Ahahah...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
029	What?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
030	I'll make you all wear loincloths! Gahaha!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0023
031	You're gonna wear a red one! And you're gonna wear a brown one!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
032	Ahahah. They're being forced to wear loincloths!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
033	Stop! Stop making everyone wear loincloths!!!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0028
034	Ack! I thought I was able to avoid it last year, but I didn't expect Gormalas to come back!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0019
035	On top of that, the already annoying fellow has gotten even more heinous...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
036	But why did he go berserk in that outfit?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0029
037	Th-that's a loincloth...	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
038	Rin, don't look!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0021
039	Loin...cloth...?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
040	Mielikki, you can't look!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
041	Whoaaa, that's quite the body!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
042	Is he acting a little strange? Was he always like that?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
043	At any rate, he wasn't the type to go around wearing a loincloth.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
044	I wonder if the loincloth is suspicious.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
045	Grrrrrrow!!! You guys put on loincloths too!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0026
046	Eek, he's coming this way!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0028
047	You filthy man...everyone stand back!	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0022
