001	Well, isn't this a familiar sight.
002	Just as well. I can deal with two annoyances at one go.
003	I won't permit you to remain a thorn in my master's side any longer.
004	Goetia will not care a whit how much you or your 'master' gives in their name.
005	Nothing will come of it save deaths in vain.
006	Don't presume to lecture me when you, too, came to Goetia in desperation.
007	We are all but poor players upon this laughable stage.
008	But enough talk! You've outlived your role!
009	(This blade again!)
010	...!
011	Emrys!
012	Slippery little minx...
013	You've meddled long enough!
014	I WILL have your blood this time!
015	They just keep coming!
016	There's not much Alchemia in the atmosphere left to use, either...
017	*BZZZ...*
018	What the-
019	Gah!
020	Ngh!
021	(Now's our chance!)
022	A pinch of flash powder ignites in the chaos, blanketing the fields in burning bright lights.
023	By the time Nesha blinks the stars out of her eyes, all that remains are malfunctioning Constructs and dead guards.
024	Tch...
025	Master won't be pleased to hear of this.
026	My lady! Are you all right?
027	Well enough...and so are you, by the looks of it.
028	Cowering in a corner while the Constructs did your work for you, hmm?
029	N-no, my lady! It's just- They were uncontrollable!
030	You saw how that bot of theirs shorted them out!
031	Mm, yes. An unfortunate development.
032	You felt that too, didn't you, Agares?
033	I'd heard that the little Queen and the Director's grumbling suit had been on the receiving end of something similar...
034	Used against us, the Construct army would be as good as a scrap metal mountain.
035	M-My lady...?
036	Don't interrupt me, you dullard!
037	Collect the rest of your mewling crew, whatever is left of them, and pay for your failures back at base!
038	But... The Constructs?
039	No longer your concern, since it requires a creature of intelligence to operate.
040	Leave me.
041	Oh, do not doubt that there will be a reckoning, 'heroes'.
042	Nothing will stand in Master's way. Nothing...
043	Ahahaha...!
044	The rest of the week passed in a blur.
045	Interestingly, Goetia did not pursue us with the dogged fervor I had expected of them.
046	Turning away from those grim thoughts, I focused my attentions on my lord and my sister instead.
047	Soon, we found ourselves once more in Professor Minerva's humble home...
048	One that has gotten rather crowded, I must admit.
049	Yet one that felt as warm and safe as I dared hope it could be.
050	You have saved us once again, Soren.
051	I'm afraid a lifetime of gratitude might not even be enough at this rate.
052	Don't say that. It's thanks to Shion's tip-off about Goetia that we were able to prepare in the first place.
053	I wish I knew what Clotho- um, the Director, was thinking...
054	In a way, this really is all my fault. Stopping this feels like the right thing to do.
055	But never doubt that we are here for you, Soren. You need not shoulder these burdens alone.
056	Indeed. I held out as long as I could when they interrogated us.
057	Save for Asuka and those who worked directly on the Atropos project, no one else knows of the details.
058	Still, I would not blame them if anything were to slip their tongues.
059	Li Wang is a monster.
060	Stop fussing, Shion. I'm fine!
061	Says the woman who put up a valiant last stand and laid bleeding in my arms the last time I saw her.
062	Never do that again. Promise me.
063	Given Goetia's escalating war, I don't think it's possible to avoid that if they come upon us.
064	But at the very least, I'll try, alright?
065	No one wants to see their sibling in grave danger. I can see Shion cares deeply for you, Lady Asuka.
066	That is true.
067	So many new Sis...
068	Big...family!
069	And you must be Eira.
070	Don't you worry. We'll make sure nothing ever happens to anyone's siblings again.
071	Happy Sis...happy.
072	You're so cute, it's almost unbelievable!
073	Ehe...
074	We're back! Did we miss anything?
075	Unfortunately, we weren't able to recover the guard bot after all. It's too damaged to be of use.
076	But I've collected enough data from our experimental add-on, thanks to Lachesis.
077	I don't know what I did, but happy to help!
078	I should be able to build a device that simulates Alchemical disruption, albeit on a small scale...so long as there's enough in the atmosphere.
079	It's a lot better than nothing. You always amaze me, Blair!
080	Let us hope it is enough for them to reconsider their relentless assaults against us.
081	There must be a way to dissuade Clotho from her path without further bloodshed.
082	There has to be...
