001	Stories are often formed against the wishes of the people. As for the history of Headstrong Dias, told through the stones—
002	This is the sinful tale of the stone that creates all life, of Headstrong Dias, and of how they intertwine.
003	We were always together. We breathed the same air, dreamed the same dream, and loved the same person.
004	We laughed and cried together. We shared our joy as well as our pain.
005	Our hearts were always one.
006	Yet, somehow, of the two of us it is only Dias who is losing his way, becoming Headstrong Dias. How did this come to pass?
007	Agatha! There you are!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
008	Huh? What's the matter, you two?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
009	Leaving the main army is dangerous! What're you doing out here?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
010	What do you mean? I'm stocking up on medicinal herbs, of course.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0007
011	Medicinal herbs?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
012	This is the healing prairie, Siguroardottir. Various types of medicinal herbs grow in clusters here.
013	There are a lot of injured within the Guard, aren't there? I thought I would collect these and make plenty of healing salve.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0011
014	Agatha...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0011
015	You're right. We can never have enough medicinal herbs. Let me help.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
016	Dias...? You're willing to help?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
017	Hm? What sort of herb is this?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
018	That's actually a kind of mushroom. An Alchemy Mushroom.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0005
019	I heard that someone who looked like nobility was seen planting them around here recently.
020	Alchemy...? Would eating this give me power?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
021	What? Power?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
022	Dias?! Wait, don't! What are you doing?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
023	Bottoms up!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
024	You ate it? Seriously?! You didn't even wash it! I thought you were civilized!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
025	What were you thinking?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
026	I must gain power, no matter what anyone says!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
027	So stubborn... So this is Headstrong Dias!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0039
028	...
029	Agatha? What's wrong?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0002
030	You know, I always wanted to be an actress.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0002
031	Wha—?! Agatha? D-did you eat the mushroom too?! What are you two doing?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
032	Agatha! Why did you eat one, too?! These Alchemy mushrooms could be...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
033	Oh... Sorry! Did I worry you?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
034	N-no, I just... Eheh. Heheh. Hehehehehehe!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0047
035	Ew! You are not acting like yourself, Dias! This has got to be the mushroom's fault!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0028
036	Back then, nobody knew that these mushrooms would be the cause of Dias' breakdown.
037	Get down, both of you! It's Wratharis soldiers!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
038	Oh!
039	It looks like they haven't noticed us. I wonder where they're headed.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
040	It could be Naraba Village. You can see it over there. They're famous for their herbs, so it's certainly—	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0002
041	Are they gonna attack the village?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
042	No, hold on! Can you see, Dias?! Monsters are attacking Naraba Village!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
043	Are the Lizard Brigade gonna try to save the village?! How hypocritical of them.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
044	Perfect. We'll be able to see how the famous Wratharis soldiers fight.
045	What are you talking about, Dias! You're not going to help?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
046	There are piles of Alchemy Mushrooms stored in that village!
047	That settles it. We're going in to help them!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
048	Well, that was a quick change of heart. Agatha, you shouldn't stir him up like that!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
049	Now, let the massacre begin!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0023
050	Oh, brother. I guess this must be Headstrong Agatha...
051	Let's go save them, and change this sad world!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0015
052	Oh, come off it. We already know you're after the mushrooms! Don't you have any pride as one of the main characters?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
053	Sir Knight! Please, wait! What do you plan to do with them?
054	What does it matter to you? The monsters have been taken care of.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
055	I will have them reveal to me where the mushrooms have gone!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
056	B-but, the Wratharis soldiers also protected the village.
057	Dias! What are you doing?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
058	You came just in time. Help me get these guys to talk.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
059	Hey! Where is your leader Sabareta?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
060	Better yet, tell me where the mushrooms are! Hurry up and spit it out!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
061	Urk!
062	Dias! How could you?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0026
063	He's become so violent all of a sudden!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
064	I need more power! Give me the Alchemy Mushrooms!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
065	No wonder people call you Headstrong Dias...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
066	Shut up! I've had it with people calling me Headstrong Dias!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
067	This isn't my fault! The developers made me what I am!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
068	Dias is going meta! This must be the mushroom's effects! At least, I sure hope it is!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0029
069	I-I've told you already! I'm not saying a word to you, you religious dogs! Hurry up and kill me!
070	I see... Then I'll just have to rub the Alchemy Mushroom's spores into every single one of your orifices!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
071	We'll get a good harvest of mushrooms off of you!
072	Stop it! How obsessed with mushrooms can you be?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
073	You lot are always the same!
074	You all think farming must be easy, because it's peasants' work! But agriculture isn't as easy as all that! No mushrooms are gonna grow down there!
075	Our wrath has awoken a mighty power! Fear us, the mushroom farmers of Babel!
076	Foolish Envylia... Your day of reckoning is at hand!
077	What is this guy saying now? Did he eat a mushroom, too?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
078	Silence, rebel scum! Just let me harvest more mushrooms!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
079	Dias, you're going too far! You're both from Wratharis! How could you do this to him?! You've gone insane!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
