001	Hyaaah!
002	Now that's what I like to see! Watch for an opening, and when the time's right...strike!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
003	Yes, master!
004	(Their technique is so much more polished than before.)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
005	(Won's teaching must really be resonating with them...)
006	But if I do that all the time, they'll never have a chance to learn. I throw 'em in at the deep end because that's how they grow.
007	Instructions are important, but sometimes you gotta trust your students enough to take the reins off.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
008	...
009	Commander! Your orders!
010	...
011	(So that's what it means to be a commander... I get it now. I have to trust them and support them.)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0045
012	Commander? Is something wrong?
013	You're strong enough to handle this yourselves. Fight as you see fit and I will support you as necessary.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
014	Yes, commander!
015	(All those sounds that were so suffocated now sound so free.)
016	(It's just like when I fought at Bertha's side...)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
017	Huh? Damn it!
018	Commander!
019	I'm fine. More importantly...	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0019
020	Look out! That's gotta be the leader!	VO_wong.wong_battle_0022
021	...We really have to fight that?
022	There's nothing to fear. We just have to disrupt their formation...
023	And strike!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0012
024	Hyaaaaaah!
025	We've cleared out the monster lair, so the village should be safe for the time being. If anything happens, please contact the Royal Knights.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
026	I cannot thank you enough.
027	And the same goes for you, Won. We'll be happy to enlist your services again.
028	Whenever you need something punched, I'll be there!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
029	Thank you, Won. It's all because of you and your disciples that we brought this mission to a speedy close.
030	Not at all. I should be the one thanking you for letting us tag along!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0007
031	I only took this job in the first place 'cause this bunch needed a real battle to cut their teeth on. Experience makes for the best teacher.
032	I see...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0045
033	Anyways, color me impressed! Cutting down that great lumbering beast with one stroke... Now that's a true knight for you!
034	I couldn't have done it alone. The battlefield resonated with the sound of trust, and that gave me the courage to keep going.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_1039
035	The sound of trust, eh?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0006
036	Come to think of it, you said your orders sounded...suffocated, was it? What happened to that?
037	Actually, never mind. The answer's written all over your face.
038	That's right. They can breathe freely now.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
039	I finally remembered the kinds of sounds that my instructor resonated with.
040	If I can teach those same sounds to my juniors, then the Royal Knights will become brighter and livelier.
041	And it will resonate with more vibrant sounds, which I'll help pass on to the next generation. That's how I'll repay my instructor's kindness.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
042	Thank you, Won. It was you and your disciples who showed me the way.
043	Those sounds of yours are quite something, huh? Maybe they're just what I need to spread my way of the Tiger-King Fist.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0045
044	Maybe so.
045	All right! Time for me to master the power of music!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0023
046	...Uh, mind if I ask for a couple pointers?
047	Well... How about we start by having you listen to a stirring symphony?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
048	A stirring symphony?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
049	Like the Envylia Philharmonic Orchestra. If anyone can show you just how magical music can be, it's them.
050	Even when words fail you...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0003
051	Music can help you realize that you're not fighting alone. That there's someone by your side.
