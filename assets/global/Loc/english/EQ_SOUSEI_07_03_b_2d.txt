001	What was that?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
002	I truly did return to my original form just now.
003	So, I haven't just returned to the past... Just what is happening to my body?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
004	Hm...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
005	So, even in such a form as this, the Fallen possess no difficulty?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
006	Gah!
007	Sadly, we people of Avaritia cannot absorb corruption.
008	We are soldiers and smiths. As I seek only strength, there is no point in avoiding sin.
009	Heh. If Nimul were to hear me say that, he would scold me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
010	Are you a weaponsmith, my apprentice?
011	Master Roh Ku.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
012	But all Fallen are naught but weaklings swallowed by sin.
013	No matter how many we cut down, we will never reach that which we are striving for.
014	All we can do is defend.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
015	So it seems...
016	Enter now. There's work to be done.
017	Yes, sir.
018	.........
019	.........
020	Your iron rings out well today.
021	Hard to believe it's the work of someone who was so cowardly yesterday.
022	Indeed...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
023	I thought you were just a fool with too much talent and too little desire for strength. I must be getting old.
024	.........
025	(I truly was inexperienced at this point. I didn't know the meaning of hammering gear or the intention poured into a blade. I was merely iterating the techniques.)	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
026	At this rate, I may just let you take over the workshop.
027	Master, that's...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
028	Yna, I don't have much time left.
029	.........
030	I am a smith, and just as the name implies, I hammered down my soul to make gear.
031	But that duty will soon come to an end.
032	I was approached by Lord Kubera.
033	He told me to make the Ultimate Blade—one worthy of being the last blade of my life.
034	That's—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
035	That man has resolved to slay the Cursed Beast.
036	There has never been another warrior to rival him in the history of the Avaritia Belt Region. If one keeps looking for strength, this is the natural result.
037	Many will die.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
038	Indeed.
039	If he fails, the Avaritia Belt itself will be destroyed.
040	And he will still go through with it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
041	Yes.
042	Do you fear for your sister's life?
043	.........
044	I am not condemning you. I hear that kind of strength is also found in other Belts.
045	But it is not the way of life for we people of Avaritia.
046	I know...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
047	(But I cannot stop.)	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
048	(If this is the trigger of our destruction, then it was the collective will of all those in the Avaritia Belt.)
049	(My will alone cannot stop this.)	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
050	What should I do, Nimul?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
