001	Boy, just look at all this commotion. This is a “wight day fair,” you say?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0024
002	Almost! With White Day just around the corner, this event sets up shops selling sweet treats from each country.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1038
003	Seeing how you can eat your fill of the sweets from all over the continent, it's no wonder there's such a hub-bub.
004	Iyazoi and I are on decoration duty! We'll make it a venue that puts A+ smiles on everyone's faces!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0004
005	Yeah, what she said. I put up a bunch of drawings to get everyone in a festive mood. Look, this one's Tsuru! Not bad, right?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
006	...A+ for ingenuity, that's for sure. Full marks!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
007	That disaster on paper aside, the hall's really come together.
008	Still, we're sure to have a ruckus on our hands with so many people in one place.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0037
009	Brace yourselves, we have a full day of guard duty ahead of us.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
010	Okay, but can someone explain what a "wight day" is?
011	Now that you mention it, I have no idea either. Some kind of sugar-centric celebration?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
012	According to the fair organizers, White Day is a day to gift sweets as a way to show gratitude to someone who's shown you similar sentiment.
013	You don't say...
014	A day to express your gratitude, huh? That's an idea I can get behind! Now I'm all gassed-up to make sure this all goes off without a hitch!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
015	(The nuance of the original White Day isn't quite the same, but oh well.)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
016	(Never thought Plumeria's misunderstanding would get this kind of traction.)
017	(Still, taking out the "guys-only" element is better for the market, anyway.)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
018	Now then, Plumeria and I will go back to helping out the prep work. Keep your eyes peeled out there.
019	So this is the White Day Fair!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
020	Compared to the days we grew up in, this era seems a bit more peaceful. All these guys have the leeway to enjoy a shindig like this.
021	And how. They've even got traditional sweets stands—anmitsu jelly, warabi mochi, you name it.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
022	Anmitsu jelly...
023	......
024	I'll patrol that side with Tsuru. Later.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0001
025	Whoa, whoa, hold on! Why're we splitting up, here?
026	Isn't it obvious? We can cover more ground that way.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0006
027	You guys get along, and seem to work well together. I just assumed Tsuru and I ought to go another way.
028	Oh, so that's your logic.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
029	I wouldn't say we're especially chummy.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
030	Besides, the hall's not all that big. There's no need to go our separate ways, is there?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
031	Huh? Oh, I see...
032	What's that? You don't think we should split up, either? Well, if you say so, Tsuru!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
033	Come on, then, shall we make the rounds? Oh, I think we shall.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0004
034	......
035	We've done a few circuits, but nothing worth writing home about.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
036	Hmm? What're you gawking around for, Iyazoi?
037	Oh, I'm just observing. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves, buying and eating all these confections.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
038	All of the people here have the wherewithal to purchase such extravagances as sweets and lollies.
039	I'm happy for them, but it makes me think about those lacking the resources to partake in these festivities.
040	Of course, I recognize the importance of our security detail. Just got me thinking, is all.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
041	Iyazoi...
042	Oh, and I'm combing for some inari sushi. There's got to be at least one vendor in all this hubbub.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
043	But...inari sushi isn't a sweet.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
044	What? It's plenty sweet!
045	You're getting caught up in the semantics...
046	I'm afraid you won't scratch your inari sushi itch here. Still, there's plenty of tasty treats to be sure. Just walking around's enough to get your stomach rumbling.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
047	That takes me back! I used to go around eyeballing other people's food, chugging down tea and imagining the seasoning of what they're eating.
048	You've gotta be kidding me.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0029
049	I was exactly rolling in zeni back then. Sweets were a luxury beyond my means.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0039
050	The doors to my dojo were always open, but the disciples were few, and the bodyguard requests even fewer.
051	Still, it's the path I've chosen, I regret nothing. Not that my stomach often agrees with me.
052	Say... How's Wadatsumi faring these days, you figure?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
053	Think it's a peaceful place, in need of life-giving swordhands?
054	Beats me.
055	Hmm? What's with the crowd here?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
056	Line up here for the white marshmallow vendor! No shoving, please!
057	This "marshmallow" confection seems pretty popular. You want one, Reimei?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0044
058	Not really my thing, to be honest. I don't know if it's the scent, or the sickly sweetness or what.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
059	What's that, Tsuru? Hmm, hmm, I see. Okay, I'll leave it to you, then.
060	What's up?
061	Something was bothering him, so he went to go check it out, is all.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
062	Don't love the sound of that...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
063	My deepest apologies, ladies and gentleman. I fear we've sold through our current stock of white marshmallows.
064	We'll be taking a brief respite until the next delivery arrives.
065	You kidding me?! I've been in this line forever!
066	Let us put in reservations for the next batch! Here, take my money!
067	Whoa, calm down, you lot! They sell out when they sell out, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0025
068	I know, I know, it's just... I can't take it. I need another melty morsel in my mouth, and I mean NOW!
069	The way the luscious flavor lingers in your mouth... One bite's enough to get anyone addicted...
070	All right, already, I get it! They've got another delivery coming, don't they? Take a seat, have a cup of tea or something!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0038
071	Yeesh, they've finally settled down...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0030
072	That was too weird. Marshmallows shouldn't cause such pandemonium, I don't care how tasty they are.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
073	Truth, truth. Is there some sort of secret to them we're not seeing?
074	Why might know more when Tsuru gets back. That sweet scent is what drew her attention in the first place.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0001
075	That right? Then let's wait and see what Tsurubami drudges up. The rest of us have a mission to complete.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
076	How many times do I have to say it?! You can't run a store on wishful thinking!
077	Hmm?
078	......
079	We've came all the way from Envylia, and this is all we've sold?
080	We'll be in the red at this rate. I'm telling you, we have to get your son back and—
081	Shut your yap! Don't say another word about him!
082	!!
083	Yo, what do you think you're doing? This is no place for Phantom Soldiers to butt in.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
084	You're not wrong, but I can't just ignore this, either!
085	Hoh boy, here we go...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
086	Calm down, you two! Cooler heads prevail, and all that.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
087	I'm just thinking of our business! Your way of doing things is behind the times!
088	I'm in no fix to give up my proclivities! Be it recipes or ingredients, there's no cutting corners when it comes to making our customers grin from ear to ear!
089	Customers out there want my wares. Even if it's old school, I won't twist the convictions handed down to me!
090	That may ring true for your regulars, but the new customers are a whole other tune! You're pidgeon-holing us, here!
091	Well I—
092	What's the point in making all these delicious sweets if there's no one around to eat them?!
093	That's why our business needs to go in a new direction!
094	......
095	I'm telling you, master! We need to make our sweets with the mashiro flour your son developed!
096	Mashiro flour?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0006
097	An ingredient made by our master's son. Cheap to produce, incredibly sweet, perfect for making piquant pastries.
098	Well, sounds like a win-win all around. Sweet and cheap, even the penniless could afford some.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0044
099	No! It's delicious to be sure, but the strange addiction that follows, well, that don't sit right with me.
100	Sweets should be all about the ingredients.
101	The plant mashiro flour is made from is an invasive species. You put it in my ware, you can hardly call them mine anymore.
102	The sweets I make come from Wadatsumi, and bear the mark of its hospitality. That flour lacks any such cordiality.
103	That bullheaded thinking's what caused your son to leave in the first place, master. All the other shops are using the flour!
104	My son...will return, in time. No one loves my sweets more than him.
105	If anyone can understand how important ingredients are, it's my boy.
106	Master...
107	Our shop's motto is "baking sweets that bring sincere smiles to our buyers." I won't betray that adage, no way no how.
108	Your ideals are admirable, master, no one's doubting that. It's just...if this keeps up...
109	Oh dear, there they go. What can be done about those two?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
110	Whatever it is, it's nothing you or I are equipped to handle.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
111	Behind the times, huh?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
112	The ideals of the Sosenko are admirable, to be sure. Still...
113	A sword that can't cut, cannot save a single soul.
114	......
115	Hello? Earth to Creto?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
116	Oh, sorry. Don't mind me.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
117	......
118	Hey, everyone. I was looking for you.
119	What's the word, Ankh?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
120	I'm actually in a bit of a bind. That shop from before, where that chaos occurred? Their next shipment of marshmallows has yet to arrive.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
121	All of the customers are in a tizzy. I'm having a devil of a time calming them down.
122	You think something happened to the merchant? Right, we'd better go check it out.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0012
123	Well, this is the route the merchant had taken. I wonder what happened to him?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
124	Search me. Could be a thief, or maybe—
125	Look, over there!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0026
126	What?! What a fearsome monster horde. What's making them swarm here?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
127	S-someone! Help! Save meeeee!
128	!!!!
