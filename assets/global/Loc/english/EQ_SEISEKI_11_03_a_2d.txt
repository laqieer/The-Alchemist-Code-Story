001	Lord...Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
002	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
003	It has been a while since I felt the breeze of this continent... It's more refreshing than I remembered.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
004	Now, what is all this? You're attacking the Holy Guard? Hmph. Even the Holy Guard's "absolute justice" has been ruined.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
005	Z-Zahar?! He's...here?! I thought he was sealed in the darkness with Captain Cadanova?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
006	The little girl...with Cadanova that day... You are the Lord Commander now? The end of the Holy Guard is indeed near.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
007	How dare you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
008	More importantly... Explain this situation to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
009	Despite inferring from her Final Battle Armament that Spica is of the Shadow Messiah...
010	...I see that your sword is poised to take aim at her, Zehn. Perhaps you can tell me why.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
011	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
012	You are not just some Phantom... Zahar, how did you manage to return to this world?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
013	How...? Even hell itself could not hold such a soul as mine.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
014	Heh... It is truly an honor to bear witness to the destruction of your hollow false justice.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
015	False justice...? You mean the Holy Order?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
016	That's exactly what I mean. The scripture of the Holy Guard is full of pretty, empty words, all for show.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
017	Having imposed these false truths upon the world, it is no wonder that your "absolute justice" should fade into obscurity.
018	That which should happen has now happened. It is only further proof that your justice is false.
019	What is this slander?! We have never done anything like "imposing false truths" on anyone! We just believe that people ought to live virtuous lives!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
020	No matter what you say, it is a fact that those who do not accept your logic are bound to be left behind.
021	Isn't our present situation evidence in itself that your "absolute justice" is false?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
022	No! Our justice cannot be destroyed so easily!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
023	Ah, so you remain in denial of the situation. Well, I only came to help as requested.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
024	To help...? Who ever asked for your help?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0012
025	I was called back to this world because I it needed me... There was a strong desire for my return.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
026	Who could possibly desire to bring Zahar here...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
027	That which most strongly fears that our world may be heading down the wrong path... The world itself called me here.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
028	...!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
029	What nonsense are you spouting?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
030	Hahaha...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0008
031	Would you like to share what is so funny with the rest of us?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
032	Zahar, I never knew you could be so funny. "The world itself" called you here...? What a laugh! It was us who brought about this situation!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
033	This has nothing to do with you!
034	Hmph. Disappointing. You really can't count on anyone these days.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
035	The world decided I was needed, and subsequently I was called back here. There cannot be any other explanation.
036	It is unfortunate that you cannot seem to understand that.
037	Then what of us Templars? Are we simply gnats unable to consider the needs of the world? Is it not only the Holy Guard, but also our organization itself that you refuse to respect?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0012
038	Our organization? Hmph. Have you affiliated yourself with yet another group? You are a man without honor.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
039	Yet another...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
040	That man once was a comrade in arms of mine...as a part of the Shadow Messiah.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
041	You were not with me at that time. You would not have met him.
042	This man was also part of the Shadow Messiah?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
043	I prefer to think of it as having temporarily lent my strength to their cause. At no point did I ever intend to act as a subordinate to this man.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
044	Interesting perspective. I myself seem to recall a certain someone joining me in the wake of personal devastation, having lost both home and reason for living.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
045	For you to have forgotten that debt you owe me... I ought to teach you a lesson.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0013
046	And now you will turn your weapon against me? Hahaha... Can you really do such a thing?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
047	Stop! I will not allow you to turn your sword on Lord Zahar...!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
048	Stand back. I do not require your assistance.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
049	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
050	I am perfectly capable of taking care of such a dishonorable...friend...on my own.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
051	Well, this is quite an unexpected sight. I never thought I would see you extend such kindness to another.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
052	Kindness...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
053	You didn't know?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
054	I could cut someone like you down in seconds. The differences in our strength are that stark. For him to try to prevent that scenario, he must be particularly fond of you.
055	Lord Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
056	I must commend you for your imagination, but you have gravely misunderstood. What kind of leader would let someone else clean up a mess of his own making?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
057	After all, it is not as if you are some sort of challenge to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0001
058	I see... In that case...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0020
059	You shouldn't mind if I just...tie up a few loose ends.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
060	Spica! Behind you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
061	?!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0023
062	L-Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
063	Did I not tell you to stand back? Don't make me waste my time protecting you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
064	Hahahaha. What is this, Zahar? Are your words and actions not contradicting one another?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
065	Are they? Or perhaps I think the value of this life is not worth losing to a malicious blade like yours.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
066	In addition, Spica has a duty to help carry out my ambitions.
067	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
068	Spica... Make this the last time you wear your Final Battle Armament. It is up to you to revive the Shadow Messiah for those who have fallen through the cracks in the world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
069	R-revive...the Shadow Messiah?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
070	What did you say?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
071	Ha! Zahar, you are funny! You're out of touch with the times!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0008
072	The times...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
073	Revive the Shadow Messiah? Don't make me laugh!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
074	What is the point of reviving the dead?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
075	You are wasting my time speaking in circles. Get to your point.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
076	Listen to you... You're not understanding reality!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
077	The organization you imbued with your own will and ambitions died along with you at your first "death."
078	I don't know why you think you can just set foot back on these lands, but I will get nothing from beating a dead horse like you with a stick.
079	Silence! How dare you insult Lord Zahar like this!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0010
080	Hmph. A fool can never be more than a fool.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
081	What...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
082	Here are some words of advice—one fit to rule the world does not do so with force or purse, but with their eyes.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0005
083	Their...eyes?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
084	Yes. One with eyes that can perceive inevitable destruction and use will and reason to guide the world away from it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
085	Hmph. Perhaps this is too much for someone who can only handle killing things that are right in front of them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
086	You!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
087	In the past, I at least felt that your violence had a purpose... To prevent others from experiencing the same pain you had known.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
088	Well, perhaps that too is an overestimation of you.
089	After all, you seem to have subordinated yourself to scum like the Greed Dike emperor. You're pathetically happy to be little more than one of his chess pieces.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
090	...!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
091	Do you understand...? Depending on what you do with my words, this might be the end of you...or the beginning, I suppose.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
092	Hmph. Such a man thinks himself worthy to be my opponent, when he barely even understands his own position in the world!
093	You sure have a lot to say for someone with one foot out of the grave. Allow me to guide you on your way back to hell!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
094	He disappeared! Watch yourselves!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
095	Lord Zahar, be careful! You won't be able to follow his movements with your eyes alone!
096	Blood Sacrifice!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
097	Ack...?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
098	He deflected it?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
099	Did you think I wouldn't be able to handle your attack when I already know how you fight? You insult me with your artlessness.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0016
100	You are correct... My art...of "less."	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
101	What...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
102	Ack...?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
103	Lord Zahar!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0023
104	You underestimated me, Zahar. While you were gone, I've had plenty of time to hone my sword skills under another master.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
105	Sol's strength is in a whole different dimension. I suspect that even you would not be able to match him in battle.
106	A different...dimension?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
107	I myself have also unlocked a new dimension of battle. Farewell, Zahar.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
108	Lord Zahar, watch out!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
