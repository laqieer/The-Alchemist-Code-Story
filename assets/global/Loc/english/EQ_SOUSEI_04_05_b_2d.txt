001	Julia! Stop this! If we fight, it'll just end up hurting Emmel—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
002	Only Emmel?
003	What...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
004	Nimul, no!
005	Even though it was me who always loved you!
006	Huh?
007	(Julia felt like that? Preposterous. This is certainly a trick...)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
008	(No...but that look in her eyes. That's right, she always looked at me like that...)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
009	"Shapeless shadows, thus become boundless!"
010	Ah—!
011	Nim—!
012	Ha! You're just like I remember you!
013	Always so consumed in your selfish ideals... Even now, you hold onto that naivete!
014	Awkward and insensitive, too weak to properly protect yourself... Yet you were Julia's first love.
015	This is why I am filled with such disgust. Because I am no longer that girl with stars in her eyes.
016	Nimul?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
017	For now, I have been satisfied. Be grateful that I shall spare you and take my leave.
018	I bid you farewell, Nimul. The next time we meet, you will be drenched in corruption.
019	Urgh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
020	She got away!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
021	Nimul, are you hurt?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
022	Stay back... Wagi...nau...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
023	Why?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
024	The corruption... She got me. If you touch me, you will also...
025	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
026	Urgh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
027	Can you heal him?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
055	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
056	Ack!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
057	No, this isn't enough...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
028	Like Nimul said, he's been corrupted. On top of that, it's deep down in the core of his body...
029	What does that mean?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
030	This means that Nimul will become a Sinner at this rate...
031	No...!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0021
032	This isn't a matter of only healing his wounds. Even the very voices of the spirits that make up Nimul must be cut off from the corruption!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0018
033	Even for the Sephira, that's a nigh impossible task... Nimul...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
034	For now, let's tend to his injuries! Mira!
035	Ah, yeah!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
036	Do you have any other comrades? If you do, could you please bring them here?
037	Oh, of course! I'll go super-quick! But it sucks that my connection with them got cut off earlier...
038	Waginau, please help support Nimul. I'll protect your body from the corruption!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
039	Right!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
040	I have returned.
041	Speak.
042	Their ringleader, he who is named Nimul, has taken a direct attack of Beelzebub's corruption.
043	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
044	Regardless of his potential in magil or willpower, he will become a Sinner by daybreak tomorrow.
045	...
046	I see. Very well. That man poses quite the threat...but that is exactly why that had to be done.
047	I am eager to see if he has what it takes to become an ally of ours. Will he, or won't he...?
048	Now, I will take my leave. There remain the last of the Sephira to erase from this world.
049	Very well. However, if you are able to, refrain from killing as many as you can. The more humans you leave alive, the more that will fall into sin.
050	Understood.
051	No...
052	...
053	J-Julia...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
054	Is this really what you wanted?
