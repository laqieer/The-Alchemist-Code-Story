001	Urgh! Gah...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0043
002	A human...has surpassed me?
003	I already know all of your tricks. There is nothing you can show me in combat that I am not intimately familiar with.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
004	And yet...you still struck me down! How could a mere impersonation of me successfully stand its ground?!
005	I know all of it... None of it is new... And yet... And yet...!
006	Because each of us pitches in to do what we can. If one of us reaches out for help, another takes that hand and pulls us up. This is the way of humans.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
007	And this is why the potential of humans continues to grow.
008	And this is how I differ from you, Ouroboros. I do not shoulder all of it on my own.
009	Are you saying my failure here...is because I am but one being, alone?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0025
010	This is the end, Ouroboros. I have shown you our power. I have proven our resolve.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
011	This world is meant to change. Under the current state of the Belt Regions, humanity's way of life has become much too distorted and untenable.
012	And that's precisely why I need your help, too. Help me save the world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
013	What...?
014	Haha...hahahahahahaha!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0008
015	Why are you laughing?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
016	You're terribly mistaken, child of man. Your true trial starts here.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0039
017	Now that the floodgates are open, and I am no longer to serve as breakwater, you will continue to live within the sin and corruption you have spurred! Let it overtake you and wash you away!
020	Nimul! Get back!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
021	Ghah!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
022	What is this?!
023	My body has already fallen. The collapse of the world is imminent. It has already begun.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
024	Collapse?!
037	Now is the time to show me this potential in humanity you boast of...if it truly exists.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
038	This is a disaster humans have brought into being—Cursed Beasts without form, created by your own hands.
025	This shall be the final chance to create the world anew.
026	All the more reason for us to work together, Ouroboros!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
027	The Ceremony of Creation... The final sacrifice...is me.
028	...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
029	You've noticed, I'm sure. This huge mass we refer to as the world... And the magil needed to remake it all...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0030
030	It's everything. There is nothing beyond the Shell of the World—my flesh and blood.
031	But you may rejoice, human. The curtain now closes upon this convoluted creation myth, involving dragons and sin...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
032	As I, the last of the dragons, crumble away, the age of humans can truly begin.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
033	...I understand.
034	Nimul...
035	I'm sorry, Waginau. I'm going to need you to endure for just a bit longer.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
036	The Ceremony of Creation is about to begin.
