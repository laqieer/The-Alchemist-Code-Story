001	The Construct army vanishes in a cascade of flame.
002	Amidst the embers, the faint figure of the Director comes into view.
003	A portent of doom, or the birth of a new world order?
004	I stand ever above the far edge of humanity, yet distant ripples affect even the stillest pond.
005	What could you hope to gain from this?
006	...
007	Humans drive their own destruction, and in so doing, end their legacies.
008	Their suffering is entirely unnecessary.
009	You seek liberation.
010	But what are you, if you are not of Man?
011	The Director turns, their face still shrouded in deepest shadow, but Morrigan startles.
012	This burden I willingly carry before his ordained return.
013	And when we meet again once more upon this blighted land...
014	His will shall be made true.
015	The figure vanishes as the vision begins to fade of its own accord.
016	...
017	Catha, Macha - wake.
018	A sliver of dawn begins to pierce the glowing sky as Morrigan awakens for the final time.
019	[A complicated scry.]
020	[The players have assembled upon the stage.]
021	[Will we be satisfied watching...]
022	[...This strange play to its end?]
023	It remains to be seen.
024	The visions are not without notes of hope...
025	Perhaps when he regains more of his memories.
026	How will you change the world, Soren?
027	I look forward to it.
