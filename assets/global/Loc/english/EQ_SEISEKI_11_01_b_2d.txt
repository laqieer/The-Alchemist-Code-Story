001	Meanwhile...in the Desert Zone.
002	...Uggh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
003	I can't give up... Not yet! I have to hurry and tell Kanon...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
004	It is you... I never thought that I would meet you in the middle of the desert like this.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
005	?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
006	Kagura...? What are you doing here?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
007	Um... Do I know you?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
008	No, but I know you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
009	You were the one sealed in the Stone in Wadatsumi.
010	I also spent some time traveling with Kudanstein...
011	With Kudan...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
012	Ugh...gh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
013	You've been under this desert sun for too long. You shouldn't push yourself so hard.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
014	Is this...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
015	It's just water. There's no poison in it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
016	......
017	I'm not your enemy, even if I am not your friend.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
018	...Mm...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
019	Yeesh. Slow down.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
020	If that strange man hadn't appeared, I would have never found you here. You're lucky.
021	Strange...man?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
022	Some guy showed up and told me that you were here. He called himself the "guardian of the sand" or something, but seemed to just be some kind of desert dweller.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
023	Friend of yours?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
024	I don't...think so...
025	I suppose it doesn't matter. More importantly, what are you even doing here?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
026	This isn't the kind of place for a Captain of the Holy Guard.
027	Did you know anything about Kudan still being alive?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0003
028	What...? That guy is still alive?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
029	You didn't know?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
030	Hm... This is an interesting development.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
031	Come.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0003
032	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
033	If you're around, the likelihood of that guy showing up increases significantly. Come. I'll lend you a hand.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
034	...!
