001	Here he comes.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
002	I see. Just as you stated, even Fung Liu wasn't enough to stop him.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
003	Huzzzaaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
004	Orion! Waginau!
005	What a rowdy visitor. I arranged for you to be welcomed graciously.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
006	I'd like to return your generous welcome, but can you explain why I was greeted by an assassin?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
007	It appears orders weren't conveyed properly. My mistake...I apologize.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0034
008	A mistake? You gotta be kidding me!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
009	So...did you come all this way to point your weapon at me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
010	What...?
011	If that's the case then this talk is over. Waginau, I'll leave the rest to you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
012	Understood.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
013	Wait!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
014	What is it?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
015	You said that you could help me pursue absolute power that surpasses any in this world.
016	Exactly.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
017	I came here to ascertain the meaning of your words.
018	I see. Well then, listen.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
019	Tsk...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
020	I'll be waiting at the entrance. If something happens, call me right away.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
021	Got it.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
022	Hmph. So why are you pointing your spear at Emperor Orion?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
023	Don't get me wrong. I just came here to hear what you have to say. I have no intention of hanging around.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
024	Never mind. Well...what do you want to ask me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
025	What do you mean when you refer to absolute power?
026	I'm talking about an ancient power that is immense enough to affect the laws of the world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
027	An ancient power?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
028	You know about the brother and sister who created the Tower of Babel, right?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
029	Nimul and Emmel. They unified this world, created the Tower of Babel, and discovered Alchemy.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
030	How can I live on this continent and not know about them?
031	Having seen the other side of the Door of Truth, Nimul fell into utter despair and attempted to destroy the world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
032	However...it was his younger sister Emmel who prevented him.
033	Eventually, in order to protect the order of this world, Emmel created the Holy Guard.
034	Just so you know, I didn't come here to talk about folk tales.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
035	This isn't a folk tale. It's an actual story that leads up to this present day.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
036	The absolute power that I'm talking about is the same power that Nimul tried to use to destroy the world.
037	Are you saying it's the power that Nimul obtained?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
038	Yes. I am trying to achieve that power; the very power that will shake the laws of this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
039	Are you serious? How would you obtain that power?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
040	That power won't appear unless the balance of the world is disturbed.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
041	The balance of this world? What are you talking about? Explain it to me in a way that I can understand.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
042	This world is balanced by an extremely precise force that is supported by the Alchemy Source.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
043	The Alchemy Source...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
044	The Alchemy of Power that revolves around Nimul...can change the laws of this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
045	And the Alchemy of Love that revolves around Emmel...can protect the laws of this world.
046	Alchemy is comprised of these two different natures of Alchemy.
047	Power...and love...
048	What I am aiming for is the one polarizing side of the Alchemy Source that is the Alchemy of Power.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
049	The Alchemy created by Nimul...? How do you propose to obtain it?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
050	If we destroy the balance of this world, this power will no doubt show itself.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
051	The two different types of Alchemy that constitute the Alchemy Source.
052	Because there is a balanced equilibrium between these two forces, the world is kept in a state of silence.
053	In other words, if one of these forces of Alchemy were obtained and the equilibrium was destroyed...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
054	The embodiment of that Alchemy source will bring about an effect in this world.
055	There is a so-called "supreme judge" that maintains balance in this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
056	As long as that person maintains balance of the Alchemy Source, the embodiment of its force won't appear in this world.
057	A "supreme judge"?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
058	The one who maintains the balance of power and soothes the turbulence on this world. Their name bears that of absolute justice.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
059	Wait...are you talking about the Lord Commander?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
060	Yes. I guess you could say your slaying of Zain was a great step in the right direction.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
061	That man was placed in the position of "supreme judge", yet he attempted to lay his hands on the Alchemy of Power.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
062	If you had not stopped him...he would've had full sway over this world by now.
063	W-wait! Are you saying that I influenced the equilibrium of this world? That was never my intention...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
064	Regardless of your intent, the outcome is the same. It was your destiny to destroy this world's equilibrium.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
065	Destiny?! Nonsense!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
066	In any case, the moment that Nimul's Alchemy of Power manifests itself in this world is drawing nearer.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
067	Whatever the case, I will obtain that power. I will lead this world to its ideal state.
068	What world do you intend to create if you get that power?
069	It's quite simple. A world where only the fittest can survive—where those without power are not qualified to live.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0011
070	A world where only the fittest can survive?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
071	Kudanstein...how does this world reflect in your eyes?	VO_orione.orione_chara_1008
072	Ugly battles are waged across the land, fueled by hatred, envy, contempt...and vulgar emotions.
073	That is the current state of the world based on its natural equilibrium. Can you call this the ideal world?
074	I...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
075	The source of all this confusion is the lukewarm spirit of equality that has given birth to this balanced world.
076	You were helpless amidst the destruction of Wadatsumi, unable to do anything...
077	That's nonsense. If it were to become the kind of dog eat dog world you're suggesting, it would only increase the conflict...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
078	You're wrong there. A world where only the fittest can survive is based around the absolute guidelines of power.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
079	Those with power lead; those without it obey. There is no room for conflict to be born.
080	Look at the animals of this world. That is the true state of mankind.
081	... ...
082	Was the destruction of Wadatsumi when you began to seek power?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
083	!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
084	You were helpless admist the destruction of of Wadatsumi, unable to do anything...
085	That memory, which most would wish to turn their back on, is at your core.
086	The reason why you continue to protect the daughter of Wadatsumi's royal family is because you want to dispel the notion of your powerlessness.
087	Shut up! Don't act like you know me...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
088	There's nothing for you to deny. That is the true nature of humanity. Your way of thinking is correct.
089	...What?
090	It's not a strange thing to blame yourself when you are helpless...to seek power in order to change the future.
091	You understand well that power is absolute.
092	...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
093	With your immense determination, it's unlikely you'll fall to the darkness.
094	Kudanstein...I beseech you to seek further power.	VO_orione.orione_chara_1008
095	...Fall to the darkness?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
096	Captain Cadanova used to speak of that often. What does it mean?
097	There are two faces to the power we seek...that of light and dark.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
098	If the two are balanced it will aid the wielder as pure force.
099	And if they are not balanced?
100	The heart will be infiltrated with darkness. Eventually, you will no longer be able to separate yourself from it, and you will fall into the world of darkness.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
101	Is that the world that lies on the other side of the Door of Truth?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
102	Heheh. It's just a matter of not seeking more power that you can handle.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
103	With your determination, I am sure you will be able to obtain an extraordinary amount of power.
104	...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
105	However...right now, your determination appears to occasionally fluctuate.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
106	First of all, you must do whatever is possible to protect the source of your determination.
107	The source of my determination?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
108	I'm talking about Kagura.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
109	With her sealed in the Philosopher's Stone, the Paladins are heading to Ramproad Mountain in order to repair the Holy Sword Excalibur and release her.
110	Of course...they ultimately plan to use her to obtain the Mikaboshi.
111	Kagura...she's still alive!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
112	That's the end of our discussion. We're wasting time here.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
113	Don't get me wrong. I will not base my actions around your words.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
114	Of course. I am in no position to force your will.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
115	I will find my own path to travel.
116	Thanks for your time.
117	Honestly...he's a real handful.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
118	Don't worry about it.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
119	He will destroy the equilibrium of this world. As long as he fulfill his role, I have no complaints.
120	Hm. It appears we have an uninvited guest headed this way. What would you like to do about it?	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
121	Let them do as they please. I have no time to deal with them.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
