001	It must be tough shouldering all that responsibility by yourself.
002	I could say the same for you, Lady Asuka. After all, aren't you going to be engaged soon?
003	I overheard your exchange that day, you know.
004	Granted, he was speaking primarily of joining our houses officially by way of marriage... but a proposal is still a proposal, is it not?
005	Shion, please!
006	I-it's not like... he announced... anything...
007	Fufu. Look at you. You're as red as a cherry.
008	You've grown so much.
009	Shion places his hand on top of Asuka's and smiles at her.
010	Back to business, I suppose. There is plenty more to be done this night.
011	Like every other night, you mean.
012	Hmhm... That is true.
013	Let us be off, then. Surely you have many reports to handle as well.
014	Mm. That I do.
015	Hmm? What is it?
016	Oh!
017	Shion? What's wrong?
018	... ...
019	Let me hold you for a little while, Asuka.
020	It's just...
021	It's okay...
022	Shh...
023	Asuka, no matter what happens... I'll always watch over you.
024	Shion...
025	Hehe. I will, too.
026	[I guess some things really do never change...]
