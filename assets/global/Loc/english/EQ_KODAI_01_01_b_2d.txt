001	Before every beginning, there is an end.
002	Before the age of humanity, long before the regions became as they are, there was life on this world under a different heavenly order...
003	Its legacy now reduced to mere stories, which stand as remnants of that life once lived.
004	Though that life is long gone, the generations that followed are all its hopes made manifest.
005	These are the tales—the final throes—of those who would ultimately reveal themselves to be dragons...
006	Along with the humble story of a girl burdened with everything, and the foolish dragon who tried to save her.
007	I did not expect the erosion to have progressed so far already.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
008	Hierosolyma is obviously not the paradise it once was.
009	Yeah... Looks like we've failed, huh?
010	Well, I suppose that just means it's up to us to see that all is in good order before we leave this world.
011	Saving this world is the least we can do, really. We are going to be imposing our will upon her, after all.
012	You agreed to stand with us in that, did you not, Zafeiris?
013	I did, but still, Schmeier...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
014	Oh, don't be so stubborn! We're about to initiate her first test runs! Wipe that grimace off your face!
015	We wouldn't want the first expression our daughter sees to be something so dour, now, would we?
016	...
017	Oh, dear! It's time. Come back to the lab.
018	What...did I just see?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
019	That was me, as I was in bygone days. Quite different from what you see now, eh?
020	I suppose it would be more accurate to call it my past life, given the current state of things.
021	Ah, right. I'd almost forgotten that you're a Fallen now.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
022	Indeed. Those with souls corrupted and degenerated by sin are no longer the beings they once were.
023	Are we within a memory of some sort, then? I can't even touch anything. What am I to do here?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
024	Yes, this is my memory. Because I am a vestige of my former self, you are connected to and can see all that lies within me.
025	You will learn firsthand the power and skill of the dragons...along with the depths of their sin...
026	All of which would come together to form your new flesh and blood.
027	...
028	There you are! About time you showed up.
029	Are you...sure I'm qualified for this?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
030	I have no experience raising a child. We dragons are spawned complete and fully formed.
031	Furthermore, I've only seen this world through conflict. These claws, and the bloodstained battlefields they've been employed in, are all that I am.
032	Do you seriously believe I can play house like the humans do?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
033	It's a little late for such contentions, Zafeiris.
034	We've already discussed this. She needs an exceptionally stalwart custodian.
035	Otherwise, she'd never survive the coming world.
036	We haven't the luxury of another choice. You know this.
037	We dragons have made many mistakes, the worst of which is allowing the Shell of the World to degenerate as it has.
038	A system meant to protect us, now devouring the world we inhabit... We cannot ignore this. We must rectify this errancy.
039	The next generations—effectively visitors from another world—should not be burdened with such impossible circumstance.
040	The humans who've already rooted themselves in this world have started shaping their own society, though.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
041	And more of them continue to drift in unwillingly as we speak. Is there a way to stop that?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
042	There is not. Research on matters regarding this issue should be Ophioneus' domain.
043	I wonder what he's doing now...
044	I'm sure, like you, these humans are looking into this problem.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
045	Like us, you mean? Don't make it sound as though you're not with me on this.
046	It's our beautiful little daughter who's going to save the world, after all.
047	All phases finalized. Field structure nominal. Vessel construction complete.
048	Perfect! Welcome to the world, little one!
049	Can you hear us, Ouroboros?
050	Hnng... Ah...	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
051	Hmm? Are you not yet capable of functioning properly? Odd. I've designed you with a body comparable to what we dragons possess.
052	Ah... Agh...
053	Whoa! Careful, now.
054	Are you all right?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
055	Ah?
056	Schmeier, can she not speak?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
057	That shouldn't be the case. According to my readings, there aren't any functional issues with her structure.
058	She's most likely just not yet used to her body. Which stands to reason, given that she was forced into it.
059	Who...are...you?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0002
060	My name is Zafeiris.
061	Za...feiris?
062	Right. And you are the physical vessel housing Ouroboros, the consciousness of the Shell of the World.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
063	Ouro...? Shell? Con...sciousness?
064	Hahaha! Zafeiris, she's just a child, only but a few moments old!
065	Surely you don't expect her to understand all of that just yet!
066	How else was I meant to explain—?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
067	Let's just start with a name. What shall we call you?
068	A...name?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
069	Your own personal identifier. Let's see... How do you feel about...Lil?
070	It means "ocean" in our old tongue. Perfect for a body full of never-before-seen possibilities, don't you think?
071	Lil? I'm...Lil?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0031
072	That's right, Lil. Don't you worry, though. There's no rush. You'll learn everything you need to learn, little by little.
073	Your body is that of a dragon. It is timeless. You have all of eternity to learn, unlike us.
074	Hmph.
075	Learn?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_chara_1001
076	Yes. There's a lot of studying to do. Are you feeling up to it?
077	We'll teach you everything you need to know to save this world, sweet daughter of ours.
