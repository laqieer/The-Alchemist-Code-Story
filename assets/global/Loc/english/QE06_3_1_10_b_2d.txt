001	Forgive me...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0035
002	You know the rules. Any Blade Fox bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon. Do not falter.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
003	I-it's not that simple! This is a lot to ask...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
004	No one said it was simple. But it is your duty.
005	It may not bother me any, but I'm not Amane. She has her own way of thinking and her own sense of duty, ya know?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
006	I didn't ask for your opinion.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
007	Hyaaaaah!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0032
008	This is no time to bicker. We must hurry and find the Hidden Ogres!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
009	Really, though... To each their own, I always say. Everybody's got their own thing going on.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
010	And one thing is for sure: this never gets any easier. There's really got to be a better way.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0027
011	Consumed by corruption from a pure-blood demon, a human becomes the very thing we struggle against every day...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
012	There's still so much we don't know about the accursed Demon's Blood. Such as why it only afflicts the people of Wadatsumi.
013	According to the voice I've been hearing in my head:	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
014	The Alchemy dormant on the island permeated mankind after many years.
015	You think Alchemia is the cause of these mutations, then?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0045
016	Captain Ugachi! Now is not the time to pontificate! Please assist!
017	She's right. Let's put this think tank on hold and find those Hidden Ogres.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
018	Tch...
019	......
020	(We can't ignore the current crisis, but I do hope we come back to this topic of discussion. We may just be able to find a solution to everything if we can learn a little more about our past.)
021	Can you really afford to be lost in thought right now?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
022	What?!
023	...Aah!
024	Don't worry. I have no intention of killing you. You're the bait, after all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
025	Bait?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
026	You needn't concern yourself with that. Just sleep.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
027	Ngh!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
028	Amane? No! Snap out of it, Amane!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
029	Aza...mi...
030	We won't let y— —et her back— —Amane!!!
031	Urgh...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
032	Where am I?
033	We meet again.
034	You!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
