001	If we were gonna end up back here anyway, we should've just infiltrated it from the start.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
002	Edgar, have you visited the Beckrams' mansion before?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
003	I paid them a visit when I was unaware you'd been abducted by that massive-armed idiot.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
004	Alkemono and I came here together. Didn't we?
005	Squeak.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
006	Seriously. It's weirding me out now that you can't speak.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
007	When we were first here, this little guy started to go berzerk, so we had to retreat.
008	Hmph. In other words, he saved your life.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
009	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
010	You seem to be clueless about how terrifying the security system is here.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0002
011	The security Alkaroids are striding about leisurely, but the same doesn't apply to humans.
012	What do you mean?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
013	There is a sensor that responds as soon as it detects lifeforms.<br><br>
014	The second even a tiny fly enters the premises, a 1500 degree heat ray will turn it into a puff of smoke.
015	Plus, it's built in a way that this system can only be deactivated from within the mansion.
016	Whoa! Are you serious?! So if I had infiltrated the premises...!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
017	Alkemono, I'm sorry I called you an idiot at the time.
018	Squeak.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
019	Th-then what are we gonna do?! If that's the case, we can't get inside...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
020	There's a way. There's an underground passage. Tango.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0037
021	Yes, Don.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
022	I've been expecting this day to come. Looks like my research paid off.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
023	Squeak! Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0007
024	Yikes! Hounds!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
025	Tsk! If we hang around here, they'll close in on us! Let's head underground!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
