001	She's late.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
002	There is no way shopping for some plates could take so long. Something must have happened.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0021
003	Sure, she's taking a while, but she's also a Knight of Wratharis. I doubt we need to worry about her.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
004	Still...
005	Dang it, Moa. I take my eyes off of her for one moment, and she's gone! If she gets herself in trouble again, I'm just not going to care!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0030
006	You say that, but you seem very worried.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
007	I'm not!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
008	Sorry, sorry. Well, I've invited plenty of people, so I think I can now help out with... Uh, hey.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0008
009	Where's Plumeria?
010	That's what I'd like to know.	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
011	Uh... What?
012	What's wrong, Ankh? You seem irritated.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
013	You two missed a lot while you were out.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
014	...
015	Hello, everyone!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0002
016	Welcome back, Plumeria! Wait, what's up with all those flowers?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
017	Hehe, aren't they beautiful?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
018	I picked them from a field. I believe this should be enough to liven up the venue!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0008
019	You were out picking flowers?
020	I was!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
021	This is meant to be a happy party, so I wanted to add some more flair to our hospitality to bring happy smiles to our guests!
022	I see. So this is what kept you for so long.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
023	Perhaps I was not clear enough with my directions, but I absolutely did not ask you for this.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
024	Ankh?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
025	Why can you not just do as I say? That's all you needed to do in order for the preparations for this party to progress smoothly.	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
026	I'm...sorry. I just wanted this party to be—	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0035
027	Did you even stop to think how your self-indulgent decisions would inconvenience everyone here?
028	Hey, uh, Ankh? Let's calm down a little. Come on, you want me to pour you some tea?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0002
029	Ah, about that...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
030	Unfortunately, Miss Plumeria has already scattered all of my tea leaves on the floor.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
031	I'm so sorry!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
032	Do not be. It was a select brand, but there is no use in crying over spilled milk.
033	Regardless, I am beyond the soothing of a simple cup of tea.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
034	Not that it matters. Perhaps a brew of the legendary Parfaire, a tea that is said to have the finest fragrance and flavor, would pacify my temper, but we certainly don't have that here.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
035	A brew of the what?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
036	The legendary Parfaire tea... Supposedly the aroma of it is reminiscent of Bergamot tea without relying on artificial fragrances. Though I've only heard of it in passing rumor...
037	Come on, Ankh. You can't expect anyone to be able to get that for you.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
038	Clearly I was not being serious. According to the rumors, it is produced somewhere in Wratharis, but even I couldn't find it.
039	Regardless, we do still need to find some tea. It would be a shame if we cannot serve tea at this party.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
040	Parfaire...
041	A legendary tea, eh? I heard of it once while on a mission in Wratharis.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
042	Supposedly it's prepared for some festival in a small village somewhere, and they won't part with it no matter how much you offer to pay.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
043	...
044	I understand. I will go get that tea!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0037
045	Plumeria? What are you...?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
046	With that legendary tea, Ankh and all those who attend the party will smile, yes?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_chara_1001
076	So I will—
047	Enough!	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
048	Eek!
049	You can't simply go to the market and buy yourself some Parfaire. That's why it's considered to be legend.
050	It's somewhere in Wratharis. That's all that is known. And you think you can just go out and get it?
051	D-did I offend you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0020
052	Cease promising to do things you can't do.	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
053	Can't you see how your thoughtless behavior is causing more trouble for all those around you?!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1013
054	Ankh! Chill out!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0012
055	Oh, I...
056	I-I'm s-sorry... I...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0036
057	Ah...
058	Ankh, come on...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
059	You need not say more. I know.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
060	I am not sure why she affects me so. Why can she not just do as I say?
061	If she would simply follow my directions, things would progress far more efficiently. And yet...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
062	That's probably because she has her own image of what hospitality means.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
063	Her own image?
064	You have your own idea of what hospitality means, right?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
065	Well, she's got her own ideas about hospitality or White Day or whatever.
066	Those who are most earnest about their ideals can't help but persist with their will, no matter how irrational that may be.
075	Such a straightforward approach to life and ideals can change a person. Even someone like me.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0037
067	Trust me, I know someone just like that.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
068	...
069	Yeah, you're both just stubborn people who stick to their guns no matter what.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
070	For now, let's go find our little Plumeria. We should make sure she's okay.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
071	Fine...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
072	You'll pay for what you just said to us! You think it's funny to taunt us for being so miserably unpopular?!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0003
073	Oh, geez. I'd feel sorry for myself if I said a line like that. Are you guys trying to start a fight?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
074	D-dammit! We're gonna wreck this stupid party!	VO_mafia.mafia_battle_0019
