001	So this is it...the cave where the Sephirium is...	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
002	You called it the Temporal Cave, didn't you?
003	Ye-yes. According to the ancient traditions, it is said to be a passage that connects this world with the underworld.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
004	The truth is that it's just a regular cave.
005	(But...I'm scared. Deep within here is...an ancient darkness...the old world of death.)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043
006	Hmm. All right. Let's go then.
007	Yep.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
008	Huh...oh!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
009	(Why aren't they afraid of this darkness?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0017
010	Ohh...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
011	(I...need to go too!)
012	It's pretty dark in here. Careful, dad.	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1002
013	Don't treat me like an old man.
014	Yeah, yeah.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
015	... ...
016	...Sorry, but I don't like you.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
017	I don't understand how you could be so frightened of dying while you're still alive.
018	Maybe what you're really afraid of is being alive.
019	Or better put...you're so afraid of dying that you've become scared of living.
020	Are you...really alive right now? Or are you dead even as you live? That's how it appears to me.
021	We are those who unite wisdom.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
022	(It is human nature to fear death. It is inevitable for those who live to die. Afraid of death?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
023	(Dead even as I live...? Unite wisdom? My...compatriots? I don't understand. What...)
024	(What am I afraid of?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
025	Le-let's go back!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0017
026	?
027	Seriously? What are you talking about?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
028	We can't! We must not go any further!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
029	Look. I don't mind you being afraid, but could you not get in the way of our—	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0017
030	No, you don't understand! Ku Yogi...you...you're going to die soon!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0040
031	Yeah. I know that.
032	...Huh?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
033	I'm sick. Miuna knows that as well.
034	...If you know that then why are you doing this? Why?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0021
035	...There was this man.
036	...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
037	He came to me with a request to weld a weapon. He wanted a sword that would lose to no other.
038	There was a strong sense of determination in his voice-an unwavering belief in something. It was the voice of a man who had resolved himself.<br><br>
039	Resolve...	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
040	Yes...resolve. However, I am a blacksmith hired by a man of a certain status.
041	I'm not supposed to accept requests from other individuals. That's why I turned him down. I turned him down, but...
042	Heh. I was moved by that man...by the resolve in Zehn's voice.
043	Yes...I don't have long to live. That's why...
044	For my final creation as a blacksmith, I've been itching to make him that sword.
045	...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
046	("Until the moment I die, I want to listen to the voice of the iron that I strike, weld, and sharpen!" That is Ku Yogi's way of living...)
047	Uzuma...I won't discount your fears or your way of thinking. We can't help what we're afraid of. Still...
048	Can you help me complete my final creation until the end? Please.
049	(But, still...this man is headed to his death! If he continues this way...Ku Yogi will die!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
050	I don't know... Wh-what should I do...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_1019
051	If you don't know, then I'll tell you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
052	Come with us. That's the answer.
053	...!!!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
054	Seriously. You guys again. You really are an annoying bunch, aren't you?
055	Say what you like. We are here to accomplish our mission.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
056	Your mission, huh? Well, the same goes for me. I'm here to complete a very important job.
057	Enough! How dare you place our noble purpose and your so-called job in the same boat!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
058	How dare you! Everyone carries their own purpose in life. I'd appreciate if you didn't pass judgment on mine.
059	...It appears we can't see eye to eye.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
060	For once I agree with you! Miuna!
061	Yep!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
062	Heh. I summon you...slave of wisdom...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
063	Gurrrr...!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0019
064	They've summoned a monster...?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
065	Now!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0012
066	...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0022
067	Hyahahah! We're taking Uzuma with us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
068	Tsk! Those scum!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0043
069	Gurrraaaaahhh!!!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_b
070	Ack! Get out of the way, monster!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
071	We've finally...finally obtained Uzuma! Our long-cherished wish can finally be achieved!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
072	Your long-cherished wish? What are you talking about?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
073	Heh...heheheh...hyahahah! We've found it! Behold!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
074	Huh?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
075	Oh! That's...the Sephirium!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_1011
076	Yes! This is the resin secreted from Sephiron. It is literally Sephiron's blood!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
077	We can now fulfill our long-cherished wish...we can resurrect our mother, the giant green tree Sephiron!
078	Re-resurrect Sephiron...?! Is that possible?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0021
079	It is. All we need is the Sephirium, you, Uzuma...and that hourglass of yours.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
080	Why me...and why the hourglass?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
081	So you had it all this time without knowing? That hourglass contains the Sands of Life that once nourished the roots of Sephiron.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
082	That sand can nurture various life...it is the only substance that can restore life to Sephiron.
083	?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
084	After we plant the seeds of Sephiron reproduced from the Sephirium and allow it to germinate in that sand...the only remaining ingredient will be you, Uzuma.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
085	Your flesh and blood will serve as nourishment!
086	...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0017
087	Rejoice! Your body will serve as a sacrifice to Sephiron! Hyahahahahah!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
088	...!!!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0022
089	Ah, so gathering from what I heard from your speech, your mission is to plant a tree, huh?
090	?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
091	Ku Yogi...Miuna?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
092	Well, I'm sure it's an important tree, but...I'm not fully convinced that it's worth exchanging the life of this young girl for.
093	You...! How did you get this far?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
094	Here's how it is: I'm practically blind.
095	...No way.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
096	Instead, my hearing is exceptionally good. All I did was follow your loud voices.
097	(He can't see? It didn't seem that way at all until now. More importantly...)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0021
098	(Did he come all this way without being able to see...and being fully aware of his own impending death?)
099	(Is that what it means to be resolved? What strength...the blinding radiance of life!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
100	Dad, the Sephirium is here.	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
101	Yes, even I can tell. It's still alive. I can feel its strength.
102	But it's resin, not ore, right? Can you really make a weapon out of it?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
103	Heh. Sephirium's resin is many times harder than your average ore. There won't be any problem. Besides...
104	I'm Ku Yogi. Whether it be resin or diamonds, there is no substance I cannot use to make a weapon out of.
105	Yeah, got it. All right, let's get our hands on it...even if we have to use force!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
106	We're not going to let a blind man and a brat rob us of our Sephirium!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
107	It's not just us. There's her as well.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
108	Huh...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
109	Hey! Scaredy-cat! You're afraid of dying, right?!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1015
110	At this rate, you're going to be turned into fertilizer for that tree!
111	...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
112	(I can feel Miuna's radiance! It's blinding! How can people shine so brightly?!)	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
113	(I want to shine as well!!!)
114	Don't tell me you're willing to remain silent while they kill you!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
115	No! No, of course not! I'm going to live!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0020
116	Haahhh!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0032
117	Aghh...?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
118	What?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
119	Not bad! Let's go!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0044
120	Okay!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
121	We won't allow it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
