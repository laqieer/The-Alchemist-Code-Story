001	Urgh!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
002	What's the matter, usurper? Has your contract run its course already?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0005
003	No! I can...keep going...
004	(I've got to. But I've already gone through three offerings...)	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0031
005	(Pain, taste, and touch. If you should lose any more of yourself, it may interfere with your ability to fight.)
006	(If you were a dragon, or even a Fallen, you could manage. But as a human, you lack the fortitude that's required.)
007	...!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
008	It looks like you've exhausted all of your options. Now is the time...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
009	For you to be gone from my sight!
010	Ghh... Adhere to the...Dark—
011	Curses! She...hit my...lungs!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0022
012	Offering your ability to feel pain has led you to suffer tremendous physical damage without knowing it. You must stop this. You won't be able to survive much more punishment.
013	...!
014	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Pride!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
015	And so the Child of God has come.
016	That's right. I'm here.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
017	I've still got a score to settle with you, after all.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
018	Took you...long enough.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
019	Sorry about that. But we fight together now.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
020	Inconceivable.
021	Nimul, bearer of the recreation of humanity's future... Why have you brought others into your struggle?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
022	You have the power to realize your every whim—to change the Truth of the world as you see fit, and take whatever form you wish within that Truth.
023	No other has power that even comes close to yours. No others need be involved with your struggle. So, why have you chosen to subject them?
024	You should have figured that out by now, Ouroboros. Despite everything you can do, your perspective is awfully limited.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
025	Pardon?
026	No matter how much power I obtain, this simply isn't something I can do on my own. Nothing new will be born from my will alone.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
027	Differing opinions and fresh perspectives have always been the driving force behind all of human progress.
028	It is you who lack understanding in these matters, Child of God. Novelty and perspective are irrelevant. Perfection requires neither.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0016
029	The ultimate form of this world is a perfect circle, spinning as instructed on a singular axis—under a singular will. Further axes only lead to instability.
030	If all that's true, Ouroboros, then why are you not alone? Why do you require others to do your bidding?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
031	...
032	The one known as Bianca is similar to you, is she not? And yet, very different.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
033	But I believe she shares the same origin as you. And if that's the case, it begs the question:
034	Why does she exist? Are you not the perfect, complete being? Are you not the singular axis upon which the world spins?
035	I do not know the intentions of the dragons that created us.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
036	But if your assertion is that I am incomplete...that I alone am not enough to serve as god to this world...
037	Then I shall show you evidence to the contrary!
038	My name is Ouroboros—Ouroboros Legacy. I represent the will of the old world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
039	Long ago, the dragons created a canopy for the world, to prolong the life of all its creatures.
040	Yet despite its protection, this world is now coming to an end.
041	Know that by surpassing me, you are surpassing the once-prosperous world itself, for that is I!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
043	Ugh! The magil is too dense. Our attacks can't get through!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
044	"Adhere to the dark commandments!"	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0004
045	...I can barely withstand this. I won't be able to keep it up much longer!
046	I'll clear a path.
047	Wait! Waginau!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
048	Am I understanding correctly that every time you use that ability, you have to sacrifice some part of yourself?
049	That's a heavy burden to bear, and you don't need to bear it alone.
050	I am your attendant, though, am I not?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
051	That was my responsibility at the start of it all. And even now, it is the one thing I truly take pride in.
052	Waginau...
053	Now's not the time to hesitate, Nimul! Go!
054	(Zafeiris!)	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
055	(You wish to fight once more? Very well. State your pledge.)
056	(It seems my lady already knows that her power never matched that which the dragons once possessed, and she understands the implications of that fact.)
057	(I'll give up half of my world. I will pledge my right eye.)	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
058	That is certainly sufficient.
059	Here. Take this.
060	...! This is... Ah!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
061	"Adhere to the dark commandments!"	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0032
062	"Devour all that impedes our path!"
063	What?!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0026
064	Nimul! Now!
065	Right!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
066	"I am Transcender of the Seven Gates!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
067	...Did... Did we do it?
068	It landed, but...
069	Most amusing.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0046
070	The very moment this world is to meet its end, an adversary with the power to actually wound me suddenly appears.
071	Yet, you are still inadequate.
072	No...! Her magil output is increasing even further!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
073	The wall of corruption that separates the regions of this world...is now a part of me.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
074	I am the last and most fearsome Cursed Beast of them all!
075	So tell me, human. Do you truly have the conviction to bear all the sins of this world?
076	No...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
077	It's all corruption...as far as the eye can see!
078	Augh! My body's being...swallowed?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
079	Want... I want...
080	Envy... Wrath... Lust... Gluttony... Greed... Sloth...
081	Why...won't you...succumb...?
082	I've thought about this so much. How many times have I cursed this world for its unfair, unjust ways?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
083	How could I possibly stand to see the world end on such a low note...
084	...without fighting to make it better?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0013
085	That light...
086	"Save us, the lost souls!"
087	That voice...
088	That's Emmel! Even now, she's still protecting the tower!
089	Which means...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
090	She's still giving this her best effort. And as her older brother, I need to make sure I do my part, too, so that effort isn't in vain!
091	Hmm...?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0019
092	Ouroboros...
093	I'm going to take this world from you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
094	Ah... I see you've taken back the tower. But what do you think such pointless struggling can possibly accomplish at this late stage?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0012
095	"The Power of Alchemy is not solely for creating wealth!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
096	"In other words, my soul will become a new, refined extreme!"
097	This is the Dragon Realm! How could a human...?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0025
098	The seven Cursed Beasts who serve as the tower's foundation have granted me their power.
099	Hmph. Even with a Dragon Realm at your disposal, nothing can help you overcome the difference in power between us.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
100	You're right. There's no way that I alone could ever gain enough power to defeat you. You are, after all, the very world itself.
101	And that's why we're all going to fight you as one.
102	All of you?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0019
103	Yes. All of the people I've met on my journey. Those I've seen eye-to-eye with, and those I haven't. Those I could save, and those I couldn't. I call upon them all now.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
104	To each and every one of you...I give my gold, that you may hear my plea!
105	Alchemy isn't something I ever meant to keep for myself. From the very start, I wanted it to be a resource available to every single person.
106	And once everyone had learned it, and mastered it, I'd hoped they could use it to make the world a better place!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
107	What sheer absurdity.
108	Do you know what will come of you should you freely give out the Truth—the Wisdom you've gained?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
109	You will no longer be able to function as a vessel. You will lose your sense of self, distributing it among countless others!
110	And what of it? I'll do whatever it takes to change this world!
111	World, hear my ideals!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
112	It's been a while since Nimul and the others set out for Superbia Belt.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
113	And the world seems to be changing rapidly, all of a sudden.
114	Is that why we've been summoned here, then?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0006
115	The Fallen throughout all the regions have become a lot more active of late, and I'd really prefer not to leave this Belt Region if at all possible.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
116	Are you implying that this is because of what's happening in Superbia Belt?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
117	...! Could it be?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0025
118	The barrier of corruption is thinning. Someone is consuming the sinful magil filling the world, which is causing the uptick in Fallen activity.
119	The sinful magil is as vital to the Fallen as the air we breathe is to us. Without it, they cannot exist.
120	So what you're saying is, the Fallen are starting to run out of air and are at risk of suffocating, which is causing them to rampage?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0045
121	Precisely. Aren't you a smart cookie?
122	Okay. I understand the problem, then, but what can we do about it? Why did you call us here?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0003
123	What Nimul's embarked on is truly something big. So big, in fact, that he'll constantly be in need of more people to help till it's over and done with.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
124	Are we to go assist him, then?
125	With the barrier of corruption as fragile as it is, now might be the best time to do so.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
126	If I draw upon the crystallized magil of this region—the Stone of the Gods—I can use Space-Time Manipulation to get us to Superbia Belt.
127	Thing is, if I did that, I'd also be exhausting the area's source of magil, which would have...consequences.
128	There's not really any point to the town floating in the air anymore. It shouldn't be that much of an issue.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
129	Are you sure about that?!
130	Nimul says he wants to change this world. I believe in him, so I want to do what I can to chip in from here.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0008
131	Besides, this is a land of science and engineering. We've been researching technology to help the island get along even without magil, though we haven't exactly been public about it.
132	Minario seemed so confident, and it really motivated me to join this effort...	VO_slba.slba_sys_0030
133	But this battle has become so much harder than anyone had ever imagined.
134	Don't spread yourself too thin, Sulva. We're all working together here. Being part of a team means we help cover one another's shortcomings. We'll make it through this!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
135	Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
136	Ire and Invidia are allies now, and if that can happen, anything is possible.
137	How are you holding up, Ambrosia?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0002
138	Not well, if I'm being honest!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0039
139	My magic isn't doing squat here!
140	Direct attacks don't seem so effective, either.
141	Ambrosia! That's a phantom built from past memories, made through Alchemy!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
142	Regular techniques are just gonna bounce right off of it like they're nothing! That's why you can't seem to hit it!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
143	Hmm?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
144	Ah, now that you mention it, weren't the dragons much the same way?
145	Do you have a plan for dealing with it, Ambrosia?
146	If I did, you think our Belt Region would've been destroyed by the Cursed Beast?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
147	......
148	Ain't gonna stop me from trying, though! "Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!"	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0032
149	That won't do a thing. You're wasting your efforts.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0014
150	Well, live and learn, I guess. Mira! Nyx! How've you been fighting this joker?
151	Alchemy! We've been using Alchemy!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0003
152	We got the power from Nimul. It directly manipulates the target itself, so we can ignore their magil density.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
153	If you aren't going to present any challenge, then you're worthless. Begone!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0004
154	Agh...!
155	Winnick!
156	I... I will fight! Fight! ...Fight...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
157	No matter the cost...I must protect... What am I protecting? What is it?!
158	Aaaagh!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0042
159	Urk...!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0022
160	She's so powerful!
161	Let's go, Mira, Nyx! We'll join, too!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
162	Right! We've gotta keep at it! There's no time to stand around!
163	If we all focus our attacks together, it should have some effect!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
164	It sounds like you're having a hard time. Thank you for letting me know.
165	Ngh!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0043
166	Everyone's out there fighting, giving their all. There's got to be something I can do to help...
167	――...――......――
168	Huh? What was that?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
169	This voice doesn't sound like the spirits. Wait, I think I've heard this voice somewhere before...
170	Isn't it...?
171	It's rare to see you so languid, Eulalia.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0003
172	...Julia?
173	Yes. It's been such a long time, hasn't it?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
174	Are we in...Sephira Village?
175	We are not.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0039
176	Huh?
177	We are inside your mind. The injuries you've been dealt by that woman named Matia are tormenting your very soul.
178	I see. So this is how the sinful magil comes to be. It's created inside of us all.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0022
179	Precisely. It is born from within each and every one of us. However...
180	Hear my ideals!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
181	He can teach you how to dispel it. He will show you the way.
182	Give me your hand.
183	A-all right. I hadn't wanted to rely on you, after you died. It just didn't feel right...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
184	But I'm sure observing what's happening to the world must be unbearable even for those who've already departed it.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0003
185	No, no, no! It's not enough! I need more! More! More!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0032
186	We can't...let it end here...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0022
187	Wait. What's that sound?
188	"I am the priestess of the Forest of Suga. I hear the voices of the skies, the winds, and the earth."	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
189	...And I'll be relying on that halberd of yours, one last time.
190	Who's there?!
191	This is our first time crossing paths. I am from a line of once renowned soldiers.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
192	And I cannot even bear to look at you, traitor. Therefore, I shall cut you down.
193	I am Julia of the Forest of Suga, Protector of Sephira and descendant of your line. And this is to be your final stand.
194	Who...?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
195	She's an ally. Would you lend us your aid in battle, Julia?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
196	I would be honored, Eulalia. Let us ready our counteroffensive!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
