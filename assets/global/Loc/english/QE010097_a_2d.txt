001	The Holy Guard are pursuing us at a tremendous speed.
002	They seem to be in quite a hurry. Well then...we part ways here.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
003	Huh...?! W-wait! We told you we'll persuade—	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
004	No, it's all right, Logi.
005	If we encounter the Holy Guard and the Lizard Brigade is present, it will likely result in a conflict.
006	It would be better if we split up and you headed to Valderik. I'm guessing that's what you had in mind.
007	...Well, something like that.
008	The road ahead is still long. It doesn't hurt to have fewer victims.
009	I want to ask you one thing.
010	Your words... Can I perceive them as the remarks of an honorable knight of Wratharis?
011	Do you think I'll try to run away?
012	I told you... We're traveling with you, our sworn enemies. We're also determined in our actions.
013	Well... Not that my words matter if you can't believe me.
014	... ...
015	... ...
016	...Very well.
017	I, Zeke Crowley, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, respectfully accept your proposal.
018	...!
019	B-but father...! If we move separately, it will put them in further danger!
020	I learned this from traveling with them, but they are strong.
021	They also possess the strength to live by their beliefs and to be undaunted by anything.
022	Do not worry, Agatha. They will keep their promise and show up at our meeting location. As a fellow knight, I believe this.
023	Father...
024	I see. So this is Zeke, the hero of the Kingdom of Envylia. I better understand now why my predecessors struggled against you.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0044
025	Sabareta, the next time we meet will be at the seat of peace negotiations.
026	Make sure you get there.
027	Right back at you.
028	Don't let your guard down. Those negotiations will only matter if you are present there.
029	Father! Sabareta!
030	As if responding to Logi's voice, Agatha, whose face had been lowered in thought, suddenly looks up.
031	Father! I will accompany the Lizard Brigade!	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0005b
032	What?!
033	Agatha!
034	I'm certain that Dias will draw his sword if he encounters the Lizard Brigade. It's my role to stop that from happening!
035	I promise I will protect you the people of Wratharis.
036	Father, please allow me to go—for the sake of bringing peace to the continent of Babel!
037	I doubt you would listen even if I tried to stop you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
038	My apologies, Sabareta.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0036
039	Oh well.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0030
040	The inadept Lizard Brigade accepts the young lady as our bodyguard.
041	Father! Sabareta!
042	Agatha, you better not push yourself too hard, okay? Let's end this 20-year conflict between Envylia and Wratharis together!
043	Yes!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0005
044	Logi and Agatha grasp each other's hands firmly and convey their determination.
