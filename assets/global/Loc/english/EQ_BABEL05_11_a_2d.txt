001	The birthday I lost my parents...
002	What's your name?
003	Cheryl.
004	Your parents were researching sorcery in Slothstein. Do you have any thoughts about what they were doing?
005	No.
006	Discontent with simply studying magic, they overreached by breaking the taboo on Alchemy to study the very foundations of magic itself.
007	Would you like to see your parents?
008	No.
009	Your parents seemed to feel that they needed to understand the truth of Alchemy.
010	What do you think of that?
011	I would say that it is foolish nonsense.
012	Here I am again.
013	The country of sloth, ever dependent upon the power of magic, the applied art of Alchemy.
014	In this, my hateful homeland, I was never indolent. I knew only self-control.
015	I recoiled from the things I loved, and instead took all that I loathed upon myself.
016	I was not a greedy child. I didn't ask for much.
017	So long as I was good, my parents were always kind to me, but...
018	We never went on trips together as a family, or anything like that.
019	I suppose they had little time to spend with me. Looking back, I merely surmise that they must have enjoyed their work very much.
020	I never sought anything, yet still I lost so much.
021	The only thing I ever asked for was that we might stay together. I wished for nothing else.
022	Helpless rage will inevitably morph into twisted hate.
023	I knew this.
024	Yet, for the first time in my life, I began to desire something. I wished for it, over, and over, and over again.
025	I wanted Alchemy to cease to exist.
026	Slothstein, Real Heaven - Lowest Level of the Slums
027	Cheryl!
028	I haven't seen you in a while, Courage.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
029	You could try contacting me once in a while.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
030	Aren't you happy to see me?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
031	I didn't say you aren't welcome.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0005
032	How are you getting along with Reagan?
033	Oh! You have to hear this! I just mentioned that it's been so many years since father left, and do you know what he said to me?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
034	He said, "Knowing you, if you saw him again, you'd end up sobbing and burying your face in his chest."	VO_courage.courage_chara_1008
035	Can you believe that?! I'm not talking to him right now.	VO_courage.courage_chara_2008
036	Hmhm. It's good to see that nothing has changed around here.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
037	Hey! What's that supposed to mean?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
038	Well, this is the fourth time you've told me this story.
039	The sixth, actually. It's still bugging me, so there'll probably be a seventh.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0040
040	May we come in?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
041	Sure. It's messy, though.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
042	Anyway, shut up, will you?	VO_courage.courage_chara_1001
043	I haven't even said anything yet!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
044	You need my help, right?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
045	Well, no, I—
046	Your face says it all.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0010
047	That's not really—	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
048	Spit it out already!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0012
049	You're the one who told me to shut up!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
050	So what if I did?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0005
051	Huh?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
052	Well?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
053	Courage, please.
054	Who is this, anyway?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0001
055	Her name is Lofia. She's currently on the run, due to some...special circumstances.
056	And you are?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
057	This is Courage. She is perhaps the most outstanding gunner in all of Babel.
058	Cheryl! Did you have to say it like that?!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0047
059	There's no need to be bashful.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
060	There's nothing more embarrassing than when your family talks big about you in front of strangers.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0050
061	F-family? W-well, that's... I...!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0047
062	Hah! Look who's blushing now!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0023
063	Are the two of you related?
064	My parents used to take care of Courage, back when they were still in good health.
065	Yeah, right after my father disappeared.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
066	...
067	Hey, you! What do you think you're looking at? My eyes are up here!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0012
068	Wha—?! No! I wasn't...! I was just thinking that your outfit was really nice, that's all.
069	See? I knew your eyes were wandering!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0039
070	N-no, I really wasn't...!
071	Oh, Nyx. You've gone all red. I'm surprised at you!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0028
072	No, no, no! You've got it all wrong!
073	I must say that I do not appreciate this behavior, Nyx. This is no way to treat one's host.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
074	Will the three of you cut it out already?! I don't have time for this!
075	You've mentioned that, but your eyes were awfully busy just now.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0015
076	Urgh!
077	I just couldn't help but notice how nice her clothes and accessories are, that's all!
078	Huh? Really? Well, thanks, I guess.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0048
079	Her outfit, huh? Yeah, right.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
080	Accessories, indeed!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0045
081	Oh, come on!
082	Look at him, trying to act all charming.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
083	I definitely caught his eyes lingering on several places where there are no accessories.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
084	No fair! Don't gang up on me!
085	These are all homemade. I use a special magical filament to run Alchemia through them and make them glow.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
086	Aren't they lovely?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0023
087	Y-yeah... Super pretty.
088	(There are gadgets in this time that I've never seen before, and the people here wield Alchemia in ways I've never even heard of it being used.)
089	(Who knew you could use Alchemia for things like this?)
090	You can still feel a little buzz from the Alchemia when you touch them. Here.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
091	O-oh, really?
092	Just what is that hand of yours reaching for, Nyx?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0028
093	C-Courage! What do you think you're doing?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
094	Huh? I-I was talking about my accessories, not me! The accessories!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
095	Nyx! Nyx! Hey, Nyx!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
096	What do you want?!
097	Why don't we step outside for a bit?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
098	Sure. J-just let me think in peace for a moment.
099	(I'm such an idiot!)
100	(What was I thinking?!)
101	(I can't even think about touching anything under these circumstances!)
102	Can we talk about something else now?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
103	Other than your work as a mercenary and the gunner competitions that sometimes take place in other countries, you are always home, are you not?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
104	Well, you never know... Father might come back someday! Don't forget, I have those maintenance jobs from time to time, too.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
105	Real Heaven is a slum city that you will not find on any map. It suits our purposes well.
106	In the extreme case that something should happen, however, Courage will protect you.
107	You want me to watch this kid, too?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0001
108	I can protect myself!
109	Remind me, Courage... What is your daily training routine?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
110	Huh? I go up to the clock tower after every meal and scope out the town with my sniper rifle, three times a day. Why?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
111	Whoa!
112	Wow!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
113	What? You got something to say?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0012
114	You have to keep an eye out for your father, just in case.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
115	You know it! I can't afford to miss him!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0038
116	So if there happened to be someone suspicious near Lofia, here, would you notice them?
117	Urgh! You're always lumping things on me!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0029
118	You would be doing me a big favor.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0041
119	That's what you always say!
120	It would only be for a little while, as long as it takes for me to make the short trip to Northern Pride.
121	Then I'll come straight back here to see you.
122	...
123	You know, with Lofia here to mind the house in case of your father's return, you could even go outside of the slums to search for him.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
124	Consider my magic at your disposal. Just so you know, I can't make anything but dessert, though.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0037
125	...
126	It's fine. I have other options for a house-sitter.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
127	Other options...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
128	I suppose you just up and left without telling your friends?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
129	I can't really talk about it.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0035
130	Hmph.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0044
131	(She just left without telling them anything, huh?)
132	(Or maybe... She really couldn't talk about it, to them, either.)
133	Fine. I'll do it. I might as well.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0045
134	Thank you!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0033
135	I don't really get what's going on, but once this is all over... Make sure you tell your friends about it, all right?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
136	I'm sure they'd appreciate it.
137	I will now present my account of what has occurred before the Holy Order. All of the evidence I need has been recorded in my monocle.
138	I expect that my investigation into the Holy Guard will progress much more quickly with the full might of the Inquisition behind it.
139	Your unjust persecution, Lofia, should also be swiftly resolved. You will only have to hold on a little while longer.
140	...
141	I didn't think I'd get to see her...my friend...again.
142	Thank you, Cheryl. You've done so much for me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0034
143	There's no need for that. You are the one who made this possible, Lofia.
144	In fact... You saved me.
145	What are you talking about?
146	I refuse to live my life being controlled and used by those in power.
147	Power must be controlled. I will be the one to keep it in check, and to pass judgment on those who would misuse it.
148	Now, the opportunity to do so is upon me.
149	I must live long enough to see it done.
150	The Space-Time Manipulator!
151	Huh?!
152	What was that?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
153	I can hear the ringing of a bell, and... Who is that speaking?
154	Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, so that I may see you.
155	Wait, this is...!
156	Where the hell is this voice coming from?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
157	Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.
158	Mira?!
159	Now, come!
160	Ahhhhhh!	シェリル・ロフィア
161	Chance Encounter!!!
162	What in the world?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
163	Wh-where are we?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
164	Phantoms?! Wait, no, that can't be right.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
165	Chance Encounter.
166	A space-time technique which, for a limited time, pulls together people who hold the same convictions from their separate times.
167	Even people who have no idea what's going on? Isn't that kinda rude?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
168	Well... It is somewhat random.
169	It's a big help, either way.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
170	Nyx...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
171	What?! How do you know Nyx?!
172	No, you aren't Nyx at all. Where are we?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
173	H-how did we get here? Just a second ago we were—	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
174	Grooooorrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0001
175	Ahh!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0022
176	What manner of...?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
177	I have no idea what's going on, but they're not our enemies, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
178	Probably not!
179	Yo.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
180	Yes?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
181	You wanna lend us a hand?
182	Who are you, anyway, old man? You're suspicious.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
183	Heh. I'm not an old man. Call me Mister Will.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0015
184	Only an old man would want to be called "Mister".	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
185	What?! The hell kinda logic is that?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
186	Besides, Will is an old man's name.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
187	Oh, is it now! Is that so? Hell no, that ain't so!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
188	Are those...Demonic Soldiers?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0021
189	Now how do you know that, pretty lady?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
190	P-pretty lady?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
191	Yeah, you. Don't you like it?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
192	W-we only just met!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0050
193	Was I being too forward?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0035
194	N-no, not at all! I mean, I...! I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement.
195	Anyway, it doesn't really matter who you guys are right now.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
196	We don't have the strength to fight them at the moment, so would you mind doing us a favor and helping out?
197	To what end?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
198	Our survival.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
199	Y-your eyes are all red. Have you been crying?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
200	Someone very important to me just passed away. I want to live on, for their sake.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
201	So, please... Please help us.
202	...
203	Very well. I accept your request as reasonable and just.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_1001
204	Cheryl?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
205	I need no reason to execute these disgusting products of Alchemy, believe you me!
206	Moreover, by fighting beside these people, who are only trying to survive, and by experiencing this other time...
207	Perhaps we can find out why.
208	Why...you were killed.
209	Maybe.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
210	Don't cry.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
211	...
212	I want to keep on living, too.
213	Just like you.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
214	I...!
215	Th-thank you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0033
216	Magnus...
217	I'll be back soon.
218	The same...
219	What?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
220	She said that this technique pulls together people who hold the same convictions.
221	I suppose she did, yes.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
222	Which means that we must share some convictions with them...
223	As well as with each other.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
224	Perhaps.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
225	I've been wishing for something...
226	Even though I know in my heart of hearts that it will never come true.
227	I just can't help but want to see her again.
228	I accept your request as reasonable and just.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_3001
229	Hahah. Why are you acting all high-and-mighty?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
230	You do realize that I am an inquisitor...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
231	Yes, but you're a lenient one.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
232	Only on those who are closest to me.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
233	Let's have tea together later.	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0018
234	Very well. Perhaps we might have something spicy for now, then?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
235	Where do you keep all those pickles, anyway?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
236	Would you like some?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
237	Hmmm...	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
238	Yes, please!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
239	Hmhm. Here you are.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
240	Umgf...
241	Oh.
242	How are they?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
243	...
244	They're not spicy anymore.
245	Boot up, Campanella!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
246	It's so bright! Is this...Alchemy?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0046
247	It's so pretty.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0046
248	Father, mother, Magnus... Let's go!
249	It's family vacation time!
250	Grrrroooooorrgghhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
251	Ah, this is the true pleasure of traveling.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
252	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
253	Nothing beats raising hell with the people you meet along the way.
254	Well, we're not strangers anymore!
255	It's like a picnic.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
256	Like going out together as a family.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
257	I guess that makes us...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
258	Lofia...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
259	Something like a family.
260	You're lenient on those you're closest to, right, Cheryl?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
