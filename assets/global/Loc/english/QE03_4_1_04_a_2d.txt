001	I'm sorry to interrupt you when you're all stoked, but recovering the Sacred Stone is my job.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
002	B-but...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
003	Lisbeth...despite the fact you can use Alchemy, you're still a civilian.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
004	Don't get any closer to the Sacred Stones. It's dangerous. There are those who got involved with Sacred Stones and ended up destroying their own countries.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
005	If it's that dangerous then why are you trying to recover it, Dias?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
006	So that I can take care of it before a civilian like you were to get close to it inadvertently.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
007	No...I don't think it's just that. Dias...you always have such a desperate expression your face.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
008	Please, tell me. I may be able to help.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
009	Help?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
010	You helped us numerous times, Dias...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
011	If I tell you why I'm seeking the Sacred Stone...if I ask you for your help, it would make everything I've done to help you seem manipulative.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0014
012	I'm tired of being used and using others in the Holy Guard.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
013	You're not manipulating me.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
014	What?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
015	I've been thinking for a long time now that there's something wrong with this country.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
016	But, I never thought of changing this country or fighting against it the way we are now. I didn't think I could have.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
017	It's because you obtained Alchemy, right? Power pushes people to action and sends countries into chaos...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
018	No! The reason why I've come this far...is because I met you, Dias!
019	Me...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
020	Dias...you saved the strawberry seedlings.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
021	You said that the resolve of someone who would try to grow flowers in this land shouldn't be buried in the snow.
022	... ...
023	In this country, there is a lot of sadness that is buried in the snow. I want to brush that snow away!
024	To give birth to me, my mother had to suffer.
025	She had to suffer the loss of my father.
026	As a witch of Lustburg, we are the ones that need to fix this.
027	Both that strawberry and I were raised in this sad land.
028	Dias, you warmed that strawberry...
029	Seeing that made me so happy. It warmed my heart too.
030	That's why...I want to warm your heart as well, Dias.
031	If I can save you by obtaining that Sacred Stone, Dias...I want to lend you my strength!
032	Lisbeth...
033	Is it wrong for me to want to do that?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
034	... ...
035	I want to collect the Sacred Stones...so that I can be reunited with someone.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
036	What...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
037	It's someone that I swore to give my life to defend, but...I wasn't able to protect her.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
038	This time I want to protect her...and, in order to do so, I want to get the Sacred Stones before the Holy Guard does.
039	Dias...
040	Lisbeth, it's true that you and your friends may be able to go above the clouds.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
041	Right now, the only one who can stop Asmodeus is you.
042	I was planning on doing it alone, but, when it comes to going above the clouds, it's easier said than done. On top of that, I understand your motives now.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
043	If you truly want to save this country...then I ask this of you as well. Please, Lisbeth.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0041
044	O-okay!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
045	Let's go...Liz!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0015
046	We've got permission from Dias. There's no one to stop us now—	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
047	That's as far as you'll go, traitors!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0007
048	Right, they're here to stop us!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
