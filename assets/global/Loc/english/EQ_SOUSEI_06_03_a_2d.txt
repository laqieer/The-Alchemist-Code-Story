001	...
002	Hey, did you hear? The village to the west of here got swallowed by the flames of corruption.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
003	Already? That's the third one this month.
004	It seems the invasion of the Invidia Belt also failed miserably. At this rate we're all going to—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
005	...
006	Did you hear King Arius lost?
007	He is basically wrath itself! None of us have ever come close to matching him and they beat him?
008	Does the Invidia Belt possess such fearsome knights? Who could've possibly beaten him?
009	And not just that—
010	Oh. Sulva. Are you...playing...outside the castle again?
011	...
012	I don't care much for your antics. A brat ought to obediently listen to their caretakers. It would make all our lives much easier.
013	I understand the urge to act out while you're in your rebellious phase, but that does not give you free rein to behave like a spoiled child.
014	...What does a serpent want with me?
015	Nothing at all. I simply saw you passing by.
016	I don't have any interest in you. Your pride will hit a dead-end sooner or later.
017	...?
018	However, I have some thoughts about that sword you carry on your back.
019	...
020	My, my, no need to be so wary. Didn't I just tell you I have no interest in you?
021	I'm busy enough keeping the Cursed Beast fed...
022	Didn't you hear? Satna flattened another village!
023	Here I am, trying so desperately to bring peace to this area, and there it goes, just doing whatever it wants.
024	Aah... If only Icona were still alive. That women really just did whatever she felt like. Even in death she's selfish.
025	I'd laugh if it weren't for the fact that I now have to clean up her mess.
026	...I'm here to meet the queen.
027	Oh? Go right ahead then. The end is near, child. Enjoy the time you have left.
028	After all, in this world it isn't unusual to die before you realize what is happening.
029	...
030	My queen, are you awake?
031	...My queen?
032	...Sulva. What is it?
033	What am I supposed to do? For what reason do I live?
034	Why would you ask me such things?
035	Your life, your work, and your actions are your own.
036	Make your own decisions, face your own challenges, and live as you see fit.
037	But...
038	Are you still worried about what happened that day?
039	When the former king—my brother Arius—sacrificed himself to save you? It was of his own volition.
040	It may be the reason why he fell into corruption, but even if that is what makes our land perish, you aren't the one to blame.
041	...
042	You carry the Red Blade. The very blade that my brother, the king, entrusted to you.
043	Nobody will voice their objections to your choices, regardless of how you use it.
044	Perhaps, but...
045	If you wished for the throne, then the sword would respond to that desire.
046	I am but a false monarch. The one recognized by the sword could make this castle built on falsity crumble at any time.
047	I do not wish to be king.
048	Then what is it that you desire? For what do you wield that sword? For what do you fight?
049	...
050	(I don't know what I desire.)
051	(All I want is to repay the one who saved my life.)
052	Grrroooooaaaahhh!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0032
053	Haaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0032
054	You dare when in the Ira Belt it is I that—!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0042
055	Tch!
056	Nrgh!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0031
057	It's over, Arius.
058	Heh.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0007
059	Hahahahahaha! Right. This is my end, is it?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0008
060	Your faith and ideals were once the light that showed us the way.
061	That's exactly why I do not wish to see you corrupted by wrath any longer.
062	And what will you do about it?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0005
063	I will slay you. You will die at my hands!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
064	Ngh—! Ah—
065	You—! Why do you protect a Fallen?!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
066	...
067	This man—
068	This man saved me... He shielded me from the corruption, so in turn I will—!
069	I see... So that's why our king has become like this.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0020
070	He protected me, so in turn I must protect him, too...
071	...I'm afraid he's already fallen victim to the corruption. He will never return to his former self.
072	This man is no longer the king you once knew. He's long since lost all his humanity.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
073	And what about it?! Does that mean I should just give up on saving him?!
074	...
075	He saved my life... And because of that...
076	I will save his!
077	...I see.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
078	I've come here to save this country. In order to do that, I am prepared to dirty my hands.
079	If that means fighting a child, then so be it.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
080	...
081	Andechs!
082	Don't interfere!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0014
083	This is a fight between countrymen... Please, let me handle it.
084	But...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
085	Please.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
086	...
087	Tch!
088	...Haa... Haa...
089	...Not bad, kid. You'd make a good knight one day.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
090	But this is the end. Run away. Don't throw your life away here.
091	I can...still fight!
092	I see.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0020
093	Oh my, it looks like someone left themselves wide open.
094	Huh?!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
095	What—?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
096	Andechs!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
097	Ngh...	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
098	Why did you—?
099	Hah...ha... Why indeed...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
100	Ande—	VO_arius.arius_battle_0022
101	Such a tragic tale.
102	A fight between a boy who adores his fallen king, and the most prestigious knight of this country.
103	I would've loved to see the conclusion to this tale.
104	Sadly, I'm afraid I do not have the time. I'm sorry, but we'll need to wrap this up.
105	...Serpent.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
106	What's this? I haven't even had the chance to introduce myself, and yet you determined my true identity in the blink of an eye. A very perceptive boy you are.
107	But don't you know that introductions are an integral part of good etiquette?
108	I am Quence. And as you have already discerned, I am a member of the group you've been so desperately searching for: the Infinite Serpent.
109	Ah well, it's a pity I don't have the time to entertain you.
110	This is but the worthless prologue before your end! Enjoy your eternal slumber!
