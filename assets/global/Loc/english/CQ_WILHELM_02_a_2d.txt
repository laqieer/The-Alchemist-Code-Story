001	Ugh, I'm wiped out. I am not looking forward to getting chewed out after all that training.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0016
002	Listen up. You two are still in training. The next time you cause a problem, I'll throw the book at you!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
003	You might even be stripped of your Paladin status. Don't forget that.
004	And don't forget that if even one of you causes a problem, you both will be held responsible!
005	I can't believe he went on for so long that everyone else chose their dorm rooms first, and we wound up as roommates.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0006
006	Well, c'est la vie. Heh, looks like we're really going to get to know each other.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
007	Good grief. Don't cause any problems for me, all right?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
008	I didn't become a Paladin just to get drawn into your messes and get fired.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
009	I'll do my best. I'll be in trouble if I get fired, too. After all that effort escaping and all...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
010	Escaping?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
011	Uh... Never mind that.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
012	Huh?
013	Hey, why did you become a Paladin?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
014	That came out of nowhere.
015	I didn't get a chance to ask you earlier. You said you'd tell me if I won that bet.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
016	And since I saw through your little attempt to cheat, that means I win.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
017	I never agreed to that. But fine. It's not like it's a big secret or anything.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
018	The reason I became a Paladin is because I could do more Alchemy research if I joined the Holy Guard.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
019	...
020	What's wrong?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
021	Nothing, just that it really wasn't a funny reason.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
022	You thought it would be?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0022
023	It's really just because you like Alchemy?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1020
024	Yup, that's it.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
025	...
026	Alchemy is interesting. The fact that it's got limitless possibilities is exciting.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
027	Huh. Well, I guess that's a good enough reason. But still...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0017
028	What'll you get from researching Alchemy? Hasn't it been pretty well researched already? Seems kind of pointless to me.
029	What'll you even get out of doing that?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
030	Pointless? Hmph. Maybe you're right.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
031	You might spend your life on it only to wind up with nothing.
032	...
033	Magnus?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_1013
034	But it'll still be my life. I'll get to live my life doing what I like even if it was pointless.	VO_magnus.magnus_event_1007
035	...
036	Well, what about you? Why did you become a Paladin?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
037	I...
038	My mom was a kind person.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
039	We lived in the cursed country of Lustburg...
040	In a country where women were generally valued above men, she was always kind, desperately loved me, and feared I might become a bug.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
041	I felt that the pity at the heart of that desperation and kindness rendered it all empty, and became child who was unfilial and difficult.
042	But as a person myself, I have to interact with other people in order to survive, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
043	So I became a Paladin. It was the fastest way for someone like me born in that country to start interacting with other humans.
044	That's it. Pretty boring, right? That's why I said it wasn't worth talking about. It just makes you sad.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
045	It's all meaningless. Which is why I don't take anything seriously and do what I want. You have to have fun in the present.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
046	Pointless? Hmph. Maybe you're right.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
047	...
048	But it'll still be my life. I'll get to live my life doing what I like even if it was pointless.	VO_magnus.magnus_event_1007
049	...
050	Man, I just had the worst dream. I should not have taken that nap.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
051	Magnus is...not back yet.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
052	Is he messing with the senior knights again? He's always telling me off about it, but he gets tired of pretending to be good after just a few days too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
053	That or he's in the research lab. He's gotten pretty interested in something recently that's got him all fired up.
054	That aside, it's still pretty late for him. He usually returns just before lights out.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
055	Now that I think about it, the knights he was messing with before were making a racket earlier.
056	...
057	(The library will be closed at this time. The only places open right now are the training grounds and the lab... He's probably in the lab.)
058	(But if he's really in trouble with those knights, that'll be a real problem.)	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1020
059	Hmm...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
060	Great, I was right. He's really getting into it with them.
061	You're a cocky twerp. Don't get all puffed up just because they're calling you a research genius even though you're new.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
062	Alchemic research is for captains. Anything you do is pointless.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0008
063	How mean. Picking on your juniors just because you lost a little at cards isn't a good habit.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0011
064	Besides, I'm the one that'll decide whether it's pointless or not. It's none of your business.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0017
065	What you say doesn't matter. Research is the only reason why I joined the Holy Guard.
066	...
067	(What's up with him getting so mad over something that's probably meaningless?)	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
068	(Why is he...)
069	Looks like you won't learn until you get hurt, so we'll just have to teach you a lesson right now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
070	Oh, you're all having fun without me. I wanna play, too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
071	Why are you here?!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
072	If we're both going to get in trouble if just one of us gets in trouble, I might as well join in on the fun.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
073	You really are a troublemaker, aren't you?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
074	I'm going to take that as permission to do what I was going to do anyway.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0030
