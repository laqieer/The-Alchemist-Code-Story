001	Do you really love war as much as they say...?
002	...
003	My name is Lamia. I'm in the First Legion with you...
004	I-I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said anything! W-we've never spoken before...
005	I, uh... I don't mind. It's just...
006	Truly, I apologize for my rudeness.
007	No, I just... For a moment, I thought I was seeing my little sister.
008	Do I...look like her?
009	Very much so. That long ponytail and your doleful eyes...
010	Where is she now?
011	In here... With my mother as well.
012	I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. That was insensitive of me.
013	Is it odd to see a warrior known to pride herself on her love of war frequenting the graveyard?
014	The way you fight... Well, recently you've been...fiercer. Almost...abusive.
015	...Who did you come here to see?
016	No one specifically. I just came here to offer my prayers to those who have fallen.
017	Do you despise war?
018	I've killed so many already...while, yes, despising what I do.
019	I come here to console myself for taking part in battle with such a half-hearted resolve.
020	We're not so different, are we?
021	Excuse me?
022	This is all I have.
023	A stone knife...?
024	My little sister made it for me. I only received it after she passed.
025	It's supposed to be a good luck charm.
026	...
027	I just wish I could erase the person I used to be. The one who loved to fight wars.
028	The one known as Ruinmaker?
029	A bit over-dramatic for a name, isn't it?
030	The one who brings ruin to those who oppose her. That's what they call you.
031	Enemies, their weapons, the whole battlefield... You crush them all until nothing but ruin remains.
032	I've come to a point where there's no turning back.
033	You'll get used to seeing tragedy. They continue until everything that the war touches is eradicated.
034	I...
035	The one thing that hasn't changed is that I aggressively charge the front lines, much like I did then, and now as the Ruinmaker.
036	N-no, you're not the same!
037	I'm exactly the same.
038	I... I used to despise the idea of fighting under you.
039	Under me?
040	That day, you were being nominated by the last captain to be the new captain of the First Legion.
041	Had you been our captain, the other knights would have gladly thrown themselves into battle. I feared such a future.
042	But you declined the position of captain when you returned from the campaign.
043	I just knew I wasn't meant for the job.
044	I would be honored to fight under you as you are now.
045	As I am now?
046	Yes.
047	As a warrior, I have no intention of leaving the front lines. I have no intention of ordering my comrades to march towards their deaths. Besides...
048	You despise war, do you not?
049	I do. I hate that it is all I know how to do.
050	It is better than being able to do nothing.
051	The Alchemia in me... It's so highly concentrated that wings shine behind my back.
052	Wratharis found me and took me in as a knight. I've been searching for ways to make use of my power ever since.
053	Your power is meant to end all wars.
054	Unlike the wars of the past that only incited more war, you can fight to end all fighting. And so I...
055	I think I would... I would like to be your apprentice!
056	Apprentice?! Y-you think too highly of me!
057	N-no, not at all!
058	I only know how to annihilate! I am the Ruinmaker as people say! If you stay too close to me, eventually you'll...
059	I'm willing to endure it all!
060	But you don't have to!
061	I-I always misjudge my own strength. That's how I scared off all my previous mentors...
062	If I don't get my powers under control, the other knights will think I'm just really good with a spear!
063	Is that...a bad thing?
064	I want to be able to help others live well with this power of mine!
065	I want to learn to love myself!
066	...
067	I'll do everything I can on my own, of course, but I just...
068	Lamia...
069	Y-yes?!
070	I can't promise to go easy on you.
071	Th-that's fine! Thank you so much!
072	Let's get going.
073	Ah, w-wait for me!
074	My little sister asked me to wait, and I promised I would. Those words ended up becoming a lie.
075	I've come so far. Mother is so far away now.
076	I realized it's been a while since the last time I held a proper conversation.
