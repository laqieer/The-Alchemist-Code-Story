001	Hey, if you focus too much on that, it leaves you wide open...right here!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0007
002	Whoa!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
003	Hm, not a bad move...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
004	But that's not all you've got, is it? You can do more, can't you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
005	If that's what you want... Miracle Kanon...Slash!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_skill_0001
006	Hm, interesting...but you lack control over your Alchemia.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
007	Urk!
008	The training ends here. I pushed myself a little... How unlike me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
009	But I understand now that you are indeed a very interesting girl... You pass.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
010	Ahh...hahhh.... Th-thank you.	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
011	Kanon...? Kaya, what is this?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
012	Hm, I knew it was you who was looking for me, Zain. I was just training this promising recruit.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
013	I thought you might be interested in her.
014	Yes, I think she should be trained thoroughly... It's not like me to say that, though.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
015	Thank you for finding Kaya for me, Kanon. You can go back now.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0033
016	I want to talk with her alone for a while.
017	Y-yes, sir! Goodbye, Lady Kaya!
018	Kanon is an interesting girl, isn't she? Now that I know that, I can step down from my position as Captain without any reservations.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
019	Why? You've always talked about it, but this time you went so far as to leave that careless letter...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
020	From now on, I want to start working full-time on what I've always wanted to do.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
021	You'll be fine without me. It doesn't matter what you say, Zain. I'm not going back to the Holy Guard, or to my role as Captain.
022	Kaya...the Holy Guard still needs your power! Or do you believe that I can't support you as Lord Commander?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
023	It's the opposite. Because you are the Lord Commander, I know that everything will be fine without me. After all, you've got some interesting recruits.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
024	Kaya!
025	This isn't like you. Zain, if you get all fired up like this, you'll wear yourself out.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1008
026	You don't need to act all tough. There's a limit to what you can do by yourself, even if you're determined.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
027	Then, please, stop this talk about leaving. The Holy Guard still needs you, Kaya.
028	Mm, you're always so stubborn at times like this. Even though what I want to do would benefit the entire world...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
029	What are you talking about?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
030	Have you heard of the Cursed Beasts?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
031	The Cursed Beasts... You mean the colossal beasts that existed in the distant past?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
032	Yes, but there are few even within the Holy Guard who know of their existence, and even fewer outside our ranks.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
033	As I'm sure you know, I originally wanted to be an archeologist.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
034	Of course, but you have power; power that can help uphold justice in Babel.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
035	Those with power should make use of it...don't you agree?
036	Hmph, you don't understand women at all, do you? You're still a chivalrous, stubborn fool.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
037	Wha—?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
038	That's why I stayed on as Captain of the 2nd Regiment until now...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
039	But we live in a relatively peaceful time, don't we? We are at peace.
040	I want to use history to reach the truth of this world.
041	But...
042	Heheh... I guess it doesn't make sense to someone like you, who has only ever had the Holy Guard in his sights.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
043	So I'll explain it in a way that's easy for you to understand.
044	Did you know that there's a blank in the history of the Holy Guard?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
045	A blank?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
046	The history of Babel begins with the year that the Holy Order was founded, marked as year zero, and we are presently in about the eight hundredth year...
047	Don't you think that's strange?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
048	Why, even after eight hundred years, are you only the tenth Lord Commander?
049	I...! You're right! The numbers...don't match.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
050	You probably didn't notice because you're always looking at what's right in front of you, but if you're interested, you can always go looking through the books in the library.
051	If you do, you're bound to notice a part of history that was omitted.
052	I see...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
053	But you don't need to worry about that. You just keep progressing forward.
054	I'll look backward in your stead, and seek out the truth.
055	The right person for the right job. Do you understand? The true nature of the Holy Guard, and what truths this world is hiding...
056	That is what I wish to learn and I am sure that knowing these things will benefit the Holy Guard as well.
057	In that case, let me search with you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0045
058	What? Were you even listening? I'll search by myself, so you do what you need to do.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
059	As Lord Commander, I should know such things. I can't save the world if I'm ignorant of its truths.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
060	You really are a stubborn man... Fine, then you had best come and see for yourself...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
061	Where are we going?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
062	To investigate this mural. There might be areas too dangerous for a lone researcher. I'd like to have you as my guard.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
063	Of course... It ought to help me understand women better as well.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
064	Hm? Did you say something?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
065	No, it's nothing. Come, let us go!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
