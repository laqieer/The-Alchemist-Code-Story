001	There they are! Stop, thieves!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
002	Damn it! How did they find this place?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
003	Too bad for you! Nothing gets past me!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0010
004	We'll be taking that cacao back now!
005	Like hell you will! Those fools who get so caught up in Valentine's will pay an arm and leg for this stuff!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
006	Making such a fuss over chocolates. Hah! It really is a stupid event for stupid people!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
007	Simply handing out chocolates, huh... It's true, up until recently I used to think the exact same way.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
008	But I've changed. Valentine's Day isn't a day just to hand out chocolates. It's a day to let your feelings be known.
009	It is my duty as general to protect this day that my people treasure so fondly.
