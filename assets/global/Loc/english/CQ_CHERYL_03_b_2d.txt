001	This is...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
002	Written notes related to alchemy... Records of past experiments... This is a laboratory disguised as an orphanage, isn't it?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
003	Gathering children who lost their parents, then building a place to use them for experiements... 	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
004	Cheryl! Look!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0001
005	...!
006	Ngh... Where's my older sister?
007	Don't worry. She's alright. She was really brave by helping us find you. We've come to rescue you.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
008	Oh... thank you...
009	Hey! Are you okay?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
010	She's alright. She's very weak but she'll survive.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
011	...
012	Cheryl? What's wrong?
013	The dark area below the lighthouse... The location is close to the Inquisition's Slothstein headquarters.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
014	Who would've expected that experiments with alchemy were taking place there?
015	If I'd only noticed earlier, as an inquisitor I could've saved her much sooner...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
016	I had no idea either. To use an orphanage as a secret lair... How horrible...	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
017	At least all the children in the other rooms are safe. And we were able to rescue this child.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
018	You're right... It's great that we could do this.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
019	And now...to start writing the report on this.
020	Hey! Cheryl!
021	How are you? Working today, too?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
022	Yes. There was a lot to do after what happened the other day, so all that's left now is to file the report.
023	It was complicated to write since there were rules that weren't followed, so I'm a bit exhausted.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0030
024	Oh yeah... But was everything alright?
025	What do you mean?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
026	I mean, because...you're an inquisitor and went against protocol, right?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
027	Yes, everything was fine. I didn't hide any facts and was honest about what happened.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0004
028	That's great! I'm so relieved... I was worried that I could've gotten you punished for your actions or something.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
029	You don't have to be worried  It's alright. Unlike me, the Inquisition isn't that strict about the fine details.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
030	Actually, my superiors were impressed.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
031	I think I was just trying to reassure myself by following all of the rules and fearing what would happen if I broke any of them.
032	I'm strict against people who don't follow the law so I can protect people.
033	Even so, I'm too obsessed with following the rules and can't see the injustice that was in front of me... And that should not happen.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
034	Of course it's important to follow the rules... But we sometimes have to think things beyond the rules.
035	Cheryl...
036	Things went in a different direction, but we were able to crack down on the illegal use of alchemy as a result.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
037	And most of all, I'm glad we were able to save those children.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
038	Yup! That's right!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0005
039	Hey, look at the time. This time, let's really have lunch together. That spicy place I recommended.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
040	Oh wait, are you in the middle of work, as usual?
041	Yes, as soon as the investigation is finished, I'll have time for a break, so...<br>	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
042	Actually... Why don't we have lunch together first?
043	Huh? Are you sure?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
044	Yes. My report's not finished yet, but maybe it's good to do something like this once in a while.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
045	Following protocol is important, but if I'm always following every little rule, I might miss out on something more important.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
046	For example, missing out on a recommended place for lunch with a friend!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
