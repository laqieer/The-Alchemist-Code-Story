001	The crowd is starting to grow. Why are you looking so serious?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
002	I'm thinking about what I ought to do as a chief.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
003	...? What do you mean?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
004	How should I respond if those from the Tehre faction and the Fuu faction decide to challenge me, knowing that I'm the chief of Voda?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
005	Surely they would never challenge you out of the blue...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
006	You can never be too careful.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
007	As the representative of my tribe, I cannot back down. That being said, as I am away from my village...if someone were to take advantage of this fact and attack them...
008	I didn't know you were thinking about such things.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
009	Such things...? As a chief, that's what's expected of me.	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
010	Don't worry about it. No one would suspect that you're a chief.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
011	It's hard to imagine that a young girl like you would be the head of a tribe.
012	...! Are you insulting me?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
013	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
014	Do you wish to imply that a young girl like me...couldn't be a chief?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
015	N-no, not at all...that's not what I meant!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
016	Even if I'm young, I'm the chief of the Toxotes tribe! As their chief, I must consider all possibilities!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
017	He-hey...wait!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
018	...I was careless.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
019	Although she may have taken on the role of chief, Tina is still a young girl. I'm sure the burden is heavy for her.
020	What the...? There's some kind of commotion.	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
021	Anyway...once you get to the village, try to find someone who bears the title of Chief.
022	It doesn't matter what tribe it is, but, unless you're accepted as the guest of a tribe, you won't be able to stay in Saga.
023	But isn't there only one chief for every tribe?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
024	I told you, didn't I? Paza is a neutral trading village. There are people from various tribes here. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than one chief.
025	Oh, right...but I can't just go along with anybody, you know?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
026	In that case, you should decide by the overall vibe of each faction.
027	If you prefer to be around reformists then you should consider Tehre...if you're interested in warfare then Fuu...and if you think nature-worshiping is your thing then most likely Voda is for you.
028	Well...that's a pretty rough categorization, but you get the picture.
029	Hmm. Between those options, I guess I'd say Voda.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
030	Besides, if they know a lot about nature, then they might know how to remove the curse of Lustburg.
031	Well then, try and find yourself a chief from the Voda faction. Sorry, but I'll be leaving now. I'm keeping my other customers waiting.
032	Seriously?! You're already leaving?! ...Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
033	...? It's been a while since I've been here, but there seems to be some kind of commotion. Be careful, young lady.	VO_merchant.merchant_story0304_0008
034	Go-got it! Thank you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_story0304_0134
035	Um... First, I need to meet a chief, right? I wonder where I can find one.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_story0304_0135
036	...Oh!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
037	Um...excuse me! Where can I find...a chief?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_story0304_0136
038	... ...	VO_tina.tina_story0304_0001
039	U-um...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_story0304_0137
040	I am Tina, the 45th chief of Toxotes. Sorry if my small, feminine stature doesn't meet your expectations.	VO_tina.tina_story0304_0002
041	Whaaaat?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_story0304_0138
042	Ack! What's with that reaction?! Chiefs aren't determined by their age...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
043	Tina! There you are!
044	What...? Did you come to apologize for your rudeness?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
045	Now isn't the time for that! The Jam are here! Let's go!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
046	What...?! Ack!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
047	Hey! Ch-chief...hold on a second!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
