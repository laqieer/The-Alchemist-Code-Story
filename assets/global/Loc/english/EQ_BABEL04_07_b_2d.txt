001	Huzzaaahh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
002	Huzzaaaaahhh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
003	Jin! You're running away again!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
004	Breaking your promise again, just like you did before! Like you always do!
005	Grraaaah?!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0025
006	I will not forgive you! Do not say a word! Hold your tongue as you always have done!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
007	Ngh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
008	Aaaaaaahh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
009	Sumeragi! Drink of my blood, and give me strength!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
010	Aaaaaahhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
011	Ha! Hahahaha! That's it! Kill me!!!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
012	Discarnate Power!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
013	Do it! You wanted to kill this man, did you not?! Now is your time! Now!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
014	Now! Do it! Kill me, Yomi!!!
015	Don't...tell me what to do! Don't... Just d-don't...!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
016	Ugh... Uuuhhh...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0019
017	Yomi? Are you crying?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
018	You can't kill me with tears, little girl!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
019	How?	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_1028
020	Aaaaahh?!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0001
021	How are you so kind? You've always been like that, even when we were young.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
022	Uh...
023	You just endure all the pain without uttering a single complaint.
024	What...are you...saying?!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
025	I now know the truth about the night my father died.
026	What?!
027	I witnessed everything I did when I first merged with the Discarnate Power.
028	Jin, you took on all the pain, the blame, and the hatred for my crimes!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
029	Haha. Hahahahaha! Then what do you have to wait for?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0023
030	What?!
031	This man's life is nearly burnt out!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
032	Such is the consequence of one who is not worthy of wielding Sumeragi!
033	Once this man's life is extinguished, this body will become mine!
034	Everything will come to an end if that comes to be!
035	Kill me along with the Discarnate Power!
036	I deceived you all those years!
037	Y-you...
038	You haven't changed at all.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
039	You're always there to give me a reason to wipe my tears away.
040	It's always been you.
041	Fight me, Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
042	Release the tension...
043	Release it just as one might spin a top.
044	If I can spin the top just right...
045	I can bring joy to my brother the same way he brought happiness to me.
046	Uggrraaah!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0028
047	I will fulfill our promise.
048	I will protect Wadatsumi together with you!
049	Huzzzaaaahh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
050	Well...done...
051	Jin! J-Jin...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
052	So...you saw...through my lies.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0022
053	You're so terrible at hiding your true feelings... How could I fail to notice?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
054	Seriously, man. Worst ninja ever.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
055	Keeping your story straight is subterfuge 101.
056	Anyway... Yomi, he wants you to move on. He did all this because he's your doting big brother.
057	...!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
058	So, the past has finally come to light.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
059	I suppose, it could have been worse.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
060	I've always wanted to...unload all this...baggage...off of my shoulders, but...
061	I didn't think that...I wouldn't want to let go...when the time came to actually do...so.
062	Huh.
063	I thought that it was all darkness...
064	Turns out it was speckled with stars.
065	Jin!
066	Yomi.	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
067	Please... Don't leave me.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
068	Now who's...an open...book?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
069	I can't help it! I...!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
070	This time...I'm not leaving you without saying...a word.	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
071	You're a tenacious one.
072	You've become...much stronger than I am.
073	No... Please, Jin...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0019
074	Let's...make a wish...on a shooting star.	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
075	A...? What?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
076	Let's wish...on a shooting star...that we'll be able to protect...Wada...tsumi.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
077	To...ge...ther.
078	O-okay.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
079	The night sky...sure is beautiful, don't you...think?
080	I...do.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
081	My wish...is that we...will be able to look up...at this sky...together...forever.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
082	Oh...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
083	Ah!
084	A shooting star.
085	...
086	Jin, I...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
087	...
088	N-no. No... Aaaaaaahhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0028
089	Jin!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0021
090	Jin!!!
091	When I grow up, I'll protect you, brother.
092	You don't need to do that, Yomi. I am sure that I will be able to keep both you and Wadatsumi from coming to harm.
093	I don't wanna be protected all the time! I wanna help, too!
094	I know. You're a hard worker. You'll probably become far stronger than me.
095	That's right! I am a hard worker! I'll get way stronger than you!
096	So it's a promise. Let's protect Wadatsumi together, no matter what!
097	All right. I promise.
098	I mean it! Don't forget you promised!
099	Let's make a wish on a shooting star.
