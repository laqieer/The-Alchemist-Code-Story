001	Currently. Near the foot of Ramproad Mountain.
002	The Shadow Messiah...?! This Spica woman? She's Zahar's underling?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
003	Formerly. That's in the past.
004	Well, that might be the case, but...	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
005	Spica simply admired Zahar. They weren't aiming for the same ideals.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
006	She isn't guilty of anything. But that's not enough to convince you, is it?
007	No...
008	If you tell me that, Commander Chloe...I'll believe you! She's my friend as well!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
009	Huh? Well, I guess you're pretty honest.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
010	Of course I am! After all, I respect you. There's no way I wouldn't believe what you say!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0023
011	Th-thanks... Hey...why do you look up to me?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
012	Huh? It's obvious... You're the Royal Commander of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
013	I don't think it's just that. You've been looking up to me ever since you joined the Guard.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
014	Well...how can I say it...you kind of remind me of my older sister, Commander.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
015	Your older sister?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
016	My parents died when I was young, so I was raised by my older brother and sister.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0037
017	I have a younger brother and sister as well, but they did their best to look after all three of us.
018	That sounds like it must've been hard.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
019	It was. But, I had no idea of how hard it was for them, so I did whatever I pleased.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
020	I heard a little about it.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
021	Apparently, you started a fight with a gang of outlaws and Captain Vettel, who happened to be passing by, saved you.
022	Yes. Captain Vettel told me then...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
023	"You can never truly become strong through physical strength alone."
024	He said that there was no point in only having the power to hurt people.
025	You cannot save people with power alone...you need to learn how to reach people's hearts. That was Captain Vettel's philosophy.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
026	Actually, my older brother and sister told me the same thing.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
027	My brother and sister had given me the same advice as Captain Vettel from long ago. When I realized that, my eyes were opened for the first time.
028	So that's when you first realized how much the two of them had struggled.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0044
029	Yes. Wanting to make amends, I said that I would work for my family.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
030	But my brother and sister told me that's not what they wanted.
031	Learning about my admiration for Captain Vettel, they sent me off, telling me to become an honorable knight.
032	I'm sure they actually wanted to follow their own dreams as well.	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
033	What they did isn't something that's very easily done. You have a wonderful brother and sister.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
034	Yes! I'm very proud of my family! And I feel that they overlap with you and Captain Vettel...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
035	For me, the Scarlet Flame Guard is like my family. I'm sorry. Did I make you feel bad?
036	Not at all! I'm glad to hear you see me the same way as your respectable older sister.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
037	Really?! Thanks!!!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1011
038	Commander Chloe!
039	Huh?! What're you all doing here?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
040	We took care of the ruffians faster than we thought we would so we made our way here!
041	I see. Thank you, everyone!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
042	Well, that's one problem taken care of.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
043	Sorry! Please hurry and take Commander Chloe and this individual to see a doctor!
044	Huh? Victor...where are you planning on going?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
045	I'm sorry. I'm gonna return to Commander Kanon.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0035
046	Huh?! Are you planning on picking a fight with Basheeny again?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
047	No, it's nothing like that. It's just...something about the look in his eyes has been bothering me.	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
048	The look in his eyes...?
049	When he said that he was an assassin, he really seemed to be telling the truth.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
050	It's better to be safe than sorry. Don't worry! I won't cause any unnecessary disputes!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
051	He-hey...Victor!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
052	Meanwhile. Halfway up Ramproad Mountain.
053	For now, I've avoided making a report to Kagura. Are you sure they don't need to make their way down the mountain?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
054	If they encounter Captain Kudan while descending the mountain, it'll be dangerous.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
055	It'll be safer if she hides herself away with Miuna.
056	That being said...how did they know that we're here?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
057	Just in case of an emergency, I made a report to the higher-ups of the Holy Order.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
058	Outside of Captain Yauras and Captain Othima, that's the only other possibility.
059	It must be Waginau. I'm certain he's connected with Kudan.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
060	Is it safe to assume that he's hiding within Greed Dike?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
061	If he's been brainwashed with the ideals of the Lion Monarch Orion then convincing him otherwise might not be an option.
062	Don't worry. A year or so won't be enough to eliminate the time that we spent together.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
063	I just hope that's the case...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
064	Um. What do you mean by convince him...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
065	We're going to convince Captain Kudan. If he goes missing again it'll be troublesome, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
066	Huh? Do all of you think that Captain Kudanstein is coming back?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
067	We're gonna make him come back—even if it's by force. We owe an obligation of a lifetime to him.	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
068	No way. Are you being serious?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0021
069	I mean, he's the one who tore the Holy Guard to shreds. There's no way that a person like him would come...
070	Agh?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
071	Stop spewing nonsense. I am under no obligation to hear the opinion of a trainee like you.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
072	U-ughh...! I-it hurts!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
073	Captain Monzein!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
074	Tsk...
075	Cough...cough...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
076	If we were to get into a fight with Kudan...a trainee like you will just get in the way of things.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
077	If you've finished your work here then hurry back to headquarters.
078	Captain Monzein!
079	Commander Kanon...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
080	You can stay here. After all, you're my bodyguard. Try to rest a little.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
081	Cough...! Why did he get so mad? I don't understand it at all.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
082	Regardless of how it appears, Captain Monzein wants to believe in the bond he shares with Captain Kudan.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
083	I know it's difficult to comprehend under these circumstances.
084	The bond...? Isn't it really impractical to hold onto something so uncertain?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
085	What do you mean?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
086	If people have different ways of thinking, the only wave to solve it is by twisting arms.
087	People follow those with more power than them. That's how this world functions.
088	I'm pretty sure Captain Kudanstein feels the same way.
089	You've been Kanon's bodyguard and yet you've learned nothing?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
090	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
091	If you're gonna go by sheer strength, then there are so many others that have more power than Kanon.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
092	However, that's not the reason why she was selected as Lord Commander.
093	It's because she values something that surpasses power.
094	You haven't realized that, have you?
095	Are you talking about the burning passion within all humans that surpasses power?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
096	Huh...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
097	You're saying the same thing as the little frog...but I don't think emotional theories like that can stop Captain Kudanstein.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
098	Are you sure about that? Or maybe you've just never experienced the determination that amplifies one's power by incredible degrees.
099	The determination that amplifies one's power...? I'm not sure I believe that...but anyway...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
100	I'm just going to focus on carrying out this mission.
