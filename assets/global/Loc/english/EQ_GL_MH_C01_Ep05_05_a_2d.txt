001	Leaving the unconscious guards underneath some bushes, the party catches up with the main squad, which stops short outside of a clearing.
002	Alright, leave the boxes here, and then we can get out.
003	This forest gives me the creeps.
004	(They're just leaving them there? That's weird.)
005	*Whirr... Whirr....*
006	Several golem-like creatures emerge from the other side of the clearing and begin moving the goods.
007	Are those... Golems?
008	These are functional Constructs! How did they manage to repair them?
009	But... Hmm... These don't seem decrepit like the ones we saw in the ruins.
010	Something's leaking out of one of the boxes!
011	Grrrooowwwll...
012	SNARL!!!
013	Whoa, whoa. This is crazy. Monsters versus Constructs? What's in the box?
014	That liquid contains a high amount of Alchemia particles!
015	Wait... They were transporting the same substances as the ones we found in the ruins?
016	Highly probable and possible, yes.
017	*Whirr... Bzzzzz...*
018	Growl...
019	Looks like we're caught up in the crossfire.
020	Let's split up. Hopefully we can get them to attack each other instead.
