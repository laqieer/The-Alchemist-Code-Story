001	Fuu... Why would he go alone?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	We've got to go after him!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
003	No. We wait. Do neither of you understand the decision he's made?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0014
004	Even if I do, we can't let him do this by himself!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
005	I doubt the Jam will pose any threat to him, and the entrance that Georgios cut open is still there. He shouldn't have any problem reaching the fire core in the dragon's back either.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
006	Fuu made up his mind to go alone. He must've wanted to spare you the pain of witnessing that fatal moment...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
007	He can't...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
008	He must be letting the weight of his guilt in killing Alia cloud his judgment. The fool!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0017
009	Tina, you stay here!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
010	But Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
011	Is this...it?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
012	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
013	Why have you followed me?! I don't need your help. You will only slow me down!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
014	We weren't able to bring the beast to a full stop. At least let me fight alongside you!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0036
015	No matter what I say, you've got no intention of going back, have you?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_1047
016	You can come along. Just don't get in my way. I'd better not hear a peep out of you!	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1019
017	Yes, sir!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
018	Is that...the dragon's core?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0009
019	You, who reap from nature and dare forget our existence...begone from this place!
020	Out it comes! Boy, this reminds me of the old days!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
021	Humans, why do you fight so much? Nature bears no grudge against you, yet you claim dominion over its lands!
022	I admit we've made mistakes! We claim to live off the land, but in truth, we reap its bounty!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
023	But I believe we humans learn from our mistakes and grow stronger for them!
024	If you're demanding payment for our mistakes, then I'll gladly give you the life of this old man. Take as much you want, just leave the people of Saga alone!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0018
025	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
026	I told you to stay silent! Even Alia did the same for us not so long ago! Ah... I finally get it.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
027	Alia... This is how you felt, isn't it? Gahahaha!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0008
028	If you will not leave, then I shall be forced to eliminate you!
029	You're welcome to try! In exchange, I'll make sure you never lay a hand on Saga!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
