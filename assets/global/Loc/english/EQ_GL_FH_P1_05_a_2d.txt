001	- Slothstein Borders -
002	Yeah, you take care of the west route. I'll remain here.
003	Understood.
004	Move out!
005	Yes sir!
006	Looks like they're already trialling those creepy new demon robot things.
007	Guess it's about to turn into a permanent assignment here.
008	Tch. There's even less of a chance of running now. Not that I can...
009	Lilith kicks idly at a patch of dirt and stares into the horizon.
010	The metal collar around her neck seemed to weigh down even her soul.
011	Was that all there was to a wretched life like hers?
012	(Well, no use being mopey. If I don't start my patrol they'll junk me on the spot.)
013	Come on, Belial.
014	*SCREECH*
015	Somewhere to the north...
016	Hang on, Berith... I need to catch my breath.
017	Yeah, you do that. We've been running for a while.
018	Ain't nothing we can hide behind in these flat plains, either.
019	Keep your eyes peeled, kid.
020	And here I thought it was going to be two familiar troublemakers...
021	Weren't you on the run, Red?
022	Sis!
023	Hey, you're hurt.
024	Don't tell me you got into a scrap with the scouts.
025	Did anyone see you?
026	No...
027	There was a new weapon in the city. One that looks like-
028	The one I put to sleep? Yeah.
029	It's pretty unsettling, but at least I'm not assigned to work with her.
030	...Did she do this?
031	...
032	Tracking prey or setting it free?
033	For someone carrying a briefcase all the time you walk ridiculously lightly.
034	I'm not here to make small talk.
035	Subject VI. I witnessed the altercation between you and Subject R in Slothstein.
036	Grimm loads his pistol.
037	Your execution has been ordered by the Director.
038	Wait.
039	What happened back there? Why wasn't I informed?
040	And give you a second opportunity at letting persons of interest saunter away?
041	You're next on the list, Godslayer.
042	If you don't want your punishment to be more severe than it already is, you'd do well to stay out of the way.
043	Even if you were to kill her on the spot, what's gonna happen to the sword?
044	How would you know if it would go inert? Berith's pretty attached to Red.
045	Shut it. I didn't ask you to talk.
046	The Director's magnanimous grace in granting her a new lease of life was repaid in treachery.
047	Without the Director, none of us here would be alive right now. NONE!
048	The Director SAVED you! You OWE your life to Goetia!
049	Grr...
050	No. No!
051	Erasing my identity and forcing me to live a life I have no control over...how is that living?
052	All for some strange goal we are never told about...
053	All without ever knowing why!
054	Enough games.
055	Astaroth, devour!
056	*GRRRSNRK*
057	Berith!
058	Astaroth's shadowy tendrils bind Red in place, causing her to drop the greatsword.
059	Ugh!
060	Aaahh!
061	Oh no you don't.
062	No one's hurting my little sis.
063	Little sis'? Don't make me laugh.
064	Camaraderie is a lie. All of you are just tools.
065	Some of us are more committed than others...
066	And once the Director's grand vision comes to fruition, my purpose will be fulfilled!
067	Heh...
068	I think you're just too afraid to accept the possibility that it's just a load of nonsense...
069	You suit-clad bootlicker!
070	DIE.
