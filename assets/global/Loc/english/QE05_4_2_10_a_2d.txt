001	Is everyone ready?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
002	From here, we will be crossing the border into Gluttony Foss.
003	We will then be joining up with Ceclidis IV, who is leading the Liberation Army, and together we will launch our attack upon the royal capital.
004	I mean, I'm fine with this plan, but what about Agatha and Marie?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
005	With things the way they are, Ceclidis is definitely going to be looking for them.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
006	I'd like the two of them to remain hidden.
007	For this reason, I am planning to have them hide out in a stronghold of the Liberation Army that's never been struck successfully before. I think that's our best bet.
008	I...cannot disagree.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0044
009	If that's settled, then we'd better get going. How are you planning to cross the border, anyway?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
010	There's no way we'll make it past the checkpoints with the Blue Tongues traveling with us.
011	You're right. That's why we'll be crossing by sea.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
012	Is that really the best plan? I don't imagine that the sight of us arriving by ship will go unnoticed.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
013	There is a port in the west of Gluttony that faces the open sea. It is known as the heart of the country.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
014	This port is a well-known supporter of the radical Ceclidis, but the truth is that it has long had a connection to the royal family.
015	What kind of connection?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
016	The port was once burned to the ground on Ceclidis' orders.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
017	Its residents have never forgotten this. Ever since that day, they have outwardly displayed loyalty to Ceclidis' rule, while at the same time dabbling in the business of smuggling, in defiance of his laws.
018	By helping Sephira and other refugees escape the country, for example.
019	So in other words, they're secretly our allies?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
020	I am sure that they will expect adequate reimbursement for doing so, but it is precisely for this kind of situation that we have been so diligent in building up the Fruit Peddlers as a merchant guild.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
021	No expense has been spared in making our border-crossing successful.
022	Then will we be meeting up with the Liberation Army near the port?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0045
023	That's the plan. From there, we will go with the Liberation Army to attack the royal capital.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
024	Meanwhile, Mocca will take Agatha to Ceclidis IV's stronghold.
025	Understood.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
026	Good. Then we shall now head west across the desert and board the merchant ship waiting for us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
027	Georgios will be acting as a diversion for the enemy forces, but he can only hold them off for so long. Whether or not our crossing is successful will be dependent on timing.
028	No matter what gets in our way, we must push through. We must get to the ocean!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
