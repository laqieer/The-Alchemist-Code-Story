001	I'll have this soldier carry the wounded. Where should we send them?
002	There's a town south of here, built around an oasis.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
003	Take them there. It's an emergency refuge for my guild.
004	Very well. What will you do?
005	We can't afford to leave the Jam here. It will only serve to make Ceclidis more powerful in the long run. That's how it goes.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
006	The Jam are basically masses of corruption. Without proper protection and gear, they can be quite tricky to deal with.
007	Leave it to us.
008	It shall be done. Don't overdo it, now.
009	Right.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
010	Logi, I want you to stay with Agatha.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
011	B-but...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
012	It's likely that Ceclidis is targeting her. You must protect her no matter what.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
013	I understand. Let's go, Agatha.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
014	O-okay. Mr. Kamui, Miss Tina... Please be careful.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
015	Have you ever fought the Jam before, Tina?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
016	Unfortunately, yes. Too many.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
017	Then I guess you won't be needing my advice. I'll go ahead and intercept them, so that you can sneak up behind them and catch them by surprise.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
018	Got it. Geez, I can't believe I have to fight the Jam in the desert of all places! Fate is so ridiculous.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
