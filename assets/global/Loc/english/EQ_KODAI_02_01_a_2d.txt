001	This must be the old world home of the dragons, the majestic city of Hierosolyma. 	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
002	I heard it was abandoned, but it still looks lively enough to me.
003	Not that it matters either way for my purposes.
004	...I do enjoy a bit of a challenge, after all.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
005	--What did you say was supposed to happen after this?
006	Well, if this place really is a memory of the past, then we should be able to get a head start.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
007	It's a fool's errand, but we may as well give it a shot.
008	Ready, Waginau? Just ahead is--
009	What...?
010	Huh? Was I asleep? ...What a strange dream.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
011	That shadow... It seemed almost familiar, and yet completely foreign.
012	...Hmm, well just a dream, I guess.
013	I've been locked up here for over a week now. I must really be starting to lose it, seeing things that make no sense like that.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0020
014	I hope you are comfortable, Lady Schmeier, my most diligent and wise dragon.
015	Oh, not so bad I suppose--apart from this empty stomach, anyway. Getting to see that nice body of yours when I wake up certainly helps. 	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
016	...It would be so much easier to appreciate without these bars, though.
017	I do apologize, but this body is nothing more than a facsimile of the human form.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
018	And it would be the height of disrespect to address a dragon such as yourself without keeping a reverential separation between us.
019	How about you cut the act and just treat me like a prisoner. That's what I am, after all.
020	Would you prefer that? Well then, I shall remember such honesty is a virtue.	VO_chahele.chahele_voice_0018
021	...So? What is it that you want with me?
022	I have brought word from my master, Lord Ophioneus.
023	Yeah? Well, let's hear it.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
024	"Join our army."
025	...That's it?
026	That is it.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0037
027	Stop acting all high and mighty and just tell me what's going on already. What is this about the dragons' original sin?
028	--Perhaps I will enlighten you.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
029	Hey, wait! Wait! Weren't you going to "enlighten" me!?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
030	Aaaand he's gone. That body really does not suit him at all.
031	Well, now what?
032	I'm worried about Lil and Zafeiris, but what can I do stuck here like this?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
033	Who'd have thought a dragon like myself would be rendered helpless by a simple iron cage.
034	The city of pride, Hierosolyma, exists inside the ever-expanding Dragon Realm of Ophioneus...
035	Here, dragons and humans are equal--simple servants of the Dragon King.
036	I may be in over my head...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0030
037	Oh ho, so that's what's going on.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
038	No matter how hard I try, my body just isn't suited for combat. What a pain.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
039	I thought all dragons were tough, but I guess not, huh?
040	Hey! I don't need to listen to this kind of prejudiced--wait, huh? Who's there!?
041	Oh, sorry, sorry. I just happened to overhear some juicy info.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0035
042	So that's why my halberd felt so much heavier when I arrived in this city...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
043	The very laws of the world are being rewritten--
044	Could this be the "Dragon Realm" power of the seven apex dragons?
045	--Who are...
046	Matia. I was just passing by and thought this place looked interesting, so I snuck in.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
047	Though that may have been a mistake. I thought this was a place I could test my strength, but instead it's like I don't even have any strength here.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
048	I guess that explains why they don't need much security.
049	...
050	Hello? I just introduced myself and everything. Aren't you supposed to tell me your name or something now?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
051	I, oh, umm-- My name is Schmeier	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0035
052	...Sch...meier?
053	Yeah. Nice name, don't you think?
054	............Anyway.
055	Aren't you one of the seven dragons? What are you doing locked up here like this?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0025
056	Even the Dragon Realm has wars between factions... I was just one of its casualties.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
057	You're not from around here, are you? You don't seem to be from any of the seven layers. A castaway from another world, perhaps?
058	You can stash the labels. I'm just me.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
059	I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just curious what someone like you is doing in a place like this.
060	I haven't seen many sightseers running around with halberds before.
061	Like I said, I wanted to test my strength. I'm here to kill a dragon.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
062	Impressive. So am I your target then? I am one of the seven dragons, as you said.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0024
063	It's pretty hard to look tough when you're trapped in a cage, you know.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
064	But no. I'm after bigger prey. I decided I'm going to take down Dragon King Ophioneus, himself.
065	Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
066	I'm starting to worry about that too.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
067	As soon as I entered this place, I realized that as long as this Dragon Realm thing exists, I won't be able to reach the summit.
068	Anyway, I was just about to sneak back out when I overheard your voice.
069	So that's what you were up to.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0044
070	Well then, what if I were to hire you?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
071	Hire me?
072	I need to get out of here. I still have some unfinished business on the outside.
073	And just what's in it for me?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
074	I'll tell you how to kill a dragon.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
075	----
076	You said that's why you came here, didn't you? There's more to hunting than simple strength. It takes knowledge of your target to succeed.
077	Knowledge is power, after all. If you help me, I can give you that power.
078	...Alright then, I accept.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0037
079	Well let's hurry up and get out of here, then. I don't want to get spotted by anyone.
080	Now? Just like that? Fine by me, but how do you plan to get me out of here?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0008
081	...
082	Like that. Now come on, let's get going.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
083	...Um, er, I've brought your meal, but...huh!?
084	Uh oh.
085	..."Uh oh"?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
086	TH-THE PRISONER IS ESCAPING!!
087	Hmm, I didn't think it would be so loud...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
088	...What did you think was gonna happen!?
089	Look, it was the most efficient way.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
090	The most efficient way to do what? Alert the guards?
091	...Don't worry. We just have to double down and we'll come out ahead.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
092	Ok, now let's get out of here.
