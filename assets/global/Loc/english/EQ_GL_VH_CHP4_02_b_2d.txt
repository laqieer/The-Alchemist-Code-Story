001	Tch...
002	What in blazes are you playing at?
003	Is that all you've got?
004	I've no respect for people like you.
005	Have you no sense of pride?
006	Lilith's lip curls in disgust as her sclera begins to darken.
007	And what would you know of pride?
008	What would you know of dirt and blood on your hands just to make it through the next day?
009	This power...
010	Siegfried! Get down!
011	Damn it!
012	You won't get away this time.
013	Haaah!
014	You're just a group of wannabe heroes on high horses!
015	You don't know what it's like for the ones who fall through the cracks.
016	Doesn't matter to me when you're dead, anyway. You'll be just the same as the rest.
017	You can join her if you miss her so much.
018	...What?
019	I slew her, hero.
020	And I'm not averse to sending you to her either!
021	No. No!
022	You're lying!
023	...
024	Siegfried, stop!
025	You'll only get yourself killed!
026	LET GO OF ME!
027	A hailstorm of lightning bolts sweep the field, terminating in wicked arrows.
028	In the distance, the shouts of Goetia soldiers grow louder.
029	They're coming in droves...
030	We have to lose them or they'll track us down.
031	I'll make them pay!
032	Now is not the time!
033	I promise you, Siegfried—there is none other I would see punished for what they did to Eira.
034	Come on, we have to return to the Professor!
035	Scour the area! If they have sympathizers in Lustberg we won't be getting in!
036	...We'll leave the rest to you, Godslayer.
037	That's enough, Belial.
038	I'm...tired.
039	*SCREECH*
040	We're just letting them go, aren't we?
041	Guess I can see how Red ended up in her cell.
042	It's not as if I have a place to-
043	...
044	All right, all right, time to clean up the fallout.
