001	What's going on? The Vermin became docile while undergoing metamorphosis!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0026
002	That power...it must be!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0042
003	The insects know that there's no need to fight!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
004	Neither we nor the insects have to fight!
005	If you advocate for your rights using the proper means, I'm sure everyone would understand—
006	Do you have insects swimming around in that hallow brain of yours?! If you're gonna spew nonsense then I'll silence you permanently!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0012
007	Women fall in love with men too! As long as we don't hate each other, I'm sure we can find a way to get along!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_0001
008	You're talking about men and women who are equal! When a powerful witch falls in love with a man, he ends up being the one that gets dominated!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
009	A-are you saying that women aren't allowed to fall in love?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
010	The women of this country already avoid men. So, from now on, men should choose the women.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0040
011	That would finally make things fair, wouldn't it? We men will one day spend our lives as insects! The least you could do is serve as flowers of tribute to our sacrifice!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0007
012	Flowers of tribute? What's the point of such one-sided love?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
013	There doesn't need to be one! Flowers don't need to speak; they just need to serve as food for insects!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0017
