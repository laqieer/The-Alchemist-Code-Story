001	I've got you now!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0007
002	An illusion?!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0025
003	It's not always brute strength alone that wins the day...though it can certainly help!
004	Gah!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0042
005	Oh, dear. That looked rather painful. I think you may have overdone it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
006	Huh? No, there's no way...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0025
007	I-I mean, good! That should teach him not to mess with me anymore.
008	Humans are quite resilient, anyway. I'm sure he'll be fine.
009	Urgh... I'm not dead yet, at least...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
010	Ah, sorry, but I'll be taking that gun from you now.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
011	...A wise move.
012	Look, I admit it, okay? I lost. I forfeit.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
013	Good boy.
014	Permit me to ask you something, though...Emmel, was it?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
015	Yes, that's right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
016	Well... I understand that you want to save as many people as possible for your brother's sake.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
017	But it seems as though you've elected to part from his side and fight for his ideals without him. Why?
018	What? Uhh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
019	He was chosen by the Infinite Serpent, was he not?
020	You should've just let him fight his own battles. Let him do things his own way.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
021	Let him try to save everything and everyone, if that's what he wants to do. They're his ideals, not yours!
022	All you needed to do was stand by his side, and be there for him if he required your aid!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
023	So why have you been going out of your way for his sake, to the point of self-sacrifice, rather than striving to rejoin him?!
024	...Because I want to give him a future.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
025	As I told Shahel, I don't have much time left in this world.
026	And I don't want to see my brother get hurt on my behalf anymore.
027	Even putting all that aside, though...
028	I can tell that the Alchemy my brother uses is extraordinarily dangerous.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
029	The incredible things that Alchemy can do just don't make sense when you take into consideration how little magil they consume.
030	When he uses it, it feels like something frightening and forbidden, as if he's forcibly summoning things into this world which should never be called upon.
031	I can tell that only a single, small misstep could lead to his complete and utter devastation—or someone else's, for that matter.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
032	Yet despite knowing these dangers himself—better than anyone, I imagine—he has never once hesitated to use those powers. To him, if he can save others from distress, it's all worth it.
033	So you're not trying to save everyone on his behalf after all; you're just setting the stage so he no longer has to use Alchemy.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
034	That's right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
035	The gap in devotion between us is cavernous indeed. I suppose the loyalty of a discarded child to his adoptive father is but a farce when compared with the bonds of true family.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
036	A...discarded child?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
037	Well... Uh, never mind that part.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
038	All right, Ignacio. You've said your piece. Now it's time to get down to business.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
039	Let's see how loyal you are to your dear sister. You know how to use this gun, right? Right?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0008
040	I have no intention of telling you anything about that.
041	Despite the position you're in?
042	I belong to the Infinite Serpent.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
043	But you're also my brother.
044	Yes, I suppose I am.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
045	So come on! Brother it up! Teeeeach uuuus!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0018
046	Emmel? A little help? My sister is scaring me.
047	...
048	Well... Now you're scaring me, too! Please don't look at me like that.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
049	I'm going to stop Father. I once promised him I would.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
050	I...see.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0016
051	So that, too, is his will, then...
052	Won't you please help us?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
053	Well, I...suppose I don't have much choice.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
054	That's not a very encouraging reply.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
055	You know, for how frail you look, you can be quite imposing.
056	I've been hearing that sort of thing a lot lately.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
057	Speaking of, where's Quence?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
058	He's a bit...tied up at the moment, back in his quarters at the castl—
059	Hey. Are you done convincing him to help?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
060	Yes, I do believe we just crossed that bridge.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
061	You all give me such a headache...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
062	See, I told you you'd regret leaving me.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0007
063	...I don't like you, you know. I didn't like you before, but now I really, really don't like you.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
064	Hmph. The feeling's mutual.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
065	Um, I do believe the fight is over. There's no need to continue.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
066	We're not fighting.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
067	I wouldn't waste my energy fighting with him. He's not worth it.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
068	All right. If you say so!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
069	Come on, then, let's go. It's time to challenge the Cursed Beast of Pride once more!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
