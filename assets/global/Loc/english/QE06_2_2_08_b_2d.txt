001	AAAAND...it's done!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0009
002	…………
003	Try it! ...Huh? What's wrong?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
004	It's just...I hope what I said didn't set us astray…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
005	We'll figure it out as we go! Don't think too much. Food is either good or bad.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
006	Besides…we already know we’re in for a difficult climb. After all, we're trying to use food to bring about peace.
007	All you have to do is try it and tell me what you think. That's all!
008	…You're right. Okay. I give thanks for this food.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
009	…What do you think?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
010	...Oh! Wow…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0024
011	Is it delicious?
012	It's different than before... Yeah, not bad.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
013	Not bad? Damn it! Not "delicious?"	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0022
014	Er, well it's definitely the best I've had so far...	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
015	That's not the response I was hoping for! I want to hear you say that magical word!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0039
016	…Er, well…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
017	But hey! That was our first attempt! We're getting close--I can feel it!
018	Right...and compared to before, my stomach feels much more satisfied.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
019	Hot diggety dog!! We must be on the right track!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0009
020	Just a little more... You're definitely gonna say that it's delicious!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
021	*Chuckle* You're such a dummy.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
022	You already knew that.
023	Yep, sure did.
024	Still...I wonder if what we're doing is even possible--putting chakra directly into food and converting it into life force--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
025	We just did, didn't we?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
026	Oh, what I mean is... Yes we did, but how on earth--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
027	It's simple! All you need is the power of positive thinking: "Be delicious. Be delicious."	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
028	…That's it!?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
029	Of course, that's not all there is to it. But it's important nonetheless.
030	… Kinda like giving thanks to the food and the chef?
031	Bingo! You're starting to catch on!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
032	…There's still so much to learn.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0011
033	You'll get there soon enough... I can tell you think of your big brother often.
034	…My brother?
035	You said you wanted to change for your big brother, right--So that you don't burden him?
036	You have a good heart, Kaede. That's why…I know you'll be alright.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
037	Do you...really think so?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
038	I do! Without those horns, you could easily pass for a human!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
039	My horns!? They're a part of who I am! I'd never want to lose them…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
040	I'm not saying you should get rid of them. I just meant--human or demon--who cares about that?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
041	As long as we can laugh around the dinner table together, what difference does it make?
042	You and I can still enjoy a meal together like this--with or without horns.
043	I think that's what will lead to peace in Wadatsumi.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
044	…I hope so.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
045	…! Kaede, I need you to hide.
046	...?
047	It's alright. Hurry!
048	Who's there?
049	It's me.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
050	…What do you want now? No matter how many times you ask, I won't join the Phoenix Brigade.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
051	I just dropped by to say hello. I'm not here to try to recruit you. There's something I need to confirm.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
052	…What might that be?
