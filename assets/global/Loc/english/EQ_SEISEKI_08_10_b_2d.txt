001	Huzzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
002	Monzein...who would've thought he was such a warrior.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
003	His demonic way of fighting...if possible, I would've liked to have had him on our side.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
004	Ugh...! What are you saying? Such a wild way of fighting wouldn't last for very long...	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
005	Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
006	What...?! He still possesses that much power?!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
007	I still can't seem to see an end in sight. At this rate, do you not think we'll end up with more crushed versions of our boastful prototypes?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
008	N-no...I would hardly think so...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
009	Heheh... Now then...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
010	King of Envylia...it is about time you handed over Leviathan to me.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
011	Huff...huff...! Argh! What speed. It's like I can't even see her movement!
012	No...is it really a matter of speed? Even I can't discern it with my eyes.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
013	Now isn't the time for unnecessary thoughts! We don't have much time...huh?!
014	Huh...?! B-Bud...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
015	I-I'm sorry! My arm just started moving on its...!
016	Oh...have the two of you started to play together? It's rude of you to leave a lady on her own. I thought you were gentlemen.	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
017	Argh...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0019
018	Ack! Basheeny, forget about me! Just get out of here!
019	Don't be stupid! Of course I can't do that! Ack!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
020	Then kill me!
021	Heheh. I guess your boastful Phantom Arts aren't very useful if you're being pulled down by your friend.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
022	All right then, shall we end it?
023	Bud, behind you!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
024	Agh! M-my body...!
025	Basheeny! Bud!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
026	...!
027	Argh! Don't get in my way!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
028	All right then. Let's start with you! Now let me hear your final cries of sheer agony!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0015
029	Those are the men who will inherit my code of chivalry. I will not allow you to harm them!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0010
030	Hey, what is this?! Stop!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0027
031	Hyaaahhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
032	Why doesn't it work?! Stop! I said stop! Stoooop!!!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0021
033	Ugh...?! M-Monzein...! Why?!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
034	Hmph. A knight who is truly prepared is a knight who cannot be decieved!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
035	Wh-what is this...?! Ack... Let go of me!!!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0027
036	Agh...!!! Ackkk...!!!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0025
037	Y-yes...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0046
038	My fingers are free!
039	Ugff...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
040	Captain?! Are you all right?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
041	Ugh...ghh. I still have nearly half of my strength left!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
042	B-but it seems like my time...is almost over.
043	Sorry, but once you meet up with Yauras and the others...I'll have to leave the rest to you.
044	...! Captain...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
045	I'll...get started on my last task. I can't afford to finish emptyhanded.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
046	Wait...are you talking about Orion?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0022
047	You want me to give you Leviathan?! You idiot! I would never comply with such a demand...
048	King of Envylia...think carefully before you answer.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
049	Once we eliminate that lot...our swords will be pointed at the people of this country. Do you understand?
050	If you offer up your Sacred Stone, you'll be able to avoid meaningless casualties.
051	First you attempt to control me and now you're threatening me? You don't seem to really understand Leviathan, do you?
052	What are you talking about?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
053	The jealousy that rests within Leviathan...it can only be inherited by another if I will it.
054	In other words...even if you mentally manipulate me or attempt to threaten me...
055	Without my will, none of it matters.
056	If I were to release it, it would lose its power more and more...and eventually be nothing more than a pebble.
057	In other words...unless you truly want to give it away, I won't be able to possess it for my own?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
058	Yes. And, as long as I'm alive...I will never allow that to happen.
059	I see. I'm glad we were able to have this talk. It saves me both time and effort.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
060	What do you mean?
061	This is what I mean.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
062	Aghh...!!!
063	...! What the...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
064	Your Majesty!!!
065	Ug...ggh...! Y-you scum!
066	My goal is to destroy the balance of power in this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
067	I had wished to obtain the Sacred Stone for myself, but even if it is to become as useless as a pebble...
068	As long as that equilibrium is broken, that's all that matters.
069	Y-Your Majesty! My king!!!
070	Bu...Bud...Ta...take Leviathan to the prince. As long as the Sacred Stone is...safe...
071	Your Majesty!!!
072	I see... What you say is true.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
073	As if to pursue your death, Your Majesty, the Alchemy energy is disappearing from Leviathan. Heheh. How interesting.
074	Tsk...! Interesting?! Doesn't human life mean anything to you?!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
075	Human life? It's the cornerstone of what moves this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
076	The cornerstone?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
077	Those who are chosen by fate move this world. All others serve as cornerstones for such individuals.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
078	That is how this world's history has been spun.
079	You...!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
080	Don't worry. I'll have your life serve as the foundation for my rule. Get rid of him.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
081	Even if history displays me that way...even if that is the reality that I cannot escape...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
082	At the very least...my code of chivalry will not forgive you!!! Huzzzaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1008
083	...! His power has increased again?! He might very well come charging in to our army! His overconfidence is getting the better of him. Attack!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
084	Y-you gotta be kidding me. After just how much you've made fun of me...do you think I'd let you get away with it?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0029
085	...You!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
086	If I restrain you from this distance, you won't be able to lay a finger on me.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
087	I'll have to at least have Orion be in my debt or there's no telling what Sol might say.	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
088	Ack! I won't let you!
089	...?! That power! Don't tell me... Did you use that power?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
090	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
091	Are you planning on engaging in single-handed battle with Orion?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0022
092	You're an idiot. You're planning on abiding by your code of chivalry until the very end, aren't you?
093	C-Captain Yauras...!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
094	...! Captain Yauras...of the 1st Regiment?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0027
095	The main troops have entered the vicinity already. They are intercepting the Scarlet Flame Guard. It'll be okay now.
096	Hmph. According to Sieba, you're confident when it comes to agility, right?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
097	In that case, how about it? What does it feel like to be attacked from behind? Does it send shivers down your spine?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
098	Captain Yauras, behind you!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
099	Right...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
100	Maybe it feels like the sensation you're experiencing right now.
101	Huh?! Behind me...?! Ack...!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0025
102	The damage that she received from Captain Monzein...it's still there!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
103	Monzein may have gone easy on you because you're a woman, but I won't.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0010
104	I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.
105	...! Yauras...
106	Monzein! Don't worry...leave the rest to me!
107	...!
108	I will witness the end of your walk down the path of chivalry!
109	And...taking on your resolve...I will become even stronger!
110	Ugh! Arrghhh!!!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
111	Slender Twin-Blade!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0032
112	Aghh!!! Ackk!!!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0025
113	Heh... I'll leave the rest to you.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0020
114	Ugh...ghh! J-just a little more...! Hold on just a little more...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
115	Huzzzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
116	What?! He doesn't stop! No...in fact, he's even faster than before!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0020
117	What a fighting spirit he has. Heheh. It makes my blood boil even hotter!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
118	Your Highness...what are you doing?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
119	I want to dedicate a flower in celebration of the first step of our assault.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
120	Orion...! Out of the way!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
121	Heheh. The Great Thunder Axe...will you be able to take the head of the Lion Monarch?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
122	Of course! Prepare yourself, you King of Beasts!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
123	He flew?! No...! Emperor Orion!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
124	Hmph...!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0003
125	Ugh...?! Aghh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
126	Impressive, Monzein...taking on such a massive army...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
127	You are a glorious warrior! To be honest...I regret that I will have to end you, however...
128	Ugh...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
129	As one who aims to rule... I cannot allow myself to stop moving forward!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
130	Unfortunately...it is too dangerous to allow you to remain alive.
131	Scatter into the wind, you brave and just knight! Let the blade of the Lion Monarch erase your existence!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0011
132	Captain Monzein!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0028
133	...Ugff...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
134	...!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
135	...Ukkk...! Uggkkkk...!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
136	...What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
137	...! He is pushing Orion's sword back...!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
138	It can't be?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
139	...Aghhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
140	What the...?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0022
141	He made Orion's blade ricochet! He can still win this!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0046
142	Emperor Orion!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0020
143	I am Captain Monzein of the Holy Guard's 2nd Regiment!!!
144	In the name of justice, I will take your life, Lion Monarch Orion!!!
145	Ac...ack!!!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0023
146	...Agh...?! Ugh...ghhhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
147	What...?! Leviathan?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0022
148	Ta...take it, Basheeny!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
149	?! Ouch! Captain M-Monzein...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0042
150	Wh-why...have you stopped your attack?!
151	...! No, it can't be...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
152	Rather than saving his own life...he chose to save that rock instead?	VO_orione.orione_battle_0027
153	He must know that Leviathan has lost its effect. What is this supposed to mean...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0021
154	I-it means that thing you hold is far more important than your existence...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
155	Uck...uckkk... Take the Sacred Stone...and use its true power wisely...ugfff!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0020
156	What...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
157	It can't be! The effects have already...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
158	Th...the true power...of the Sacred Stone...is not the Alchemy energy...encapsulated within it...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
159	The hearts of those...who gather...the Sacred Stones...will be passed on...to the next generation...giving meaning...to the will of the people...
160	The will of the people?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
161	The true power...of the Sacred Stone...is its force...to connect the souls...of all.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
162	Whe...whether it were to be transformed into a pebble...that effect...will not...vanish!
163	Ugh...ghh...! S-someone like you...who can only see the power...that lies before their eyes...will never understand this...until the day...you die...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
164	...!
165	Your Majesty, don't allow yourself to indulge in such silly dialogue...finish him.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
166	...Enough!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0015
167	Your...Your Majesty?!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
168	This man was able to corner me to this point.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
169	I will not permit any other to lay a hand on him.
170	Besides...there is no longer any need to finish him off.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
171	D-does that mean...?!
172	............
173	C...Captain Monzein!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
174	We're heading out!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
175	Huh? Wh-what are you saying?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
176	Waginau...you understand, don't you?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
177	The line that that man drew...no matter how many troops we had, we could not cross it.
178	Besides...the immortal soldiers that Vier manipulated have been destroyed. What can we do now?
179	Ugh...	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
180	Not to worry. Whether we gain control here or not doesn't change the final outcome.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
181	Captain Yauras! In honor of this man I will withdraw from this place as promised.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
182	However, next time things will not be so easy. If you wish to stand in my way, I will not hold back!
183	Right back at you.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
184	Hmph. Let's go.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
185	Tsk! Are we just going to let him go free?!
186	Both the Scarlet Flame Guard and the Blue Flame Guard have suffered more casualties than expected...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
187	Even adding our reinforcements, it's likely to assume our damage will only increase further.
188	Seeing the current state of this city as well...it would be best to focus on rebuilding it.
189	Tsk! Arghh!!! This is...! This is so unfair!!!
190	Ugh...ghh! Captain Monzein! Bwahaaaah!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
191	...Basheeny.
192	Why? Why?! Why did it have to be like this?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
193	This is all wrong! Why does Captain Monzein have to die...and I get to keep living?!
194	Basheeny...calm down.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
195	I-I can't calm down!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
196	Captain Monzein was supposed to hate me! But...
197	Why did he continue to protect me?! This is all wrong! I was the one who was supposed to die!!!
198	Ughh...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
199	Pull yourself together. Crying isn't going to fix anything.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
200	If you have time to do that, then remember in your heart what he meant to you.
201	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
202	He entrusted the future in your hands. You are now obliged to witness his end.
203	Look carefully...witness the final moment of this brave knight who continued to maintain his honor until the very end!
204	Waa...waahhh! Ca...Captain Monzein...!!! Waaaahhhhh!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
