001	Y-you cannot...defeat...me!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
002	I know. Your regeneration is incredible.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
003	But you know what? I've never seen a creature survive having its head cut off.
004	What?!
005	Azami.
006	Now.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
007	Wha—?!
008	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0032
009	Heh! You startled me for a moment, but a feeble strike like that cannot decapitate me.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
010	Azami! Hold it there! I'm coming!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
011	?!
012	Amane!
013	Ready when you are!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
014	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhh!
015	Grraaagh!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
016	Well done, Azami.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
017	She was...just taking too long.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
018	Azami!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
019	Huh? H-hey! Amane!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
020	You did it! You did it, Azami!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
021	What the—?! Why are you crying?! Ew! Watch your snot! Gross!
022	All's well that ends well, eh?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
023	Azami, what of the demons out there?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
024	We've eradicated them all, sir. The others should be catching up to me shortly.
025	Well done.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0047
026	Okay then! Now that we've defeated the big boss of demons, it should get a whole lot easier to fight demons in this region!
027	Let's get back to headquarters and have ourselves a feast!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
028	Hee hee... I'm glad to see you enjoying yourselves.
029	Who...?!
030	Impossible! How can it stand after being decapitated?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0025
031	Decapitated? Ah... You must be talking about that one over there.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
032	How?! Its corpse is still here!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
033	What made you think there was only one of me?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
034	!!!
035	Th-there's so many...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
036	No!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
037	Azami!
038	No, no, no, no, no! This can't be real!
039	Oh, it's real.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
040	Unfortunately for you, we have plenty of spares to go around.
041	No...!
042	I think we should burn this little fox hole.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
043	H-how could you...	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
044	Heh. Yes! Despair!
046	You're not going anywhere!
047	Wait! We gotta put out the fire first!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
048	Tch!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
049	Azami! Wake up! Can you stand?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
050	This can't be real... No matter how many times we kill it, it's going to come back...?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0020
051	No! It can't be!	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
070	Azami...
052	I'm taking you with me.
053	Ah?!
054	Amane!
055	You!!! I will kill you!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
056	!!!	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
057	Azami!!!
058	You, let go of Amane. Now.
059	Do you think you can do anything against me on your own?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
060	Hey... Will you leave this place if I go with you?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
061	With you as a prize, I would call it a good day. Sure. I'll leave.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
062	Amane... What are you—?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
063	Don't worry, Celis. I will not die just yet. I will come back.
064	More importantly, please take care of Azami.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0011
065	Amane!
066	If they want me this badly, surely they won't bring me to any harm. So please. Wait for me.
067	You're not leaving once you come with us.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
068	I'll be back.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0011
069	Amane!!!
