001	According to the reports, this is one of the spots where they've been conducting those horrific Alchemical experiments.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0031
002	Aha! Here we are. Records.
003	Extraction of Alchemia from living beings... Observation of test subjects after strenuous exertion... Effects of experimentation on human anatomy...
004	It's all so grim!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0029
005	How can such atrocities take place here in this country, unexposed by the Inquisition? I must dispose of this all immediately!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0016
006	Behind the public efforts to put an end to the war, illegal Alchemy experiments are being conducted by an underground organization, planting fresh seeds of new conflict.
007	Of course, the researchers covered their tracks as best as they could in the time they had, to avoid any questioning from the Inquisition. But inevitably, some traces remain.
008	Their work likely no longer serves any nation in any positive way, yet it's the patronage of those in charge that brought about these ill-begotten seeds.
009	And like my mother and sister did that day, countless innocent civilians are sure to suffer as a result. I cannot turn a blind eye to this.
010	So I will bring ruin to it all. It's the only just thing to do.
011	!!! Who's there?!	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0019
012	Tch. Got me.
013	You. I've sensed your presence following me for some time now. What is it you want?	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0002
014	That's no concern of yours. It's not you I'm after.
015	Hold it!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0001
016	Rrg...
017	Master?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
018	Ah! Erm, it's nothing. Don't worry. I must have simply been lost in my thoughts.
019	You're tired, is more like it. Perhaps we should rest for a while?
020	No, I'm fine. Let's continue. Training with you always lifts my spirits.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0007
021	If you're sure!
022	I am. Now, come at me with everything you've got!
023	Right! Here we go!	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0037
