001	Haaa... That took a little longer than I thought it would.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
002	Wow... So while everyone's asleep, you're out here, walking around and protecting the city!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0045
003	Hmm? Oh. Well, that is part of the reason why I am patrolling, yes.
004	Haa... You're amazing, Lofia!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0046
005	It was just a little detour on the way.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1021
006	H-huh?
007	Now, why are you...? Well, I suppose you did have quite a long sleep in the afternoon. It's only natural that you would have trouble sleeping.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
008	Why am I like this?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
009	Lustburg may be a snowy country, but the days are surprisingly hot.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1021
010	It's better to go into safe mode and sleep than to let yourself overheat, right?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
011	Overheat?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
012	When you first came here, you had a lot of trouble controlling your magic, didn't you?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
013	Y-yeah, that's right! I forgot, but whenever I'd try to use my magic, I'd start feeling really warm, and then—	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
014	That's called overheating. The heat from your magic steadily raises your body temperature, until you start losing control of your magic and eventually pass out.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
015	You experienced this many times as a child. Hence why you are sensitive to the heat and use up much more energy than most when attempting to control your magic in the middle of the day.
016	Using up so much energy makes you tired. It's only logical.
017	I'm sorry. I... I don't really remember overheating. My memories of that time are all...fuzzy.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0035
018	Of course they are. The human mind cannot function correctly in that state.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
019	But...I do know that you and Michael were always there for me.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
020	Ah, I miss those days. You know, I think I recall a time when Michael got distracted and ended up taking a direct hit! His moustache turned black as soot.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
021	N-no! I burned Michael's moustache?!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0026
022	Only the very tips. Oh, but it was so funny!	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
023	P-please don't tell me I ever hurt you, Lofia!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0047
024	Well... A few burns here and there, and the occasional bout of frostbite...but nothing for you to be concerned about. I've long-since healed up now!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
025	F-frostbite?! N-no! I...! I did that to you?!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0020
026	I... I can't believe I hurt you.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0021
027	Don't be silly! Like I said, I'm all better!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
028	...
029	Ravina?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
030	All I've ever done is cause you and Michael trouble.	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0019
031	You're always so kind to me, giving me cookies and waiting at my bedside for me to wake up.
032	Michael carries me to my room when I fall asleep. I... I love the both of you so much.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
033	But...I did terrible things to you—to both of you! Not only that, but I somehow forgot all about these things...
034	Ravina...
035	I guess you'd be better off if I wasn't around.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
036	...
037	Hey, Ravina? I'd like to take you somewhere nice. Will you come with me?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
038	H-huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
039	I usually don't tell people about this place, but you can be the exception. Come on, let's get going! Actually, wait...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
040	I suppose I had better deal with the rest of this lot first!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
