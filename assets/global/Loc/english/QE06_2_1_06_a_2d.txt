001	Demons! Prepare to meet your maker!
002	Dancing flames, heed my call!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_favorite_0001
003	Now's our chance! Don't let up!
004	Status Report! Our troops have suffered little damage. At this rate, victory will be ours.
005	Hm… The demons are persistent. No matter how many of them we destroy, more keep coming…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
006	We've got a long way to go until we stamp out this threat.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0030
007	It's only thanks to you, Lady Mitsuha, that we were able to corner them.
008	My duty is to protect the people of Wadatsumi as a member of the Aquila Rubrum royal family. You should expect nothing less.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
009	That is why I entered the Phoenix Covenant…
010	But…our people grow weary of this never-ending war against the demons...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
011	Are you not weary yourself?
012	…Our people need me. This is no time to rest on our laurels. We must deal with the situation at hand…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0039
013	…What on earth!?
014	So, you are the human leader with special powers.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
015	…Huzzaaaaaah!!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0032
016	…Hm. Troublesome, indeed. This won't be as easy as I thought.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
017	You must be the demons' leader. Why have you appeared before me?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0001
018	Consider it a warning. We won't allow you to do as you please any longer.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
019	It's time the tides of war shift in our favor.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
020	At this rate, demons will become extinct. Have you come to prevent that from happening?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0045
021	Say what you will--we demons will have the last laugh.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
022	Let me phrase it in a way you'll understand. If I defeat you, then humans will--	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
023	If I defeat you demons will--	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
024	Prevail!!
025	Take that!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0004
026	!!!
027	Arg--Quite impressive for just a scratch. Your skills are fearsome, puny human… Confound it.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
028	"Puny humans" cannot match demons with power alone, so we must cultivate our minds…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0001
029	We do not flaunt power like you do--we support one another--that is the source of our strength.
030	Hmph. We have no such concept. But so what?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
031	The mind has no shape. Chakra gives it shape, making it possible to interfere with others…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
032	The "mind" evolved into "skill" through the Phoenix Covenant. That is the essence of our art and its depth.
033	…I see.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
034	With this art, we will defeat you demons… And…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
035	You will know the fortitude of the Wadatsumi Aquila Rubrum lineage and the Phoenix Brigade which I command.
036	What!?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
037	…
038	An ink technique?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
039	….
040	You scattered my spell!?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
041	Who…or what are you?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
042	We are one and the same. However, as you said, our source of power differs from you humans.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
043	Your power derives from a concept unfamiliar to us. It's quite impressive, indeed.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
044	However, did you think we would idly stand by as you devised power for yourselves?
045	…!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
046	I may be chief among demons, but these two…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
047	They are born to become demon kings…!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
048	…!!!
