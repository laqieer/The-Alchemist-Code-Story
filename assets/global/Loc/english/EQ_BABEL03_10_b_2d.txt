001	Heh! Not bad! I guess I can go all out!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
002	Well, if they're going to be so clingy, it's rude to leave so soon. I'll tear you all to shreds!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
003	They still have strength to spare?! If this keeps up...!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
004	What are you getting faint-hearted for? You don't mind if Carla gets taken away?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
005	I will never allow that!	VO_balt.balt_event_1013
006	This is where we make our stand! Get behind me! Huzzaaaah!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0032
007	Carla! Don't over-do it!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0015
008	I'm fine! I've always wanted to do my part to keep this desert safe, but all this time, I was the one being protected.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
009	It brings tears to my eyes! That's why I still have so much to give back!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
010	Carla!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
011	Remember when Hawk said I'd be able to control this power when I have something to protect? Now is that time!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
012	You're after me, right?! Then I'll take you on! Come on!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0040
013	So, this is Spiritbonding!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0009
014	Aw, man. I can't slack off when she's pulling out all the stops like that.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0027
015	Yes... It is a shame. You might even break a sweat.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1038
016	Lucian, Retzius, your mission is not yet complete, understand?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
017	Of course.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0006
018	Leave it to us!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0005
019	Ramses, you're not out of commission, are you? We must show them that we nobility are not to be trifled with, either.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
020	Absolutely!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
021	Carla, we won't let you fight alone! I will protect you, no matter what! For Hawk's sake as well!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
022	We will protect this desert together!
023	Thank you, all of you! Let's protect our home! Hm? What's that sound?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0033
024	It's the Sand Hawks!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
025	I see our own guild members, too.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
026	Even some members of the nobility... What is going on?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0042
027	Captain! Are you okay?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
028	All of you... Why are you here? How?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
029	Nefertiti! We will not let you fight alone!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
030	Oh my, you're all here. I am...overcome.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0025
031	Ryle, we've gathered as many members as we can!
032	Is this your doing, Ankh?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
033	I only informed each party of the situation. To be honest, I've never really trusted anybody in this desert.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0007
034	I never expected anybody to take action even after hearing about what is going on. However, there was one man who believed in everyone here.
035	You mean...?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
036	Back then, I only moved to involve a handful of people, due to my own lack of willingness to trust in others.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0018
037	This time, it's different. I called upon as many people as I could reach, and now that leap of faith has been validated on all accounts.
038	Ankh!	VO_karla.karla_sys_1046
039	I do not know if this is enough to pay off the debt I owe Hawk, but there is one thing I am sure of.
040	Just like him, everybody here believes in what this desert can be.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0007
041	It'd be a shame to call ourselves the Sand Hawks if we can't even fight off this menace!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
042	Someone take care of Ryle's wounds! The rest of you, prepare to counter the enemy!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
043	Protect Nefertiti! Don't let them lay a single finger on her! The well-being of this desert is our responsibility!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0010
044	Balt! This is...!	VO_karla.karla_sys_1046
045	Yeah... This is what a united desert looks like!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
046	Bring it on! I'll take you all down!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
047	The fun's over. Neun, it's time to go!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
048	Wait, what?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
049	Sol is calling for us. Orion contacted him. We're leaving this forsaken desert.	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
050	Tch! Things were just getting good. Hey! Looks like you all get to live another day!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
051	Next time we meet, I'll kill you. If you even manage to stay alive until then, that is.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
052	Whew. Is it over?	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
053	Balt.
054	Yeah... We won.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
055	I wish Hawk was here to see this, gosh darnit.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
056	I'm sure he's up there, watching over us.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
057	Yeah, you're right.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
058	No sprouts yet, huh?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
059	Well, we just have to be patient. It'll happen when it happens.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
060	How are things on your end?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
061	Nefertiti is the same as ever. I have no idea what she's plotting or thinking about.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
062	Oh, and Ramses started doing some bureaucratic work. He's still terrified of Nefertiti though, of course.
063	Nefertiti said the nobility are working hard to push through plans needed to bring green life back to the desert, regardless of what the Conservatives say.
064	They're going to be part of the reform to make the desert a place where everybody can make a living!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
065	What about you?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
066	Oh yeah.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
067	The Desert Wings have officially hired the Sand Hawks for security detail. Ryle wasn't there for any of the meetings, but Ankh and I hashed things out.
068	Some tasks will go to those two mercenaries, Lucian and Retzius, but most of the jobs will be ours.
069	Oh, actually Ryle did come over to have a word before I left their headquarters.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
070	What did he say?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
071	"Has anything sprouted yet? What's taking so long?" Heh. A bit unreasonable, isn't he?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
089	He even added, "We're all gonna need the crops to keep up our way of life. We're counting on you."	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
072	Never would have thought he'd say something like that. I guess he's changed.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
073	(We'll keep this place safe for you. It was meant to be somewhere you could call home.)
074	(We'll turn this place into a lush oasis. I'll treat you to some bean soup then, all right?)
075	Change is happening. People are starting to think of the future as more than what's right in front of them.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
076	Man, I have so much to tell Hawk. It's amazing to see the seeds he sowed begin to sprout.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
077	......
078	"You'll never know unless you try." Such beautiful words.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
079	It may not seem like it, but surely and steadily, things are changing.
080	I'll make this desert a place people can be proud to call home.
081	As this desert's symbol of hope, I'll make your dreams a reality, Hawk.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0008
082	Yeah, I can now believe without hesitation, the same way you did all those years.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
083	I hope you're watching, Hawk! We'll make this desert rich with life!
084	Wow, hey!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
085	What?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
086	Look! It's sprouting!	VO_karla.karla_sys_1046
087	Well, would you look at that.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0009
088	Haha... Hahahahahaha! Gosh darnit, Hawk, we did it!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0008
