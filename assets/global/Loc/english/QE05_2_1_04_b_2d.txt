001	General Leordas!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0003
002	Lord Kamui, is that you? I am glad to see that you are safe!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0031
003	It was a great relief to have you come to our aid. Are the villagers here?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
004	We did the best we could to find as many survivors as we could, but the Royal Army still has the upper hand.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
005	If only my warriors and I had arrived back in the village sooner!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
006	I know how you feel, but we must focus on what we can do now to overcome this situation.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0001
007	The front line is locked in a stalemate, but we will not be able to hold the lines like this for long.
008	Will adding our warriors to your ranks help?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
009	If you are willing and able to lend us your strength, it could give us what we need to break through.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0044
010	Numbers are a strong factor in success on the battlefield.
011	Even considering the size of the army, available space for maneuvering troops, and possible strategies or tactics, the side with greater numbers tends to have the advantage in battle.
012	Those with fewer numbers will have to rely on the strength of individuals to overcome that disadvantage.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
013	There is, however, something we must do before all else.
014	What is that?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
015	The coming battle may be the decisive clash that finally brings about the end of this struggle between our armies.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0005
016	There will be no spare resources to protect those who cannot fight.
017	We must get the survivors of your village far from the field of battle.
018	Where can we take them? No matter where we run, the Royal Army will chase them down.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
019	We have someone here who's already given the issue some consideration.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
020	Who?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
021	Hello, Kamui.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0001
