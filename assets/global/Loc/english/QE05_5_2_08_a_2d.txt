001	Good work, Ceclidis.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
002	You... Your own host!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0021
003	You're wrong there, Protector. This old rot is unworthy to be my host.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
004	Agh! Aaaaaaaaahhhh!	VO_mary.mary_battle_0025
005	Behold! The majesty! The brilliance! This is Cryphone.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0009
006	The great vessel I have sought after for so long, housing all the curses of this world!
007	You've been planning this from the beginning?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0018
008	Absolutely! Everything I have done was in preparation for this very moment!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
009	I instigated events so that the priestess would leave the country. She tasted freedom and gained a sense of hope, all so that I may take them away from her!
010	Despair! That is what corrupts her to become worthy of being called Mother of the Jam!
011	Though it was a pain organizing these events behind Ceclidis' back...
012	Everything is falling into place as planned!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
013	Though I originally intended to have that boy king as the sacrifice...
014	Heh, it must be fate that a blood relative would come charging in.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
015	Tch!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
016	You will not have your way!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0002
017	O, great mother Cryphone! Awaken, and bestow upon us your eternal bounty!
018	Eternal...bounty?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
019	What the—?! They're multiplying without devouring anything?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0026
020	This is bad! Logi, take Georgios! We're getting out of here!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
021	But...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
022	If we die here, everything would be for naught! Georgios needs immediate medical care!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0015
023	All right.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
