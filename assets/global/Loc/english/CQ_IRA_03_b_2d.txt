001	Huff... huff...
002	Pheeew! We beat them all somehow... I'm bushed!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
003	Right, um... Yeah... Same...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
004	...
005	Why?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
006	Huh?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
007	Why did you come and help me? Even after what I said...	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
008	On top of that, helping me has no benefit to you.
009	Why? It's because we're friends, duh!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
010	Huh?!
011	It has nothing to do with what pros or cons! You're my friend, so I was worried and I wanted to protect you! I don't need a reason to protect a friend!
012	A friend...
013	(A friend is a someone that weaklings use and get used by. That's it. I have no need for that.)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
014	(That's what I thought... Silma didn't have to come for me. So that must mean...)
015	...
016	Jeez! I'm relieved that I made it on time, but don't go running off by yourself and doing anything crazy again, okay?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
017	You really worried me there! It's just like Corvus said...
018	Corvus? What does he have to do with this?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0021
019	Well, you know, Corvus said that, "As strong as Ila has become, she'll try to do everything by herself..."	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
020	The Shadow Messiah are comrades guided by the same darkness, but she is not yet able to surrender herself to it completely.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
021	When she becomes aware of the darkness surrounding herself and can treasure what's important, then Ila's own darkness will grow deeper and stronger...
022	That is what the darkness within me whispers.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
023	Bewildering... That's just like him.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
024	That man always, always talks in riddles! But...
025	However, your darkness is still a far cry from being true darkness.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
026	You're always too hard to understand! Say it in a way that normal people like me can make sense of!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
027	I'm telling you that you still lack the power to handle a mission on your own.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0003
028	...
029	(I seriously never know what that guy is trying to say.)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
030	(Was he seriously trying to tell me not to try to handle everything on my own when I have comrades that I could rely on?)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
031	(So Corvus was really worried about me...)
032	...
033	Hey, Ila! Are you listening? I'm talking, Ila!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
034	What! I'm listening! I got it! I'll be more careful next time! And, I guess...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
035	Um... I guess... Um, th-thanks for saving me earlier...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0034
036	...Friends, huh?
037	Hmm? You say something, Ila?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
038	It's nothing. Just...next time, I said.
039	Next time, I'll be the one to protect you... Because we're friends.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
