001	…
002	I don't…believe it.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
003	Just a bit longer. It's almost ready.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
004	…Why are you doing this?
005	A deal's a deal.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
006	…Yes, but…
007	Just be patient.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
008	…Pft.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
009	You're not really good at fighting, are you?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0002
010	…How dare you!
011	Your opening moves are amateurish. Your attacks are weak…and you're too kindhearted to take someone's life.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
012	Now when you start rampaging, that's a different story.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
013	…
014	I was joking. Forget I said anything. As for me, I'm happy as long as I can cook.
015	…Do you live alone?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
016	Yep. My parents were devoured by demons when I was a kid.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
017	…!
018	Wait! Hang on! …I won't hold it against you. Sit back down.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
019	…Oh.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
020	Demons have to eat to survive. We humans eat other living things to survive, too. It's all the same.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
021	Well, at the time, I held a grudge against you guys, but then I thought:	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
022	"Who's to say that animals and monsters and nature don't resent me?" So, I stopped.
023	…
024	It ain't easy being without food. To eat is to live, y'know.
025	Didn't I tell you, "Eat to live, not live to eat?"	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
026	…Why...are you--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
027	There's no life on earth that wants to die. That's why we eat.
028	I probably wouldn't have made it this far if I thought otherwise.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
029	…I see.
030	…That reminds me! Hahaha! I never got your name! Would you mind introducing yourself?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
031	…I'm Kaede.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
032	Kaede, is it? Has a nice ring to it. To new friendships, Kaede!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
033	…You're a strange man. I might devour you right here. You know that, don't you?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
034	It's fine. We made a promise. I'm just happy you to kept it.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
035	…! Well, that's because…
036	There must be some reason you need to devour humans, even though it seems you can't.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
037	So, you should just do it.
038	…
039	Hahahahaha! Sorry, I bet it's easier said than done...but I'm sure you won't eat me.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
040	…What makes you so sure?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0001
041	You know my name. And I know yours.
042	You can't eat something if you know its name…That tends to be the case, anyway.
043	But if you've got to eat to live, then I don't mind going out like that. Can't really blame you, can I?
044	Still, a gentle soul like yours surely needs good cooking to live a normal, quiet life.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
045	…!? Why do you say that?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
046	It's hard to fight when you're full!
047	…!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
048	Oh, sorry!! Did I same something wrong?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0035
049	N-No. I…I'm--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
050	I see… So that's how it is…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0021
051	…
052	…Humans are cruel. They don't care about life.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0016
053	And... I'm not "normal." I have a power I can't control. I fainted suddenly...
054	…Like when you're rampaging?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
055	My brother tries to help me live a "normal" life. So, I--
056	So, that's why you want to devour me, huh?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0045
057	…
058	All I can say is... I give thanks for the life I take. I won't take anything from you.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
059	And what I can do now is…
060	Fill your stomach.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
061	…
062	…
063	What's wrong?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
064	…Forgive me.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0035
065	…?
066	The reason you had to suffer like that--it may have been my fault.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
067	You? How could that be?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
068	…It's a long story.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
069	What I'm about to tell you is a story from my past.
