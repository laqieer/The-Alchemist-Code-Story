001	Hey, wait!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
002	Wh-what?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
003	It's dangerous staying in this castle, but...I feel like it'll be a waste to go outside.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
004	A waste?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
005	The royal palace is the highest building in all of Lustburg.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004

007	Of course! You're right!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
008	But the queen is up there...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
009	We won't get anywhere if we fear an opponent we've already beaten! Let's go!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
010	Okay!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
011	Rebecca...you're starting to get pretty crazy too.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0044
