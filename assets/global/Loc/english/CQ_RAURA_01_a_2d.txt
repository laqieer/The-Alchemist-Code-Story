001	Phew...well I've certainly come a ways.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0030
002	It's so quiet out here in the countryside... I rather miss the clamor of the colosseum.
003	How many times have we seen it now, folks? The winner is once again, the one and only, the beautiful blitzkrieg, Laila!
004	It seems my strength and beauty have prevailed yet again. You aren't growing tired of me are you?	VO_laura.laura_battle_0029
005	LAILA! LAILA! LAILA!
006	...
007	(I can't pretend I don't love hearing them cheer my name, but... the pressure is really on now.)	VO_laura.laura_sys_0039
008	(Sometimes I wish I could be free of it...)
009	But there's got to be more to freedom than all this walking...	VO_laura.laura_sys_0031
010	After all, what good is all my strength and beauty without any sort of purpose? What am I even doing with myself?
011	...Oh? What is that sweet fragrance? Flowers? It seems to be coming from that forest.
012	Could this be a flower bed? There are so many of them...	VO_laura.laura_sys_0009
013	They have such delicate beauty, but...also a powerful radiance, almost like the sun. Truly magnificent.
014	Hey! Hands off the flowers, you!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0010
015	Huh?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0025
016	Tch...
017	I said back off!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
018	Hey, wait a sec! ...You aren't with him, are you?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0028
019	You must be mistaken. My name is Laila, and I'm just passing through.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0039
020	Don't worry. I wouldn't be so brutish as to disturb these flowers.
021	Flowers as strong and as beautiful as these... To trample on them would be like trampling on the sun itself!
022	Wait a minute... This lady's cool as heck! You're not anything like that guy who was trying to sell them for cash!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0024
023	That peeping Tom from before? Brutes like that are a zeni a dozen.
024	That's right! Just the other day this guy was trying to grab a bunch of them, so I kicked the crap outta him!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
025	You did? A big man like that?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0025
026	Yeah, no sweat! Oh, but you know what? We should probably get out of here. It's not safe hanging around these parts!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
027	Bugs drawn in by the flowers' scent always start to show up around this time. Look!
028	Well, it appears you were telling the truth. But I can take care of myself.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0007
029	This is perfect timing, in fact. You're about to get a front-row seat to a demonstration of my overwhelming strength and beauty!	VO_laura.laura_sys_0001
