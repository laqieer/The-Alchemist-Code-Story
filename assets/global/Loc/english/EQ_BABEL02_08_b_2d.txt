001	...
002	We've taken a lot of casualties...but at least it's over.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
003	However...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
004	Lord...Zahar?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
005	Haaaaaargh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
006	Ugh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
007	At last, the Philosopher's Stone! We have achieved that which we came for. It is time to head back.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
008	Um... Lord Zahar, what about our fallen brethren?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
009	Here they shall remain.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
010	Oh, but...
011	But they're our...comrades.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
012	Not anymore. We move forward! There will be no looking back. This place may become our grave as well, if we tarry.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
013	Yes...sir.
014	Welcome back!	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
015	You all right there, squirt?	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
016	Yep. How'd it go, Ila?	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
017	We lost...so many of our comrades...
018	Oh, no...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
019	That's all there was to it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
020	That's all...? You mean, you didn't find what you were looking for?	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
021	That's our, life, ya know? That's all there is to this fight.	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
022	...
023	...
024	Ila, I hardly care whether you like me or not, nor if you trust me. However...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
025	You mustn't betray the trust of those who believe in you.
026	Ya don't have ta tell me what I already know.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
027	...
028	We shed much blood today, but gained much in return.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
029	No, it still isn't enough.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
030	Yes, we still require more Philosopher's—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
031	No, it is power we need.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
032	...?
033	We don't have the required power.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
034	Corvus, bolster our forces with some strong new blood.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
035	I...will do as you wish.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
036	We need comrades who will add to our strength.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
037	...
038	Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
039	What's the matter, Natalie?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
040	We've gotten a letter from Ren! He managed to infiltrate the Shadow Messiah!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
041	Fabulous!	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
042	I hope he doesn't do anything reckless.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
043	Yeah...I know what you mean...but at least we'll know what's going on in Wratharis now.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
044	We're counting on you to be our eyes and ears...Ren.
045	The waves of darkness grow ever stronger.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
046	My, my, Zahar... What will you do to entertain me next?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0031
