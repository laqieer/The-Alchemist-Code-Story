001	Well, that's a face I haven't seen in a while.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
002	Get me the best alcohol you have. And put it on the tab of this big fella' right here.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1010
003	Hey, I never said I was gonna treat you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
004	Shut up. You're my client, so at least show that much goodwill. More importantly, what are you playing at?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
005	You told me that she was being targeted so I need you to escort her.
006	Hmph...that's all there is to it. Just escort her as requested. Nothing changes.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
007	Tsk. Since you've mixed me up in this complicated affair, you better reward me handsomely.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
008	That's if you complete your role.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
009	Near the west side of the village, there's a secluded rock area.
010	So you want to settle things fast. Fine then...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0045
011	Two hours from now.
012	W-was that an acquaintance, Edgar?! What were you talking about...?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0027
013	That's Don Taras...in my world, he's a well-known cleaner. He's the one who was after you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
014	...!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0019
015	I get in the way of his work and he gets in the way of mine...that's why we've decided to settle it directly.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
016	N-no...!!!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
017	After today, there won't be anyone left who wants to take your life.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
018	So, from now, you can take your time more when dancing.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
019	You may not appreciate my advice, but...when you dance...it looks somewhat painful.
020	... ...
021	I'm impressed you didn't run away. Let’s settle this, you little comb head!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
022	Yeah. Let's settle this quickly.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
