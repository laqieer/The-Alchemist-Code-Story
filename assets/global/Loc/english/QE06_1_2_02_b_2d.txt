001	Huzzaaaaaahh!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
002	Nngh!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
003	I will not forgive you! You will feel the pain of those whom you've stolen from!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
004	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
005	Wha—?! What is this?! A snake from...?! I-I can't move!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
006	Any last words, Hidden Ogre?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0015
007	Hmph.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
008	Wha—?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
009	How naive!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
010	Tch! Dammit!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
011	Hahaha! Can't cut down your friend, pathetic human? This Blade Fox must be a collective of the incompetent!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
012	Tch!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
013	You have a unique power. I will let you live, and take you with me. But first...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
014	I shall feed upon the Blade Fox!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
015	No, you will not.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
016	Who...?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
017	Hmph, how odd. I didn't think you'd have trouble with such a trifling foe, Amane. You bring shame to the Blade Fox.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
018	Captain Ugachi?!
019	Tch...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
020	Don't make me laugh!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_battle_0001
021	Wh-what?! How can he...?! Without hesitation...!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
022	Fool! Now that you've shown yourself, your mimicry is pathetically unavailing.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0010
023	I will kill all you demons.
024	Nnrgh...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
025	How many more Hidden Ogres are there? Considering the extent of this chaos, you surely aren't the only one.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
026	You dare think I would confess to you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
027	No. Die.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
028	Gah!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
029	We must find the other Hidden Ogres. Disperse!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
030	...!
031	You better hurry too, rookie. We can't let the chaos spread.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
032	S-sir!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
033	What?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
034	H-how is it that you can be so decisive?
035	What do you mean?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
036	That demon took on Azami's form, yet you showed no hesitation.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
037	Can you save a life with hesitation? Besides, the real Azami would have easily evaded that thrust.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0010
038	Um...sir!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
039	What is it now?
040	What if... What if you were bitten?
041	That is a foolish question. I would never allow myself to be bitten.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
042	But even if there was a one in a million chance I did, I would have my squad follow regulation and cut me down. That's all there is to it.
043	A member of the Blade Fox that is bitten by a demon must be purged by their squad before they themselves turn into a demon. You didn't forget already, did you?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
044	Even if that member is crucial to the Blade Fox like you, Captain Ugachi?
045	The regulations are absolute. There are no exceptions. If bitten, you are purged. That's it.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
046	But...	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
047	I'd much rather have a clean death than to become one who steals life from others. Do you not have the conviction to say the same?
048	I-I...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
049	If you have no resolve, then you do not belong here. We don't need you.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
050	...
051	Remember this. Until we kill all demons, there will be no peace.
052	That is what we are here to do.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
053	...
054	Rather die a clean death...than to become one...who steals life from others.
055	"Demons must be eradicated."
056	My every day life could be...stolen...?
057	I could become the one who steals it from others...?!
058	Rather die...than to become someone like that...
059	...
