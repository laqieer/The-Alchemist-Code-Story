001	That was the last one!
002	Adaleigh, did you get all the soldiers?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
003	I just got the last one! Quick! You should get in too!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
004	Good, I'll come—	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
005	...
006	Huh? Is... Is it looking over here?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
007	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
008	Yikes!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
009	Huh?! That wave came up so fast! It even managed to hit us at this altitude?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
010	This isn't good! Magil is leaking from the hull where the wave hit us! We've got to get out of here, Adaleigh!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
011	I know that, but!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
012	Whew, made it!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
013	Adaleigh, I don't know what's going on out there, but I got a bad feeling about this! We have to get out of this ocean as fast as possible!
014	Oh no...
015	...
016	It spotted us!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
017	It's looking this way—?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
018	If we return to the capital now, who knows what kind of damage it'll do!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
019	Nyx, divert more power to the reactor! We're headed for the border between the Invidia and Ira Belt!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
020	Got it! I'll also start Libra up just in case!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
021	We're heading for the border?! Do you have a plan?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
022	Not at all! But I feel we might have a chance!
023	The ocean is that guy's hunting ground! So if we can reach—
024	Land... If we reach that scorched land, it won't be able to follow us. That's it!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
025	I'm telling you it's just a chance! But I say it's worth a gamble when things are this bad!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
026	The reactor is re-pressurized! We're ready when you are, Adaleigh!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
027	Then let's gooo!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
