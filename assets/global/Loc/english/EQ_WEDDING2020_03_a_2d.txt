001	SQUEAK!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_b
002	Dang! They got away!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0027
003	Lady Lucia, you're incorrigible... Those Rattys seem frightened, didn't they?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
004	They did… This area must be unfamiliar to them, after all.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
005	I see why they came here, though. Their usual habitat is deep in the forest where it’s cool and dark.
006	On average, they're docile creatures that rarely harm humans and are terrified of fire.
007	Lord Ewan, you have such a wide breadth of knowledge!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
008	Soldiers often conduct camping missions, so I picked up a few survival tricks.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
009	For being such docile creatures, they certainly seemed agitated.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
010	Yes… The townsfolk mentioned they appeared here out of nowhere.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
011	Hm… Yet monsters have never taken up residence here before. Don't you think it's bizarre?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
012	Well, given the ear-splitting work that goes on here, I doubt this place is ideal…
013	They wouldn't come here unless there was a good reason…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
014	Hmm… This weapon isn't very easy to handle.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
015	Maybe if it was used more like a Ratty claw...
016	Lucia, you can't throw yourself in front of monsters just to research them.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0014
017	Hm? Why not?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0006
018	What if you got injured?
019	I can handle a few bumps and bruises in the name of research!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
020	Wow. You don't seem phased at all.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
021	You getting injured would not only justify the current closure, it would prompt a total shutdown.
022	How are you going to make your weapon then?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
023	I hadn't thought about that!
024	In that case, you’d better take care not to get hurt.
025	*Grumble* What do you care if I get hurt, anyway?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
026	Lady Lucia, Lord Ewan is just concerned for you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
027	Really? How come? I'm saying it's fine, so there's no need to worry…	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
028	Easy for you to say… I can't just let you get hurt.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
029	After all, a soldier's duty is to protect others.
030	Oh brother… That line again? I'm sick of hearing you say that…	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0030
031	What about what you want to do? Not as a soldier--as you!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
032	Huh?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
033	You know, you're always smiling, but you're not happy at all, are you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
034	…
035	Hm? What's that? Uzuma, that shiny thing over there--could that be Felicitite?
036	I'm going to have a look!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
037	Ah! Lady Lucia, please wait! Don't go off by yourself! It's dangerous!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_1011
038	…
039	Honestly…she never changes.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
040	…Is she always like that?
041	Mm-hmm. She's made the most of becoming a Phantom by focusing on enemy weapon research.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
042	I don't get it. How can she do that…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
043	For her, creating weapons is more important than anything else.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
044	…
045	I see… She wasn't forced to make weapons until she became a Phantom.
046	"Forced?"	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
047	The military took advantage of her innate power. That must be what changed her...	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
048	That's why she continues to fixate on weapons. Even though no one is forcing her to anymore.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
049	…
050	You think she changed? You of all people should know the hearts of men don't change so easily.
051	Are you sure you're not referring to yourself?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
052	…What do you mean?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
053	You only see what's on the surface. You aren't trying to see who Lucia truly is.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
054	No one has the right to decide the happiness of another. Don't impose your rigid version of truth.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
055	!
056	Are you going off alone?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0003
057	A friend of mine always told me the key to reconnaissance is to travel lightly.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
058	You must mean that spy from Wratharis...
059	She’s a bit of a loose cannon, but her skills as a secret agent are second to none. Best to follow her advice.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
060	I'll entrust Lucia to you. This may be a good chance for you to learn something.
061	(The hearts of men don't change easily…Yes, I know that very well.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
062	(My men…they all died with the same desires burning in their hearts…)
063	To fight alongside a leader who vows to protect the people--
064	It's the greatest honor! I'd follow you to the ends of the earth, sir!
065	I vowed to protect the weak from senseless violence. That's why I became a soldier.
066	I would rather live and die by that vow than to ever waver.
067	As long as I stay true to myself, I'll be happy.
068	And I'll be happy to fight alongside likeminded comrades.
069	You know, you're always smiling, but you're not happy at all, are you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
070	(How can they all smile?)
071	There's nothing to smile about…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
072	What did you find?
073	Hmm…It sure is shiny, but this isn't Felicitite.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
074	But I bet something great can be made out of this, so I'm taking it. What should I make, I wonder!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0023
075	Lady Lucia, you really love making weapons, don't you?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
076	Making weapons is everything to me. I'll do whatever it takes to make something great.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
077	I can't say that near Ewan or he'll scold me again--even though I told him I'll be fine. He's such a killjoy.
078	I'm certain Lord Ewan has good intentions.
079	You think? I dunno. He really annoyed me earlier.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
080	He said he wanted me to realize there are things more important than weapons.
081	What could be more important than weapons?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
082	Maybe if I find the answer, that will help me create a wedding knife that isn't a weapon.
083	How's it going, you two? Did you find any Felicitite?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0001
084	Nope. Nothing. We've got to go deeper.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0030
085	*Shriek*	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
086	!
087	Who could that be? I thought the mine was sealed off!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
088	There’s no time! We've got to help them!	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
