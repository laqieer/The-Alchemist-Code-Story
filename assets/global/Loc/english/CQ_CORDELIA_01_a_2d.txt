001	Nnngh... I can't believe I'm already awake. It's only three in the afternoon.
002	I'm usually dead asleep at this time. I must be stressed. There were a lot of intruders yesterday.
003	So there's a vampire living here? If that's true, we should exterminate it before it brings harm to the village!
004	Yeah, a friend of mine saw it. A female with white hair and skin as pale as a ghost.
005	Yeah, just like that girl there... She had blood soaking her lips red, and...!
006	Huff...huff... They're finally gone. I hope this convinces them to stay away.
007	I know this mansion is old, but it's not like there's treasure hidden in here or anything. We don't have anything worth stealing!
008	Ohh, ew. I think I got some of their blood on me.
009	Aaaaaaaagh! A real vampire!
010	Huh?
011	Oh, why do they have to call me names like that? I'm not even a vampire.
012	I was hoping to get some quality alone time while she's off resting, but...I'm about to lose my mind here.
013	I might not be so lonely if mother were here...
014	N-no! I shouldn't say that! Mother is working so hard for me!
015	I'm an adult now. I can't be dependent on mother or anyone else anymore!
016	I just need to...um... I know! I'll make friends! But how?
017	Maybe I can meet some friendly people if I go outside? Ugh, but it's so bright out. It's making me dizzy.
018	...Hm? Who's that over there? Another intruder?
019	Oh! Perhaps it's the owner of the mansion? I should probably go say hello.
020	Hello! I'm Alyu, a merchant from Lustburg. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
021	Oh, um...hello.
022	(I guess she hasn't heard the rumor about me being a vampire.)
023	My name is Cordelia. I live in this mansion. May I ask what you are doing here?
024	I was on my way back home from a business trip when I passed by this mansion, and I couldn't help but stare in awe of it. That's when I noticed a plant in your garden that I've never seen before.
025	I wanted to get a closer look at it, and...well...I know it's bad manners, but... I'm so sorry.
026	Oh, no, it's fine. Is this the plant you were looking at?
027	That's the one! I'm a connoisseur of sorts, but I've never seen anything like that before.
028	I didn't know such a rare thing was in our garden... I rarely leave the house because I don't much care for the sun, you see.
029	What a waste!
030	I have just the thing for you! Let me show you my catalog.
031	These glasses completely shut out and reflect sunlight.
032	People around you might not appreciate the reflected light, and these might not be the most stylish, either.
033	These are the thickest lenses I've ever seen! Will I even be able to see through them?
034	Well, how about this? It's an alchemical hood! It's enveloped in a small quantity of Alchemia, which helps protect you from sunlight!
035	It's very effective, but you might look like a member of some dangerous cult.
036	This might help isolate me from sunlight, but...wouldn't it isolate me from society as well?
037	You...don't like them?
038	Oh, um... S-sorry. I'm sure they function exactly as intended, but aesthetically...
039	If that's the case, I can go find plenty of other products! I'm quite confident in my ability to procure great merchandise...I think.
040	Heheh. Thank you. I would be glad to welcome more intruders like you.
041	Look! The vampire's out of the mansion!
042	Heading out in search of blood, are you?! We'll stake you before you have a chance to bare your fangs!
043	Ugh...not again.
044	And I was in such a good mood, too!
