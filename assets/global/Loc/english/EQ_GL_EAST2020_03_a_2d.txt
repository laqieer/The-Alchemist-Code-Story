001	Ok, so the culprit is on the upper floors of the school gathering the remaining eggs.
002	If we create more chocolate eggs...
003	...it's bound to return and find us!
004	And this time, we'll create a barrier in the hallway to prevent escape!
005	Hmm? I can't believe I missed a bunch of chocolate eggs on this floor!
006	The culprit gathers the final few eggs.
007	Now!
008	Argh! Tricked by such a simple plan!
009	Alright, we caught you, now you can stop this charade.
010	Minerva!
011	An astute observation my dear student!
012	(What... are you wearing?)
013	Maybe now you'll figure out why I'm gathering the eggs in the first place!
014	Um, yeah, you didn't want anyone else to succumb to the shrinking effect.
015	Right, right... The eggs caused the shrinking, and you were the one that created the eggs...
016	However! That doesn't give you the right to cause chaos in the school!
017	Geh! How dare you mock me! How dare you how dare you!!!
018	Seems like its not just her physical size that shrunk...
