001	Vettel, you're not going to believe what Gerald did this time! He went and fought some bandits by himself! Didn't even think about telling us first!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
002	Don't underestimate me. A couple of bandits are nothing to someone of my ability.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
003	Besides, the two of you were occupied. You were busy with the wounded, and Vettel was teaching the town children how to use a sword.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
004	I mean, yeah, but that's not the point! I wish you'd tell us these things instead of doing everything on your own.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
005	What if something happened to you? What would we do then?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
006	I understand that, but for now, there's some things I have to face alone.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
007	(...Even then, Gerald already exhibited the resolve that would later become the cornerstone of the Scarlet Flame Guard.)	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
008	(I feel like I'm finally starting to understand the true meaning of that resolve of his.)	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
009	(I want to protect the future Gerald left for this country and the Scarlet Flame Guard.)
010	(Just like Gerald did...)	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
011	The Lion Monarch's Charge shook the Continent of Babel to its core.
012	In its aftermath, Envylia and the other countries of Babel focused their efforts on recovering from the horrors of war as quickly as possible.
013	To compensate for the losses of the Blue Flame Guard, the Scarlet Flame Guard formed a new "Crown's Guard" headed by Chloe.
014	Anybody who laid eyes upon her knew she would do anything to protect her country.
015	Her example roused the morale of the other knights. It inspired them to do whatever they could to help, just like their commander.
016	Heh, we got you cornered! Didn't make it easy for us, did you...
017	Quietly hand over the goods and we'll let you walk away with your life.
018	E-eeek!
019	Stop right there!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0015
020	V-Vettel, Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard?! What are you doing here?!
021	I'm on patrol. This area sustained a lot of damage during the war, so it's been unsafe for a lot of people.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
022	Tsk...
