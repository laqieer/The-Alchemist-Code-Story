001	Nimul has reached the others, I see.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
002	Then all I have to do is wait for my cue, as arranged.
003	The time to use it has come. Zafeiris!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
004	Are you certain?
005	Of course! That's the point of this whole journey!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
006	Very well. Fringe Dimensional Art, Nero. Extraction.
007	It is time to impart the seven wonders upon he who knows the final fate of the dragons. If your body can handle them, that is.
008	What price are you prepared to pay?
009	My sense of pain, to start with.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
010	Acceptable. Your offering shall be received.
011	...Ngh!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
012	"Adhere to the dark commandments."
013	"Fall to ruin."	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0001
014	This...power...
015	Nice! A clean hit!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
016	Nn...gh... Gn...gh...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
017	(I've lost my sense of pain, and yet...this feeling of being torn apart...)
018	(Is this what it means to come in contact with the Truth of the world? Have I misjudged the cost of standing on the same stage as Nimul? Was I even prepared to pay this price?)
019	How can you still be standing after that attack?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
020	Why...do you have that...?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
021	I'm merely borrowing it. Once I've settled matters here, I fully intend to return it.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
022	I don't understand. That shouldn't be possible! You... You have her power. You...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0019
023	Nrk... What? My strength is leaving me?! Ah, I see. The magil that sustains this body has run its course.
024	Tch! What an inconvenient physical form!
025	Your power doesn't even compare to that of your master, Ouroboros.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
026	Of course not! Humans are imperfect creatures. Still...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
027	That's enough, Mesarthim.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
028	Look out!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
029	Matia?! Why are you intervening?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0025
030	Because you've gotten clumsy, Mesarthim. Have you been having too much fun playing with these children?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
031	Your biggest flaw has always been your inability to see the forest through the trees, as it were.
032	You don't even know what you're saying. They're strong, Matia. Not individually, but as a group.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0002
033	Are they? Well, if you say so. I suppose I'll just have to take your word for it.
034	Nonetheless, your defeat would be quite the problem right now, and I don't much care for babysitting.
035	Ha. I'd heard that you gave up your weapons before the end of your life and thought maybe you'd mellowed a bit, but it seems you must have had some second thoughts!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
036	You talk too much. When I said I don't care for babysitting, I wasn't talking about you. But maybe I should have been.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
037	...!
038	She stopped it with a single hand?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
039	Your swordsmanship isn't half bad. More promising than anyone else's I've seen since my transmutation, at any rate. However...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
040	Nngah?!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
041	No...
042	Andechs!
043	Gnrk... It's just a scratch!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
044	(What was that?! I didn't even see her attack!)
045	I appreciate that you recognize us as the superior force, and even planned a surprise attack to compensate for that.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
046	Sadly for you, your opponent is not so easily tricked!
047	I...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0018
048	Hmph. I thought I'd grant you a moment to reflect on your failures here, but it seems you aren't interested in such niceties!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
049	How about one final tip before we...part ways? Regarding the proper means of using sephirah...
050	We humans, plunged into the deepest depths of sin, having molded and consumed even the spirits themselves...
051	The magil here is changing again! Mira, we have to adjust our calculations, quickly!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
052	Ulgh, such a pain! Sorry, everyone! We'll adapt as fast as we can!
053	And you think I'd be so generous as to grant you enough time for that?!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0013
