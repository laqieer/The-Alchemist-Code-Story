001	Sophia! Are you hurt? Honestly... Please... Putting yourself in harm's way is super unacceptable!	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0001
002	Soleil, sorry for worrying you. I'll go home for today. Let's have tea together next time.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0036
003	Oh... Yes, I understand. Please be careful on your way home.	VO_soleil.soleil_chara_1001
004	Thank you. You too...Soleil.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
005	Yawn... Oh? Is it still this early? I've woken up at an odd hour.	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1005
006	Hmm... I can't seem to fall back to sleep. Maybe I'll try my hand at some divination.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0031
007	Huh? No...! This time it's Soleil that's in danger...? I need to go to her right away!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0012
008	I wonder if she's at her house. Oh, I hope I can get there in time!	VO_sophia.sophia_battle_0019
009	There's a light coming from the window! It seems like Soleil is safe. What a relief...	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1017
010	Hey, Muncle? Do you think Sophia will come visit me again? I wonder if I acted out of turn today...	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0030
011	When I watch Sophia, she reminds me so much of Luru... I can't help myself from wanting to look after her.	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0018
012	(Heheh. She's talking about Luruna again. Soleil told me about her the first time we met. I hope I can meet her someday.)	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
013	Sophia, do you come to this town often?	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0001
014	Yes. As long as I hide my ears, I can move about the town safely without anyone knowing my identity...although the people of my village are against it.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
015	I'm sure they're all worried about you. I have a younger sister too, so I can empathize with them!	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0007
016	In order to protect ourselves and avoid danger, we live tucked away together in our hidden village, avoiding contact with humans and other races.
017	But I want to absorb and learn more and more about what life has to offer!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
018	You're such an eager student!	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0044
019	Heheh. This time that I'm spending with you eating lunch in this town is another precious moment that I'm learning a lot from.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0008
020	I enjoy spending time with you too, Sophia! I think I can assist you in your studies! You can rely on me as if I were your older sister!	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0038
021	Ah-hahah. Actually, I'm older than Soleil...	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0008
022	...Well, well. We meet again, little elf missy.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
023	You're the men from this afternoon! What're you doing here?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0029
024	Well, our boss was none too happy when we came back empty-handed.
025	We were gonna capture the little therapist and use her to bait you, but... Your being here makes everything a lot simpler!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
026	You were going to kidnap Soleil for such a stupid reason? I see... So, you really haven't learned anything from our fight earlier.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0013
027	...All right then. I guess I'll show you...the true strength of my race!	VO_sophia.sophia_battle_0014
028	Sophia! What're you doing here at this hour? It's a little late for tea...	VO_soleil.soleil_sys_0025
029	Soleil, please, go back inside the house!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0015
030	You caused quite a lot of problems for us this afternoon, little therapist!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
031	Oh! You guys again! Are you still chasing after Sophia! Erghhh! That's super unacceptable!	VO_soleil.soleil_chara_1001
032	All right, this time we'd better catch them! Take 'em down, boys!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
