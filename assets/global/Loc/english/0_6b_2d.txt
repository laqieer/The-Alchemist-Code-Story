007	Who are you?!	0_6b_2d.dios_story0101_0024
008	I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.	0_6b_2d.uroboros_story0101_0003
009	I have glimpsed your soul bond. You are worthy to possess this power.	0_6b_2d.uroboros_story0101_0003_02

020	Where your will shall take you and how the world shall judge you—those answers lie behind the door.	0_6b_2d.uroboros_story0101_0007
021	Stand, humans! Pave the path to the unwavering truth!	0_6b_2d.uroboros_story0101_0007_02
