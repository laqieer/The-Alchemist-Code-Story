001	They were unforgettable stories; beloved tales from childhood. The adventures of just knights and princesses.
002	In a land across the sea, a knight brandishes their sword and swears their love to the princess. They protect her with all the fierceness of a lioness defending her cubs.
003	I'm not afraid of death.
004	We were children, playing children's games. There are some words that can only be said when you're playing pretend.
005	I want to be a knight!
006	I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!
007	Playing the role of princess is...kind of embarrassing...
008	Aw, c'mon. Play along, will you?
009	You're my master and I'm your servant. You should act a little more selfish and haughty with me!
010	I refuse.
011	We're family, aren't we?
012	Family?
013	Wouldn't that make things more peaceful?
014	Y'know, I hate traveling.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
015	Urk...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0029
016	I can't take baths as often as I'd like...
017	Urk... Ngh...
018	And sometimes I get stuck with a seasick roommate.
019	Nngh... Blrpk...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0029
020	It's okay. The sea will catch whatever you throw at her.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
021	I'm not going to vomit!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0013
022	Oh, look. A giant wave's coming this way.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
023	What?!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
024	A Paladin?
025	Yup. A knight of the Holy Guard. We stand for the absolute justice of the continent.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
026	Then you really did become a knight like you said you would.
027	Hey, how's that old handicrafts lady doing?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
028	Still losing her hair.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0005
029	Guess that proves that hair growth serums are always a sham, no matter where you buy it, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
030	She asked me to bring her back something from a country other than Greed Dike.
031	How about I get you some seasickness medicine?
032	I'd appreciate that.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0041
033	Wadatsumi is still restricting its relations with other countries, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
034	That's because it was in turmoil for a very long time.
035	And now that the house of Rising Ashes has the throne, everything's back to normal?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
036	The taverns are full of soldiers drinking through the night without a care for rank.
037	Ahh, now I get it.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0044
038	Get what?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
039	You're used to just reacting to the things that come up.
040	Yes, well... Not everything is solved by letting the sea swallow it up.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0030
041	So that's how you ended up getting your chance to set out and explore the world, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
042	Ikasa...
043	Yeah?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
044	Why did you leave?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
045	Huh?
046	You just left. Without telling me anything.
047	Button...
048	I was all alone for so many years, and now...
049	But I came back, didn't I? I'm right here.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
050	...
051	Geez...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0029
052	You're a demon, aren't you?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
053	Huh?
054	I hate this place! Onigashima is riddled with these fiends!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
055	Lady Leafah, please! Calm yourself!
056	No, I will not! As the warrior poised to become the next general, I cannot let this stand!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0040
057	What's going on?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0025
058	I knew I was right to keep watch! I knew that eventually someone would come along who wasn't a traveling merchant, someone from the land of demons!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
059	That's right! I've been watching for any demon fool enough to attempt an invasion of the proud nation of Greed Dike!
060	That is my duty as the future general of this nation! I must remain vigilant!
061	Did she say...the land of demons?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
062	She's talking about Wadatsumi. Since it's been restricting its relations with other nations, there have been a lot of nasty rumors going around about what's going on there.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
063	You would be wise not to underestimate me, for I am...!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
064	The future general of this nation?
065	Exactly! I like the way you think.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
066	Thanks.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0010
067	But protecting a demon is unforgivable!
068	Lady Leafah, please! These people are—
069	I know what they are! Foul demons who threaten the peace of the continent!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
070	They see us as...demons?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
071	Some people just won't listen, no matter what you tell them. You'll find a lot of her kind out here.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
072	Ikasa...
073	That's why I went home, y'know?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
074	Prepare yourself, demon!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0007
075	Lady, you've got no chill.
