001	All right. So far so good. However, our rescue subjects have progressed further in.
002	Let's step up our pace a little.
003	Hey, Kagura...
004	What is it this time? Is it about Kudan?
005	Yeah.
006	You said that you were more than childhood friends with the Captain, right?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
007	Yes.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
008	I realize now that you were talking about how he saved your life.
009	What else did you think I meant?
010	W-well, ah...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
011	Why are you blushing again?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
012	A-anyway, since Captain Kudan was with you...does that mean he's also from Wadatsumi?
013	No. When I met him, he was already in the Holy Guard.
014	From what I recall, several young Paladins, who had just been ordained, were traveling to different countries for their studies.
015	I was still 7 years old at the time, but I remember how Wadatsumi welcomed them as honored guests.
016	Kudan was 15 years old, but even then his strength stood out amongst the other knights.
017	Wow! Then again, he is the youngest captain in the history of the Holy Guard.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0045
018	Yes! Kudan was amazing back then. All the girls in Wadatsumi were crazy about him.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
019	He's still attractive, but back then Kudan was—	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0007
020	Are you guys still talking? Your pace is slowing.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
021	Oh, s-sorry, but I can't help thinking about what you just said, Captain.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0035
022	What are you talking about?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
023	Aw, come on! We're in the middle of an important conversation!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
024	First, we need to take care of these monsters!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
