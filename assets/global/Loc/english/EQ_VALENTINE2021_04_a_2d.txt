001	Ugh, I really hate pushy customers. Take it up with management, you brute!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0012
002	Margaret, watch out!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_battle_0020
003	Wha— Aaaaaahh!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
004	How dare you!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_0022
005	Margaret! Are you all right?!
006	Owww... Sorry. I should've been more careful.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0035
007	Why did you charge on ahead by yourself? You usually fight alongside me. Please, just tell me what's on your mind!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
008	Oh, um... Haha. Just, everything that's been happening. I guess I got lost in reflection. It's nothing to worry about.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0011
009	Let me see your wounds. Oh, dear me, this looks quite bad. Let's just use a little dab of this...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
010	Owwww! Gah, Lizzy, that hurts!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0042
011	With a wound like that, of course it does!
012	That monster's saliva is poisonous, so we need to be very careful here. This medicine should help neutralize it. I think...about this much should do.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
013	Aaaah!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0043
014	Nnngh... That really hurts... Which is fine—I will endure any pain for your sake—but can't you at least try to be a little gentler?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
015	Hehehe! Look, Margaret. Your cut's fizzing and bubbling; that means the treatment is working! It should heal up in no time at all now.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
016	You seem to be having fun. I'm glad I had a chance to be your test subject.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
017	I...really am glad, but...
018	(I guess I have just been a lab rat for her all this time. Or I would've been, if she'd had more opportunities to actually experiment on me.)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
019	(But what if she's just saving me up until she has something really big she wants to test out?)
020	Hey, Margaret?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0002
021	(Maybe she really does get a sort of sick thrill out of experimenting on people who've fallen gravely ill or gotten themselves injured...)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
022	Margaret? Hello?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
023	(But that doesn't change the fact that she saved me! Even still...)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
024	Tuning me out again, are you? All right, Margaret, face this way.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
025	Whoa!
026	Here, open up. Down the hatch.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0005
027	Hrmpff?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0029
028	(Ack, what did she just give me?! I knew it; she really does just think of me as a guinea pig! I mean, if that's what she truly desires, that's what I'll be, but—)
029	Wait... This is sweet!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_2011
030	Of course it is. It's chocolate.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
031	Chocolate?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
032	From the contraband that girl bought.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
033	What?! But that chocolate's made from Rainbow Cacao! Isn't it dangerous?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
034	There's no need to worry. Based on my analysis, a tiny piece like that won't cause any harm whatsoever.
035	In fact, it should do quite the opposite! A small dose of Blue and Purple Cacao should help calm your nerves. So? How do you feel?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
036	Oh... Now that you mention it, I do feel considerably less tense.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
037	Hehe! Perfect! Rainbow Cacao truly is fascinating, in so many ways.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0009
038	I realized when I was studying it earlier that it can actually be quite good for the body if properly portioned.
039	For example, you could eat some Red Cacao if you need a quick pick-me-up...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
040	Green Cacao can lift your spirits if you're feeling down, and if you mix it with some Blue, it could even be a fairly potent painkiller! In addition to that—
041	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, now! Have you thought about this before, or did you really come up with all of these potential uses for cacao in the short time since our job here began?
042	I came up with them while treating the girl, yeah! I just wanted to figure out how I could make her feel better.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
043	I was able to devise an antidote to neutralize the cacao's poison, too, which is why I'm so keen on experimenting with it further.
044	An antidote? You mean, there's a way to make it so the Rainbow Cacao won't be dangerous to eat?!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
045	That's amazing! Without that danger, we might actually be able to open it back up to the market, and get those regulations rescinded. This could be huge!
046	I suppose that's true. I wasn't even thinking about all that, though.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
047	You weren't?! But your antidote could be a game-changer for everyone!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
048	You are a genuinely amazing person. How are you able to do so much?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
049	Hehehe! I just have fun with my work!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
050	You certainly do get into it. But how fun can it really be to make medicines and treat people?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
051	And how can you have so much fun when you're dealing with a patient who's...suffering?
052	Oh, that's easy. It's fun to see them recover because of my medicine, of course! The fun is in knowing that I'm responsible for making then feel good again.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
053	...!
054	It's why I love analyzing different types of illnesses as much as I do. Devising possible cures for them is one of the greatest feelings in the world.
055	And putting them to use is better still! Then whenever I see someone start perking up, I try to imagine what else I can do for them. It's...exhilarating, frankly!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
056	No wonder you always look so happy when you're treating people...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0045
057	Exactly. I had lots of fun when I was tending to you, too, Margaret. It was my medicine that was able to bring you right back from death's door, after all. Can you even imagine how gratifying that was?
058	Lizzy...!
059	(I can't believe what an idiot I've been! She wasn't deriving pleasure from seeing others in pain at all!)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
060	(Of course she isn't that kind of person. I knew Lizzy was the best! I love her so much. I'm going to stay by her side for the rest of my life! No more doubts—ever!)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
061	Lizzy, I'm going to do my very best so you can do all the experiments with Rainbow Cacao your heart desires someday!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
062	Are you? Well, that's great! I look forward to it.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
063	Yay! But first things first... Let's get going, shall we?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
064	...
065	Goodness... One minute she's quiet as a mouse, and the next, she's sprinting off into the snow. She never changes, does she? What a handful my little sister is!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0022
066	I thought I told her to stop worrying me so much...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
067	Hehe. I'm just glad she's back to her normal, cheerful self.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
068	Come one, come all! If you seek to strengthen your magical powers, why not try some chocolate made with Purple and Red Cacao? Guaranteed to make you soar!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
069	Purple Cacao? But isn't that dangerous to eat?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0025
070	Oh, it'll hurt after you eat it, to be sure! But that just proves how potent it is. And if you want to become a powerful witch—and I know you do—well, it's like they always say: no pain, no gain!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
071	...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
072	Ugh! I'd say we found the right place, and the right guy, lying about the cacao without even a hint of concern or sympathy! He is the lowest of the low.
073	But look at all the Rainbow Cacao he has! I could do so many experiments if I had even half that much to work with...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
074	You sure could!
075	I can't believe how easy it was to find this place, though.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
076	(It's almost as if we were being led here...)
085	Hmm? Look, over there. That figure is behaving rather suspiciously, wouldn't you say?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
077	Huh?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
078	Is she taking more cacao on the road to sell elsewhere? Something seems particularly off about her, though...
079	Halt! Who goes there?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
080	Oh!
081	Are you guards? Why have you come?! We were told the regulations didn't apply here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
082	Well, that's not a suspicious statement at all, is it? I sure would like to ask you a few questions...
083	Something tells me answers won't be very forthcoming, though.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
084	Blasted do-gooders leaving us no choice... Dispose of them both!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
