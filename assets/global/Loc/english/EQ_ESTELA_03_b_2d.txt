001	Hey, how are things going here?	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0005
002	Director Vincent!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0025
058	Sorry I'm late. Had a little trouble finding the store I had to go to.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0022
003	I'll take care of the rest. You guys go back to your posts. Rehearsals for the ceremony will begin soon	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0002
004	Peacekeepers! They arrived quickly.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0025
005	Yup. I called for them.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0004
006	I was suspicious that this guy was up to something. I was doing my job, too.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0010
059	To be honest, I felt like I wasn't being as helpful a I could have been. We owe our gratitude for Estella.
007	Ugh… The job of a director is not easy. I can't wait for you to take over, Amis.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0030
008	Dammit! What you're doing is wrong. To promote a magic using weakling as the next director? Why?	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
009	…
010	What are you talking about? You're the one that's a weakling.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0012
011	Huh?
012	You're thinking of ruining the unveiling and the event because of your own vanity and self-interest.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0001
013	You don't deserve to sit alongside hardworking engineers.
014	…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
015	Get it straight. It doesn't matter whether she can use magic or not. I selected someone who is passionate about magic and machines as the next director.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0003
016	That giant hunk of metal is to pave the way of the future. I'll do what I can to make that come true.
017	That kind of determination is necessary for the future of mechanical engineering and as a director of the Central Technology Bureau.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0010
018	Director Vincent…
019	Besides, Amis can do troublesome work flawlessly. She's the perfect successor for me.
020	As I've explained myself, go for it, Amis. Make sure there are no more problems.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0002
021	Not the most honest explanation.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
022	Yes… Really.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
023	There are so many people here. So, what's the ceremony about? What's going to happen?
024	They're unveiling some new machine. Something that's supposed to change the face of mechanical engineering, they say.
025	And also the inauguration of the new director.
026	And now everyone, a speech from the newly appointed director, Amis.
027	…
028	I'm the newly appointed director Amis. For a long time, I've devoted myself to the development of the Magitek Train.
029	I may not have had a lot of experience, but my colleagues and others have supported me for this dream to become a reality.
030	With their help, I'm now ready to unveil this train for everyone here.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0004
031	With the construction of rails, the train will be able to travel everywhere. The possibilities are endless.
060	The Magitek Train… It is my dream. It's only just begun. My next goal is to make flying transport.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
061	To create a machine to transport people in the air without the aid of magic. This is the future that I imagine.
032	I'll continue to put my work into mechanical and magic engineering for the future.
033	This will be the goal of the new director of the Central Technology Bureau… My goal.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
034	We're so far away. Can we even see it from here?
035	Yes, I'm sure. You'll see something dazzling and beautiful.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0039
036	Is that right? Then that's good.
037	I should thank you. You've really supported them with their work. Thank you very much.
038	I don't understand. I came to this city just for a short time to do fortune telling for people.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
039	But, I met a number of people that I wanted to support and help, because they were willing to work at improving themselves.
040	She made sure to work hard for the future. I only gave her a little advice.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
041	No matter how hard someone works, they might not know which direction to go. Like the direction for the future.
042	It's because of your help by supporting her that she is able to smile like that. Your powers did that.
043	You're right. If that's the case…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0004
044	I know why my mother loved doing this for people.
045	Are you going to leave the city soon?
046	Yes. To go somewhere that my powers would be needed.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
047	I see… Then there is one last fortune telling request.
048	About the future of mechanical engineering…
049	…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
050	Magical engineering can benefit everyone, but the evolution of machines has its drawbacks. So I'm concerned about this train…
051	And finally, the train will move across these rails. Is everyone ready?!
052	With rails, the train can go anywhere? Isn't that amazing?
053	But can that giant metal thing really move?
054	Let's see… A massive power will appear. Sooner or later, the machines of this land may run into great difficulties…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0004
055	Even so, she and her subordinates who put so much into the train will not give up.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
056	They will stand up again and again for their dreams and goals, and change the negative fortune telling readings with their efforts.
057	And so…there's no reason to worry.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0008
