001	Man, if you think about it, there ain't nothin' in this world scarier than a woman.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
002	Hrrghh! Nngh! Gghh...ack!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
003	You still got some fight in you?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
004	Of course!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
005	Aaaaaahhhhh!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0025
006	Give up already.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
007	Never.	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0016
008	Nnnrrggh!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0022
009	Listen up! If you just give up like a good little girl, I'll turn a blind eye!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
010	No.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
011	What the hell are you sayin'?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
012	That is not good enough!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0007
013	Tch!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
014	I'm...not good enough.	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
015	I can't do anything alone.
016	Alone like this, I'm...nothing but a little girl!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0004
017	Cut it out already!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0003
018	It's...nnnngghh...p-painfully obvious!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0043
019	What?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
020	I can't stand being nothing but a tragic heroine. I can't bear to even look at my pathetic self.	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
021	It is so difficult to stand alone...but I didn't even understand that until recently!
022	I was so focused on becoming a praiseworthy mayor that I forgot something incredibly important.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
023	......
024	There is one crucial requirement for being a mayor. Do you know what that is?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
025	It's power, ain't it?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
026	Wrong.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
027	It's simple, really. To be a mayor, you have to have people... Citizens.
028	Without people to support you, you cannot be a leader!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0007
029	Are you proud of that?!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0005
030	Haaa...haaaa...haaaa...ack! Unnnnggghhhh!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
031	Haaaa...haaaaa... Just give it up already!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0018
032	We're going to settle this once and for all, in front of everyone!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0043
033	In front of who?! There's nobody here!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
034	Then I will face a pitiful loss, and it will be my duty to turn this city over to you! That is what you told me!
035	If that's how it must be...then unless I lose pitifully, I can't lose!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0012
036	What the hell?!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0006
037	Aaaaaaahhhh!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
038	Haaaa...haaaaa...haaaa...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0018
039	......
040	So you came to get beat down, too, huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0001
041	Squeak... Squeak.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
042	Are you cryin'?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
043	Squeak! Squeeeeeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0007
044	What are you lookin' at? The one who did in your master was me, ya got it?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
045	Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
046	You've been starin' at the sky this whole time. What're you—?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
047	Wait, are you projectin' our fight into the sky?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
048	All those times I attacked her, you were—?!
049	A-Al—...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
050	Heheh. You know, this reminds me of that time when Edgar and the others led us to the Sacred Stone. You're really trying your best, just like you did that day.
051	Are you...? Are you going to guide me, now?	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
052	Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
053	Aye, 'cause I like it best when Fiona is smiling and surrounded by flowers!
054	This...is...our...city!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
055	You're so stubborn!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0021
056	This is important to me!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0007
057	Where's this resolve comin' from all of a sudden?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
058	Our city is like steel! If you hit it, it may dent, but no matter how many times you dent it, it won't break!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
059	The more you temper it, the stronger and more resilient it becomes!
060	I am the mayor of this city of steel, and I will never give up! I will fight for you all, until my last breath!
061	Is she serious?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
062	People of Redington! If you can hear me—if you are watching this—then open your doors! Lend me your strength!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0041
063	I, Fiona Elester, the current mayor of this city, am begging you for your help! I want to move forward alongside you all!
064	Do you take me to be your mayor, in sickness and in health, until death do us part?
065	I am prepared to be married to this city for the rest of my life!
066	Come, walk hand in hand with me!
067	...!
068	Please!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
069	What was with that crazy speech? No one's gonna come!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
070	...!
071	You?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
072	T-Taras! G-give me back my protection money!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
073	What?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
074	Eep! W-we can't just s-stand back when our mayor is trying so hard for us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
075	I'm so ashamed of myself, I could cry!
076	Y-you agree, don't you, guys?! Right, everyone?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
077	Th-that's right! This is our city!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
078	She said she's ready to be married to this city! We gotta do something, too! Take up your weapons, everyone!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
079	Huzzaaaah!
080	Th-thank you, all of you!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0009
081	Y-young lady, were you...? Is this what you were anticipating?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0021
082	Not anticipating, per se...	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1001
083	Per se?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
084	I had hope.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
085	Tch.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
086	It's neither money nor power that motivates people. It's the law of humanity! I believe those were your words on moral obligation, Mr. Taras.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
087	We will no longer take this sitting down!
088	Wait.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
089	Wh-what is it?
090	It's over.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
091	Pardon?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
092	I lost. I won't be gettin' any protection money anymore. I'm outta business.	VO_taras.taras_battle_0021
093	You even wiped the floor with that outta control Alkaroid. I got nothin' left to protect these schmucks from.
094	You said you'd marry the city, didn't ya? Well, like I said, I'm not the type to interfere in people's love lives.
095	Mr. Taras...	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
096	We'll back off.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
097	Please...wait.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
098	What do you want?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
099	Everyone, please listen.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0001
100	I cannot in any way condone what the mafia—including their leader, Don Taras—has done.
101	......
102	However, they took on the unpleasant role of playing the villain in order to unite this city against a common enemy.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
103	If they had defeated me, that would have been that. If I had won, they would have simply carried on the burden of their charade in preparation for future threats.
104	This city—no, this country—was on the verge of collapse, and I believe, with all my heart, that this ordeal has set us on a better path.
105	I have confirmed that the damage caused by the Alkaroid attack was minimal, and that the losses suffered by the people of this city were limited.
106	I cannot say that I forgive them for what they have done. However, I would like you to allow them to remain here.
107	N-no way! We can't just let them keep running around like they own the place!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
108	They should be banished!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
109	If they had not been here, I could not have defeated the Alkaroid.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
110	This country is still plagued by unrest. We do not know when the next attack will come and destroy our hard-fought peace.
111	They are a necessary evil with which we must coexist.
112	...!
113	B-but...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
114	Of course, as mayor, I will be keeping a close eye on them. Or would you rather they be exiled?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
115	If they were to be released out into the world, you wouldn't be able to come and go freely anymore.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
116	Oh! Th-that's a good point!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
117	Well, I mean, if the mayor is sure, who are we to argue?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
118	Thank you.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0034
119	Hmph.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
120	Mayor Edward, she really is your daughter, isn't she?
121	She's got me beat.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
122	Mr. Taras?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
123	Huff...huff...huff... Mr. Taras! Wait!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
124	The bad guys lost, remember? We're leaving.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
125	You're really important to me!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
126	Do you have a concussion or somethin'?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
127	You gave me confidence and resolve as a mayor. Although I must admit that it did hurt a bit.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
128	Didn't look like just a bit, from where I was standin'.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
129	All right, then... Fine. It hurt. A lot.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1012
130	Well, looks like everything's okay here.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
131	I don't mind. My body will heal. However, for someone who cares so much about this city to be treated as a bad guy...	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1001
132	Your heart hurts worse than takin' a beatin', huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
133	Yes.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
134	That's all you need.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
135	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
136	This city has a boss with a big heart. I know that much.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
137	Right!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
138	Heh... Sorry. I didn't even bring a bouquet to your wedding.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
139	That's not true. I have some flowers from you.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1001
140	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
141	My flower crown, see?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
142	White roses. I borrowed them from father's grave. In the language of flowers, a white rose means both reverence, and keeping promises.
143	As mayor, and as my father's daughter, I will fulfill the promises I have made, just as you have done yours.
144	Heheh.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
145	I almost forgot to tell ya.
146	Yes?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
147	That dress looks good on you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
148	Right!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
149	This right arm of mine might be empty again, but I wanna try savin' this small world if I can.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
150	Time continues on.
151	As the restoration continues, the citizens' lives slowly regain a bit of normality.
152	The clock tower in the center of the city has been restored to its former glory, and its beautiful chiming can be heard once again.
153	The beautiful, indomitable Fiona that was projected into the sky that day inspired something unexpected.
154	There's an unprecedented wedding boom going on in Slothstein right now!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0007
155	Bzzzzt. Correlation does not compute.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0030
156	Okay, just gotta fix the camera connection, and... Ah, here we go!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
157	Let me try this again. Good morning, Ejitan!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0007
158	Good morning.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0004
159	At any rate, it seems that the relationship between humans and robots may be nearing those peaceful, prosperous days of remarried life.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0006
160	It's just like Miss Elester said. If Alkaroids keep evolving, they may become the cornerstone of humanity.
161	Bzzzt. Understood. Order received. I will go now.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0045
162	That's your specialty, isn't it?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0004
163	I am the civil engineering Alkaroid, Ejitan.	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_1003
164	My kind must support the humans.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0037
165	All right!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0023
166	Don't just sit there. Get goin' already.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
167	S-sorry!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
168	Bzzzt. Understood.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0006
169	The flowers are growin'.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
170	The clouds are clearing.
171	The bell is tolling, the wind is blowing, and the flower petals are dancing.
172	Driven by the wind, and moral obligation...
173	I... We are moving forward together.
174	There are times when there's a fierce headwind, and there are winters where all of the flowers wilt.
175	Yet I'm surrounded by flowers again, and everyone is here to support me.
176	I can't help but smile.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
