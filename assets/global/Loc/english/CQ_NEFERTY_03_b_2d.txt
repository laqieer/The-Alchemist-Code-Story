001	Phew... We've destroyed their base. That should make it difficult for them to find any more victims.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
002	But there was no clear evidence that Gluttony Foss was involved.	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
003	My best bet is that the buyer is near the border of Gluttony, likely even a Gluttony citizen.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
004	Someone focused on buying people with strong Alchemia... That's not much to work with, but it's a good lead.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
005	Thank you very much, Ryle. I'm sure we'll be able to move forward on this one.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0033
006	That's good to hear.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
007	If I hadn't met you today, this case would have been much more difficult, so...thank you very much.
008	Stop acting so sweet. It's creeping me out.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
009	How rude. But I'm in a good mood, so I'll make a special exception for you today and give you a pass.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
010	Thanks, I guess.
011	(We were able to resolve the situation by connecting people with different positions and goals...)
012	I think I understand a little better now.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0045
013	Did you say something?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
014	No.
015	...? All right, well, we're done here. The rest is your business.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
016	Yes, I understand.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
017	The conservatives are stubborn, but there are some who are more open-minded. I'm sure they'll do something about it.
018	Are you figuring out ways to get others to do your job right now?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
019	Hehe. It was you who said that I would be good at that kind of thing, Ryle.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
020	Ah... I shouldn't have said anything.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
021	Oh, I wouldn't say that. In fact, I'm grateful. You've made me realize something important.
022	The people of the desert are many and varied. Some want peace, some live in strife, some worry for the future, some want immediate power...	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
023	We may all be looking in different directions, but we are all people of the desert. If we can just roll with their individual strengths and connect them...	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
024	It has the potential to be a great force of good, even if it's not quite what Hawk dreamed of.
025	If it works out.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
026	I'll make it work. We can't afford to have another tragedy like Hawk.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
027	The role of the nobles is to do their best for the future and peace of the desert.
028	That is my responsibility, not anyone else's.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
029	(I can't let his death be in vain.)
030	That's why I hope you will continue to roll with the punches and do your best as well. In your own way.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
031	If possible, I'd like to be in a position where I can relax and let someone else do the rolling.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
032	Yes. I'll limit the work I ask you to do to the times when you'll be most effective, Mr. Ryle.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
033	I feel like you're ignoring the fact I'd prefer that you not need me at all... You really are one heck of a character.	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
034	Hehe.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
035	I will use whatever I feel is necessary, no matter what you say. That is how I roll.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
