001	Why would you do something like this? Why rob your fellow countrym—	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
002	Why?! Isn't that obvious? There's no other way to survive!
003	This war has left us with nothing! No home, no family! Nothing! Everything is gone! We don't have any other choice!
004	...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0021
005	Ah...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
006	...I see. You were also victims of this war.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
007	The fact that I couldn't stop this world from forcing you into a life of crime is my sin to bear.
008	...But that doesn't mean I can overlook it when you inflict harm upon others.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
009	Gh... Curses...
010	It is the duty of Scarlet Flame Guard to watch over the citizens of Envylia, after all.
011	Captain Vettel! We apologize for our delay! Are you unharmed?
012	I'm all right, though I can't say the same for these folks. Please look after them.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
013	Of course they must be punished for their crimes, but they are still citizens of Envylia even if they had to turn to a life of crime.
014	Yes, sir!
015	They had no other way to survive, huh? This country is still a long way away from recovery...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
016	U-um, C-Captain Vettel!
017	My apologies, I was lost in thought—are you injured?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
018	I'm safe and sound. Thank you so much for helping me!
019	That's a relief. Huh? Why are you crying?	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
020	Sniff... B-because you got injured on my behalf...
021	Huh? This little thing? Don't worry about it. I barely noticed it. I'm just happy you're safe.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
022	Truly?
023	Truly. If anything, your tears make my heart ache more than this wound ever could. So chin up and give me your best smile!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
024	Okay... I will!
025	Much better. That's what I like to see.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
026	What do you mean much better?! You big idiot!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
027	O-ouch! Natalie! H-hold on a sec—!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0027
028	No, you listen up! One wrong move and you could've been seriously injured!
029	No matter how many people you were facing, the fact that mere bandits could injure you at all is proof that you're too tired to be doing this!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
030	Haha... I can't hide anything from you. I guess I'm a little tired.
031	...I'll give you some medicine to help with the fatigue, but could you try not to worry me into an early grave?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
032	Seriously... This is exactly why I've been saying that you should let other knights take care of your patrols for a bit. You need some rest.
033	I know I do, but going on patrol meant that I could take care of these bandits. So it's not like nothing good came out of it.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
034	If that's what it takes to keep the city safe, then a little bit of exhaustion is nothing.
035	If anything, going outside and seeing the people I do this for gives me strength. Knowing that I could keep them safe is better than any medicine.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
036	...At least take one of the other guards with you then. You shouldn't keep trying to do this alone...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
037	Are you still hung up on the time Nina collapsed?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
038	Right, that time she overdid it after you appointed her as Vice-Captain... But that's a different story.
039	...
040	...No, I should've known Nina would overwork herself. That's just the way she is.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_1050
041	Vettel...
042	Hello everyone! I'm back!
043	Vettel?! Are you okay? I heard you got injured!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
044	Haha, word spreads quickly around here! This is getting embarrassing... It's just a couple of scratches, so don't worry about it. You have a message for me, right?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0011
045	Ah! Yes, I do! My apologies.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
046	I would like to give you my report on the Crown's Guard's cooperation with the Blue Flame Guard.
047	We successfully ensured that the king's coronation went off without a hitch. As did all related ceremonies.
048	That's right. I heard even the king praised the Crown's Guard efforts. Excellent work.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
049	Th-thank you!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0006
050	What about your team, Nina?
051	We're successfully cooperating with the others to lead Envylia down the road of recovery!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0037
052	I haven't been Vice-Captain for too long, and I face some troubles being in this position as a therian...
053	But Victor has been super helpful in getting everyone to fall in line!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
054	Oh? Sounds like you were a big help, Victor.
055	It's no big deal! We're all just doing our best to rebuild this country!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
056	Everyone is working so hard. Even Ren is traveling all over this continent to keep an ear on the ground.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
057	I heard. I actually got a letter from him the other day. He should be coming home soon.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
058	It does me good to see how hard everyone is working. As your captain, I couldn't be prouder!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0023
059	Haaa...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
060	Chloe? Is everything okay?
061	Y-yes! Couldn't be better!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
062	Are you sure? You're looking a little pale.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
063	Hn...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
064	That goes for you too, Nina. You're a hard worker, but I don't want you to overdo it either.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
065	Victor, too. Don't be reckless just because you're confident in your abilities. If something happens it'll be too late...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
066	...
067	What? Why are you all looking at me like that?
068	...Look who's talking. You're the last person they want to hear that from.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
069	...Ah.
070	Excuse me, Captain! A fight broke out near the Wratharis border! The men in the area are not equipped to handle this alone. We need to send reinforcements!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
071	Understood. I'll go.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
072	Vettel, come on! We just talked about this!
073	Don't worry, I can handle this much. Besides, I just wrapped up my patrol. I have the time.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_1050
074	The rest of you should head back to base and take some time to rest.
075	...Uh-uhm, Captain Vettel!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
076	Hmm?
077	...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
078	Never mind.
079	We'll see you later. Be careful out there.
080	Thanks, Victor. Well then, I'm just going to check in on the situation. Vice-Captain, I'll be leaving you in charge while I'm gone.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
081	Understood!
082	Sigh... Every time with this guy...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
083	...Leaving us all to worry out here.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
