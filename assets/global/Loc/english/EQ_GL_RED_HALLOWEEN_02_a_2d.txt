001	The place should be around here...
002	Excuse me, sir. Could I have a bit of your time?
003	Oh? What do you need, stranger?
004	I'm looking for this address.
005	Let's see.. Ah, it's just down that alleyway. Take a right at the next junction.
006	Thanks for your assistance.
007	It feels a little crowded tonight.
008	Of course! Because of the festival!
009	A sweets and candy filled Halloween!
010	Anyone can join! The more the merrier!
011	I will consider it, good sir. Have a great evening.
012	Hahaha! You too, stranger.
013	Looks like this is the place.
014	Wonder if anyone's home.
015	(Emrys walks up to the door, but before he could knock, the door swings open)
016	!
017	...
018	...Yes?
019	Good evening, miss. I was referred here by an associate of this place.
020	I should have an appointment.
021	Hmm...
022	It's from the Queen...
023	She's not seeing anyone now.
024	I see...
025	Anything else...
026	Please, call me Emrys.
027	Anything else...Emrys?
028	Nothing else miss. I must find a place to stay for the night.
029	Could you kindly relay this message to...the Queen for me?
030	...That I will be back tommorrow.
031	Noted...
032	...Wait.
033	Do you want to go to...the festival?
034	I want to get some candy...for my kitties.
035	Sis is busy...and I have your letter for the Queen...
036	...so you are...a friend?
037	("Hmm, I guess there's no harm seeing where this goes...")
038	It will be my pleasure, miss. I was about check out the festival...
039	Really? ...Thank you!
040	("Maybe I can get some information from her regarding the Queen...")
041	Let's head out now, shall we?
042	Noted!
043	...
044	Are you bringing that...weapon?
045	Yes... Sis told me...
046	Never be unarmed.
047	I see. Let's go, then.
048	("That weapon... Better keep an eye on her...")
049	Hey cutie, come hang with us? *Hic*
050	*Hic* We have some candy for you, sugar.
051	...Candy?
052	Miss, let's acquire the candy from a more "reliable" source.
053	Hey!
054	Is this guy sugar-blocking us? *Hic*
055	Yea, lets give him a *Hic* toothache for the morning, gang!
056	Drunkards... I will handle this, miss.
057	No candy?
058	Yeah, they are just tricking you.
059	Then I fight too!
060	Punish liars... Hiya!
061	Wah!
