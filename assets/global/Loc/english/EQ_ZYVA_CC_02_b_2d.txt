001	The grass is always greener on the other side.
002	As I gazed, enraptured, upon the rainbows that arced from her twin blades, showering blood like rain, I loathed myself even more than the lump that had been my father.
003	I despised my ugliness, as I latched onto jealousy and envy more firmly than I ever had familial love.
004	Why hadn't someone come to save me sooner?
005	You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0008
006	A costume of lies. A pilfered life. No trace of my true self.
007	She should have just let me die.
008	You're quite clumsy, aren't you?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
009	Aaahh! No...!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_battle_0022
010	Seeing as you are so desperate to stop me...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
011	S-stop! Don't open it! Don't...!
012	I am afraid I find myself terribly curious about what lies inside this bag.
013	A white...lump...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0025
014	...
015	This is...
016	I-I'm...sor...ry...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0018
017	A skull...
018	I-I'm...sorry.
019	To whom are you addressing this apology?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
020	That's all I had. Th-that's all...!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0020
021	That's all that was left of my...true...self!
022	Unnnnngghhhhh... Aaaaagghhhh!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0019
023	...
024	Your true self.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
025	Aaaahhh...unnnghhhh...!
026	I feel as if I have met your true self!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
027	Hic...unnghh...hic! H-huh...?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
028	How do you feel right now? Why are you carrying around a skull on your personage? What did you mean to do with it?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
029	H-huh?
030	What are the ideals by which you live? What urges compel you? What is the path that you would pursue?
031	Into what blossom will you someday bloom? You have yet to even be planted...
032	H-huh? Wha...?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
033	But make no mistake! In my eyes, you are a true flower!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
034	A...f-flower?
035	Your corrupted roots! Thorny trunk! Unripe buds! You are a briar, a rose! Ahh, I am shaking with excitement.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0023
036	I...
037	Let me hear your sorrows, your wails! Let me lend you my ears, that I may comprehend, that I might understand...!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
038	Let me test you! Your personage, and your being...!
039	U-um...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0020
040	Ahhh... My apologies.
041	This is a poor habit of mine. I cannot help but press when I witness a personage of such radiance.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
042	How callous of me. I was really far too bold.
043	...
044	Ungh...hic...unghh...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0018
045	Oh, dear. I've made you cry again. Please forgive me.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0036
046	Like that...
047	Hm? What?
048	No one's ever talked to me...like that...
049	Ahh... I expect you've received nothing but cruelty.
050	My...personage...
051	Indeed.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
052	I want to be gorgeous...
053	No, I want to be something much, much more than that!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0018
054	Something that wasn't stolen, or even borrowed. Something that is mine to give. I... I want to be nothing other than my truest self!
055	Marvelous.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0046
056	Truly marvelous. Magnificent! I have the perfect word for what you wish to be. For what you are.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
057	Wh-what...?
058	Not gorgeous, but dazzling.
059	D-dazzling? As in...sparkly?
060	Become something that cannot be denied, regardless of the perspective of the observer. One who could be the hope of both the salvaged and the beaten.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
061	You will be more resplendent than simply gorgeous; so lavish as to dazzle the eyes, wreathed in a brilliant, sparkling radiance...
062	Let yourself blossom into bloom!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
063	Despite his blatant hypocrisy, the mystery of his approach, and that he fills my head with unfamiliar words, to the Iris I am now, he is rather pleasant company...
064	One that glitters more richly than gold.
