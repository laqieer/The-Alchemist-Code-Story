001	What are these?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
002	Amane, watch out!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
003	What do you think you're doing?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
004	Don't try to fool me. You're trying to kill me, aren't you?
005	Well, not if I kill you first!
006	W-wait! Stop!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
007	Captain Tanosuke! What's going on?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
008	Behind you!
009	!!!
010	Stop! What are you all thinking?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
011	Hold it. Don't jump in on this one. You'll just get mixed up in it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0014
012	Captain Tanosuke. Is this...?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
013	Yeah. There's only one thing it can be.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
014	Hidden Ogres.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
015	!!!
016	I get it now. That's what they were doing.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0045
017	That was the reason for the demon attack.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
018	What?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
019	They intended to station Hidden Ogres within the Blade Fox and destroy us from the inside.
020	How horrible...
021	Captain Ugachi, what should we do?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
022	Do you even need to ask? We're taking this place back.
023	Conflict or killing within the Corps is strictly prohibited. No exceptions. So we're not going to take this one lying down.
024	This level of deceit, though! We're going to have to be a lot more vigilant from now on.
025	...
026	And I'm certainly not planning on letting the Blade Fox fall before the lady of the hour returns. I'd never be able to face her.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
027	Understood, Captain Ugachi!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0007
028	Interesting. When she's not around, he can't stop thinking about her, can he?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
029	Just one more reason to like you, Captain Ugachi!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
030	Shut your mouth! We have no time to lose here. First things first, we need to quell this distrust among the troops.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0015
031	If they don't listen to reason, they're useless. Disable them so they can't get in our way, then find and destroy those Hidden Ogres.
032	Yes, Sir!
033	They really think a cowardly plan like this is enough to stop the Blade Fox? We won't be beaten so easily.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
034	The Blade Fox are made of sterner stuff than that!
035	Now, let's get moving!
