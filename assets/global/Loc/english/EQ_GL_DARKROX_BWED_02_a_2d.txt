001	I didn't know why I wanted to see him again, honestly.
002	I was being impulsive. Reckless. And I could get caught at any moment.
003	Would he even come?
004	Who was I even doing it for?
005	That will be all, then.
006	Ah, before you go...
007	The Director would like to see you after you have taken your ease. Something about a new mission.
008	Right.
009	This way, my lady.
010	(I wonder why Grimm wasn't there at the review...)
011	(He couldn't have seen me let that man go, could he?)
012	My lady, is something the matter?
013	...No. I'm fine.
014	Lead the way.
015	The main hall was much larger than I expected.
016	Something about the place made me uneasy, and it wasn't just the scale.
017	Eventually, after countless winding corridors, we arrived at a single steel door.
018	Subject R, Director.
019	The Director raises a hand, and the handmaiden dips her head before leaving.
020	You wanted to see me, Director?
021	The Director's shaded hood was in the way, but I got the distinct feeling I was being studied rather intently.
022	What do you know of Subject VI?
023	I assume Grimm has mentioned her in passing.
024	...Yes.
025	Subject VI has been declared missing for well on a month, with few to no traces of her activities around the borders.
026	In light of this, scouts have been withdrawn for the time being.
027	The Director holds out a scrap of paper.
028	(An address and a contact.)
029	The caretaker of the care center Subject VI was fond of visiting.
030	I have informed them to observe the premises.
031	I expect you to be on standby at a moment's notice, and to dispose of her should you sight her.
032	Grimm has been notified of your mission. This shall take precedence over your other duties.
033	Understood, Director.
034	It wasn't my place to question the Director.
035	Without Grimm breathing down my neck, though, I had the freedom to entertain that spark of madness in my heart.
036	Of course, I didn't know if that man would even come.
037	Siegfried. The mysterious link to my past.
038	But some things have a knack of catching up with you sooner rather than later.
039	- Archives, Main Hall -
040	No human guards?
041	None. They are patrolled exclusively by robots.
042	The better to keep their secrets, I'm guessing.
043	This way.
044	- Archives, East Wing -
045	Are we even heading in the right direction?
046	Truthfully? I don't know.
047	There's no time to comb through every one of these archives, so we'll have to make do with what we can access.
048	Good enough for me.
049	Wait. Something's coming.
050	PRESENCE DETECTED.
051	Stay in the shadows. Let me handle this.
052	Here on official directive.
053	STATE YOUR IDENTITY.
054	Roxanne- Subject R.
055	CHECKING...
056	NO PERMISSION RECORDS FOUND.
057	SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY WILL BE REPORTED-
058	BZZT... SHUTTING DOWN.
059	It was worth a try.
060	I...guess.
061	We'd best keep moving.
062	...Or not.
063	UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL DETECTED.
