001	Move it!
002	Tch! Where did these guys come from?!
003	I will show no mercy to those who disrupt the forest.
004	We thank you for your cooperation. We've been having trouble catching these poachers.
005	So long as the forest is safe; that is all I need. I leave the rest to you.
006	...
007	Now, a promise is a promise. We caught those poachers, so it's time you accepted my challenge.
008	I never promised anything. Besides, as I've told you, I have no reason to fight you.
009	Ugh! You're a stubborn one. Almost as bad as that monk. Do we really need a reason to fight?
010	Say what you will. This is my creed.
011	Creed?
012	All those who fight must have a creed to live by. I choose to fight for the forest's sake, and I will not exert my strength for any other cause.
013	...
036	Gaining power for the sake of power is different from gaining power for a specific purpose.
037	Strength for the sake of the forest, huh?
014	Sorry, little ones. That must've been frightening. You're safe now.
015	In order to protect all of you and every other life in this forest, I promise you that I will become stronger.
016	...
017	Averting your eyes from what you must become, allowing your rage to drive you... How is this different from a child throwing a tantrum?
018	What did you say?!
019	This is why you must become stronger, Tsang Lei. You have the potential to surpass my expectations.
038	Should you succeed, that would be proof that my words have reached you. I wait anxiously for that day to come.
020	...
021	Tch! I guess I really was just dancing like a puppet for him.
022	What's the matter?
023	I don't have anything so noble as a creed to call my own, but I just can't stand losing like this.
024	So I'm gonna travel the world, fight formidable warriors I come across to refine my skills, and then show that monk what I'm really made of.
025	I see...
026	Though I cannot agree with your blind pursuit of strength...
027	I can respect it as your creed.
028	Creed? I just said I don't have one of those.
029	Oh really? Your eyes tell me otherwise.
030	Hmph. I guess I get it now. I finally see that that stupid monk was the only one who ever really cared to look at me.
031	Well, I'll make that monk recognize me. Forget all that complicated creed nonsense. I'm just going to get stronger!
032	I'm sure there are other ways to come to an understanding with him besides fighting.
033	But...I suppose that is simply your truest desire.
034	It is. It is!
039	Are you heading back to the temple, then?
040	Not yet! I have to surprise him with power beyond anything he has ever imagined!
035	For I am he who lays waste to all those who stand against him! I walk the path to becoming the strongest man alive!
