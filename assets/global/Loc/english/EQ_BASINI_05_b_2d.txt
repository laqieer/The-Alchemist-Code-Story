014	Excalibur... It's growing brighter!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
015	For all the friends I've lost... For all the oaths I've sworn...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
016	For all the world's creatures who seek salvation in order...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
017	By the power of light!
077	By the power of darkness!
018	Hyaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
019	Gnrk!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
020	To think they would master the power of compassion to such a degree...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
021	Well, no matter. They have merely prolonged the inevitable.
022	Run all they like, they cannot elude me forever.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
023	Thank you, Carlotta.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0033
024	He can't follow us this far. We should be safe here for a little while.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
025	Irene, I need to thank you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0034
026	No, you don't. I did only as my resolve bid me.
027	...
028	What is it?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0006
029	What happened to your blindfold?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
030	That was part of Corpse's uniform. I no longer have need of it.
031	Are you certain?
032	I am. I've decided this for myself, for the sake of order.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
033	What will you do now?
034	I will fight to defend the order of Babel in my own way, following my own resolve.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0031
035	Now that I have you as my guiding light, I won't run any more.
036	Human resolve can make a paradise or a wasteland of this world. Balancing it is the only way to ensure order in a world of light and darkness.
037	If I have to bloody my hands beyond the reach of light to preserve that balance, so be it. That is my resolve.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0004
038	I see.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
039	And what about you? You cannot run from Waginau forever.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003
040	Just watch me. I'll run fast enough to save the world.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
041	You truly have changed.
042	I have a lot more responsibilities to bear nowadays.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
043	Then I will go my own way.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0004
044	Running away never was your style.
045	Will you miss me?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0007
046	And here I thought you didn't know how to make a joke.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
047	Swear to me that you'll keep Excalibur safe.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
048	Of course I will. I've gotten used to keeping my oaths by now.
049	Well then... See you around.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
050	May we meet again someday.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
051	I hope so too, although I'm not sure if that day will ever come.
052	All of this means nothing before the absolution of order, after all.
053	Now then.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
054	It's time I started running. I've got a world to save.
055	For the sake of the light, I go into darkness.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
056	And so the Lord Commander took Excalibur and vanished.
057	Within days, the news had spread across the entirety of Babel.
058	Did you hear?! It's Basheeny! He's...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0001
059	Up and left, eh? So I've heard.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
060	I wonder where he's gotten to now.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
061	Can't the two of you look a little more alarmed?! Do you have any idea what the Lord Commander's disappearance will mean for Babel?!
062	Nothing good, I guess. But I've got a feeling it'll work out in the end.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
063	Bud!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0016
064	Remember, Basheeny swore to protect Babel just like the rest of us.
065	He hasn't run away. I guarantee it.
066	Whatever he's up to, he's doing it for the good of all.
067	I...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
068	Well, can't let him get ahead of us. Up for some sparring, Victor?	VO_budd.budd_chara_1005
069	Of course!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
070	You two! Honestly!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
078	Although... Maybe you're right. We have to have faith in him.
071	Basheeny, wherever you are... I believe in you.
072	And so the Holy Sword Excalibur vanished from the pages of history.
073	Behind its disappearance, unbeknownst to all, lay the unwavering conviction of Basheeny, the twelfth Lord Commander.
074	His determination to defend the law and order of the world lent him the strength to endure his disgrace.
075	In order to realize the justice with which he had been entrusted, he plunged deeper and deeper into darkness...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
076	There to lie, until the day that light shone once more in the abyss.
