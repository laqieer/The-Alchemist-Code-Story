001	...Hm. I can see why they call him "the wizard of the land of machinery." These prosthetics aren't half bad.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0045
002	I guess I can't expect to master them right from the start, but with a bit more use, I think I'll get used to them.
003	Hazel...why did you follow me here?	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0001
004	What do you mean "why"? Because we're partners.
005	But...I failed you. I failed my partner!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0019
006	What happened to you was because of me!
007	That's not how it is Evelika...
008	And now because of me, you're here on the battlefield even though you're still getting used to your new limbs. I'm just causing problems again!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0018
009	Evelika
010	...
011	The two of us made that plan together. What happened to me wasn't your fault.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
012	But!
013	Look, there they are!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
014	We've got company!
015	!?
016	What's the enemy's position? Can you tell?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
017	Judging from their footsteps...the enemy is at 6 o'clock. There are a great deal of them!
018	Trying to surround us, huh?
019	No...in this terrain, they're probably trying to drive us back.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0003
020	Think we can break through?
021	Well, it's not impossible, but...	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0004
022	(Hazel seems to be handling her prosthetics well, but I'm worried about her physical strength.)
023	(If we're going to break up the enemy and take them out individually, the closest place to do that would be...)
024	We need to lure them into that cave.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0001
025	Alright, let's do it.
026	...Heheh.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
027	Huh? What are you laughing about?
028	Nothing.
029	It's just, you seem like the old Evelika again.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0008
030	Hazel...?
031	Anyway, we've gotta hurry. You go ahead!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
032	Me...?	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0006
033	There! You're dead!
034	We don't have time to argue!
035	...Ah, ok! I'll head for the cave!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0010
036	...Right. I'm counting on you!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
037	!!
038	(She's what?)
039	Die!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
040	Ha!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0001
041	Gah...!!
042	Hazel! Watch out!
043	HAAAAA!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
044	Hiya!	VO_hazel.hazel_battle_0001
045	Nyah...!!
046	Nice one, Hazel! Are your prosthetics ok?
047	They're fine! Get to the cave!	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1020
048	Right!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0004
049	(How... How can she say she trusts me...?)
050	(Like I'm still her...)
051	Hazel, I'm almost to the entrance!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0001
052	...!!
053	(Wait, is that light...coming from inside the cave?)
054	That's it! Hazel!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0044
055	Can you block the cave entrance!?
056	Got it!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0038
057	Haa!!	VO_hazel.hazel_battle_0004
058	Damn! They saw through our ambush! Get out there, quick!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
059	We're just gonna have to overpower 'em!
060	Evelika, they're heading your way! Let's meet 'em head on!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0012
061	Right!
