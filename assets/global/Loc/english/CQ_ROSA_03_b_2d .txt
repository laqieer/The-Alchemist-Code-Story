001	......
002	Tsk. You're pushing yourself too hard.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
003	Hm? What's the matter? You've gone quiet.	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1006
004	Your smithy was burnt down. As someone from the same nobility as the ones who did this, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0036
005	Oh? You've suddenly gone all meek on me.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0044
006	Observing that noble, I simply became aware of my own immaturity.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
007	I was almost doing the same thing as that noble with my one-sided demands for you to create me a weapon.
008	Hurry back with me to my manor. I will immediately present you with one of my forges.
009	What are you playing at? Will you ask for me to give you a weapon in exchange?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
010	Of course not. Don't mock me.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
011	Then what is your motive?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
012	If you insist on knowing, I want to apologize for everything up until now.
013	Additionally, I want to pay back the common folk who have suffered under the whims of the aristocrats.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
014	It would be horrible just to walk off now. I couldn't do that.
015	I see.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0045
016	When you started berating that noble, I wondered what had gotten into you.
017	Fww...fwahahah! I see. For all your craziness, you can actually string together a decent sentence or two!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0023
018	It looks like I read you wrong. It turns out you're actually the good kind of an idiot.
019	Hey! Don't call me an idiot!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_1028
020	I've taken a liking to you. Fine. I'll go with you to your manor.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
021	It looks like there's more to you than I initially assumed.
022	Heh...heheh! Of course! I'm not a shallow individual that's easily understood!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0008
023	By living near me, you'll be able to understand me on a more personal level.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_0013
024	Also, I have a name. It's Rosa.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1001
025	Eventually, I will conquer the gods themselves...so remember my name!
