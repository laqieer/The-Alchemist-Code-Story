001	Hey! You can't just take it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
002	Grrrrl...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_b
003	Hm? What are you saying?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0005
004	"Were these presents for yourself? Us animals are sad since Santa doesn't bring us presents. We want presents too!"	VO_neena.neena_sys_0031
005	I see. Hmm, I understand how you feel. But, this is gonna go on our tree...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0045
006	Aww, I feel bad.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
007	Hmm, ah, I have an idea! I'll make another one and bring it to you later! How's that?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0039
008	Arf!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0021
009	You listened to us before it came to punishment. You're very good kids, yes you are!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
010	That's right. That deserves a present!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
011	Yes! I'll do my best to make one!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0038
012	(The animals are also looking forward to Winter Holiday, huh.)
013	(Of course they are, it's Winter Holiday after all!)
014	...
015	...I wonder when those two will come back?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
016	Ravina, what's wrong?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0004
017	Oh, nothing.
018	But...
019	Everyone, the tree is straight ahead! Take care not to get lost!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0003
020	He said the tree is over there! Let's go!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
021	Ravina?
022	Hey, are we there yet? We've already walked quite a ways.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
023	Not yet, it seems.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
024	We're going the right way, aren't we?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
025	I...I think so. Probably. We're going the way Yuki told us to.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
026	Ah, I almost forgot! They made us walk a long time before, too.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0030
027	This is quite a tough path.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
028	...
029	(...I hope I wasn't being rude. Even though Nina cared enough to worry about me...)
030	(Klima also cared about me, said we should have a fun Winter Holiday...)
031	(...even though everyone has been so kind to me, even though this is different than past times, but for some reason I...)
032	...
033	Ravina?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
034	Eek! Um, w-what are we talking about?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
035	We-we were talking about what present you'd like to get from Santa...
036	I, for one, would like a new ribbon, or something like that! A cute ribbon which Chloe can tie in my hair for me!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
037	For me...probably clothes? Something I can wear in water... Or perhaps a nice relaxing pillow...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
038	...
039	How about you, Ravina?
040	...huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
041	What do you want, Ravina? As a present from Santa?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
042	I want...
043	...
044	...I don't think I'll be getting anything from Santa.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
045	What? Why?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
046	Because I'm not a good kid.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
047	Everyone's working so hard to prepare for this party but I'm sad because I'm thinking about Michael and Lofia...
048	And Klima, and Nina, and Birgitta, Lotia, even though everyone has been so nice to me...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
049	I still wonder if Michael and Lofia could just finish security earlier. Then the three of us could prepare for this party together. That's all I think about.
050	This is why I think I'm no good. This is why I won't get a present.
051	Ravina...
052	Oh! Look! So many huge trees!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0009
053	Wow... Amazing...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
054	And lots of monsters.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
055	They don't seem to be leaving the trees... What're we gonna do?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
056	Sheesh! Hogging things to themselves is no good! I say we teach them a lesson.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
