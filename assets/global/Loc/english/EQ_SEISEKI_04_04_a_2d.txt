001	My Kagutsuchi can't destroy the Mikaboshi?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
002	Kagura...your talent is exponential, far surpassing that of myself, Kanon, or even Kudan.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
003	But that's all.
004	Huh?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
005	You have been relying on and depending on your gift...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
006	...to the point that you haven't mastered the Alchemia in its true form.
007	For starters, Wadatsumi's people excel at Alchemia...especially the royal family.
008	They've been blessed with too many ‘friends' gifted with these powers that it's come back to bite them.
009	N-no...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
010	The Mikaboshi is an adversary that is different than any you have fought until now.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
011	It's not something that can be destroyed by anyone just because they have power.
012	You, who carry that bloodline and that fate, must destroy it yourself.
013	Of course, you must bring your original qualities to fruition, but you must also master the Holy Guard's way of controlling Alchemy.
014	My talent...
015	My Excalibur is a weapon that is exclusively meant to combat Sacred Stones.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
016	The chances of destroying the Mikaboshi are about half.
017	In order to increase the odds of destroying the Mikaboshi, we will need your Kagutsuchi.
018	I understand. In other words, you want me to learn how to control Alchemia so that I can wield my Kagutsuchi freely.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
019	It's easier said than done, but we don't have time right now. In order to improve, you must train in a special way that requires breaking the limit.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
020	Breaking the limit?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
021	Yes.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
022	Over a short period of time, you will be required to control and expand your Alchemia...something that you should usually do over decades.
023	Worse case scenario...you may end up losing your life. If you want to quit, tell me now.
024	You've got to be kidding me!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
025	Do you think I can stay quiet after being told to my face that I am incomplete and a failure?
026	I'm doing this, no matter what!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
027	I didn't say you were a failure, but...I'm sorry. Let me thank you again, Kagura.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0018
028	Well then...let's start.
