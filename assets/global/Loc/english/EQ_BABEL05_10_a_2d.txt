001	The well-worn name of justice...
002	The future of this world...
003	I am well aware of the fact that time is finite.
004	Time etches all that transpires into the fabric of this world, transforming the future into the present before our very eyes.
005	So we fight eternally, perpetually, endlessly; within the finite bounds of time itself.
006	And for what?
007	It was the day after I complained about all this to my sister that it happened.
008	No...
009	Well, have no fear, for the amazing Mira has a wonderful idea!
010	No, no, no...
011	I'm going to go fix things.
012	No, no, no, no, no!
013	Once I've made up my mind, it's time to act! It doesn't matter if I have no idea how I'm going to achieve my goals!
014	There's no time like the present. What's the point of needless worrying?
015	Th-this letter...
016	I-is this because of me? Is this...my fault?
017	I always told her to be careful of time! Why didn't she listen to me?!
018	The Space-Time Manipulator!!!
019	(Leaping into the distant future becomes increasingly unpredictable the further in time you travel.)
020	(Who can say where or when you'll end up with broad coordinates like that?)
021	(It's only natural. After all, time is always in motion.)
022	I can get a hold on Mira's location by analyzing the traces of Alchemia she left behind. According to this...
023	Her destination was "The time when Alchemia drew the name of the Cursed Beasts upon the pages of history once more." What the heck does that mean?!
024	I need to bring her back before she disrupts the flow of time.
025	I need to bring her back from the future.
026	Ah!
027	What is it?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
028	Can we stop for just a second?
029	We cannot really afford to rest until we reach the border...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
030	Do you like sweet things?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0001
031	Not particularly, no.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
032	Why not?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
033	Sugar breeds laxity.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0031
034	Laxity? What's that?
035	If we do not adhere to the rules, and comport ourselves with austerity and with dignity, then both as organizations and individuals will lose all form and become lax.
036	So you're saying that sugar is the enemy of every diet?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
037	Erm... What?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
038	Huh? W-wait...!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
039	Diet?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
040	Y-you said that...it makes you lose form, a-and...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
041	Th-that's not what I meant! I was merely talking about how one cannot afford to be too lenient upon oneself in one's daily life!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
042	Why are you lecturing me about life while we're walking along the side of the road?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0030
043	You're the one who asked me if—!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
044	Well, there's nothing lax about you, anyway.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0001
045	Of course there isn't! I remain ever alert, and always carry out my duties without a moment's—!
046	I meant physically.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
047	Ph-physically...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
048	I-I am fully aware of the fact that there is nothing lax about my appearance!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0016
049	Well, there is one spot. Or two, you could say.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0044
050	Wh-what are you...?! Would you kindly stop staring at my...!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
051	I never said where.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
052	I don't appreciate where your eyes are pointed!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0016
053	Sorry. I didn't mean to stare.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0004
054	I find that very difficult to believe!
055	(Oops. Guess I've been around Michael too long.)
056	Anyway. Do you know what time it is?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
057	According to my watch, it's—	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
058	It's afternoon tea time!	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1004
059	Really, now...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0030
060	I'm taking a short detour.
061	In order to file my report of what has transpired and pursue my obligation to the Holy Guard...
062	I will return to the headquarters of the Holy Order in Northern Pride.
063	However, I cannot simply leave you here, Lofia.
064	You have been targeted by assassins even while in Lustburg.
065	You must lay low somewhere safe.
066	Is there anywhere safe?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
067	If her attackers are unafraid to target her even in the middle of the city, how do you propose...?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
068	I have an acquaintance in Slothstein who will be able to help her.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
069	You are suggesting that she leave this country?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
070	This acquaintance of mine is a bit of a sook, but possesses the perfect cover for our purposes.
071	Fortunately for us, Lustburg shares a border with both Slothstein and Northern Pride. Incidentally, this makes things convenient for me, as well.
072	Hmmm...
073	...
074	I'll go.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
075	Are you certain?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
076	It needs to be said, so here I go.
077	Alchemy nearly killed me.
078	It's thanks to you that I'm alive right now.
079	Well...
080	So we're going to travel together!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
081	R-right!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
082	I will remain here.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
083	Will you be all right, Michael?
084	I am not sure what they want from you, my dear, but I am doubtful that they intend to have it out with an old Court Mage like myself.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
085	I told you about the Cursed Beasts and the Sacred Stones, too. It's not entirely out of the question that they might come after you.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
086	Hmm?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
087	I never heard anything about all that.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0047
088	Huh?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
089	I'm rather old, you see. I'm getting to be quite hard of hearing, and I forget everything I've heard by the end of the day.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0048
090	Ack! Ahem...
091	You're faking it!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0030
092	I think...I'm dying.
093	Oh, please. Mother Nature couldn't kill you if she tried.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
094	Besides, my dear...	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
095	Huh?
096	Someone must remain here to invite Lady Milis in, should she turn up. We wouldn't want her to be alone, now, would we?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0038
097	I...!
098	Th-thank you, Michael.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0033
099	It's my pleasure. I enjoy nothing more than interacting with young people.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0008
100	Ravina will likely have trouble dealing with my absence when she comes round, so please...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0041
101	You ought to know that I am always kind to young girls!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0037
102	Ohohohoh!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
103	Haa... Sometimes, I don't know what to do with this old man.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
104	I have some cookies!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
105	I'm fine, thank you.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
106	Umgf... The outside is all crunchy, and the middle is nice and soft. They smell so good, too, like pure maple syrup.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
107	Mmmm... They're so...umgf...good! I'm so...mmff...happy!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0024
108	...
109	I have some cream puffs, too!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
110	I'm fine, thank you.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
111	So good! The outside is all fluffy, and the custard is just...umgf...deliciously...mmm...creamy!
112	I'm in heaven! It's so sweet, so rich... I was craving this!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0023
113	...
114	You want some, don't you?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
115	Not in the slightest!
116	Of course, the type of sweet itself is important, but what really makes them taste good is sharing them with someone.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
117	I would like nothing more than for us to continue on our way as soon as possible.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
118	I'll just have a cup of tea, and then I'll be ready!
119	You are aware that your life is in danger, aren't you?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0030
120	The contrast between the sugary sweet dessert and the bitterness of the tea is just divine!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
121	...
122	There's no point in just standing there! Come and sit down with me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
123	It's too cold to sit still.
124	The tea is nice and warm, though.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
125	...
126	M-may I have a cup?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0031
127	Hee hee. Of course! Here you are!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
128	Ahhhhhhh... Mmmmm... That really hits the spot.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0024
129	How is it?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
130	It's tart. The bitterness lingers and refreshes, while the aftertaste is mellow... More than anything, I can feel its warmth spreading throughout my body.
131	Magical, isn't it?
132	Do you mean to say that there's magic in this?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0046
133	The bitterness is what gives it its sophisticated flavor.
134	I completely agree.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
135	I'm glad we were able to share this!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0023
136	Sorry to interrupt your teatime.
137	Aahhh! You...!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0028
138	Gosh. You just appear out of nowhere, don't you?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
139	Th-this is terrible for my heart!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0029
140	Hiding things isn't really going to get me anywhere, so I figured I should tell you what you need to know.
141	I'm here, but not really. It's actually just my spirit that's visiting this time. That's why I can pop up wherever I want, and vanish, too.
142	Didn't you say that you're searching for your sister?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0001
143	If not here, then where is your physical being?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
144	I left it behind...in the past. That's where I'm from.
145	The past? Do you mean to say that you're visiting from a different time?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
146	Who knows? I'll leave that up to your imagination.
147	If your sister isn't here, then why don't you leave us alone and go visit some other time?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
148	I'm going to need some powerful magic for that, so I've gotta go back home and store up power for a bit. Kinda like what you two are doing right now.
149	Then why don't you get going?
150	Hey! No need to be so cold.
151	I know nothing about you.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
152	It's not like I know for sure I can't meet my sister in this time. It could happen. Besides...
153	I didn't plan on this, but there are a few things I think I should find out first.
154	Like what?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
155	Well, for one, what exactly it is that you're fighting for.
156	Then there's the age-old question... For whom does Alchemy exist?
157	Over there!
158	The Holy Guard!
159	Wait. There's something different about them. Who are they?
160	Oh! I totally forgot to tell you.
161	There are heaps of soldiers waiting to ambush you around the bend of the mountain road up ahead.
162	If your intention was to warn us, then those ought to have been the very first words out of your mouth!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
163	Just so you know, since my body isn't here, I can't fight or anything.
164	You really ought to say these things outright!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0016
165	Guess I must be a little time-lagged.
166	We'll just have to take care of this ourselves, Cheryl.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0030
167	My bad.
168	Lofia, I know that you are still recovering, but I am afraid that I cannot deal with these numbers on my own.
169	It's fine. I need the exercise.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
170	O-oh?
171	I am mostly made of sugary sweets, you know.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1013
172	When you're out of energy and feeling down, you need sugar power.
173	That's the rule.	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0014
174	S-sugar...power?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
175	Do you know where they're positioned, Nyx?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
176	I can give you a rough idea about the ones between the mountain road and the border.
177	I'm a Court Mage, Nyx, did you know that? Yet while that title certainly has a ring to it...	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1012
178	When it comes down to it, I'm a witch.
179	The ebb and flow of Mother Nature, Elemental Force... That is my specialty.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_0024
180	Cool.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0045
181	Are you going to go on a witch hunt after this, Inquisitor?
182	Witch hunts are only for the purpose of punishing those who would use the supernatural forces under their control to harm others.
183	Which makes this lot a far more apt target for my judgment, wouldn't you agree?
184	Witch-hunters turned witch? Somehow, it's not as funny as it should be.
185	Now, allow me to show you how foolish it is to pick a fight with a witch in the very heart of nature!
186	All right, then! It's tea party time!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0015
