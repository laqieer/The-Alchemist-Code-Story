001	...
002	(Raphtalia, Filo... Where are you two?)	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
003	Say, Melty, aren't you a princess?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
004	Er, yes, I am.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
005	You said people are out to get you back in your world... May I ask what happened?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0002
006	Well...
007	I see... I had no idea that you went through so much.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
008	My father despises demi-humans...as well as the Shield Hero. But the king and Heroes should be working together, not fighting among themselves.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
009	After some deliberating, my mother ordered me to hurry back to the kingdom and admonish the king for encouraging such unjust hatred to flourish.
010	That's why I want Father and the Shield Hero to reconcile their differences. I just need to get them to speak with one another...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
011	And yet, the knights of Melromarc turned their swords on me...
012	The knights did...?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0025
013	Naofumi ended up saving me, but ended up being wanted for kidnapping the princess...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
014	I swear, no one in charge of Melromarc is worth anything. Not even their king nor that other princess...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0030
015	H-how can you even say that?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0012
016	Why do bother defending them? Your blood sister tried to kill you for the crown, after all.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0010
017	Oh... Well...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
018	They didn't believe a word you said and blindly followed your sister, right? They'll never change. They acted the same to me, too...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
019	That's why we can't trust anyone from your kingdom. Especially your poor excuse of a father—the king who tried to execute his own daughter.
020	Father never attempted to do such a thing!
021	It's true that those were my father's men, but they were just listening to my sister's orders.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
022	No matter who told them to do it, it doesn't change the fact that knights of the Melromarc Kingdom were out for your head.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
023	On top of that—those knights took orders from someone besides the king? Your kingdom's got a lot of issues.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
024	...
025	Hey... You didn't have to go that far...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
026	You have no right to butt in when you don't even know the entire situation.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
027	...
028	And just for the record—Melty's father is the one who messed with me first.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0010
029	That may be true, but...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
030	Sorry, but we're going to need you to leave this argument back in your world to deal with later. You're not going to resolve that while you're here.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
031	We need to focus on looking for your pals right now.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
032	You're right...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
033	You're a hardheaded one, Naofumi. But I suppose I don't blame you for feeling that way if what you claim is true.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
034	Still, if you keep pushing others away, no one will ever come close to truly understanding you.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
035	Indeed... It must feel disheartening when no one trusts you..	VO_melty.melty_sys_0004
036	I already know what that feels like. I don't think I could handle it if I had to do it all alone...
037	But even so... The king and Heroes need to work together...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
038	Melty...
039	That is why as our kingdom's princess, I must get the Shield Hero and the king to put aside their differences and join forces.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0004
040	Mother's putting all of her trust in me to do so.
041	Don't push yourself too hard, Melty.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0001
042	Trying to solve everything on your own can be too much to bear sometimes. I should know.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
043	...
044	Although that's easier said than done. I'm sure it's not easy being part of the royal family.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
045	Huh?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
046	As someone with so much power, you need to take into consideration not only yours, but the wellbeing of your people, as well. That is the responsibility of any leader.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
047	I'm not of royal blood... But I have protected them, so I have an idea of the amount of responsibility that they must bear.
048	I see...
049	So the fact that you are working so hard to take responsibility as your kingdom's princess makes me want the best for you.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
050	At the same time, I'm also rather concerned for you... You shouldn't feel obligated to handle all of this on your own.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0001
051	Thank you for your kind words, Miss Anastasia.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0033
052	But this is merely my responsibility as a princess of the kingdom.
053	I need to accomplish what mother expects from me... And as the future queen, I need to do everything in my power to save my kingdom.
054	So please, don't worry about me!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0007
055	Just as stubborn as Naofumi, I see.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
056	W-what?! That is absolutely not true...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
057	(I wonder if a certain someone that I know will also worry her head off just like this one here once she becomes queen...)	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
058	(All that worry and confusion... I wonder if she was plagued by the same as she tried to do what was best for Wratharis? My queen was still but a child...)	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0030
059	What's wrong?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
060	I heard something just now...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
061	H-heeelp!
062	Ah!
063	What is that thing? I've never seen a monster like that before.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0025
064	These are the monsters of our world. ...They appear to be pretty agitated. Are they being affected by the Wave?
065	Who knows... Whatever the case, we need to help that guy out right away.
066	You're going to help him?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
067	What kind of Hero would I be if I didn't help someone in need?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
068	I guess you're right...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
