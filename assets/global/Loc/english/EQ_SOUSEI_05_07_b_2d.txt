001	Hah! Got it!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0007
002	That guy's helmet just...
003	Did it—?!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0024
004	...	VO_arius.arius_sys_0042
005	Why don't we take a look at who's hiding under the—
006	...mask?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
007	Aaah... Andechs.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0046
008	N-no... Your Highness...?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0026
009	How did you become a Fallen?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0021
010	Urgaaahhh!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0043
011	Ah, damn! Stop—!
012	Hyaaahh!!!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
013	Grraaarg?!
014	"People of Invidia, lend me your strength!"	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0040
015	"I invoke the divine protection of the Shield Maiden to protect, to bring salvation, and to lend a hand to those in need!"
016	What is this light? How absurd! You believe you can oppose my corruption?!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0022
017	This... I see... This must be what that serpent was looking for!
018	Just a little further and the ocean will claim you as its own!
019	A brave effort, but this is as far as you go—	VO_arius.arius_sys_0013
020	H-huh?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
021	No way, the shield shattered?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0026
022	Mwuahaha! Now try and defend yourself against the Cursed Beast!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0009
023	Did...we do it?
024	This ocean is ruled by the Leviathan... It's a different kind of corruption, so...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
025	Hey now, little lady, you did a good job saving my ass out there, but careful not to overdo it.
026	(But something isn't right. King Arius should be the one commanding the knights. Why... How could he have fallen into sin?)
027	(Could a man like him really fall so easily?)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
028	(The Ira Belt's decision to invade, whatever happened to the King... What am I supposed to make of all this?)
029	The Fallen's phantom soldiers disappeared when he went down too...
030	Yes, they did.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
031	You hear that, Ira Belt Knights?! We defeated your commander! Victory is ours!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
032	Surrender peacefully and there'll be no need for further bloodshed—
033	Huh—? This shaking...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0025
034	No, it can't be... Adaleigh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
035	Yeah... I'm afraid I can see it all too well from up here too.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
036	Everybody, you gotta get outta there! The Leviathan is coming right for you!
