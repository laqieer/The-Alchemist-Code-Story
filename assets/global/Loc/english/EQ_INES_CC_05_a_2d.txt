001	So Nasario is somewhere in here?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0001
002	It seems so. The ones who abducted him are no doubt extremists plotting to sabotage our relationship with the high elves.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0005
003	I've done considerable research on them and identified their hideout, but this is the first opportunity I've had to properly infiltrate it.
004	Look, Claris! A feather!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0012
005	That is undeniably one of the plumes from his clothing. This confirms what the spirits told me. We must hurry!
006	Ugh, it's so dark...	VO_ines.ines_sys_0016
007	As is to expected, unfortunately, given that we're inside a cave. Will you be all right in here, Ines?
008	Y-Yes. I'll be fine.	VO_ines.ines_sys_0005
009	(I can handle this. Because right now, Nasario must be having a much harder time than I am...)
010	(I have to stay strong!)
011	Stop dilly-dallying! Grab her already, and stuff her in the carriage!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
012	!!!
013	Heh. She'll fetch a fine price. The high elves really are as beautiful as they say.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
014	Don't leave any marks. It's rare to get your hands on one without 'em. Any cut on her skin is gonna be a cut in our profits.
015	Her face looks like a little kid's, but I betcha she's been alive for hundreds o' years. Elves are basically monsters, when you get right down to it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
016	Ines?
017	S-sorry. I...	VO_ines.ines_battle_0019
018	......
019	Here. Watch this. Hah!	VO_craris.craris_sys_0001
020	Whoa...
021	You can see ahead now, right? And you can also see your own two feet, so you won't trip and fall.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0002
022	Now that you know what's out there, there's no need to be afraid.
023	Claris...
024	You're right. I'm not scared anymore. Let's go!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0005
025	Oi! How are we gonna lure the representative here?
026	Security around her is so tight, we can't get anywhere near her!
027	Tch! And after gettin' ourselves some prime high elf bait, too.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
028	Fools. Our representative would never come to such a treacherous place.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0010
029	I'm sorry to say your little scheme has failed. You couldn't even capture me without resorting to underhanded tactics.
031	Relying upon incantation gear! Honestly. The divide between our abilities and yours is wide as a chasm. I pity your kind and their small-minded ways.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0022
033	You wanna say that to my face? Huh?!
034	I'd prefer not. It's best to keep your distance, as the sound of your shrill human screeching hurts my ears enough even from afar.
035	Heh. I wonder how much longer you can keep up that tough-guy act.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
036	Don't you dare lay your dirty hands upon me!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0016
037	We were plannin' to kill your representative so the festival falls apart, but you know what? Maybe you'll do just fine after all!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
063	......
038	This incantation gear renders your high-and-mighty elf powers useless. We finally perfected it, after testin' it on lots o' elves from lots o' places!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
039	How sad. All because you're so afraid of what we can do.
064	Oi! Say that again! I dare ya!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
065	Such typical human bluster...	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0030
066	Big talk from you, too, for someone restrained by our incantation gear!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
040	Stop!!!
041	Nasario! Are you all right?!
042	Ines?! Why are you here? Why did you come here?!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0025
043	Claris! Why would you bring Ines to a place like this?!
044	It's not her fault. I came of my own accord.
045	It's because of me that you're in this position. I couldn't just sit by and do nothing!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0012
046	But you must! It's imperative you not fight with the humans!
047	Hahaha! Looks like we'll be able to wreck this festival after all!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
048	Will you, now? You really think you can get away with this?	VO_craris.craris_sys_0030
049	What, you think you can stop us?!
050	W-we got trouble, boss! Knights from Northern Pride are headed this way!
051	What?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
052	Before coming here, I used my family name to request their aid.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0005
053	I've prepared very carefully for this festival. And in doing so, I've come to know a great many things.
054	I know there are people like you out there, for instance. And that my power alone is not enough to help Ines and her companions in their time of need.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0003
055	But because of that knowledge, I can plan my next move accordingly.
056	Hrgh... Curse you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
057	Haaaaaah!
058	Aaaaaargghhhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
067	This light...!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0025
068	(The spirits aren't dispersing at all, but rather blessing Ines and Claris alike!)
059	Nasario! Are you all right?!
060	There's no need for concern. The waves from your spell merely grazed me.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0006
069	Do be on your guard, though. That man's incantation gear seals high elf magic.
070	Oh! So that's how you were captured!
061	We been preparin' lots of other things, too, so we can fight you monsters off real efficient-like!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
071	Monsters? Us?!
062	You lot live in the same body for hundreds o' years, barely agin' a day in a decade! That ain't natural. It ain't right!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
072	We're oil and water, so stop tryin' to pretend we can get along! There's no point makin' friends with freaks. We'll kill every last one o' ya!
073	The spirit's blessing is not leaving us. It seems my fear was misplaced.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0031
074	I believe it's because you are enemies of humans and high elves alike. So there is no longer any need to hold back my power.
075	Allow me to show you the true strength of the "monsters" that you fear so much!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0010
