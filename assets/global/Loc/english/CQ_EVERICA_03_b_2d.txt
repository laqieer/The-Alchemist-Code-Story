001	...
002	Gah...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
003	Guha...!!
004	...
005	Tch...! They're tough!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
006	How are all our men being pushed back by just two fighters!?
007	I'll tell you how! We're partners. And when we're together...
008	...we never lose!	VO_hazel.hazel_battle_0010
009	Hiya!!	VO_hazel.hazel_battle_0001
010	Nuh...!
011	Damn yooooou!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
012	...
013	...I thought you'd try something like that. But I won't let you!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0030
014	Are you ok?
015	Of course. After all, I've got you here with me.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
016	...
017	I know I could count on you. You've always got my back.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0045
018	!?
019	Come on, now isn't the time for... Ah...
020	Hazel...	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0001
021	I've gotten pretty used to these limbs. Now I can fight. Thanks for the help.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
022	But why... Why did you come back to battle after you were so badly hurt? 	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0019
023	You lost half of your body! You could have died!
024	Because I made up my mind, back when I first became a mercenary.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0012
025	But...aren't you afraid? Even just standing here like this, I'm...	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0001
026	...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
027	Then why?
028	Because what I'm even more afraid of is being unable to protect my friend. That's why...I'm really glad you're ok.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
029	...
030	...It's getting dark.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
031	...Yeah, it really is. And the clouds are so thick that they're starting to cloud my mood too.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0004
032	...But just beyond the clouds, there's a beautiful moon waiting. It's like how...	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
033	Even though I lost my limbs, I could still return to the battlefield. As long as you don't give up, hope will never disappear.
034	...
035	...You really are strong, Hazel. I wish I had that kind of strength.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0007
036	I can't see the moon beyond the clouds, but... I want to believe that it's there.
037	...
038	...Once the clouds clear, I'd really like to look upon that moon with you.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0008
039	...Yeah. I know we will eventually.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
040	By the way...why did you choose me to be your partner?
041	You don't know?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0005
042	No. After all, I'm still in training. And you said I had a keen eye for battle, but it wound up being no good...
043	That's not true. Just from the enemies' footsteps you were able to discern their direction and number, and then figure out how to deal with them.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
044	Not to mention, you were also the one who realized they were hiding in that cave.
045	...
046	You really do have a good eye for battle.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
047	And you always take me into account with your plans.
048	Do you remember? Back on that mission when I got hurt, you had a bad feeling about it.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
049	I...
050	We might be able to take them out with a pincer attack.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0003
051	Get 'em with their backs to the wall, huh?
052	That's right. There are too many enemies as they are now. But if we split up and take them out individually, we might stand a chance...	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0004
053	...What? Having second thoughts?
054	It's just, in a situation like this, splitting up might be too dangerous an idea.
055	Don't worry. I'll be the one to force them back. I know we can do it.	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1006
056	Yeah...you're right. Just, don't get in over your head, ok?
057	I won't.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0038
058	...
059	You realized the danger, but I went for it anyway and got in over my head.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0030
060	It was my inexperience that caused these injuries, not yours.
061	But I could have done something. I could have stopped you!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0019
062	That's what I'm talking about.
063	...huh?	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0025
064	You're always thinking of me.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
065	You know, back when we made that plan, I was thinking of you too.
066	You mean... You were doing the same thing I was?
067	Yep. That's why I wanted you to be my partner, because we're so much alike.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
068	Hazel...!
069	We don't do well on our own.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0003
070	We need each other. And now that I've got these prosthetics, I need you more than ever.
071	...You're right. I shouldn't be wasting time feeling sorry for myself. I should be thinking about how we can best fight together with your new body!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0044
072	Partners are equals... They play to each other's strengths while covering each other's weaknesses, like two parts of a whole. Isn't that right?
073	Heheh...	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
074	!
075	...More of them.
076	They don't give up, do they?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
077	Uwaaaaa!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
078	TAAAAaaaa!!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_battle_0007
079	UUUOOoooo!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0009
080	NUAAAHH----!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
081	...
082	...
083	Thanks.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0034
084	You too.	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0007
085	Hey, Evelika, what do you say after this mission, we go get some cheese dogs?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
086	...Haven't you been eating too many cheese dogs lately?
087	...No.
088	You definitely have! But...maybe just this once, we can buy a whole bunch!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0030
089	Huh?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0006
090	...I made you worry about me, so this time it's my treat.
091	Wait, really?
092	Yep! But we've got to get home safely first!	VO_ewelika.ewelika_sys_0004
093	Yeah...!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0023
094	(No matter how many enemies there are--no matter how bad it gets--it'll be ok in the end.)
095	Because we're two people who share an unbreakable bond of trust. Because we're partners!
