001	... ...
002	Its left eye and parts of its limbs have been crystallized. If we make any more alterations, there's no guarantee its body can endure.
003	However, it still cannot withstand the curse. Low-temperature resistance alone doesn't seem worth the research effort.
004	O-oh...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
005	Perhaps we selected the wrong material? The crystallized anti-curse effect seems to have been hyper-excessive.
006	Well, that's why we do experiments. Worst case scenario, we can discard the trial body.
007	Ohhh...oh...oh...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0043
008	You're going to destroy one of the few success samples?
009	There's no point unless the results accompany it. We're dabbling with the forbidden arts in order to create something that can resist the curse.
010	...But.
011	Ahh, ahh!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0025
012	Who left the experiment cage open?! Quickly, separate the insects! How many times do I have to say this experiment is a secret kept from His Majesty...
013	Aaaaaaahhh!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0028
014	How horrible. Are you all right, boy?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0027
015	...Aaah?	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
016	Who would've thought such inhumane acts were occurring within the royal palace?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0016
017	All right, there's no need to worry. Come on. Take my hands.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
018	...Uh...ah? ...A...dream...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
019	There's no one...
020	There's no one there. It's okay. It's gonna be okay...I am living alone just fine.
021	That sound...is maybe the rain? It's quiet and calming...	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
022	Maybe I still can't leave this mansion because it's like this...
023	That person said this place was safe...that, if I wanted...I could prepare to live in the village, but...
024	...I'm scared. Scared. Scared. I'm scared how they...how those girls...will look at how different I am...besides...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
025	Who would accept a creature like me that turns everything I touch into crystal...?
026	No matter how much I wish it, I cannot change myself from being me. I can't change. That's why it's better if I don't get involved with anyone.
027	...Hu...uh? That sound...the entrance door to the mansion is opening...?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
028	Ack! Seriously! Why did it start raining so suddenly?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0029
029	Ohh, my clothes are soaking wet... At this rate, I'll need to take shelter here.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
030	Um, hello...is anyone home?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
031	I guess not, huh? I mean, my mother told me that this mansion has been empty for a long...
032	Eeek?! Wh-wh-what was that sound?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
033	From inside the mansion?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
034	...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0027
035	I'm just putting this out there, but, just now, was that a gh-gh-ghost...?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0043
036	(N-no, it can't be! Ghosts don't exist...said my mother never...)
037	(B-but! I'm not scared! I'm fine!)
038	Hello! Is somebody there?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
039	Eeek?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0028
040	Aah, aah...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
041	Don't...come...I...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0010
042	...So beautiful.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
043	...Huh?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
044	Wow! Your eyes are so sparkly! U-um, are you in this mansion by yourself?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0044
045	Aah, um, yeah...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
046	I've never seen such beautiful eyes before!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0046
047	Be-beautiful? Are you talking about my crystal eyes?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
048	Wow! How strange! They're not like my mom's, my sister's, or the people from the village!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0044
049	Hey, how can you have such beautiful eyes? Wow! They're almost like...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
050	W-wait...first of all, who are you? What are you doing here?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0047
051	Ooh...well, I just wanted some shelter from the rain. I'm sorry I entered without permission...um...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0020
052	I'm Mielikki.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1024
053	And, well, you know? I've never met someone as beautiful as you...that's why, well!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
054	Pl-please become friends with me!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
055	...Huh? Friends...friends?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
056	Do you mean, um...you and me...really?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
057	Yes!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
058	... ...
059	Hey, look look! Celliers! I brought flowers today!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
060	Flowers...? Why did you bring something like that?	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
061	I don't think this mansion is very good.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
062	It's dark, damp, and stinks like medicine! If you stay here all the time, it'll make you depressed.
063	Really? I like this kind of place though.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
064	I know, right? Right? So I brought flowers instead! They're the most beautiful ones that I'm raising right now!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
065	Raising? You're raising them, Mielikki?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
066	In our village, I have my own flowerbed. I have one in the forest too but that one's a secret.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
067	And there! There! I have lots of flowers that are in bloom during this season!
068	This is a cut flower so it won't last long, but...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0020
069	I see. So flowers blossom in this country as well...
070	Celliers?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
071	Oh, well...nothing., Thank you for the beautiful flowers. I'll decorate my room with them.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
072	Oh...	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
073	The flowers...they became the same crystal as your eyes.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
074	I'm sorry, Mielikki. I still can't control this power well...and now I've ruined your flowers.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
075	...It's so beautiful! Hey, hey, can you do it to things other than flowers?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
076	Of course. But...aren't you scared of my power?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
077	Hmm...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
078	I feel a little sorry for the flowers, but this is already a cut flower and I do things like turning them into bookmarks.
079	That's not what I mean. You might end up like this as well...you know?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0039
080	I won't, you know?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
081	Why's that?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
082	My mom would say to use your powers for something good. I'm sure you could do that, Celliers!
083	Something good...my powers?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
084	Whoaa?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0027
085	What's the matter, Celliers?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
086	Ri-right now, there was a shadow on the table...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
087	Hmm...a spider? There's a lot of dust as well...I think cleaning is important.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
088	I-I hate those...kind of things...! When they rustle around in the corner of the room, it makes me feel...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
089	You're such a baby. Here, little spider. Outside you go!
090	Mielikki, are you okay with those kind soft things?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
091	Since I take care of my flowerbeds, I've seen lots of them!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
092	I see. You're pretty amazing.
093	Eheheh...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
094	We...are...going...outside!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0010
095	Stop...don't pull me, Mielikki...I don't like the sunlight and...
096	Today is cloudy so it's okay! I wanna show you my flower bed!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
097	But if someone like me suddenly went outside and people saw us together, it'll be troublesome for you.	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1005
098	Why? I'd introduce you to all my friends, you know?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
099	But...well...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
100	Come on! If you don't hurry up, it'll start—	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
101	I-it's raining...	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
102	Ahh?!
103	Aww...I'm soaking.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0029
104	I heard that rain is cold, but, looking at it like this, it's actually warm.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0044
105	But at this rate, we'll catch a cold. Hey, can I use your shower?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
106	Sure. You go ahead.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
107	But then you'll get cold, Celliers! Let's go in together!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0026
108	Huh? B-but...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
109	We're both girls so there's nothing to be embarrassed about!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0008
110	No, no, you're wrong! There's a misunderstanding! Hey, wait, don't pull on my clothes!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0026
111	I've been thinking this from before, but you're surprisingly strong and...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
112	Y-you're a guy...you're so beautiful, but it turns out you're a guy...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
113	Ack...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
114	... ...
115	(It's already been a month since I met Mielikki...)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
116	(A lot has happened...)
117	All right, preparation for the picnic is complete!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0032
118	Celliers, what's the matter?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0005
119	No, I was just thinking about how eventful this month's been.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0039
120	Really? Most of my memories are of you being locked up in that mansion.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
121	B-but now sometimes I go outside, right? Although...I'm always with you...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
122	And, today, we're gonna take a walk in the forest together! Are you ready?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
123	Ah, yeah...is the flowerbed we're gonna go to far?	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
124	It's really close. That first day I came here when I hid from the rain, I was on my way home from there!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
125	All right then! Let's go!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0032
126	O-oh...
127	Wow. I didn't know there was such an open space beyond that forest...besides...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0046
128	Heheh I wonder if everyone is doing well today.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
129	Are all the flowers growing here yours, Mielikki?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
130	Yes! Some of them have strong scents or they grow too much, so it's difficult to grow them near the village.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
131	That's why I grow them in my secret flowerbed!
132	You did this all alone? You're amazing, Mielikki.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0009
133	Heheh... You think so?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0050
134	Oh, but, but...recently I've been having some trouble.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
135	Trouble?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
136	With all these flowers, it's become a beautiful flower bed, but it seems like the scent is strong.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0030
137	So now I get naughty little monsters like those coming here and roughing up the flowers.
138	Hey, don't come in the flowerbed without permission! Can't you see it says 'Mielikki's Flower Bed' on it?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1001
139	Unurruru!!!
140	If you do something strange, I'll punish you with magic!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_2001
141	Mielikki, me too!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0032
142	H-huh...o-ohhh...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
143	H-hey...I'm not there...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
144	Celliers? What's going on?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
145	Aaaahhhh!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0028
146	The earth and the leaves...are crystal now...? Celliers?! Celliers?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
147	Hoo-hah!
148	...! Oh...the monsters are after Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
149	(I need to do something about it, but what can I do?! What?! This is my only option!)	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
150	He-hey, your fight is with me! I'm not scared of monsters at all!!!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0007
