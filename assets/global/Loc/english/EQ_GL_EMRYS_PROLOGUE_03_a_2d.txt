001	Be a good girl, alright? I'll be back to see you often.
002	...
003	Don't make trouble and take your medicine.
004	...
005	Now now, don't make that face.
006	I'll bring back a lot of sweets for you, okay?
007	...
008	Hahaha. Yes, even sweets that you have not seen before!
009	You managed to create ice already?
010	That's amazing! When I was your age I could only make frosty wind.
011	...
012	With your amount of talent it's definitely hard to control.
013	That's what the nice sisters are here to help you with, okay?
014	Don't worry they will keep you safe till I return.
015	What...happened here?
016	Did some beast attack this place?
017	These marks on the walls.
018	But where are the bodies?
019	Where is she?
020	This is the place on the note.
021	Just an unassuming building in a decrepit district. It seems obvious but randomly searching would have taken ages.
022	Not too shabby with the hidden security measures though.
023	I'll freeze those cameras so I can slip right in.
024	*clank* *clank* *clank*
025	It's guarded by machines.
026	No need for the guards to leave the place and jeopardize the location.
027	Not too shabby.
028	This also means I can freeze them all and secure the place.
029	I'd better get started then.
