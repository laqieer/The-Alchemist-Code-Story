001	Dias! You're really here...
002	What are you doing here?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
003	I'd like to ask the same of you! Dias, isn't it? What did you do to the queen?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
004	This country is cursed by the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.
005	On top of that, the Belphegor was brought into this country.
006	We, the Holy Guard, are taking responsibility for handling these two matters.
007	...Belphegor?
008	Queen...Venus Dota Lustburg, if you continue to refuse to provide information and defy me...you must be prepared to pay the consequences.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
009	Ack... If you're going to do it, then do it. I will not give the Sacred Stones to you!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
010	... ...
011	Wait!
012	Move. You don't want to die, do you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
013	Nobody wants to! Even if people risk their lives to fight, nobody truly wants to die—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
014	Liz!!!
015	Agh...ghh... Wh-what...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0027
016	You did well to buy me time, Lisbeth. Thanks to you, I have managed to transfer the magic into me.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0008
017	Transfer...? No!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
018	What can a winner give to a loser? No matter how the flesh heals, their past defeats will not disappear. 	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0003
019	Lisbeth, your hypocrisy is meaningless.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0004
020	...!!!
021	That mage just now...she ultimately...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
022	Even after Liz went out of her way to save her!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0020
023	Bundled together with the lives of my subjects, my victory is ensured. Come, you evil ones.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
024	With so many of my vassals having perished, I will fight you not as a queen but as an individual witch!
025	Everyone...why?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
