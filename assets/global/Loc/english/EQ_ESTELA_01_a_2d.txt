001	You want me to fortune tell about Slothstein's future with mechanical engineering?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0009
002	Yes. That is why I wanted you to come to Slothstein for this reading.
003	I see…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
004	Is that strange?
005	Not at all. Although for the most part, people ask to have their own fortunes told.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
006	Usually because they need some sort of direction in their lives.
007	I don't need to know my own fortune. I'm already retired.
008	Instead I'm curious about how this country will move forward with mechanical engineering.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0045
009	Yes. Magic engineering can that benefit the people, and there are some drawbacks with machines.
010	Is it right for the world to move in that direction? I'm just not so sure.
011	But I do like machines. So I'm hoping that there is a brighter future for technology.
012	And that's why you're requesting for a reading. I understand. Alright. Let's have a look.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0037
013	I see…a dark shadow…
014	A dark shadow?
015	Yes. It's looking for a great confrontation. There will be a big festival soon, won't there?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
016	It is there that it will take upon a wish…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
017	A big festival… No…
018	It can't be… Everyone's been working so hard.
118	The festival is expected to change the course of mechanical engineering. And there's nothing that can be done?
019	…
020	The future seen through fortune telling is a temporary vision. Efforts can be made to change its course.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0039
021	If you want to change the future, I'd have to look further and deeper.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
022	Please! I would like to know.
023	Certainly.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0005
024	It seems…the central person is feeling extremely nervous.
025	She is impatient and her feelings are spreading to people around her, and so the others are pushing themselves too hard. And then disaster…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
026	She… Ah, I see.
027	Thank you. I think I understand now. I have to tell him that the problem must be solved…
028	But even if one problem is solved, another one may appear.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
029	Confusion, anxiety, bewilderment… All are within her heart. Without resolution, the dark shadow will continue to control her
030	I see… What is there to do?
031	Hmm… Estella. Could you stay here for a while as a fortune teller?
032	Huh?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
033	Of course, I will pay extra for this service. I'll also prepare a place where you can do your readings.
034	But…
035	Please. There are people who need your assistance in fortune telling here.
036	(This is a difficult situation. I usually don't stay in one place for long periods…)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0031
119	(Staying in one place will make everyone around become completely dependent on fortune telling...)
037	(I didn't want to be part of that anymore, so I decided to travel. Also…)
038	I understand. Then for a little while, I'll be a fortune teller for this city.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0037
039	(It is a "job" at least…)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
040	The roles of fotune tellers are to support hard working people…
041	Those who want to achieve great things have a heavy burden. Mental strength is necessary.
042	That's why we've made promises with the spirits for their help, so we can support the backs of those who work hard.
043	"We fortune tellers must support the backs of those who work hard!" My mother's words exactly.
044	And with that in mind, she used her powers. The secret technique passed down in the family, called "Spirit Divination."
045	A long time ago, the spirit that the ancestor made a pact with gave divine protection. This gave the power of fortune telling through the five senses.
046	Surrender the senses to the spirits will grant the truth which nornal humans cannot see.
047	She slowly started to lose her vision because of the power that was given to her. In the end, she became totally blind.
048	She was a fortune teller whose eyes were like medals, and she supported a number of number of people with her visions.
049	I was proud of my mother. After her passing, I inherited the contract with the spirits to become a fortune teller like her.
050	But…
051	All the people who come for my readings just want an easy answer.. They don't try to act or think for themselves.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0018
052	Hey, mom. Is it really necessary for us to tell them their fortunes?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
053	These people are forgetting to try to make an effort on their own, relying entirely on fortune telling.
054	This is the shop that opened up recently. I heard the predictions were quite accurate.
055	I had my fortune told and I'm glad I did. I felt like she could see everything, and her advice was accurate.
056	And while she was talking, it was so soothing to hear. It was like she knew exactly what I wanted…
057	Really…? I think I'll have to make a reservation!
058	…
059	What's wrong, Amis?	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0006
060	Actually… I think I should go back… I mean, everyone's doing well, so I don't know what I'm doing here…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0031
061	Hey, you can't just cancel things. Getting a reservation for this fortune teller was really hard.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0002
062	I did quite a lot of work trying to get this reservation for you. You really should be thanking me!
063	But I didn't ask…
064	That's not an excuse! You really need a break so your subordinates can also get a break.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0010
065	W-well, that may be true, but why to a fortune teller?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0020
120	I don't have anything I particularly want to know.
121	It's your stoic ways that made me want to bring you here.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0022
122	Huh?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0025
066	Never mind. So, let's go. I don't want to be chewed out by her for being late.
067	Um… okay, I understand.
068	Welcome and thank you for coming. You must be Amis.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
069	Uh… Yes. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, but I don't have anything I want to know…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
070	Is that right…?
071	It seems you have a strong sense of responsibility…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0002
072	You are compelled to complete any task assigned with full attention.
073	There is a great and important task forthcoming. Because of it, you'll start to feel unease…
074	…!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0025
076	And then there is a major challenge for the region… No, for the world… And for you…
129	You feel extremely honored… But at the same time, there is great responsibility.
077	…
123	It seems you recognize what I'm reading.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
124	I do. There is something I'm anxious about. It's on my mind even while I sit here. But…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
125	Then let me read your fortune. We may be able to clear some of your worries and anxieties.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
126	…
079	…
080	We must succeed… The train's fate… No, the fate of a mechanical engineering…	VO_amis.amis_battle_0019
081	But... I wonder if it's really going to go well if it takes so much time for preparation. Not only the ceremony, but also for the future…
127	I can't be this weak-minded if I want to lead others. I have to be focused.
128	I know that. I know, but…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
082	It's time, Vice-Captain Amis.
083	Yes. If the next ceremony is successful, the train will officially be put into service. I never thought I'd be assigned to be in charge of it.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
084	Why not? It was essentially your idea as vice-captain.
085	At first, I was told that it was absurd. But I was able to proceed with the research though the help from my boss. And that's how it went.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
086	This will lead to many people being able to travel far and wide.
087	It's going to be a future where people will connect from all over the world, through new technology and engineering feats.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0004
088	Thanks to you, vice-captain, right?
089	…
090	Vice-captain Amis. Congratulations on your promotion as the next director.
091	The cards show…dark clouds.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
092	Huh?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0006
093	The overwhelming burden and enthusiasm together create impatience. You are now placing unnecessarily burden on yourself and those around you.
094	You or your subordinates cannot undertake this stress.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0002
095	It starts off as minor, but it will gradually spread everywhere…
096	It's like you can see your future, right Amis?	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0003
097	In other words, the situation will improve if I can calm down and pay attention to my surroundings...?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0031
098	Remember that fortune telling is not fate. You can use the readings to change the future for the better.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
099	I…see…
100	Although there is a concern. I have a bad feeling about how things are moving. It seems that there is something missing.
101	It would be wise to check once more on the preparation for the ceremony.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
102	Speaking of that, I already have some subordinates preparing for it. But it might be worth another look…
103	I have to get going then. Thank you very much, Estella!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0033
104	Hey! You're just going to leave without your superior? Really...	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0002
105	Well, at least some sense was knocked into her, so I'll let it slide this time.
106	I'm glad she is seeing things in a better light. You're looking after your subordinates.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
107	Their mental health is also my concern. I learned that from my predecessor.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0004
108	Plus, this ceremony is very important to me. We want to make it a success no matter what. And so...I might be asking for your assistance again later.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0003
109	Your powers are the real thing, it seems.
110	Whenever you need my assistance.
113	Hm? I'm sorry, the previous customer was my last reservation for today.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
114	You must be Estella. You travel from place to place, reading fortunes that lead toward success.
115	You're going to have to shut down this place. Any more of this will cause trouble around here.
116	That's a pretty forceful method, isn't it? Though It's an honor to have think of my powers so highly.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
117	You think that fortune tellers are weak… How shallow of you.
