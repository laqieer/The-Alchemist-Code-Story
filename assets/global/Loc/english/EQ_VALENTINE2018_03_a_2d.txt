001	Phew... That's the last of them.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
002	Yeah... Hey, those monsters were unusually determined, don't you think?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
003	Hm? There's something on the ground here.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1001
004	Ah. That's...
005	Wow, look how cute the wrapping is! Did you make this yourself?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
006	Y-yes! I dropped it when that monster attacked me. I hope it hasn't been broken or anything.
007	After all, I've already used up all of the Rainbow Cacao I bought...
008	Let me check... It's a little beat up, but nothing too bad! It's still a presentable enough gift.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
009	Wow, that looks delicious!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0046
010	But isn't it a little...plain?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
011	R-really?
012	It's not reaching its full potential the way it is now! Try adding a little decoration, like here...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
013	E-Emma, is this really...?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
014	What are you doing over there?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0012
015	Uh oh!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0027
016	That's chocolate, isn't it?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0001
017	Y-yes, but...
018	Snacks and chocolates are not allowed on school property. I have no choice but to confiscate this!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
019	Tsk... Valentine's Day...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0030
020	N-no, please...
021	That's pretty harsh.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
022	Strict enforcement is the only way to make sure that discipline is learned in the Academy. There's nothing we can do.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
023	I was supposed to exchange chocolates with my friend. I can't do that if I don't have chocolate to exchange!
024	It wasn't easy making it using the cacao, and I was so excited when it turned out so well...
025	Aw... I mean, I know it's against the rules, but it's sad that her handmade chocolate was just taken away like that.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
026	Yeah... Hm... What can we do?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
027	Is there really anything that can be done? I mean, rules are rules.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
028	Hey. Why don't you take this?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0003
029	Isn’t that Rainbow Cacao?!
030	Emma!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
031	I got some as a sample. Go on, take it.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
032	You can make more chocolate with this! Be careful not to get caught this time, and remember to amp up the presentation!
033	Emma! Stop encouraging her to break the rules!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
034	It'll be fine!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0008
035	F-fine?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
036	Thank you! Thank you so much!
037	I'm glad it all worked out! Or...well, I guess it hasn't worked out yet, but I hope it does.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
038	...
039	Noah?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
040	Emma is always like this... She just does whatever she wants and doesn't listen to me at all.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
041	That's not true. I just think that life would be much more boring if we all just followed the rules all the time.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
042	Boring, you say...? There's nothing wrong with following the rules!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0013
043	I didn't say there was!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1011
044	Really? That's what it sounded like to me. If you think following rules is so boring, then you must think that I'm boring too!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
045	What? What are you talking about?!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
046	H-hey, you two. Let's take a step back...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0027
047	...
048	Yeesh... Something better happen and save us all from this awkward silence...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
049	Grrrrrr!
050	Be careful what you wish for. Seems like the Cacao brought more monsters.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1008
051	No, no. This is perfect! Anything was better than that unbearable quiet!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0011
