001	The curse of the squishy things...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
002	...They're the Jam.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
003	The curse of the Jam...?! What's that?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
004	The Jam are referred to as writhing abominations. First, they eat their way into your body causing terrible pain...
005	Ultimately, their corrupted soul destroys your flesh completely.
006	How horrible! Mocca, were you inflicted with that curse?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
007	Yes. But, don't worry. The Sprite should know how to remove the curse.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
008	That being said, the curse that's being inflicted on the men of your country that turns them into insects...that's pretty horrible too.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
009	Yes. It's a very dire situation, but a certain person...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
010	He told me that dragons, who can only live in the purist of places, live in Saga. He said that I might be able to find a way to remove the curse here.
011	I want to do everything that I can to find a cure...so that the men and women of Lustburg can live together!
012	Even though we come from different countries...our desire to improve the future of our countries is the same...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
013	Right, Tina?
014	I'm hungry.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
015	Huh...?
016	You still can't let your guard down? Don't you understand that she's not even from this country?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
017	It's nothing to do with that. I haven't eaten anything in a while. I can't help it that I'm hungry.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
018	Oh, that's right! Here. Eat this!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
019	...? What...is this?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
020	It's chocolate. I brought it along to keep me company.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
021	Cho...what's that?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
022	I think it's a foreign sweet. How about you take some?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0009
023	...It doesn't contain poison, does it?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
024	Come on! Why would I want to poison you?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1007
025	...It...smells sweet...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
026	Munch...
027	...How is it?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
028	!!!
029	What is this?! I've never eaten anything like it before!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
030	Munch...wh-whoaa!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
031	Do you think she likes it?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
032	Heh. It appears so. Well then, it looks like we're entering the center of the village. Let's take a short break.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0007
