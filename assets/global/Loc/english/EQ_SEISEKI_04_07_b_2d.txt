001	Captain Yauras, about that story right now.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
002	How the late Captain Cadanova was your rival.
003	Yes. He was. That man provided me with the sensation of complete defeat for the first time in my life.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
004	He made me experience it so furiously that I felt I couldn't beat him in anything.
005	It was a one-sided rivalry, but I chased after him. My desire not to lose to him has spurred me on to this day.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0020
006	Even with his ability to become Lord Commander...
007	He gave that position to Lord Zain and always stood in the frontlines as Captain.
008	... ...
009	I can no longer catch up to that back. But, still, I continue to fight.
010	If I stop fighting for even a moment, I will never be able to win against him...that's how I feel.
011	I see...
012	I-I'm sorry.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
013	Huh?
014	Kanon?
015	Captain Cadanova tried to protect me, and in the act lost his life. If only I hadn't pulled on his leg...oh.
016	Seriously, you really are a naughty child. What did you learn from Cadanova?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
017	Huh...?
018	Always discard hesitation, hold a strong heart. He used to say that a lot, right?
019	...!
020	Kanon...no one thinks that it's your fault.
021	It's quite normal for a Paladin to die in battle.
022	Everyone lives under that destiny. Stop being hard on yourself.
023	Captain Yauras.
024	If you want to become strong, then discipline and train yourself.
025	Strength is something that should be achieved through hard discipline.
026	Didn't he teach you that it was dangerous to just seek power?
027	Yes! It's true...he did say that.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
028	... ...
029	What's the matter?
030	The search for power creates an opening for evil to enter.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	Captain Yauras...can I ask you one last question?
032	Was that maybe the reason why Captain Kudan wasn't called on?
