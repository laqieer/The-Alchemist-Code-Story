001	Captain Yauras! You got a sec?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
002	So, I get that our mission is in Wadatsumi, and we're gonna follow Kagura and Lord Zain into a cave and whatnot.
003	However, it caught my interest that, amongst the captains gathered, Captain Kudan's name alone wasn't listed.
004	Is he busy with some other mission? Oh man, or did they just totally forget to call him? We aren't far from port, ya know. There's still time to send him a message.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
005	Are you at it again? I don't have time to explain now, so I'm gonna have you be quiet for a while.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
006	Huh? Wha—?! Holy Paladin prayers, did the illustrious Captain Yauras just...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
007	You seem to have calmed down a little. Seriously...you're quite the rowdy child.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
008	Captain Yauras...ya mind if I ask one last question?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
009	Captain Kudan was really into saying...
010	He wanted power. He wanted absolute power that could surpass any other in the world.
011	Um... So, is that somehow related to all this?
012	He himself seems to be trying his best to suppress it, but...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
013	It's too dangerous to let Kudan in his current state touch the darkness.
014	Okay, right... I get ya. There's a possibility that it'll cause Captain Kudan to lose balance within himself.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
015	Yes. The reason why Lord Zain removed Kudan from this task was all for his own sake.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
016	Ya mean that a freaking huge darkness exists within Wadatsumi right now, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
017	I'm sorry to bother you while you're engaged, but we're almost out of the forest. After that, once we cut through the plains, we'll be at the rendezvous point.
018	Oh, the monsters are here to welcome us. Everyone, get into fighting positions. Hurry!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0015
