001	...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0006
002	Nice! You're really holding your own against Celis!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0046
003	But it's still not enough! What is it I'm missing?! It's just not quite coming together!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
004	I don't have time to waste here. I need to master Kagutsuchi now!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0021
005	You've already mastered the technique's form. The fact that you could land a hit on me at all is proof of that.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
006	But then why does it still feel so unwieldy to me?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0021
007	Because there is indeed still something you're missing. I could tell while we were exchanging blows.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
008	Do you know what it is?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
009	The thing I'm missing?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
010	You said it yourself. You don't yet know what burden it is you're supposed to bear. In other words...
011	It's because the everyday lives of yourself and those you wish to protect have so little overlap. This power, and the things it stands to defend, all still feel completely foreign to you.
012	...!
013	I see. Logi did say something to that effect earlier, but I'd thought nothing of it.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
014	It's not too surprising. You were brought to Wadatsumi very suddenly, and had a mass of information and expectation immediately thrust upon you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
015	And though your wish to protect this place is genuine, you don't know what it is you're protecting. It's this contradiction that dulls your blade.
016	But...then what am I supposed to do?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
017	Perhaps...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
018	There's only one thing you can do. One simple, yet utterly crucial thing.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
019	What is it?
020	Having lunch with us.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
021	Uhh...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
022	Of course, it takes a fair bit of preparation for that! So you'll have to bear with me for a bit.
