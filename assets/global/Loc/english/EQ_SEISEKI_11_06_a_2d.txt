001	Wh-what was that attack...? I can't catch his movements at all...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0042
002	Nngh... Different dimension...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
003	What...?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
004	Earlier... That fool was babbling on...about having the power of a different dimension...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
005	The power of a different...dimension?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0026
006	That's just...what I remember him saying. Take it or leave it... Nngh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0020
007	Zahar!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
008	This is your end!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
009	Hrgh...!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
010	S-Spica!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
011	Spica!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
012	You... You didn't even try to protect yourself. Is this man so important to you?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
013	L-Lord...Zahar...? He's...the only...master...for me...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0042
014	I-if...it m-means...saving him... Then my...l-life...is a small p-price...to pay...
015	...!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
016	Such loyalty from a disciple! How sad that this is the end of your journey together!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
017	N-no!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
018	What...? Is the ground...shaking?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
019	It seems that Greed Dike's army has begun its siege.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
020	I must...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
021	Must what? You cannot do anything until you get past me...and you won't.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0014
022	Ack...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
023	No. Acht, Neun... You go reinforce the Greed Dike army. I will wrap up our business here.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
024	What are you trying to do?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
025	We have to take advantage of this moment and destroy the Holy Guard's strength from the inside.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
026	Is it not also our duty to clear the path for our master before he arrives?
027	So...you're just going to take all of these people on yourself?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
028	Look at them. Do you think I will have a problem with two wounded ghosts and a single Lord Commander surrounded by little girls?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
029	I suppose you have a point. There's no real need for all three of us to be here. Shall we go, Acht?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0031
030	It is our duty to attend to such matters before Sol arrives, but... Hmph. Well, even something such as this must be within your abilities.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0045
031	Where...? No! I won't let you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
032	Time Funeral!!!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
033	Wha—? Yikes!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
034	Didn't you hear? They left you to me. Or were you volunteering to die first?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
035	N-neither Zahar nor Captain Cadanova could defeat him in a sword fight! There's no way I can do it!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
036	Hmph. I don't even need to bother crossing swords with you. You're done.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
037	B-behind me?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
038	I have a lot of other things to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to start getting to them!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
039	Mistress!!!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
040	Ngh...!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0018
041	Captain Cadanova?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
042	You used your own body to protect her... What a waste of effort.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
043	Captain Cadanova! Are you all right?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
044	Urgh... I can't believe you learned nothing from me.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
045	Huh?
046	Did I waste my time with you? What are you doing shaking in your boots like a child?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0029
047	...!
048	Kanon... This is your final test. If you are truly a Paladin of the Holy Guard, forget everything but what you need to protect the peace of this world.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
049	Forget everything but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
050	It is not only strength that determines the outcome of a battle, but also heart! You should know this as the Lord Commander!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
051	!!!
052	That's...right... Captain Monzein, Captain Yauras, Captain Othima, and Seida, too...
053	They trusted that I would do this... That I would take all that they have done, and stand strong in the face of destruction!
054	Ack... I let my guard down, but...I've got this!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
055	I don't know what to do with you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
056	Suzuka, hurry to the Royal Palace! I need you to go reinforce the Emperor's guard! The enemy is probably making their way onto the palace grounds as we speak!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
057	What?! Mistress, what are you—?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
058	I'll be fine! I won't lose to the likes of him! Believe me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
059	What did you say?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
060	You...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
