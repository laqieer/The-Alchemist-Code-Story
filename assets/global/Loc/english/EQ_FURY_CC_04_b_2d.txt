001	What...am I doing...?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_battle_0019
002	Aren't you going to run?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
003	I can't leave Ikasa behind!
004	H-hey!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
005	We made a promise!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
006	Button!
007	Sorry.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0036
008	Gah! Haa...ngh...rrgh!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0022
009	Off with her head.
010	Swift decapitation means only a split second of suffering. So don't come back and haunt me, okay?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
011	You probably would've put up a better fight if you hadn't been trying to protect that shrine maiden.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
012	But you did get me to lose sight of her. 'Course, she'll stand out in that getup. I'll just have to be patient.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
013	Wh-what the hell?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
014	Clearly, I did the right thing.
015	Didn't I kill you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
016	Guess not.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0010
017	Who are you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
018	I'm a Paladin; a knight of the Holy Guard. A knight who lives to protect her princess, who is now her king.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
019	Y'know what? I know I asked, but I don't care. It doesn't really matter who you are.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
020	Heh. Well, I forgot how to die a long time ago.
021	You've got nowhere left to run!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
022	So long as Ikasa is by my side, I can go anywhere!
023	Don't you see that Wadatsumi's true nature is in question here?
024	What are you talking about?!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
025	Wadatsumi took advantage of its distance from the continent and its cultural independence to give heretical power free reign!
026	H-heretical power? Leafah, I don't—
027	And yet you talk of another way—of a different sort of peace. What are you playing at?!
028	Lady Leafah! Where are you?! We have received the order to return! We must leave, Lady Leafah!
029	R-run!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
030	Wh-what's going on?! I-I don't understand, Leafah! Please!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
031	Our journey will continue! We will travel around the continent, connecting with those we meet!
032	I want to learn more about this world! I want to spread the teachings of my homeland, and bring that peace back home with me to Wadatsumi!
033	If I can do that, this world will be connected by true peace! Wadatsumi will become a part of the world at large!
034	What are you talking about?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
035	Isn't this just a quest for revenge?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
036	R-revenge?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
037	You keep talking about Wadatsumi...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
038	But Wadatsumi is gone.
