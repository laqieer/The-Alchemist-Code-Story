001	Some time later...
002	Hmph! I was half-afraid you would back down, then I would have gotten changed for nothing!
003	I'm not one to turn down a challenge I can easily win. I hope you're ready to face what Eira and I have in store.
004	You sure can talk big! Well, Morrigan and I are ready to show you how wrong you are!
005	I'm sorry Eira, but I'm won't be going easy on you this time!
006	Eira... fight!
007	Well it looks like our participants are all fired up! And it seems all this talk has everyone's appetite fired up as well!
008	Without further ado, let the competition begin!
009	Yeahhhhh!
