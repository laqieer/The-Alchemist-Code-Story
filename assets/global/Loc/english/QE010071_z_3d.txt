001	Sabareta! So you've brought the Demon here after all!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
002	It appears the other one was destroyed by your brother, but I doubt you'll be so successful this time.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
003	Dias was able to stop it! I promise I will stop it as well!
004	That one was destroyed before its activation was complete; don't overestimate your odds.
005	We've revived this one with Philosopher's Stones formed by generations of Wratharis blood.
006	In other words, you stand no chance of standing against it.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
007	Tsk! Why would you do such a thing?!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
008	For the restoration of Wratharis, of course.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
009	With the Demon in our hands now, it is no longer a pipe dream.
010	After enduring repeated violations, we will deliver a crushing blow of wrath to this world!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
011	Don't be an idiot! Do you think you can use fear and power to revive your homeland?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
012	How dare you speak of such things. Wasn't it your kingdom who used the forbidden art to destroy our homeland?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
013	You speak so righteously. However, Envylia does not even attempt to hide the sins they've committed using power and fear.
014	I...can't answer that right now...but...if we try to work together...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
015	Don't make me laugh!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0015
016	Taste our revenge. We'll return the heinous deeds you've done to our country ten-fold.
017	We will destroy Envylia and on its ashes, we will build a new Wratharis!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0009
018	Stop!!!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
019	Whoa...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
020	Th-the ground is trembling! Sabareta, is that you?!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
021	N-no! Has the Demon began moving on its own?!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0020
022	What?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
023	Agh!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0013
024	W-wait! Ack. Agatha?! I need to save Agatha!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
