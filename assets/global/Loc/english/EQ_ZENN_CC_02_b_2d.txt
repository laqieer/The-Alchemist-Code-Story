001	That should have been a fatal wound.
002	What...?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
003	Oh, good. You're finally awake. Well, you can go. You're all healed up, without even a scar to tell the tale of your battle.
004	What happened to me?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
005	Oh? Don't you remember?
006	A ruthless demon samurai who sheds neither blood nor tears felled you, and brought you to me.
007	Th—	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
008	I can't bear to look at him. A cold-blooded killer who can run an ally through with his katana without the slightest hesitation... His is the true face of evil. Begone from my sight, devil!
009	I-I was using the back of my blade.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
010	Oh? And I suppose that cut got there all by itself, did it?
011	I-I managed to hold back with everyone else! But Na Zhu's blow was too heavy... I had to.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
012	Hmm...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
013	I'm sorry? You "had to"?
014	We—	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
015	Here I thought you were a warrior of some skill, but it would seem you aren't worth much after all. You might have the look and study of a samurai, but you haven't a whit of the honor!
016	Bu—
017	Apologize at once!
018	T-to who?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
019	To Na Zhu, of course! It's only common decency to apologize when you hurt someone. Haven't you any manners to speak of?
020	I'v—	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
021	Of course not! You only put effort into your work, don't you?
022	...
023	You're a disgrace!
024	I... I am sorry.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0036
025	Good. Was that so difficult?
026	...
027	Na Zhu?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
028	Don't push yourself on his account. You lost a lot of blood.
029	You...treat the soldiers?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0002
030	As best I can, yes.
031	You're incredible.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
032	How sweet of you to say.
033	When he struck me...I thought for sure I was a goner.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0011
034	See?!
035	I said I'm sorry...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0004
036	I owe you my life.
037	Oh, don't be silly.
038	How can I ever repay you?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
039	That won't be necessary. This is my job, you know. You just keep doing yours, stay healthy, and stay safe. That's all the thanks I need.
040	Thank you. I won't forget this.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0034
041	You're very welcome.
042	Hey. Boss.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
043	Yes?
044	I-I won't lose to you again.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0003
045	...
046	It's your turn now. Come on. Show me your wounds.
047	Th-they're fine. Don't trouble yourself with me.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
048	I suppose humans do heal naturally. It takes time, but eventually you end up more or less the same as you were originally.
049	However, that does not mean you shouldn't be healed. There is still the risk of infection, after all. Now, show me.
050	Incredible... It's like the wounds were never there.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0046
051	This is why I was bought for such an exorbitant price. The healing powers of shrine maidens make us worth our weight in gold many times over.
052	This is a kind of magic, isn't it? I've heard of it. You use your magic rites to...materialize things.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0016
053	I have been tasked with healing soldiers wounded on the field of battle.
054	It may seem a simple art...but it is not.
055	What do you—?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
056	Ack! Hrgh... Nrgh!
057	M-Mitsu!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
058	Our magic rites utilize a form of spiritual projection. We can materialize health and bestow it unto others by carving their wounds into our own spirits.
059	If overused... Well. It takes its toll, as you can see. It weakens us, both body and spirit.
060	You've lost a lot of weight.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
061	Indeed... If war were to break out on a grand scale, I would not last a day.
062	This is why I am a sacrifice. I am the frail wheat, destined to feed the mighty soldiers of war.
063	...
064	It is my duty.
065	I...can't see you anymore.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
066	What?
067	I won't be sustaining any more wounds for you to treat.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
068	...
069	Hmhm... Tee hee!
070	Wh-what?! Why are you laughing?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0047
071	Oh, no, it's nothing. Hee hee. That's very good of you. I'll only wither faster if I have to keep healing you up, after all.
072	R-right. But...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
073	Yes?
074	P-perhaps I could still come and see you...if it's just a little scrape?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
075	Pfft... Hahaha!
076	Wh-what's so funny?!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
077	Nothing, nothing. Only that you're quite pathetic.
078	Wh—?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
079	And a coward, to boot.
080	Ho—
081	You're meant to be the head of Imperial Security, are you not?
082	Can't you come and see me without a pretext?
083	I-I am not a coward.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
084	You once asked me if there was anything I desired.
085	And? Have you thought of something?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
086	I would like a bouncy ball.
087	You mean one of those colorful cotton ones that children play with in Wadatsumi? What do you want one of those for?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
088	Why don't you find out yourself?
089	I-I... Um...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
090	Hmhm...
091	Come visit me again, won't you? You have your pretext now.
092	Welcome back, boss!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
093	What the—?!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0026
094	I don't mean to be rude, but it seems you're really quite hopeless when it comes to anything outside work.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
095	Ho—
096	I don't know how many centuries that pile of washing was there for, but I was worried it was about to gain sentience, so took care of it for you. I've given the whole house a good spring-clean, too, from top to bottom.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
097	Wh—
098	Dinner's ready when you are! I've had a little taste, and it's delicious, if I do say so myself.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
099	Wh-what's going on?
100	Oh! Didn't I mention? From this day forth, I, Na Zhu, shall be your roommate!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0003
101	R-roommate?!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
102	This is...really good.
103	Don't worry, boss! I promise I'm not here to murder you in your sleep.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
104	I...wasn't worried about that.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
105	When I challenge you, it will be from the front, D. Lily style!
106	Hmm... Perhaps this detached lifestyle is the secret to your strength?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
107	I-I doubt it.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
108	Ahh, then it must be that your selfless devotion to your duty leaves you with no time to focus on anything else!
109	Th-that's not it.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
110	No? Then you threw it all away, for the cause!
111	I can't cook like this.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
112	Perhaps, but you can make someone's life flash before their eyes. I would know.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
113	We're alike.
114	O-oh?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
115	You remind me of...my younger self.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0007
116	I-I do?!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
117	The purity of your devotion to this country... Your willingness to serve.
118	Aha! Then you, too, are a patriot!
119	You want to defeat me?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
120	Then hold on to that heart of yours, Na Zhu.
121	Wh-what do you mean?
122	I can tell by the way you handle your blade that you've been training diligently, for a long time. Your swordsmanship is...superb.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
123	L-look, I'm not good at this kind of thing, but...you're already strong, Na Zhu.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
124	So you should go. You don't want to be like me.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0050
125	Oh, but I do!
126	Please, let me stay with you.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0041
127	I want to hear you praise me like that again.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
128	That whelp really is something, isn't he?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
129	Indeed.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0004
130	He's been after your position from the very start. He made that clear to me during our first meeting. Of course, I quickly realized he didn't have what it takes.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
131	Maybe not now...but in time, I'll have to watch my back.
132	True... Sometimes I feel like I'm looking at a copy of your younger self. He's just as reckless as you were. I plan to hold on to him.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
133	Anyone who makes me think I can count on them to do what needs to be done—whatever needs to be done—is valuable to me.
134	And right now, I know I can count on you most of all.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
135	I...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0033
136	You are a tool with infinite possibilities. Few hearts lie outside the range of your blade. You are as essential to me as a lion's claws are to its hunt.
137	Yes... You will be indispensable to me as I expand my path of conquest.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
138	I suppose that means I am quite...dependent on you.
139	I am...flattered, my lord. Your words do me great honor.
140	As such...there is something you must know.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
141	What is it, my lord?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
142	We are going to war.
143	What?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
144	We have a shrine maiden who can heal our soldiers up good as new, no matter how badly injured they are. Her abilities are too miraculous to waste.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
145	So we are going to invade Wadatsumi.
