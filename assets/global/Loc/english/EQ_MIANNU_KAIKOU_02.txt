001	Ohh... I messed up again.
002	At the very least, I want to stop messing up.
003	Since the time I worked at the magic laboratory, I caused problems for a lot of people.
004	I was only able to stay in the laboratory because of old man Decel and my other colleagues who believed in me.
005	That laboratory's been closed down and is gone now.
006	When Envylia was invading Wratharis...
007	Old man Decel died and the laboratory shut down right after, due to financial difficulties.
008	I'm sure a magic laboratory will benefit you as well as the future of all!
009	That's why I want to become an Archmage and rebuild it.
010	As my first step towards becoming an Archmage, will you help me increase my strength?
011	All right! I'm going to reassemble the basics of magic theory in my head.
012	If I do this and then do that...huh? What's this?
013	I feel like I just caught a glimpse of the laws of magic!
014	Um! Will you let me perform magic on you one more time?
015	This time, I won't mess up!
016	Really? Hooray! Thank you so much!
017	I, Mianne, future Archmage, will do my very best! Get ready!
