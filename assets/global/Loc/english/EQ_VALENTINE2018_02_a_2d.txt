001	N-now that I think about it, the textbook did say that the Rainbow Cacao drew monsters to it...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
002	Oh, really? You still remember that?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
003	Well, anyway... You see why it's better to have more people available to fight, just in case.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1015
004	As you can see, this is the genuine article! The young ladies just can't get enough of this stuff either!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
005	Young ladies and monsters aren't exactly equivalent things, but I suppose you're not wrong...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0045
006	Yes!!! I got my hands on some Rainbow Cacao! With this, we can make some fantastic chocolate!
007	Hmph. If you're going to give it to who I'm thinking of, isn't the purple cacao the best choice?
008	Wha... What are you trying to say?! Rude! Come on, let's get going before this melts.
009	I'm pretty sure the cacao isn't going to melt.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
010	Ah, youth!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
011	Perhaps we ought to have stopped them from using the purple cacao...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
012	Back in the day, I used to make chocolate like that, too... I tried so many different recipes. I needed to be prepared just in case I met the perfect husband.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0048
013	Me too! My three friends and I used to make it together! It was so much fun..	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
014	So people have been enjoying Valentine's Day for generations! How lovely!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0045
015	I never said anything about enjoying it...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
016	It's fine, Albea! You still have plenty of chances to enjoy it to its fullest!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
017	You'll be making chocolate this year for your big brother again, right?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0010
018	H-hey! Nobody needs to know that!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
019	Valentine's, huh?
020	Noah, you're not done yet?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
021	Almost... Tsk. How could this get so disorganized? Despite all the trouble the school has gone through to number everything...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0036
022	Does that really matter? I mean, at least they're all on the shelf.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0001
023	That's not the issue here. It's about respect... Huh? What's that, Emma?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
024	Huh? The chocolate?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
025	The chocolate...? You know that food and drink aren't allowed in the library. Chocolates and sweets aren't allowed on the Academy campus at all!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
026	Eh, it's not a big deal. What's with you today, Noah? You seem kind of out of sorts.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
027	Huh? You mean about Valentine's? Ugh. It's just another ridiculous holiday. Such a waste...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
028	Here.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0010
029	Mmph...?! W-what the?! You can't just go shoving chocolate into people's mouths like that!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
030	I like that one a lot. Isn't it delicious?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
031	I mean, it is pretty good, but that's not the point!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
032	Come on, hurry up. I'll even help you out.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
033	What is with you?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
034	Now that I think about it, you were always bringing chocolates and stuff onto the Academy grounds...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
035	Chocolates and sweet snacks like these aren't going to hurt anyone. Like I said, it’s not a big deal.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
036	Not a big deal? Emma, it's against the rules! You know that!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
037	Oh, Noah. You're such a stick in the mud.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
038	The two of you really are close, huh...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
039	Right?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
040	You there! What are you doing? There's a monster on the loose in the school!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0012
041	No way! In the school?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
042	Oh no! We'd better get over there quickly!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0027
