001	And with that, the chores are done.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
002	It's almost time for Benika to arrive.
003	I never expected to be able to spend time with my sister like this again.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
004	There's no happier time for me than this.
005	But what should I do now? Do I continue walking the same path as I did in the past?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
006	Relive the future where I lose Benika and this region and become the sole survivor once again?
007	There is a chance I could save my sister.
008	However...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
009	That would mean betraying all the history that is to come.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
010	All the battles the world has seen up until now; the tomorrow that the people grasped for by enduring pain and suffering.
011	Do I really intend to take that from them?
012	Huff...huff... Oh...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0016
013	Are you all right, Benika?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
014	I can't...run anymore... Go on...without me, Yna...
015	Tch!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
016	What should I do? I... I...!
017	What is troubling you, Yna?
018	Master! Were you eavesdropping on me?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
019	No. I was just passing by. Although...
020	As your teacher, I have one piece of advice for you.
021	Advice?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
022	You are too kind. Naive, even.
023	...
024	Listen closely, Yna. The moment you concern yourself with the fates of others is the moment you will no longer be able to save them.
025	Know that no matter how strong you become, there's only so much you can protect.
026	That is why you must forget. Forget everything except what you want.
027	Do only what you feel you must do.
028	And believe that others are doing the same.
029	But, that is...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
030	That is all I wanted to say.
031	It is almost time for your sister to arrive. Go out and meet her.
032	Right...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
033	I must go meet with Lord Kubera. If you are finished with your tasks, you may do as you please.
034	Thank you, Master.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0034
035	There is no need to thank me.
036	Even my strict master is worried about me... I must seem rather desperate.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
037	But I...
038	What should I do?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
039	U-um...! Good afternoon!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
040	Scrah! Scrah!
041	Good job getting here, Benika. Master is not here today, so there's no need for you to be so nerv—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
042	Benika, who is that?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
043	Oh, um, I found him passed out in town and...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
044	Nimul?! Why is he here, in this time?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
045	Oh, is he a friend of yours? That's great! Looks like it was a good idea to bring him here.
046	That's a serious wound. Sorry, Benika, but could you boil some water?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
047	Y-yeah, of course!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0004
048	.........
049	.........
050	Well then, let's treat your wounds first.
051	Uh... Here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
052	So, you're awake, Nimul.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
053	Eh? Yna!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
054	From how you're acting, it seems you are somehow the very Nimul I know.
055	Which means, you must also be...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
056	Yes. the one who practiced techniques with you and went on a journey with you to defeat Cursed Beasts was me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
057	I see. I'm relieved!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
058	But...aren't you a little...young to be my Yna?
059	I was young in the first place...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
060	Ow!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
061	This wound... You fought Avaritian soldiers, didn't you?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
062	Yes, I was careless. The people of this region are strong.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
063	It's a strength obtained by making a great many trade-offs.
064	Their strength is the natural result of their stripping themselves of weakness.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
065	But more importantly, why are you here?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
066	Quence's Space-Time Manipulation. We failed at stopping him and were dragged into the ways of time.
067	As to what happened after... Sorry, but I'm unsure of what happened.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
068	I...see.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
069	But never mind that now! Listen, Nimul...
070	This region will be destroyed soon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
071	What did you say?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
072	The blade my master Roh Ku smithed, the Dragonslayer...
073	The battle between Mammon, and Lord Kubera, who obtained that blade, will lead to this region's destruction.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
074	So you must leave here quickly.
075	Dragonslayer...
076	First, we need weapons. Stronger, tougher blades.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
077	Start gathering soldiers ready for slaying a dragon.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
078	Yes, sir!
079	You heard him, soldiers! The time of our end, our final trial, is at hand!
080	But they will be doomed if they do that! Kubera found the gear components needed to take down a Cursed Beast!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
081	What?
082	We must hurry, Yna. To protect this region...we have to stop Kubera.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
083	Wait, Nimul.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
084	What is it, Yna?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
085	This is truly a rare opportunity.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0045
086	There is no other chance to save the Avaritia Belt.
087	However, that will change the past. It will negate the journey we will take hereafter.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
088	Is that all right with you? If that truly happens, will you truly be at peace with it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0003
089	Yna...
090	I myself wanting to save my sister... My hometown...
091	But I am afraid of what might happen.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
092	To fulfill my wish would mean I would have to sacrifice your futures.
093	Yna...
094	.........
095	Still, I will save this region.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
096	Nimul...
097	I have made many mistakes. And I will surely make more in the future.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
098	Life is a continuous chain of choices. One can never know if they made the right choice until it has already been made.
099	So, I have decided to do what I think is right at the current moment.
100	I've given up on worrying whether this is a path laid out by someone else, or what their intentions might be.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
101	I want to save all I hold dear. But if I save one person now, and because of that someone else is hurt...
102	Then I will save them as well! I will do it!
103	This ideal started as a dream between us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
104	In Sephira, at that workshop, we talked incessantly about the methodology of saving the world.
105	The time to change reality is nigh!
106	So let's do it once again. Just the two of us, here and now!
107	We will save this region! We'll disrupt the order of the world as it was decided by the gods—and create a new world!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
108	So, please... Help me, my friend.
109	Nimul...
110	All right.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
111	Ahhhhhhh!	VO_benika.benika_battle_0022
112	That voice...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
113	Benika?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
114	Surely the quality of this gear cannot let me down...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0042
115	Begone, human child. No matter how strong you may be, if your blade is cannot cut my flesh, it is meaningless.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
116	Damn you... Damn you!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0018
117	My blade cannot pierce it?! So, this is a Cursed Beast... This is Mammon!
118	Then we shall need stronger gear. Stronger components will be necessary.
119	I will forge the kind of gear that I will only make once in my lifetime—gear strong enough to bring down a god.
120	That day, I gained a purpose worth pouring my all into.
174	Cursed Beast Mammon, the pinnacle of all life in this region...
121	That disgrace, that powerlessness... I will never forget it. I could never have foreseen that the work I've trained to perfection would be unable to pierce any living beast.
175	How many nights have I spent in anticipation of killing that beast? But those nights are soon coming to an end as well.
122	Just a little longer...
123	My preparations are complete. I've poured all of my skill and fortitude into my technique.
124	Now, if only I could obtain the flesh and blood of a dragon...
125	Who are you?!
126	S-sorry! I'm looking for my brother...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0035
127	You are Yna's sister?
128	I'm Benika. And you must be Master Roh Ku.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
129	He's changing the forge water. Now is not the time to interrupt him.
130	Oh, yes, thank you.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0033
131	Skree!
132	Wait for a moment, Benika.
133	Y-yes?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0004
134	That beast... Where did you find it?
135	Huh? Oh... On this island.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
136	What?! It was right in front of my nose the whole time?!
137	Master Roh Ku?
138	Give that to me. We need the flesh and blood of that dragon.
139	Huh? Oh.
140	Skree skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
141	It is no mistake. It may be young, but this magil... It is, without a doubt, a dragon!
142	Master Roh Ku, please stop! It didn't do anything wrong!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0015
143	Life itself is not a sin, of course. Sin is something we humans must bear.
144	Hate my mercilessness and your weakness, my child. 
145	That feeling is what will make you stronger.
146	Stop it!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0014
147	Perhaps I am growing senile. It was my fault for leaving an opening while we were conversing.
148	You saw it, too, Lord Kubera?
149	Of course.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
150	Are you certain that small beast is a dragon?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
151	Indeed. If we obtain its flesh and blood, my work will be completed.
152	Gear powerful enough to cleave even sin. It must be completed.
153	Then there is only one thing I must do.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
154	Follow that girl.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
155	Yes, sir!
156	Haaa...haaa...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0016
157	Ah... Ungh...
158	Ah...eeek!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0022
159	It's me, Benika. What's the matter?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
160	B-brother...?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
161	Yna, who is this child?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
162	She's my sister. Her body has always been frail.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
163	Skragh...
164	It's thanks to her carrying you that helped us reunite.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0003
176	Is that so?
177	Then I must repay my debt to her.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
178	Nimul?
179	They're coming, Yna. We're surrounded.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
180	Huh?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
165	Weaponsmith Yna, and you, foreigner from another land...
166	We have been commanded to take that infant dragon. Hand it over quietly.
167	And if we do not?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
168	Of course we will take it by force, for that is the only law we follow.
169	Nimul, lend me your strength.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
170	Of course.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
171	I see. That's just what we wanted to hear.
172	Allowing something to be seized by force, without even a struggle, just isn't our way!
173	If we cannot compromise, we fight!
