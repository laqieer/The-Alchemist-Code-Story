001	Ugh! It's annoying how persistent they are. Anyway, back to the business at hand.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0030
002	Rahu... Wait.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0027
003	...
004	Noah? Is it...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
005	It's...completely smashed.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0018
006	B-but the chocolate's fine! Right?	VO_eve.eve_battle_0019
007	I'm sorry, everyone... There's no way I can fix my mistake by giving her a broken gift like this.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
008	All that's left is the smell of the chocolate... The smell of the green cacao of courage.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
009	I'm sure that it will give you the courage you need to repair your relationship with Emma.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
010	...
011	Just don't forget that it's not just about the chocolate, but also about what you want to convey to the person in question.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
012	...
013	Emma... Um... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said what I said. I hope that it's not a dealbreaker and that we can still be friends.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
014	...
015	So, um, I made you this! Chocolate! For someone who has been a good friend to me, who I hope will continue to be my friend for a long time to come.
016	...
017	Um...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
018	Interesting. I didn't think this would ever happen, let alone that you would be the first to extend the olive branch.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
019	Huh?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
020	I also have something to give you. Here.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0001
021	Wait... Could this be...?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
022	I made it with the orange cacao. It was kind of a trial to get the wrapping how I wanted it, but here you are!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
023	Emma, you also made chocolate?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
024	Yep! She was already doing it when we found her, so we got to help out a bit.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
025	It's kind of funny that the both of them ended up making chocolate for each other. The two of them really care about their friendship.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0009
026	Such good friends!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
027	Oh! Noah, look! The chocolate inside is completely fine! It’s not broken at all!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
028	You're...right.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
029	The wrapping you chose is just as stubborn and unyielding as you are. Haha!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0044
030	Excuse me? Well, haven't you gone a little overboard with the decorations on this chocolate that you gave me? How did you even manage to get all of these on here?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
031	Talent?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
032	Huh... I guess...compared to this, my chocolate must be...pretty boring...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
033	Umgf...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
034	S-slow down! You'll choke if you eat it that fast!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
035	Noah! What is this?! This chocolate is amazingly delicious! What's in it?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0024
036	R-really? It's good?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
037	Yeah! Here, have some!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
038	Umgf! I mean, it is pretty good, but...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
039	I actually think yours tastes better. Here, open up.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
040	Mmph! Hm... I don't know! I think yours is still better.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
041	No, yours is definitely better.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
042	Isn't it just that they think the best of each other? This is silly.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
043	But isn't it nice that they're friends again?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
044	Yeah, look at those smiles! Now, if you two are finished, the rest of us still have chocolate to make!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
045	Albea, you'll be making some as well, right? For I-know-who!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
046	I-I'm—	VO_albell.albell_sys_0047
047	Then let's go back to the home economics room! Come on, Albea!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
048	He-hey, wait! Don't just push me!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0027
049	I'm surprised you were willing to break the school rules to do something for me, Noah. Heh!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0047
050	Well, it's not like I'm a student here anymore.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
051	Besides, there's something that is more important to me than rules.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
052	What's that?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
053	Uh... Never you mind.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
054	No chocolate is more delicious than that eaten with the people you care about most.
