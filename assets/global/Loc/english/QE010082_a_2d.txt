001	I guess you and Dias are fighting separately now...
002	It was decided that we'd split up and search for you.
003	I went with the Blue Flame Guard to the ruins of Fort Mugarde...and Dias went with the Holy Guard to Fort Asard.
004	My actions seem to have caused trouble for all of you. I'm sorry...
005	You were too reckless... We were really worried, you know?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
006	That's why I'm apologizing! I said I'm sorry!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
007	Y-you seem more mad than sorry...
008	But, trying to broker peace between Envylia and Wratharis...that was "your own way of fighting," wasn't it?
009	Yes. I really believe it's possible. Let's do what we can to make it a reality!
010	Heheh. I want to hurry up and show Dias how well you are.
011	Dias... Do you think he's okay?
012	Huh? Why?
013	Dias has a tendency to be impatient when it comes to becoming stronger. I'm worried he might go too far.
014	It's true he has that tendency, but he's always doing his best and looking to the future!
015	I'm sure he's okay!
016	I hope things can quickly go back to the way they used to be.
017	Huh?
018	Where father would scold Dias for not eating his breakfast...
019	And you would oversleep and make things even worse...
020	Then, I would ultimately have to appease father; I want to go back to those days.
021	Come on... Save the nagging for later.
022	That's not what I mean.
023	I'm just thinking how priceless those normal days were.
024	Especially now that things have become the way they are.
025	Yeah...
026	It's gonna be okay! If we can build peace between our countries, then things will go back to the way they used to be; I'm sure of it!
027	Yes!
