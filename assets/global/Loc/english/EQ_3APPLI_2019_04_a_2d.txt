001	He's turning into a perverted loon!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
002	Isn't this wonderful, Mira?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
003	Wonderful?! This is crazy, that's what it is!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
004	We needed battle power, didn't we? Why don't we take these girls home?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
123	Go home, right now!
124	They can talk?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
125	Hell yes! Just as I thought.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
126	They'll be our instant, immediate, right now firepower! An elite team of kunoichi who love me without question!
127	I'm in lurve!
128	Foolish, isn't it?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
129	Huh?!
005	I'm gonna take you home with me, Ragi-Boo.
006	What...is going on?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0013
007	Wh-what in blazes...?!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0026
008	Isn't that the girl who was with that giant monster?!	VO_thieff.thieff_sys_0025
009	Wanna fall...in lurve.
010	H-hm...?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0025
011	Don't care with who! Just wanna fall in lurve, normal love, be a normal girl!
012	So...shameless.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0017
013	Don't care what happens to me! Wanna fall in lurve right now! Just a normal love... Love, right now!
014	Love, right now... Now! Love!
015	Now, love! Now, love! Now, love!
016	Now, love! Now, love! Now, love! Now, love! Now, love! Now love!
017	What in the world...?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
018	I have heard of this.
019	Huh? R-really?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
020	There was one in my world who served my master alongside me; one of the Dark Killers. She was dressed just like this girl.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0018
021	What?!
022	To be clear, she was not like that brazen group of clones, but rather resembled this sensible Hiiragi here.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0004
023	Her name was Masamune, and this phenomenon...is a ninja technique!
024	Way of the Ninja—Shadow Clone!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0021
025	Sh-shadow clone?!
026	I have heard that it is a terrible and powerful technique. It creates countless duplicates, each terrifying in their aspect! All of you must flee at once. Quickly!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0018
027	C-countless duplicates?! That's...! Why, that's 'orrifying!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0028
028	Run! Run for yer lives! The Shadow Clones'll have yer bones!	VO_thieff.thieff_battle_0025
029	Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love!
030	Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love! Now love!
031	Oh, brother.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
032	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh! S-stop it! Stop it!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0027
033	Without a doubt! Now love! Wanna fall in lurve! Without a doubt! Now love! Wanna fall in lurve!
034	At least their vocabulary is increasing.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
035	S-stop it! Stop talking like that! N-not when you look like me! I'm going to die of embarrassment!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
036	I never feel up to anything until after the sun goes down, myself.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0030
037	I know that voice. That's...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
038	It is only when night has fallen that I feel ready to unleash my powers to their fullest.
039	Yomi!
040	Do you know her?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
041	She's an ancient samurai! I summoned her once before, and she lent me her powers. How did you get here, Yomi?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
042	I was here first, you know, but the sun was still high in the sky, so I didn't want to move.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0007
043	I didn't expect things to get so...chaotic.
044	Just normally! Now lurve! Want a lover! Anyone! Don't care who! Want a lover!
045	This is absurd. Utterly absurd.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0017
046	I can't take much more of this!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
047	Hiiragi... How inelegant.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0030
048	N-no! It's n-not me! You're wrong! I'm not like that!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
049	I know. It was just a little joke. I've lived a long time. Such things are obvious to one such as I.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0008
050	I'll bite...! How old are you, Yomi?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
051	According to my estimations, that... Hmm... For convenience's sake, let us call them a stampede of Hiiragi—	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0031
052	Don't ignore me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
053	I am a girl of seven years.
054	What the—?! You're younger than me!
055	As I was saying... That stampede of Hiiragi is likely an aggregation of the postmortem regrets of the original individual, twisted and corrupted.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0045
056	Wh-what?!
057	Let me love you! Let me be normal!
058	P-postmortem...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
059	Hiiragi has died once in her world.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0004
060	It's already so late, at this point, I don't care who I date!
061	What? She looks pretty alive to me.
062	She broke the Kunoichi Code which forbade romance, and was sent to the underworld. She was ostensibly revived, however, thanks to the efforts of her friends.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0016
063	Yet, unbeknownst to her, Hiiragi had brought with her a plethora of corruption.
064	Thanks to the meddling of you twins, Hiiragi's corrupt regrets became muddled with otherworldly powers and desires, and were made manifest.
065	The fact that she was unable to fully cleanse herself in the hot spring before she was dragged into this mess is likely part of the problem.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0045
066	I'm gonna fall in love, just normal love!
067	Even I, a samurai, would have to say that I am heavily influenced by desire and corruption. Yet that is why I was able to realize all of this and avoid being wholly drawn into this turmoil myself.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0007
068	Accordingly, it is plain to me that these foolish ramblings are not truly reflective of Hiiragi's innermost desires, but are instead twisted and corrupted versions of them.
069	Hmm... I have lain underneath the warm sun for too long today. I feel rather dizzy... You will have to clean this mess up by yourselves.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0004
070	What?! No! Yomi, please!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
071	Come here, Ragi-Boo. You can fall for me; I'll catch you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
072	Lurve...
073	This isn't me! This isn't how I feel! S-stop using my face like this! I'm going to die of embarrassment! I'm going to die...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
074	Right?! Now you see why I went on that rampage back there! I couldn't stand it!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
075	Hiiragi... Mira... I owe you both thanks.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
076	You snide little brat! Come here, I'll wipe that smirk off your face for you!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
077	From our first battle with the Lovesickness, I understood.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
078	Nyx, you pervert!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
079	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0001
080	Huh?! What was that?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
081	Can't you hear that?
130	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0001
131	I knew it. That thing sure is persistent...and loud.
132	I perceived a whirl of voices around the creature, and slowed time down so that I could listen to them.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
133	I heard snatches of things like "I want to fall in love" and "I want to be a normal girl."
134	Wh-what?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
135	These are things that you desired, aren't they? I granted you your wish! And then what happened?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
136	The Lovesickness sought me out and manifested, like this, for me! Now I don't need you anymore, Hiiragi.
137	Wh-what? B-but...why?
138	I hate talkative girls.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
139	H-huh?!
140	Besides, better to be loved by some than one!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
141	Chicks love the mother who feeds them their first mouthful, don't they?
142	When I saw the Lovesickness, I realized that in the near future this composite body, a concentration of her innermost thoughts and feelings, would come to imitate the kunoichi herself.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
143	So I considered what I could feed her, and endeavored to have her imprint her love onto me.
144	I found myself fantasizing... Ooh, I could make my very own harem! I could have girls wait on me hand and foot!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
145	Why you little...! Nyx! I don't remember raising you to be such a slovenly pervert!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
082	Eheheh! Ohh, Ragi-Boo! Thank you for falling in love with me!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
083	Hrrrrrnnngghhh! L-love?! Who gives a damn about love?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0017
084	You're not acting like yourself at all, little bro.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
085	Oh? You think so?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
086	You made all these crazy decisions without even pausing to rationalize them, for one! And the people you've roped into your scheme aren't happy! Just stop this already, will you?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
087	It doesn't look like my Ragi-Boo minds a bit, though.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
088	Your Ragi-Boo has nothing to do with this! This is a matter between us! Us, you got that?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
089	Can't handle a little competition?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
090	What're you talking about?!
091	Now love! Now love! Now love!
092	They're starting to sound like some kind of bird!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
146	It's just like that ghostly girl said. Thanks to our meddling, Mira, Hiiragi's corrupt regrets have become muddled with otherworldly powers and desires, and have been made manifest.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
147	Ragi-Boo got her fighting prowess from Almace.
093	But she got her recklessness from you, Mira.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
094	N-no way...!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
095	If it's to make my dreams of love come true, I'll do whatever I can for you! Confess my love, right here, right now! I really don't care who to!
096	Wanna fall in love right now! Just like a normal girl!
097	M-Mira... She sounds just like you.
098	You...!
099	All right, my Ragi-Boos! Let's clear out these interlopers, and form our paradise: Hiiragi Harem!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
100	Now love!
101	Yomi! Wake up! Please! My clones are attacking us! There are so many of them!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
102	Nngh... Being summoned multiple times, between multiple worlds, is just too much for me. I already told you I can't, and I meant it.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0030
103	Aaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
104	Almace...!
105	I think this'll do. We've cleaned up after Mira enough for one day.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
106	Ungh...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
107	There is still much to be done, and I am here to do it.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0030
108	I wanna fall in love, just normal love!
109	Nothing about this is normal.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0015
110	H-huh...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
111	At least, not from my perspective. How about yours, Hiiragi?
112	N-no... Not normal at all.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0005
113	I'm not going to let you interfere with my normal life. I will see normality restored...	VO_almace.almace_battle_0016
114	You tactless brat!
115	She's right, Nyx. You heard her.
116	Do you know how I feel, now?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
148	No, but I've gotten a taste of my own recklessness.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
117	I've just been letting you do all the thinking...but it's about time I started doing some, myself.
118	Didn't you just have a go at me for failing to rationalize things?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
119	Have you forgotten? I'm your older sister.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
120	Not to mention, we're twins. Of course I understand you.
121	So...you actually thought about my feelings for once, huh, big sis? About time.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
122	It is. That's why I'm going to right your promiscuous wrongs with sisterly love!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
