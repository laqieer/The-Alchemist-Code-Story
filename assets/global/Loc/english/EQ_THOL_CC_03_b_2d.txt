001	Do not misunderstand what justice truly is.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
002	Honestly...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
003	That one seemed to have detected the existence of Lost Blue on his own, but...
004	How self-righteous of him to demand a total revision of its society after such a pointless investigation.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
005	Lost Blue being no more would rob our friend Greed Dike of its assets.
006	Seeing as it holds several secret experimental facilities there, not to mention it provides access to assassins.
007	Lost Blue is simply too convenient a place to hide what you don't want seen. If such a place is brought into the light of day, then its connection to Greed Dike will also be revealed.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
008	Why do you target me so?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
009	You really don't know why?
010	Ngh!
011	Cadanova... An individual that is rather sensitive to the corruption of organizations.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
012	He tirelessly develops his strength for the purpose of some day purifying that corruption.
013	My path is a righteous one!
014	Phantom Karmacoma... Alchemy that does not require the use of the souls of the dead.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
015	The eternal duty of the Holy Guard...
016	That is to be unyielding in their faith in justice!
017	We cannot allow him to become any stronger.
018	That is our honor! That is the responsibility of those with power! That is the duty we have been charged with!
019	How admirable.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
020	What will happen if we botch this assassination?
021	If Cadanova falls, great. If he survives, well, it should be fine as long as he understands meddling with Lost Blue will have consequences.
022	That should keep him from reporting his findings to others. He wouldn't want to bring danger to his comrades, now would he?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
023	That's just how people like him are, isn't it?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0044
024	Heh, hahaha...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0011
025	A dragon soaring through the air and a unicorn galloping in the sky...
026	This is awesome...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
027	What I saw was like a scene from a legend playing out before my eyes. It was enough to reignite my passion for the sky. Once again, the sun shone in my eyes.
028	Have you honor?
029	I have my creed as a villain. Does that count?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
030	I'd like to hear more about that.
031	You wouldn't understand.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
032	Even so...
033	...
034	For the sake of reaching the sky.
035	I want to bring the bright blue sky, unobstructed by the veil, and without fear of being devoured by dragons, to the people of Lost Blue.
036	The bright blue sky...
037	Hm...
038	Is it not possible for us to walk the same path of justice?
039	Why would we be crossing blades at all if we weren't on different paths?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
040	I myself have never seen this Lost Blue, but I acknowledge its existence. I would like to save it if I can.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
041	While investigating the past of many assassins, I've caught a glimpse of this so-called Lost Blue. A place forgotten by history.
042	I would like to extend a helping hand from now on.
043	Not possible.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0016
044	Whose side are you supposed to be on?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
045	It's just a difference of perspective.
046	Lost Blue is a lost cause. Like you said, it has been forgotten by history and the world.
047	Even if its existence is revealed to the world, there are those who will immediately be culled and ousted.
048	No matter how hard the Holy Guard tries, there will be those who cannot be saved.
049	We will never know unless we at least make an attempt to—!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
050	You should learn from history.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
051	Those raised in the slums only know how to survive in the slums.
052	What?!
053	If denizens of Lost Blue are suddenly brought to live in the world above, they will only know how to make a living by stealing and killing. They will soon find themselves in another slum.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
054	Especially if their fate is left up to the Holy Guard, who depend on military might to champion their absolute justice. The Holy Guard cannot save Lost Blue.
055	You dare insult the Holy Guard?
056	It's just impossible to reform those who are drenched in the ways of the underground.
057	They monopolize authority, crush their enemies, and hide their secrets. Only fools blindly believe in justice, while being intolerant of any tinge of evil.
058	Fools? For some, justice is nothing more than the truth.
059	Certainly. Just as there are some whose truth is that justice doesn't exist.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
060	...
061	The only way for Lost Blue to be saved is for it to gain power strong enough to defeat the whole world.
062	Those of us who are twisted cannot bask in the light until the world has become twisted as well. That's the only way for us move forward.
063	And the first step towards that is this fight right here.
064	...
065	All right.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0037
066	So can we finish this?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
067	Would you mind giving me some time?
068	You're going to let me go again?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
069	The corrupt must be purged with fire. I know this to be true. It is the righteous way.
070	But the reform you dream of cannot occur abruptly. It must be realized gradually over time.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
071	A hasty revolution will bring ruin to the world. History has seen much devastation because of this.
072	...
073	Justice isn't that easy, huh?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0020
074	I'm glad you understand.
075	We may not understand each other, but I can at least give you time to prepare yourself.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
076	There's no way for us to come to an understanding, is there?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
077	The plot can't move along if good and evil compromise so easily, you know?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
078	...
079	I wish to ask you one thing.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
080	You've given me time. Ask anything.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
081	I can't return to my client without having assassinated you.
082	When you report to the Holy Guard, please tell them that you eliminated the assassins to the very last.
083	That will erase me from existence, and it should halt attempts on your life for a while.
084	I suppose I will owe you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
085	Just until we see whether you cleanse the corruption from this world, or if evil catches up to you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0003
086	There will be consequences if you don't keep up with what you owe.
