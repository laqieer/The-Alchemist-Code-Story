001	Argh! You'll pay for this, Detective!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
002	I wonder what he was even upset with in the first place.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
003	Um, thank you for your help. Who are you?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0031
004	Ah, my apologies. I'm Justin, one of the nation's Peacekeepers.	VO_justin.justin_chara_1008
005	Right now, I just happen to be chasing down a criminal called Chat Noir. Have you seen any suspicious...
006	...? Is something wrong?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
007	N-no! That being said, my dear lady! Perhaps it would be best if you covered yourself a little more!	VO_justin.justin_battle_0019
008	Do you think so? Does my outfit look bad on me?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
009	I-it's not a matter of that! It's that...I have a hard time knowing where to look!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0047
010	Oh, why is that? Would you please teach me what you mean by that?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
011	St-stop! I told you to stop! I can also have you brought in for public altercation!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0027
012	You're quite the exagger—
013	Ehem! In any case, what is a lady like you doing alone in a back alley like this? You seem to be a foreigner. Is there anyone accompanying you?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
014	No. I'm traveling alone. Is that odd?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
015	Dressed like that?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0025
016	What does my outfit have to do with anything?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
017	Hmm... Anyway! This isn't a good neighborhood so let me take you to the main boulevard.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
018	Are you going to walk with me? If so, I have a request I'd like to ask you...	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0009
019	Do you know where this city's toyshop is?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0002
020	...Huh?
021	All right, I've closed everything up and finished delivery preparation on orders. I've got my tickets and everything is ready.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0004
022	Finally got tickets to see the Envylia Orchestra. I'm really gonna enjoy it.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0007
023	Daisy, today I don't have time to...
024	Um... Excuse me. Do you have a moment?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
025	If I recall correctly, you’re the Peacekeeper...	VO_rish.rish_sys_0001
026	Justin. Ah, I wanted to ask if you're closed today.	VO_justin.justin_chara_1001
027	I'm sorry, but we are. I've got plans for the full day.
028	The time is a little inconvenient. There's something I wanted to ask you to repair today.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0030
029	...Who's that?	VO_rish.rish_chara_1009
030	She goes by the name Strie. Apparently, she's in the middle of her solo travels...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0004
031	An item of great nostalgia to me has broken and I came to this city wondering if I could have it fixed here.
032	That's unfortunate. However, today is an extremely important day in my life...
033	Wait, is that toy in your hand the one you want me to repair?
034	Yes, it is. Is it something very rare?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
035	I've never seen anything like it before.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
036	On top of that, it seems to be well used and has extensive traces of careful repair... It appears to have been greatly cherished.
037	Is it the inside mechanism that's broken? This...ack...I'll need to take it apart.
038	That being said, what's this engraving right here? Is it the maker's mark?
039	...! That engraving!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0006
040	Have you seen it before, Detective?	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
041	N-no, it's nothing. Recently, my investigation has been yielding little results and I've been somewhat on edge.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0047
042	Ah, I heard that you let Chat Noir escape again. You don't know when to give up, do you?
043	Ack!	VO_justin.justin_battle_0019
044	Well, will you take it on?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0031
045	... ...
046	I'll cancel my vacation. Having been shown something of this quality, it'll be a stain on my name as a toy maker if I were to send you away.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0038
047	Instead, are you willing to look after my shop while I'm taking on the repairs? This is gonna be quite the job.
048	The owner of this toy shop has taken custody of Chat Noir's package.
049	It is the perfect opportunity to take it. Yet...that detective's presence is an interference.
050	In that case, let's have our employee do a little work as well.
051	So why am I the one looking after the shop?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
052	Well, you got yourself involved, so isn't it good manners to see it through until the end?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
053	Well, that's true, but...I need to find the whereabouts of Chat Noir...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
054	Hey, how much is this toy?
055	The price tag is right there. Do you have money on you?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0005
056	Hey, this doll's hands came off! Can you please fix it!
057	All right, all right. All the toys you want repaired, you can place here along with your name and address.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
058	Okay!
059	... ...
060	...? Is there something on my face?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
061	No, I'm just surprised to see that you're good at looking after children, contrary to your outfit and mannerisms.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
062	Oh? Isn't it problematic if a detective were to judge people based on their appearances?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
063	Well...you're right. I'm sorry.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
064	Heheh. I was just teasing you. Don't worry about it.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
065	In my village, we all participate in taking care of the children.
066	That sounds like a nice village.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0005
067	Who knows? It's very small and closed off from the rest of the world. They're always averting their eyes from what's going on outside of their village.
068	That's why they've been left in the past and are no longer able to make strides forward.
069	...Hm.	VO_justin.justin_chara_1008
070	... ...
071	Hey, little boy over there! Show me what you just took right now.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0003
072	A-ah!
073	So you stole something. Listen, kiddo. What you did just now...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
074	Here you go. I paid and bought it for you.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_event_1008
075	Huh...are you sure?
076	Yes. But just today, all right?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
077	O-okay!
078	Strie!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0001
079	He wanted that toy and I wanted to buy it for him. See? There's no problem, right?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
080	But he won't learn his lesson then. Wouldn't you agree?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
081	If he did it with evil intent then he must be scolded.
082	However, scolding him alone might not help.
083	What do you mean?	VO_justin.justin_sys_0006
084	This shop is positioned right between the poor and rich districts.
085	It's true. Left of here, the district spreads out into a place called Real Heavy.
086	Redington City is a nice place...but there are those who suffer as well.
087	There are those who cannot find work, who have their dreams stolen from them, and who have children who cannot buy toys.
088	For them, in order to become happy, they must exhaust all means. Is that such a bad thing?
089	Still, whatever the reasons may be, stealing is stealing.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
090	Furthermore, we are trying to do everything we can rectify the problems of this city!
091	It's true that there are disparities that force even some of the residents of Real Heaven to have to leave.
092	Perhaps the result of that is Lost Blue..."the sunken city where light does not reach."<br>	VO_justin.justin_sys_0030
093	Lost Blue...?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
094	Oh, no, it's nothing! Please, forget what I just said.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0047
095	Well, fine. But doesn't your brand of justice eventually result in the severing of the weak?
096	Well, I'm doing my best to make sure that's not the case...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
097	Ch-Chat Noir has made an appearance?!
098	What?! Ack! There's no time to waste!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
099	Hey, wait?! Come on! We can leave the shop unmanned for a little while, right?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_chara_1001
100	Is that one of the prototypes for the Guard Droid?! But the way it's moving...has someone made it go rogue?
101	Is Chat Noir behind this? I heard he was a thief, but I guess he's good with his hands as well.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0030
102	No, this isn't him. He'd never do something like this.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
103	Heheh. From the way you just spoke now, there seems to be some kind of trust between the two of you.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
104	What?! Not at all! It's just...!	VO_justin.justin_battle_0019
105	He has his own aesthetic when it comes to stealing...that's all.
106	Heheh. I thought you just said, 'whatever the reason may be, stealing is stealing'?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
107	Agh. That's true, but...!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
108	Let's talk later! Right now, I need to handle this situation!
