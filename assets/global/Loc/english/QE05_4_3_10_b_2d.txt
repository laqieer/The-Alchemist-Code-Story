001	Hurgh...	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0022
002	Your Highness?!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0027
003	Finally... After all this time, I have the druidic priestess! With this, we can achieve all that we have ever dreamed! Ha...hahahahaha!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
004	Grng... Why...? How? I didn't...sense anything.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
005	I remember you; the girl from Saga. What was your name again? Mocca, was it? I must thank you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
006	If not for you, I would have never been able to find the priestess!
007	Wh-what?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
008	The Wind Ouija... A girl who hails from Saga... She who carries the curse of my brethren... I could smell your curse from across the ocean!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
009	Curse...? You could...smell...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
010	Yes... That curse of yours was like a beacon for the Jam such as us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
011	No matter how far you run, you cannot escape!
012	N-no!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
013	Release Marie, interloper!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0015
014	Urk...!	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0022
015	Hahahahah! Your futile efforts are entertaining, but ultimately in vain, little king.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
016	It was your own father who said, "The weak are nothing more than fodder for the strong!"
017	Ma...rie...	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0018
018	Give it up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0002
019	L-let...her...	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0019
020	Nngh... O Wind!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
021	Pitiful!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
022	Come, priestess. I'd rather not be here when the Protector sees fit to show up.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
023	No!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0020
024	Oh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
025	Agatha?! Armed with...a crossbow? Did you get that from the stronghold's armory?
026	That won't be enough! Normal weapons don't effect this enemy!
027	I can't just do nothing and let Marie be taken!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
028	Let her go!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0043
029	Eeek!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0025
030	Ah, I had forgotten. There was a more...ungainly one of you, wasn't there?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
031	Wh-what?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
032	Well, then. Come.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
033	No!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0020
034	Wh...?! What is this light?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
035	Get away from Agatha!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0009
036	Are you all right, Agatha?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
037	Logi?! I'm fine, but we have to save Marie!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
038	Got it!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
039	No! He's...using Marie as a shield?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
040	What?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
041	Hmph. So you survived and managed to make your way back here. How unfortunate.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
042	Your Highness! Are you all right?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_favorite_0001
043	How dare you put our king in this state, you cur!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0042
044	Hmph. This seems liable to become more trouble than it's worth. All I need is this one, disobedient little vessel, so I'll take my leave now.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
045	Wait!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0013
046	Hahaha! Pitiful child, if you want to save her so badly, why don't you come and find her? Hah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
047	We'll be waiting for you in the place where our malice was born, alchemists.
048	I won't just let you run away!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
049	Nngh! Not this again! If this is anything like what we saw at the castle—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
050	No, there are fewer than before! My Wind Ouija should be enough to wipe them out!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
051	You Highness, your injuries...!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_favorite_0001
052	It doesn't matter! What's more important is Marie—ah, my leg...	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0018
053	Your Highness! Somebody call a medic! Anyone else who is free should immediately begin investigating the casualties of the stronghold!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0042
054	Y-yes, sir!
055	I-I'm sorry. I... I couldn't do anything to help.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
056	You haven't done anything wrong, Agatha. We should have... If only... Dangit!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
057	Logi... Where is Sir Kamui?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
058	Ah... Well...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
059	He...stayed behind. To give us the chance to make it here. He's...still in the castle.
060	Wh-what?! Does that mean—?!
061	Ceclidis outsmarted us.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
062	But it's not over yet! There must be some way to stop him! I have to believe that!
063	The situation is dire, and only growing worse.
064	As the Jam cover the royal capital, the military forces of Gluttony Foss fight on in the desert, oblivious.
065	Meanwhile, the Liberation Army is divided and struggling to bounce back after the loss of their comrades. All is going according to the enemy's plan...
066	But as long as we still live, it isn't over yet.
