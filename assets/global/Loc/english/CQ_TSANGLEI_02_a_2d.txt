001	Gaaaah!
002	Hahahah! Taste my thunder!
003	Huzzah!
004	(Just as I thought, he's strong as hell!)
005	(Fighting him should help improve my skills significantly!)
006	You... Are you poaching in this forest?
007	Th-that's not us! I mean, I have heard that there are some, ah, ill-mannered louts around here. Maybe it's them you're after?
008	So none of you are poachers? Hmm...
009	Still, you bandits have disturbed the peace of this forest. I cannot forgive you for that.
010	Aaaaaaah!
011	...
012	That's it! Keep that fighting spirit going! Don't let go of it! Now fight me!
013	Hmph.
014	Aaaahh! No! You just had it! That oomph I was looking for! Don't you dare lose it now!
015	As I told you earlier, I do not take pleasure in fighting. Please go bother somebody else.
016	You think I'm just going to leave when there's a warrior like you standing right in front of me?! That isn't happening!
017	You're the first warrior I've met since gaining my freedom! I must fight you!
018	I can fight when and how I wish now! There is nothing better in this world than that!
062	To fight and win! That is everything a man needs in life!
019	Ugh...
020	I know! I'll help you find those poachers you're after!
021	But you must promise to fight me if I catch them before you!
022	Why would you go to such lengths to fight me? What do you intend to do by becoming more powerful?
023	What do I intend? I've never really thought about it.
024	I only wish to become more powerful because strength is justice. It's as simple as that. There's nothing else to it.
025	That's quite extreme. What is it that makes you believe this?
026	Experience. I was born with powerful magic within me; so powerful that I could barely contain it.
027	Because the magic would run wild from time to time, kids and even adults kept their distance from me. It was great.
028	No matter what I did, I was never chastised. They all knew that they were weaker than me!
029	You must have been a troublesome child.
030	What did you just—?! Well...yeah, I suppose I was.
031	My father threw me into a temple. Said it was for my own good.
032	I hated being held down by their precepts. I wanted to escape, but I couldn't. There was someone stronger than me there.
033	What, you want a piece of me, too?! Come on!
034	Such a pity. You've never had a proper lesson, nor have you ever received instruction as to how to control your power. Is this not so?
035	What?!
063	Poor child, your powers threw you off the path of righteousness and cost you your parents. Do you truly believe that winning fights will grant you the satisfaction you seek?
064	Of course! All I know is how to get what I want by winning it!
065	What you want, eh? Very well. It is my duty to provide guidance to lost souls such as you.
036	Poor, weak child, I will beat your misguided character back into shape!
037	Ugh, just thinking about that damn monk gets me all worked up. Always treating me like a child...
038	Yet you obeyed him.
039	He was stronger than me. It's power that makes people obey. Strength is justice!
040	He was stronger than me, so I obeyed. It's as simple as that.
041	No matter how many times I challenged him, I couldn't win.
042	He would look down on me after he defeated me and say, "An amateur who can't control his own powers can never win."
043	So I trained in that temple until I could control my powers. But then you know what he says?
044	You have learned how to control your powers, but you have still yet to come to understand the true meaning of strength. It is time that you broadened your perspective outside the temple.
045	I hate that damn monk! I feel like I'm being manipulated, like a puppet dancing in the palm of his hand!
046	You "feel like"? Isn't that exactly how it is?
047	Not anymore. I'm out of the temple. I'm free! I'm never going back!
048	You keep hollering about how you are free, but it does not seem that way to my eyes. That monk clearly still hovers over your every thought.
049	Urk!
050	Hm...?
051	What? What is it?
052	Hush!
053	Huh? What are they...?
054	...
055	Heheh, got one. The horns on this thing will fetch us a nice price indeed.
056	Is this little thing really worth anything?
057	Yeah. Small critters like this can be used for experiments.
058	Still, we don't have enough. Let's catch as many as we can before the guards catch on.
059	...
060	(This aura about him... He truly must be an exceptional warrior!)
061	I find no pleasure in combat, but sometimes there are things that one can only protect by fighting for them. That is why I wish to be strong.
