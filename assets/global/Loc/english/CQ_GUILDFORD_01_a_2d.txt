001	Heheh! This way! Catch me if you can!
002	Ack!
003	Are you all right?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0016
004	Eek! I-I'm sorry...
005	...
006	Lord Gilfred? Is something the matter?
007	No. Let's go.
008	Yes, Sir!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
009	(Another frightened child... It's always wearying to see.)
010	You...! Inquisitor!	VO_desel.desel_battle_0022
011	I take it you know why I am here.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0023
012	Begin the inspection! Show no mercy to those who will sow disorder!	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0001
013	Yes, Sir!
014	H-hey! Stop! Sure, we study Alchemy here, but...	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
015	We've never done anything that goes against the Magna Code! You have no right!
016	We're not here to take statements. We have all the evidence we need. All we need from you is honest answers to our inquiries.
017	...Fine.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0042
018	Does this laboratory allow entry to those besides the affiliated researchers?
019	Of course not. We deal with confidential information here, so only certified researchers are allowed in.
020	Well, excluding Inquisitors, I suppose.
021	Are your researchers present every day?
022	Every day...? Well, no. Sometimes we go out on the field, or have days off if we're sick.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0031
023	Most of them are here today... Oh, except Bill. He's not in.
024	He's still new here. He's never had to work in a laboratory like this, so we're still teaching him the ropes.
025	...I see.
026	Hey! Hey! Careful with that! Those are important research materials!
027	Keep your distance. We cannot allow you the chance to conceal evidence.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
028	You can stop it with your accusations. I'm just asking them to be more careful.	VO_desel.desel_battle_0019
029	To be honest, I don't like letting people who don't understand the value of these materials touch them.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0030
030	Besides, we have nothing to hide here. We're totally legitimate!
031	That's for us to decide.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0010
032	Try to refrain from interrupting the inspection. Just stay back and answer my questions.
033	We aren't researching how to use Alchemy. We're just trying to gain more knowledge about it.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0017
034	Everybody here takes pride in their work. We believe our work here will pave the way for the future of this continent!
035	...
036	The future of this continent, eh?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0030
037	(It is true, a deeper understanding of Alchemy would benefit all of Babel. There is no doubt of that.)
038	(But great power must be handled with care. We cannot afford to let anything go wrong. The victims of these mistakes are always—)
039	Waaaaah!
040	Is that...a child?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0018
041	Hey, you! What do you think you're doing to that kid?!
042	Shut up! This kid's been wakin' me up from my nap, runnin' around makin' a racket!
043	Are you serious?! This is a park! Of course kids are gonna be running around playing!
044	I said, shut up! I don't give a damn!
045	Hey?!	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
046	I see you can't even be bothered to lace your shoes properly, let alone show some common decency.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0010
047	Allow me to show you what happens to egocentric ruffians who disturb the peace.
