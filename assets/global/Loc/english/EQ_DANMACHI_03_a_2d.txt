001	Seems like the beasts have calmed down, and the flow of Alchemia with them...
002	Leaving us without any further leads, unfortunately.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
003	Hmm. That's not good.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0022
004	If there are other people around who've come from Bell's world, we should probably focus some of our efforts on tracking them down, too.
005	Doesn't seem like there's anyone around to ask, though.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
006	Wait, I think I see someone over there. Is that...a child? And they look like they've collapsed!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0012
007	What?!
008	Ila!
009	We've gotta go after her!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0018
010	Come on, wake up! Don't die on me here!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
011	Easy there, Ila! The kid's just unconscious. No need to worry.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0014
012	Let's move them somewhere safer until they wake up.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
013	Good idea. Ila, can you carry them?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
014	Right.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
015	Okay, this spot seems like a good choice. There aren't any beasts in sight, and it's fairly concealed.	VO_kevin.kevin_battle_0001
016	...
017	Ila, do you know this kid?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
018	No.
019	But I have a feeling I know...just what kinds of things they've been through.
020	Look. Scars all over, arms and legs thin as twigs... You have to go through hell to end up like that.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
021	Believe me, I know. I once looked just like this.
022	After losing my parents, I was left all alone to be exploited and abused.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
023	Ah...
024	I understand where you're coming from. But you shouldn't run off on your own like that. You could wind up going through hell all over again.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
025	What was I supposed to do?! They could've been attacked at any moment, with all these monsters around!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
026	Still...	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
027	I hate to say it, but I think Kevin's right.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
028	Acting on your own like that is rolling the dice. You never know what kind of trouble you might be getting yourself into.
029	But sometimes, that's just what you have to do! Otherwise you can't protect the things that really matter!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
030	Sounds familiar. "That's why you should let me help you! I would never abandon you, or anyone else—I want to protect others the same as you!"	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
031	...That's what my goddess is always saying whenever she gets mad at me.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
032	...
033	Not to mention the fact that if you got injured from recklessly rushing in, you wouldn't be able to protect anyone at all.
034	Or if you could, the people you were able to protect would always feel guilty that you got hurt because of them.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
035	Wait, shh! That sound... There's a battle going on!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
036	Ila, I think it's safe here, but just in case, I want you to stay and guard the kid.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
037	Gah, I can't stand you telling me what to do! ...But yeah, all right. I'll keep watch here.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
038	Agh!	VO_eyes.eyes_battle_0022
039	Is that...Ais?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
040	So Ais got summoned to this world too...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0020
041	Kevin, sorry, I've got to go on ahead!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0035
042	You got it. I'll clear the way to the girl for you.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0038
