001	You guys understand, don't you?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
002	Nu numa.	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_c
003	Okay, good.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0007
004	Wow... Just like that, they all lined up and are paying attention.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0044
005	Nu, nuumaaaa. Numa.	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0021
006	Huh? Again with that? Hmm...	VO_merda.merda_sys_0012
007	What are they saying?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0001
008	They really, really want to participate, no matter what.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0022
009	They said, "We've been looking forward to it all year, numa!"
010	Numa! Numaaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
011	You're looking forward to it that much, huh?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0016
012	In that case... Why don't we let them participate in secret?
013	Would that be okay?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0025
014	Well, they participated last time, didn't they? So to cut them out this time would be...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0004
015	That's true. Well, there are plenty of humans who are less well behaved than they are.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0031
016	Numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
017	I wonder if we can make really this Halloween sparkly like last year was, though?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_chara_1003
018	Of course we can.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
019	Mei Fang!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0019
020	How long are you two going to fool around here? Didn't we say to hurry back?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
021	You're right. Sorry.	VO_merda.merda_battle_0018
022	Because you took so long, I got bored and made these.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
023	This is...bean cake.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
024	This is no average bean cake! This is bean cake that I decorated personally!	VO_meifan.meifan_chara_1002
025	What do you think? Quite sparkly, is it not? You don't see sparkly bean cake like this every day!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
026	That's true. You don't ever see bean cake with marzipan figures or silver sprinkles on top like this.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0011
027	Could it be...? Did you do this...for me?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0031
028	It isn't as if it was for you alone that I did this. I thought everyone should be able to enjoy such sparkly bean cake, that is all.	VO_meifan.meifan_chara_1006
029	Mei Fang...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0023
030	Let us hurry back to town. The decorating is not yet done.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
031	Let's go, Hozuki.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0001
032	Right!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
033	Oh, right. If you guys want to participate in Halloween then you better help with the preparations, hm?
034	Numa?!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
035	If you work hard, maybe you can get some of Neica's candy.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
036	Numaaaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
037	It's almost done.	VO_merda.merda_sys_1045
038	Of course it is. I am helping, am I not? Now all that is left, Hozuki, is what to do with your flowers.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
039	I expect you to paint the whole town with flowers that will do justice to the treats that we have prepared.
040	That's a tall order.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0029
041	I...
042	Hey, what's that you're holding?
043	Huh?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
044	Is that Halloween candy?!
045	What's that? I've never seen anything like it! It's really sparkly and cute!
046	I wanna try it! Give me one!
047	What? L-later, okay? I'll be handing it out to everyone later.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
048	Really? You promise?
049	If you don't, we'll trick you, you know!
050	Yes, I promise!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
051	Well, well, well. Would you look at that? The treats I arranged are quite the success, after all.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
052	They may have just been excited at the prospect of something new, but I'm glad they're embracing it.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0005
053	Children are the stars of Halloween, after all.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0007
054	...
055	(Now that I think about it, my father used to watch over me like this, with such a kind gaze.)
056	(I remember this look... I'm sure, now, that she must be right. My father wouldn't have given me this name with any ill will.)
057	You're right. Kids are, truly, the stars of Halloween.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
058	I didn't want to lose to Neica. I wanted to be the real deal. So I got desperate, and because of that, I forgot something important.
059	I forgot that the most important thing is the enjoyment of the children, and how they feel about their Halloween experience.
060	That's right.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
061	Hey...Hozuki? Maybe you're thinking about it all wrong. Having room on the inside, isn't necessarily a bad thing, you know.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0002
062	Huh?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0006
063	Well, if something is empty, there's more room to fill with all sorts of things. You could become anything you want to be, instead of just imitating it on the outside.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0007
064	You could become something even better than what you call the "real deal".
065	I could...become something better... Something more...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0016
066	Bean cake may not be a real Halloween treat...but that just means we have to make it better than the real deal!
067	If we decorate something as novel and exciting as bean cake it to suit the Halloween spirit, then...
068	Bean cake... Bon... Bonfire dances... I always used to enjoy those festivities with my father.
069	Oh! At the festivals, they always have lanterns! We could have lanterns decorated with flowers!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_chara_1003
070	Then, there would be the animals in their costumes... This could be great!
071	There she goes, all fired up.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0044
072	Hey! Did any monsters come running this way?	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1024
073	We haven't seen anything. What kinds of monsters?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0012
074	Uh, well... They don't have legs. They were apparently created by an experiment of Elizabeth's. They're, like, these weird...wriggly things.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0027
075	We got rid of most of them, but about 10 of them escaped. Eh? What's wrong, Mei Fang? You're really pale.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
076	I-it's nothing! It's got nothing to do with them being legless, wriggly things!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0027
077	Ugh. They had no plan to counteract those things. Man, this Halloween just keeps getting more and more complicated.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0029
078	I just want to go home...so let's do what we can to get this over with.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
079	Good for you, Hozuki.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
080	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0006
081	It's your first time being in charge of Halloween, right? You looked like you had a lot of tension in your shoulders, so I figured you had gotten worked up about something...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0006
082	But now you look much more relaxed, so I'm glad you're feeling better about whatever was bothering you.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0007
083	Spoken as if you had not been the one to get so worked up last time around.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
084	I... I did not!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
085	Heh heh. It's okay. I'm through with letting things get to me like that.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
086	(I've learned. I've learned that the whole point of making things sparkly is for the enjoyment of those who will see that sparkle. That's all that really matters.)
087	...?
088	(I've also learned...that I don't have to do it all by myself.)
089	All right! We'll stage this Halloween with an array of flower lanterns!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0008
090	Did you know that, in Wadatsumi, the hozuki flower is a talisman for good health?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
091	There may be a lot of meanings for it in the language of flowers that could be interpreted negatively, yet it also carries the spirit of natural beauty and tranquility.
092	You're well informed, Mei Fang.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0031
093	Among the souvenirs from Wadatsumi I was given by Vivi, there were some hozuki flowers. I came to be curious, and so I looked them up.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
094	Oh...? You knew that all along, and yet you didn't say anything to Hozuki about it. How mean.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
095	It's accurate, though, isn't it? I mean, Hozuki sparkles most when she's just being herself.
096	Heh heh. As I always say; all anyone need do is trust in my command!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
097	If you do not have anything in your arms,
098	you can embrace the beautiful flowers.
