001	No...is my father amongst you?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0022
002	What's the matter? You killed him? He could've been your father.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
003	You might have killed the unfortunate man who gave you life at the cost of being turned into an insect.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0007
004	...!
005	You scum!!!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0020
006	Calm down, Rebecca!
007	Lisbeth...?
008	Ever since we were born, we've never seen our father once...so all we can do is imagine.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
009	Rebecca!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
010	Your father wanted to give you life, even at the cost of being turned into an insect!
011	Do you think he'd be the kind of person to attack you?! Can you imagine that?!
012	!!!
013	That's just wishful thinking. Do you think your imagination is enough to escape reality?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0012
014	It's not my imagination; it's the truth! At least for those of us who believe in our fathers!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
015	So you don't care about the soul of an insect as long as it isn't your father?! You witches truly are evil!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0016
016	!!!
