001	What...? Him?! This is one of the Seven Deadly Sins you mentioned before?!
002	A skilled hawk hides its talons, but...the hawk might lose its talons if it is too well hidden.
003	Are you sure this guy is, erm...strong?
004	Hahah... Hard to believe, isn't it?
005	Are you okay? Where have you been, Escanor?
006	Hahahaha... Well, I only just arrived and it was already dark, so... I essentially wandered around until I found myself here and did my best to avoid the monsters of the night.
007	I guess it has been a while since we arrived here...
008	Uhm... I'm still quite lost regarding the situation we are in. What is happening to us? Where are we?
009	Well...
010	I see... I finally understand. I'm sorry that I was not present to help. Had it been daylight...
011	Oh no, I'm happy that we were able to find each other at all. I was told the others were brought here as well, but I couldn't be sure until I saw you.
012	You need not worry about that. I'm sure they're here.
013	What makes you so sure?
014	Nothing in particular.
015	You're kidding me, right?
016	That's just what it means to be comrades. Isn't that right, Elizabeth?
017	Exactly!
018	Even a denizen of darkness like myself can be drawn to light. The brighter the light, the stronger the pull. So whispers the darkness within me.
019	You have quite a way with words, sir.
020	But I digress. We should search for the others, should we not?
021	I won't be much help to you during the night, after all.
022	That might be the wisest course of action with Zeldris hovering around. Ah. Would you look at that.
023	Get 'em, boys!
024	Rude! I am not a boy!
