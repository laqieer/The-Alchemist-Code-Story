001	Tch! It's stronger than it looks! ...?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0043
002	Tehre!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0020
003	Unfortunately, compared to my power, you are nothing but a worthless clay puppet! Hyaaaaah!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
004	For the sake of Saga's future, you will not stop me here.
005	By the Matter! Tehre, you really are unbelievably strong!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0024
006	Well now, shall we get started then? Take this!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
007	Tehre, what are you doing?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
008	I wanted to know whether the core would be destroyed if we eliminated the shadow. Unfortunately, it appears it won't be that simple.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
009	Physical attacks don't appear to have any effect on it. Then...how about this?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
010	It's able to deflect even Tehre's attacks?! How are we supposed to—?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
011	Quiet! I have more in my arsenal. O earth, infuse me with thy breath of life...and envelop all in your deep embrace!	VO_terre.terre_chara_1010
012	What is...this?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
013	There's a knack to dealing with such Matter as is infusing the power of earth into the core... It's different from our own Matter, which are simply massive reservoirs of energy.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
014	Without Matter powering it, I expect I should be able to destroy the empty husk of the core from inside!
015	O tranquil breath of life... O great and endless bounty... Grant thy strength unto me! Yaaaaaaaaargh!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0032
016	Finally! It has been destroyed!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0024
017	We just have to do this three more times and it'll be over. We're pressed for time. Let's make our way back.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
018	Then the wind core...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
019	We will, of course, leave to Tamis...assuming she makes it in time.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
020	...!
021	Time to go! We cannot assume what will happen now that it has lost one of its cores.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
022	...?! Tehre, look out!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0020
023	Wha—?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0025
024	Guh!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0025
025	Tehre!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
