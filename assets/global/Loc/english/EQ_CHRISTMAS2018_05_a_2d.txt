001	Woke you up, did we? It's all right. We won't bother you anymore, so why don't you just pop off back to sleep? Go along, now. That's it.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0003
002	Grrrrrrrrrr...
003	They're actually going! Wow! I guess that's Birgitta for you!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0046
004	You're amazing, Birgitta!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0009
005	You will find that they can be quite reasonable if you simply talk to them. Now, the two of you need to calm down.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
006	S-sorry.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0028_a
007	We can't help it. We just get so excited about the Winter Holiday!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0020
008	Really, now. What troublesome little fellows you are!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
009	I can...kind of understand. They just really treasure the Winter Holiday.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
010	Ah, yes. I am certain that it is something you all share.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
011	I'm gonna make you pay for what you did earlier!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0001
012	Looks like you brought some friends this time, huh? I guess you must be pretty serious about this.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0001
013	You people who spread a misguided Winter Holiday across the continent of Babel are the root of all evil! We're gonna crush you, right here, right now!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0003
