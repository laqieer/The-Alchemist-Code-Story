001	Imprisoned by the Beckrams, Ethan entrusted you with the task of finding the Sacred Stone's location.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
002	In other words, isn't it plausible to consider that the Stone wasn't at the Beckram's house at the time of the wedding?
003	Can we believe that the Sacred Stone might, in fact, be at your family's mansion?
004	But, if the Sacred Stone is in our mansion...
005	Wouldn't Ethan have just gone about things without causing any conflict?
006	Right...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
007	In other words, that would mean the Sacred Stone Belphegor is in the hands of neither family.
008	But...Ethan entrusted you with the whereabouts of the Sacred Stone.
009	He must have determined that you would be able to trace its location.
010	... ...
011	Is there anything that comes to mind? It doesn't matter how insignificant it is.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
012	The clock tower...
013	Huh?
014	The last time I met Ethan, he screamed, "Use the Sacred Stone for the silent clock!"
015	He used to work as the protector of the clock tower.
016	Clock tower...as in that old clock tower?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
017	The clock tower in the center of Redington, aye! It's said to have been there from the founding of this country!
018	From its inception? There's definitely a chance it could be that. Not a bad guess.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
019	Wooof!
020	Huh? What's that? A dog?
021	No-not good! It's a Hound!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0016
022	A Hound?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
023	It's the electronic dogs that the Guard Droids use, aye! It pursues its target with a sharp sense of smell. It's even equipped with the ability to latch onto you with its jaw before exploding.
024	Exploding? Jeez, that's not very peaceful.
025	Additionally, they have a fusion function—
026	That's enough info.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
027	Let's take them out before they get close.
