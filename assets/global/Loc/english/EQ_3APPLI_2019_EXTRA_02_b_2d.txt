001	This is our third Chance Encounter...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
002	But from the perspective of Nyx and Mira, it's only our first.
003	The Mira and Nyx currently standing over there don't know either of us at all.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
004	But that messy technique of theirs ended up dragging us in, too, even though we're not destined to meet until well into the future.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
005	According to Michael, if we accidentally cross paths with Mira and Nyx now, we'll end up creating an enormous time paradox.
006	I wonder if we'll ever actually be allowed to meet them again?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
007	Well, we first have to have them save us in the past.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1021
008	Right. So long as they do that, I bet we will!
009	They'll have to complete the Chance Encounter—finalize it properly.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
010	In the mean time, we'll be listening for those bells.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
