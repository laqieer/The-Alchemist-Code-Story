001	Numaaa!
002	...! These aren't costumes! They are real monsters!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
003	These monsters have infiltrated the town. Isn't that pretty bad? It might cause a panic.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0026
004	You're right. Fortunately...everyone here is dressed up in a costume.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0004
005	We need to chase the monsters out of town before the townsfolk realize. Let's try and talk with them first.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
006	Hm...? Talk with them? How?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
007	Hmph. Don't underestimate me. I am Hayate from the honorable Gyobu tribe! I can understand the words of beast-type monsters!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0010
008	Ah... That's...useful...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0044
009	Numaa...
010	...Huh? What's that? You still haven't fulfilled your goal yet?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
011	Numa? Numa, numa, numu, numaaa...numa? Numaaa!!!
012	You've long been waiting for this moment and you can't afford to miss out on this opportunity?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0045
013	Hey...are you really talking with them?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0002
014	Numaaa!
015	Wait! What exactly is your goal...?!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
016	Oh dear, they're gone...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
017	N-not good! We need to catch them before they cause a commotion! Elizabeth, Alexis! Let's chase them!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0026
018	I accepted the request of being in charge of the candy, but...I think making accessories is totally different from making candy.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
019	Well, I like working alone from home, so it's fine. Sigh... If only this time of peace would continue forever.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
020	Oh... I finished making the candy. I guess I need to go and deliver them.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
021	Ohhh. I really, really, really don't want to!
022	Making candy is one thing, but I hate going outside! I don't want to go where there are crowds!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
023	...I guess I can't afford to be saying that. After all, I'm on a mission...and I was transmuted...sigh. I wish they would call me for missions where I can stay home the whole time.
024	...Hm? There was a strange shadow at the window.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0006
025	... ...!
026	I wonder why Neica hasn't arrived yet. Do you think she's shut herself up indoors again?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0030
027	It's possible. We're talking about Neica here. Wouldn't this kind of crowded festival be the kind of environment she'd want to avoid the most?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
028	But that's not right! I don't like being in public places either, but I'm doing my best over here!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0014
029	(She really gets passionate when it comes to Halloween.)	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
030	We had quite a few incidences previously, as well, but it made me really happy to see everyone's smiles.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
031	I think that, if Neica saw those smiles in person, she would come to love Halloween!
032	...I hope so. Well, she should arrive soon. Hey...something's wrong.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
033	Numa! Numaaa!
034	Something is surrounding the house... Are those...Rattys?! There are so many of them!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0026
035	Sigh... It looks like we've got our work cut out for us.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
