001	Headed for the gates of Castle Valderik, the Blue Flame Guard and the Lizard Brigade rest halfway up the mountainous terrain.
002	No matter how many times I see it, it's an odd view.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
003	What?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
004	Seeing the Blue Flame Guard and the Lizard Brigade together.
005	A few days ago, I would never have been able to predict this situation.
006	If you believe in something enough, ideas can really become reality. Right, Sabareta?
007	Logi turns around and sees one of the Lizard Brigade whispering something into Sabareta's ear.
008	It looks like...things won't be that easy after all.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
009	...What do you mean?
010	I've received news.
011	The Holy Guard are marching towards us from Envylia.
012	!!!
013	Regardless of what you say...it looks like the top brass of Envylia just won't accept us.
014	No...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
015	What do we do? Do we disband here?
016	W-what're you saying?! Whatever it takes, we're going to persuade them!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
017	We're going to have everyone accept you! Right, Agatha?
018	Yes! Something like this will absolutely not stop us!
019	There may never be another opportunity for Envylia and Wratharis to join hands!
020	Heh... I thought you would turn tail and run.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
021	Don't try to test our resolve. We're determined in our actions.
022	Not one of my Blue Flame Knights will cower over something like this.
023	We promise to defend you all until you have an audience with King Patrick.
024	Protect us? Don't be a fool.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
025	As long as the Holy Guard are involved, that will be no easy feat.
026	You should be well aware that we'll protect ourselves. Don't underestimate the Lizard Brigade.
027	Sabareta...
028	We're traveling with you, our sworn enemies.
029	You're not the only ones who are determined in your actions.
030	However...if the top brass won't listen, just remember that we have our own way of handling things.
031	Heh. Then let's hurry on ahead!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
032	We must minimize casualties and establish peace!
