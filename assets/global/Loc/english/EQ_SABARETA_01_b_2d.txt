001	This is...the Demon!
002	Hah...hyahahah!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
003	I've finally found it! This is the weapon that destroyed ancient civilization!
004	With this power, I'll be able to plunge the world into chaos!
005	I'll bring change to this world bound by Alchemy!
006	—!
007	Where am I?!
008	Welcome, traveler with the wandering soul.
009	This is the Door of Truth, where souls are judged.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0008
010	The Door of Truth?! It can't be!
011	Oh? Have you heard of this place?
012	I guess. The lore of Nimul and Emmel mentions the Door of Truth.
013	Anyone who pursues the power of Alchemy knows about it.
014	Hmm. I am Ouroboros—the observer of souls that bond this world with truth.
015	Although you are not qualified to be here, I invited you because I felt a strange power emanating from you.
016	I ask you here and now, why do you seek Alchemy?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
017	I guess a roundabout answer won't be necessary. I aim for one thing alone—to change Wratharis's existence in this world.
018	Its existence in this world?
019	The War of Alchemy is said to have destroyed ancient Babel, as a result dividing the world into seven lands.
020	It was then that Alchemy was declared a Forbidden Art. Under the name of justice, the Holy Guard destroyed all who sought that power.
021	However, the seekers of that power never died out.
022	The history of conflict in this world is none other than the history of conflict over Alchemy.
023	As long as Alchemy exists, this conflict will continue indefinitely.
024	So, do you reject this power as harmful?
025	No. The power of Alchemy is nothing more than a means to an end.
026	The true harm is the suzerain that monopolizes Alchemy and use it to fight.
027	... ...
028	Why is Alchemy forbidden? Why are only Paladins allowed to wield it?
029	It's because this world was forced to obey the logic of the victors.
030	The Magna Code they laid out is an evil that allows them to rule the world.
031	To resist their rule, I have no other choice but to obtain the forbidden power.
032	In other words, you will defeat poison with poison?
033	Heheh. I'm a deadly venom, so to speak, that feasts on poison.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
034	However, some may say the power you have is fake; you cannot use it without the Stones.
035	Hmph. So you know about our Philosopher's Stones, huh?
036	Those Stones are made from the blood of humans.
037	This means that blood will cover the path you follow.
038	I told you, I'm a deadly venom. I resolved myself to that fate a long time ago.
039	Hmm. Interesting. Very well.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
040	I am the observer of destiny.
041	I will observe how the power you possess affects this world.
042	Agh...
043	What was that?! Was my consciousness transported somewhere?
044	Demon, did you show that to me? You who desires the blood of Wratharis?
045	Heheh. All right.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
046	Very well. I'll hurry and gather all the Philosopher's Stone needed to revive you.
047	If it's blood you desire, then I'll slit the throats of countless people to quench your thirst.
048	I will do everything I can to wake you,
049	if it means the promise of peace!
