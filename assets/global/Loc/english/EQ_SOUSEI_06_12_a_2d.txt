001	…Is this the best I can do?	VO_terres.terres_battle_0019
002	It appears so. It's over.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
003	…Why do you lower your sword, Andechs?
004	Tell your soldiers to stand down. You lost.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
005	…We'll defeat Satna, here and now, and put an end to this nightmare.
006	The rest is on your shoulders...as you bear the burden of past sins.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
007	…
008	Spare me your pity, Andechs.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0003
009	Kill me.
010	What?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
011	You should understand as a knight. The general who suffers a defeat in battle must pay with her head.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0010
012	Give me a break! You can't use death to escape your responsibility.
013	You dare pontificate on morality while in the same breath you disavow our people!?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0013
014	…!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
015	Hereafter, our people will have no choice but to pander to the whims of the Invidians.
016	You, as our heroic knight, were also the one responsible for the failed invasion of the Invidia Belt, were you not?
017	You could claim your motives were pure, but do you think they'd forgive you so easily?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0027
018	However, suppose the Knight of Justice defeated the "evil queen" and freed the people from her control. That would be a different story wouldn't it?
019	Your Majesty…are you saying--	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
020	I will play the part of the evil queen. I was a uniquely villainous actor who left a stain on the Ira Belt.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0010
021	If you comprehend my words, then strike me down. My head will be one more "sin" you must carry.
022	…You're right.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
023	Andechs! You can't possibly be--	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
024	I told you, didn't I?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
025	I don't care how dirty my hands get…as long as I can save the Ira Belt.
026	*Gulp*	VO_slba.slba_battle_0019
027	Quen-- W-Why…	VO_terres.terres_battle_0022
028	Apologies, Your Majesty. I bet you weren't expecting this, were you?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0035
029	I had always planned on dying, to be honest. Think of this as an eye for an eye.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
030	…Quence!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
031	Oops! Should I offer an explanation? It wasn't just revenge, y'know?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0037
032	She was even more formidable than I could've imagined. I had to kill her so that she wouldn't get in my way.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
033	Your Majesty! Queen Terese!?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0020
034	...Sul…va…
035	W-We've got to treat your wound…	VO_slba.slba_battle_0019
036	It's alright… Bring your face…closer…	VO_terres.terres_sys_0018
037	Your Majesty, I…I--	VO_slba.slba_sys_0021
038	I fell victim…to the law of this land… Just like…my brother. But--	VO_terres.terres_sys_0042
078	Teres…! Don't speak! You'll bleed to death…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0015
079	I know that you...will usher in a new dawn for our people…So--
080	"So" what!? Why do you always do this!? Why don't you ever explain it to me!?
081	How can I understand?! I can't...! I can't! *sniff*	VO_slba.slba_sys_0018
041	Terese! *hic* Terese…! AHhhhHHHHHhhh!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0019
042	…Why'd you do it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
043	Hm?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0025
044	She already surrendered. You didn't have to kill her. She didn't have to…
045	But you did it anyway. Why?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
046	Don't worry. If my plan works, it'll be like none of this happened anyway.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
047	Quence!!!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0013
048	Oof…	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
049	Impulsive, aren't we? But not too bright. Could you really be the "final key?"	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
050	Well, it doesn't matter. I'll settle everything before we find out.
051	I've got some work for you, partner.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
052	…Y…na?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
053	…Is that you, old man!?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
054	…
055	Hey, old man! What're you doing!?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
056	Now, now. It's no use trying to talk to him. As far as he's concerned, time is frozen.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0037
057	It doesn't matter how strong he was mentally. Now, he's a puppet of corruption.
058	…!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
059	Don't get so upset! I put a lot of consideration into this beforehand.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0047
060	I removed his personality so that you won't feel so bad killing each other. Isn't that generous of me?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0023
061	You monster…! Have you no heart, Quence?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
062	…Good question.
063	I suppose...I must have lost it somewhere.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
064	You'll let me know when you find it, won't you? It's probably somewhere in the bowels of hell.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
065	…
066	…What're we gonna do?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
067	…Tch.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
068	I'm the one that lead you all here. This is my responsibility. Alright?
069	…No way!
070	Corruption is what's controlling Yna, so I--	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
071	…Huh? What was that?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
072	Don't go it alone. Let me help you.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
073	Really? Thanks, Eulalia!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
074	(This is no time to dawdle. I've got to focus on what's in front of me…)
075	Eulalia and I will purify him! So, give us some cover in the meantime!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
076	If it's a diversion you want, you got it--	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
077	Let's show 'em what we got!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
