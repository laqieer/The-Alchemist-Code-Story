001	What are you willing to wager?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0002
002	Sorry, but I'm broke.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
003	It wasn't until several years after I left the Holy Guard that I was finally reunited with Magnus.
004	After years of aimless wandering, I found him in an underground gambling den.
005	Their eyes are ever watchful, and nothing will change the fact that I know what I know. It won't be long before they terminate me.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
006	As long as I keep hanging around in crowded places like this, though, Corpse won't be able to do as they please.
007	So I figured I might as well enjoy life while I can.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
008	I threw away Alchemy, the Holy Guard, and my family.
009	For now, I guess I'm...
010	...
011	Well...carefree, if anything.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0023
012	It's not a bad life. Better than being dead.
013	He claims to have never lost a bet.
014	He was best buddies with Captain Othima back in his Holy Guard days, and they made a lot of money together.
015	As for me, I was always the one who had to clean up after their messes.
016	A good win in a real life-or-death situation... You can't get this feeling in a bogus game.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
017	It's riveting.
018	As he smirked at me, his right eye winked briefly.
019	I noticed this little tell, something that he did not have back when he dedicated his time to researching Alchemy.
020	Mind doing me a favor?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
021	It was a little while later that he asked me this, giving me a serious look that I'd never seen on him before.
022	I want you to keep my sister far away from Alchemy.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0041
023	Come again? You want me to what, now?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
024	I was...comforted by that kid, you know?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
025	Didn't know you were into that sort of thing.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0027
026	No, you idiot! Not like that! I'm only interested in partners my age or older, but younger than 75.	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
027	That so? Here I thought you were picking from the lower-hanging fruit as well.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0005
028	Ha! And steal your bounty?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
029	Well, maybe my limit is a little younger than 75, but I'm no cradle robber! Anyway, it's the soul that matters, not the age.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
030	Well, if you wanna put it so poetically...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0009
031	Don't worry your pretty pink head. I won't try anything with your little sister.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
032	Well, that's a relief.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
033	So you want me to keep your sister away from Alchemy.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
034	I might. For the right price. How much are you willing to wager?
035	Oh, I don't know... How about my life?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
036	What the hell, man?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
037	She's your sister, isn't she? Why not do it yourself?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
038	I first started learning Alchemy because I wanted to make my little sister smile.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
039	Well, this is rare... You, giving up details about yourself.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
040	I tapped into Alchemia to make a doll move around. You should have seen the smile on her face.
041	Even after our parents split up, I believed that I'd see that smile again someday.
042	That is...until I found out that the peace brought about by Alchemy is false.
043	And about the Holy Guard's monopolization of Alchemy and their concealment of the truth, of course.
044	I've heard that my sister is sniffing around about these things, and about Alchemy.
045	She's a clever one. She's bound to attract Corpse's attention eventually.
046	They won't take the fact that she and I are related lightly.
047	They'll either try to use her to get to me, or kill her to punish me.
048	Either way, I can't allow her to get involved.
049	So I can't exactly go looking for her myself.
050	Did you know there are only three reasons a man will take action?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
051	Let's hear 'em.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
052	A woman's tears, a child's smile, a love interest, and filial piety.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
053	That's four, but whatever. Where do I come into—?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
054	You're a man.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
055	Are you saying you're not gonna take action because I don't fall under any of those categories?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
056	I'm a man, too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
057	And men...don't need reasons to help each other out.
058	Dude...!
059	You are the coolest right now.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
060	Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
061	I get that a lot.
062	I like honest people.
063	I never have to doubt what they're saying.
064	Well, I guess I just like people in general.
065	As a person myself, I have to interact with other people in order to survive, right?
066	Life would be too difficult if I didn't like people.
067	Stifling, even.
068	You know, meeting you really helped me realize something.
069	People who like people are...
070	Well... They're lovable, aren't they?
071	Information for information, right? That was the condition of the trade.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
072	Huh?
073	Do you feel like talking now?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
074	About what?
075	About the Cursed Beasts.
076	...
077	Why do you feel the need to keep this a secret?
078	What exactly are they?
079	Why do we have to suffer like this?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
080	...
081	I don't know.
082	Huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
083	I may not know anything worth trading.
084	...
085	I once thought I knew everything, but I'm realizing more and more how little I actually know.
086	Alchemy is being used against people.
087	The tools we carried are now used for killing.
088	The Cursed Beasts, hidden.
089	The truth behind our struggles has never been made public knowledge. Why?
090	The corruption of those who uphold justice.
091	For the future of this world?
092	For a future like this?
093	Must Alchemy stand in the way of seeing my family again?
094	Mira, I won't pretend to know what it is that's weighing on your shoulders...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
095	But maybe it's time you let some of that weight go.
096	Thanks for your concern.
097	Still, there are some things that I've gotta find out...
098	Challenges I have to pursue.
099	That's why I'm here, you know?
100	Well...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1016
101	Why not just let the flow of this river take you where it will?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_1003
102	Easy for you to say. You don't know anything about this river!
103	That's because you won't tell me anything about it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
104	I did so!
105	Would it help you to know...? I believe!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
106	Eeeeek! What are you doing, you creep?!
107	Huh. So I really can't touch you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
108	It might seem like nothing special to you, but I still feel it when people go through me and it's really weird!
109	Seriously?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
110	Wha—?! No! Stop that! Eeeeeek!
111	Hahahaha!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0024
112	Hahahahahaha!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
113	It's not funny!
114	So you came here—all the way from the past—in search of the future.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
115	Yeah! What about it?!
116	Yet you can't interact with anything.
117	Well... Yeah.
118	Then I guess you'll just have to watch.
119	Watch...what?
120	Nothing ever goes as planned, you know?
121	In this crazy thing called life.
122	Huh?
123	I can't interact with everything, either. There are things that I can't let myself get too close to.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
124	Huh?
125	We'll just have to let the river take us where it will.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_1003
126	If we have to sit back and watch, we may as well do it with smiles and laughter.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
127	She got away.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
128	Who got away?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
129	Your little sister's just as hardheaded as you are.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
130	Still, I did warn her to stay away from Alchemy and that ancient ruin in Slothstein.
131	Meanwhile, I've got Corpse preoccupied with this stone I snatched from under their noses.
132	I've done what I can, so now all there is for me to do is find out how much danger I'm in myself.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1016
133	I'm sorry.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0035
134	Stop that. It doesn't suit you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
135	Well, I guess it's my turn now.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
136	...
137	I have my own way of doing things.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
138	Just you watch. I won't miss the mark.
139	This is a first.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
140	For what?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
141	This is the first time I'm praying your wager goes down the drain.
142	Hmph.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
143	Then you're staking your hopes against a winning hand.	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
144	...
145	(He's laughing.)
146	(How can he be laughing?)
147	Huh?!
148	Wh—?!
149	...
