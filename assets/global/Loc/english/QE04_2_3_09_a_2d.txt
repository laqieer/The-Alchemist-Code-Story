001	Bacteria...?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
002	My deduction was the same, Tina, Mocca.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
003	He-hey, wait! I don't remember giving you a really helpful clue!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
004	You sneezed, didn't you, Lisbeth? That was the big hint I needed.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
005	Oh...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
006	True. It all makes sense.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
007	That being said, if it's true form is bacteria...then how should we go about dealing with it?
008	Although this is only my guess...when the Gluttony army went near the trees and did something, the Jam emerged...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
009	It could be theorized that the trees were used as breeding grounds for the Jam outbreaks.
010	Hm. And when that bacteria and the curse of Beelzebub came together, it caused the Jam to be born.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
011	Although it might be just a theory, it sounds sufficiently plausible.
012	If we do not halt the growth of the Jam, it could very well consume Saga and transform it into a desert.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
013	That's what happened in the south of Gluttony.
014	Ack! What are we supposed to do?!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
015	Don't worry, Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
016	What we must do has not changed. In fact, it's clearer than ever.
017	Tina...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
018	Trying to place the steps in order. To suppress the Jam outbreaks, we must suppress the power of Beelzebub.
019	In order to do that, we must restore the power of the wind to the Wind Temple.
020	To do this, we must join together the power of fire, water, and earth.
021	To regain balance, we must persuade the earth...in other words Tehre.
022	I see...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
023	Similarly, if the Gluttony army is using bacteria to grow the Jam...it's the same thing.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
024	As long as Tehre is working together with Gluttony, we must do what we can to persuade him back to our side.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
025	Impressive, Tina. It's just as you say. Persuading Tehre is of the utmost importance. The question is how do we hold a dialogue with him.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0046
026	Then there's still the problem with the people. Even if the Sprite Trio were to unite, we must ensure the unity of the people as well.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
027	With Fuu having destroyed Aria, there are still hard feelings from both the Tehre faction and the Voda faction. We must do something about that.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
028	We don't have to time persuade every citizen individually.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
029	However, this situation did not happen overnight. Likewise, it will take time to solve it as well.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
030	Is there...is there not some way?!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
031	Don't worry. I'm certain we'll find a way. Until recently, we, too, never thought we'd be working together in this fashion.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
032	But look at us now. We were able to change. I am certain the people of Saga can too.
033	You're right, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
034	If only there were some kind of law about "making up after fighting."	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0030
035	If such a law existed it would immediately solve both the problem with Tehre as well as all of Saga. Don't you think so?
036	!!!
037	What's the matter?!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
038	That's right. I'd completely forgotten about that.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
039	Indeed. Well, we haven't gone there since going from the Sprite Quartet to the Sprite Trio. That being said...it's what we need now more than ever.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
040	Did you think of an effective way?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
041	Yes. There's a certain law in Saga. It's been such a long time I'd completely forgotten about it.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
