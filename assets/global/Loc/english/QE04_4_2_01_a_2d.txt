001	Ack! My attacks are going right through them! How is this possible?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	No matter. If I keep hacking away, I am bound to do some damage eventually! Raaaaaaaaargh!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
003	Isn't this the same as the Trial? We're facing our own shadows, just like we did then!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
004	You cannot defeat us. We are the collective will of nature itself! Humans, prepare to be destroyed!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
005	They've vanished!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
006	The core's stopped glowing, too. What in the world is going on?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
007	Hyaaaaah!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
008	Does this mean we need to find another way to destroy it?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
009	Dang it. We don't have time to regroup outside. What should we do?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
010	...
011	Hey! Where are you going?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
012	Even if we cannot destroy the core, Beelzebub must be holed up somewhere inside here. I must search on for it.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
013	Hey, get back here!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
014	So...what do we do now?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
015	The core's stopped glowing...and shadows have appeared to protect it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
016	It really is the same as the Trial! Except...our attacks go right through them. What're we supposed to do now?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
017	Hmm... There must be a way to destroy the core! For the time being, let's go after Georgios.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
018	But the core's right in front of our very eyes!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
019	We can't do anything about it if our attacks can't even make a scratch. We should go after Georgios, while we think of a backup plan. It's more dangerous to keep our forces divided like this.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
020	Hey, guys... What do think those are?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
021	Glurrrrrrrrrrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0009
022	What the hell are they?! Humanoid...Jam?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
