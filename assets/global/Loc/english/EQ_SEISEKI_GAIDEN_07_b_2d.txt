001	Embrace the light that guides the world... Rising Sun!!!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0024
002	Nnngh!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0019
003	The sun rises... Dawn breaks... You've come a long way, Zain.
004	I am only able to embark on this path because of you...and those under my command.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
005	So in doing what I wanted, I showed you the way...? Interesting.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0045
006	Well, sometimes observation leads to unexpected results.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
007	It's not like me to be so helpful, though.
008	It is, however, good to do things that go against one's character sometimes.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
009	Your duty isn't to face the justice and peace of this world alone...but to walk with the light that envelops you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
010	Our paths may be different, but Cadanova and I are a part of that light. We'll be right there beside you.
011	Now, with that, I'll stop lecturing. It's really not my style.
012	Can I return my coat of arms from the 2nd Regiment to you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
013	Yes. I'll do everything I can to give you peace of mind, Kaya.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
014	I humbly return my coat of arms.
015	Captain of the 2nd Regiment, Crimson Dragon, Kaya... You have done well.
016	I swear that what light I glean from my path will shine upon that of the Lord Commander and the Holy Guard.
017	Good luck, Zain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
018	I'll be waiting for the report on that mural...and on the Cursed Beasts.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
019	I need to learn that truth, as Lord Commander.
020	If necessary, the Holy Guard will provide official support. Please, do everything in your power to reach the truth.
021	I will. I'll use my observations to contribute to the justice of Babel. That is my new duty.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
022	I'm counting on you, Kaya.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
023	Heheh... He's become so reliable.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
024	I'm not needed here anymore. Wouldn't you agree, Cadanova?
025	The Cursed Beasts...and the humans who stood against them. Could this be why the founders of alchemy...?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0046
026	If this is true... It threatens the entire continent. I must report this to Zain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
027	No. My observations aren't complete yet.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
028	I've finished researching the Cursed Beasts from every kingdom. I think I'll look into the founders of alchemy next.
029	I have plenty of time now, after all. I can fumble around in the dark for as long as it takes to uncover the truth.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
030	Previous Captain of the 2nd Regiment... Kaya, the Crimson Dragon... You know too much.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
031	All manner of incidents are occurring every day across Babel.
032	That is why it is time that we in the Holy Guard make our presence known. Order and justice will follow us.
033	It is for this purpose that we are reorganizing the ranks. Perhaps one of you will be promoted to Captain.
034	Never forget that those who gather here embody the justice of Babel. Don't shirk your training. Persist in your beliefs.
035	We are comrades who fight together to uphold justice. Every battle we fight is for the Holy Guard, and for Babel!
036	This is the untold record of the days of the Lord Commander's youth, inscribed into a Philosopher's Stone.
037	The various incidents that were to befall Lord Commander Zain, that lead to him protecting the justice of the continent...
038	...were to happen a little later.
039	As for the rumored Door to the Truth... What became of that was known only to a select few.
040	Lady Kaya!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
041	Huh...? Kanon? What's the matter? Surely there is no reason for you to be here.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
042	Lord Zain told me to give this to you!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
043	But this is...a lantern.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
044	So that Kaya, who has chosen to walk alone, doesn't have to fumble blindly in the dark. Also...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
045	That she may light her path as she goes. That's what he said!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
046	I think I said something like that once...but that wasn't what I meant by it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
047	Giving a lantern to a woman who has started her life anew... Heheh. Zain really doesn't understand women at all.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
048	Oh, I have one more message!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
049	Oh? Perhaps Zain has changed after all?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
050	He said... "I have no intention of failing to assist you. Should you have need of me, I swear upon my blade that I will hasten to your side."	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
051	Hahahah! Same old Zain... He gains full marks for being a knight, even though I'm nothing like Cadanova.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
052	Ah, Zain. You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
053	Well, be that as it may, I have to do my best to support Zain whether he understands us women or not.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
