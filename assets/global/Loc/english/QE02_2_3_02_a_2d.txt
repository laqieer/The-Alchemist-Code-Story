001	Edgar! The locomotive is accelerating rapidly! At this rate...	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
002	Jeez... The power of steam shouldn't be underestimated. It's moving at an incredible speed.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
003	This road leads to the city, aye! Soon we won't be able to see the locomotive!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
004	How much longer until the overpass crosses the railway?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
005	2 km until we reach the Panema Overpass, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
006	2 km, huh? Does the railway continue on straight from here?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
007	Squeak! The railway is laid out to avoid the hills, aye. There's one big curve further down!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
008	If we can cut across that hill, won't it save a little time?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
009	Yep. Alkemono, calculate the route. It doesn't matter if there's no road. Find the shortest path to the overpass.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
010	Aye!
011	We've finally gotten this far. We can't afford to lose this chance!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
