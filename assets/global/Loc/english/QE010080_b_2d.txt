001	Agh... What?! How can the likes of you...?!
002	Huff...huff...! D-don't stand in my way, Sabareta! I need to stop that Demon as soon as possible.
003	Heh. Then you'll have to cut me down.
004	As long as I live, the flame of Envylia's revenge will not go out.
005	I'll use whatever means possible to take control of the Demon!
006	... ...
007	Logi stares at Sabareta for a while before quietly lowering his sword that is pressed against him.
008	...What are you playing at?
009	Like Agatha said, the cycle of hatred will only give birth to sorrow. There is no point in killing you.
010	You... So you spare me out of sympathy! You'll regret it!
011	What you asked me before, I wasn't able to answer it then, but I can answer it now.
012	What...?
013	My generation will accept responsibility for the sins of the past. We want to atone by finding a way for us to walk the same path.
014	What a joke! You can never erase the sin of Envylia committed against us.
015	I know that it won't be easy!
016	But...if two disputing countries were to help each other...
017	We may be able to bring peace to this world!
018	I don't know if that would be a sufficient atonement, but...!
019	Hmph! You truly believe in that pipe dream?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
020	Even pipe dreams can become a reality if you don't give up on them! If we believe and act upon them, I am certain that day will come!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
021	...!!!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_battle_0019
022	As if prompted by those words, Sabareta returns Logi's sharp gaze.
023	Both you and that girl... How optimistic are you people of Envylia...	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
024	...Grroogh...grooo...!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0020
025	The Demon! I need to go save Agatha!
026	...Wait.
027	...What?
028	A reconciliation between Wrath and Envylia... Do you seriously believe such a surreal dream is possible?
029	...Of course.
030	If we don't do it, the world will never change. It's not a question of whether it's possible or not; we will make it possible!
031	Tsk. What a silly notion.
