001	From here we're completely off the map. In addition to the Guard Droids, we should anticipate attacks the mafia as well.
002	They're more of a hassle to deal with since I'll need to exercise restraint.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
003	Go home if you don't wanna tag along, aye! I'll save Fiona on my own!
004	Hah. You're on fire. Fiona means a lot to you, doesn't she?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
005	Aye, of course! Everyone always refers to me as Alkemono...
006	Fiona is the only one who affectionately calls me Allie!
007	I've been with her since her childhood. We're family, aye!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
008	Family, huh? I never expected to learn about family from a robot.
009	What's so funny, aye?! Stop making fun of me!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0024
010	I wasn't. There's no way I'd make fun of your relationship...sob...
011	Aye? You crying?!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0025
012	It doesn't matter whether you're man or woman, human or robot, we can all care for others. You've moved me to tears!
013	Don't worry. I'll make sure your prayers are answered. I'm confident that Fiona is safe.
014	What's your reason for rescuing Fiona, aye?
015	You shouldn't need to rescue Fiona to solve the mystery of the Sacred Stone.
016	I'll tell you my reason. Nothing is important enough in this world to put off the rescue of a woman in distress.
017	Stopping a woman from shedding tears should be a top priority in all things.
018	That's your policy, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0010
019	No, it's the law of the world that those born as men must fulfill.
020	That's some moving stuff, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0026
021	Heh. All right, let's go, Alkemono!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
022	So, what's the mafia boss who controls the Slothstein underworld like?
