001	Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.
002	Lord Commander Kanon!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
003	Basheeny...how is Almira's condition?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
004	Fortunately, there is no risk to her life. Still, the wound was surprisingly deep. She is currently receiving treatment by the medical unit.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
005	I see. What is going on? What were you doing with Almira...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
006	I had received a report from Kazahaya that she was headed with Captain Othima to Saga, but...
007	It's a long story. However, in summary, while heading to Saga, I encountered the fleeing Almira.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
008	Fleeing? From Saga region?
009	Yes. She told me she was able to escape due to Kagura's quick judgment.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
010	Were they attacked by Greed Dike in Saga? Yauras wasn't able to make it out in time?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
011	Regarding that...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
012	This is difficult for me to report, but...Captain Yauras was killed in the line of duty.
013	What...?!
014	She was slaughtered by the Templar's leader Sol.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
015	Furthermore, Sol...he has detained Captain Kagura and is said to be currently headed to Saga region in order to seize the Matter.
016	!!!
017	No...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
018	Before making his way to Saga, Captain Othima informed me that protecting the Matter was the highest priority.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
019	I'm sure he will be able to rescue Captain Kagura as well.
020	... ...
021	Is that all...true?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
022	Yes...unfortunately.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
023	...Very well.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
024	My lady...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
025	Currently, Greed Dike's main army is approaching us here in Northern Pride.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
026	We encountered them ourselves. Their numbers are vast to the point that we could not determine where their ranks ended.
027	I believe that Captain Yauras and Captain Kagura assisted Almira in her escape in order to pass on this report.
028	I thank the two of you for this report.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
029	We serve at your pleasure.
030	Huff...huff... We've received a report from the frontlines!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0024
031	...!
032	Greed Dike's army is approaching! Their exact numbers are undeterminable due to their endless ranks.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
033	This is unmistakably Greed Dike's main army!
034	Mistress...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
035	Proceed to intercept immediately!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
036	Inform both the Royal Palace and the Holy Order to hurry with the evacuation of all citizens! Basheeny, contact each squadron!
037	Understood!
038	Very well!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0038
039	...So, it's finally gotten to this point! I won't let you do as you please, Orion!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
040	Saga region. Near the Wind Temple.
041	Venom Arrow Rain!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
042	Hyaaah!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0026
043	Ack...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
044	I heard you were calm and calculated. Your passionate attack plays quite against my image of you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
045	I heard that you were a man who destroys without discrimination or regard...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
046	The most efficient way to avoid further damage is to finish you off as soon as possible.
047	Efficient, huh? I heard that was your catchphrase.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0045
048	However, aren't you acting in contrary to your beliefs?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
049	...What are you talking about?
050	You went out of your way to appear before us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
051	If you had hidden along with the rest of the wind tribe, you could've prevented any and all casualties.
052	I'm a captain of the Holy Guard. I would never run while letting you remain unchecked.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
053	No...that's not that the only reason.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
054	...What do you mean?
055	You're going to tell me you're here to take me down and save this redhead.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
056	However, the truth is that there's a reason you can't move from here, isn't there?
057	...!
058	A reason she can't move...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
059	I told you just now, didn't I? The Matter has consistently been stored within the temples.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
060	I doubt this tribe is an exception.
061	...Oh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
062	You managed to evacuate all your people, but...you cannot move the Matter from this temple.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
063	If someone has to protect the Matter...
064	It's pretty much predetermined who that person would be.
065	... ...
066	In other words...the final Matter is still stored in this temple. Or else...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
067	You wouldn't do something so inefficient as launching an ambush against me.
068	...Seida...
069	...Are you finished?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
070	Huh?
071	Heartbreaking Arrow!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
072	Ack...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
073	You can conjecture about my presence as much as you like. Either way, I'm going to finish you here.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
074	He-hey! Hold on a second...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
075	No. I won't give you a moment's grace. This is where it ends!
076	Tsk! You won't even let me get a word in...?! In that case...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
077	Wh-whoa...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
078	Seriously... You may be getting worked up, but...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
079	I have here one of your precious comrades. If I were to use her as a shield like this...
080	You're an idiot.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
081	Huh?
082	You really don't know anything about us, do you? Look.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
083	...?! He-hey...didn't you hear me?! Can't you see her here?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
084	From the moment we each became a Paladin, we resolved ourselves to our fate.	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
085	In order to rid this world of any and all threats, we are more than willing to sacrifice ourselves. Isn't that right, Kagura?
086	Of course.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
087	...!
088	We of the Holy Guard will never succumb to you and your kind! Twin Fang God Wolf!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0013
089	Argh! Dodge it!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
090	Whoa...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
091	That was close... What power! Hey...are you okay, redhead?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
092	How about you worry about yourself instead?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
093	What?
094	Where did all those arrows come from?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0026
095	You've been targeted from every angle. You have nowhere to run. Goodbye.
096	Ack...?! Arghhhhhhh!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
097	Yes...! Seida!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0024
098	...No!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
099	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
100	That impact just now...that wasn't my technique!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
101	I think you should retract that last goodbye.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
102	?!
103	You suppress your emotions and calmly take down your enemy. I'll have to admit, I don't dislike your composed attitude.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
104	Hey, you...do you want to be my woman?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
105	Sol...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
106	Ack! Sorry, but I'm not into kids!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
107	I see. That's unfortunate.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
108	Huh...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
109	The Alize people settlement...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
110	No matter how much I fall for a woman, it goes against my philosophy to obtain her by force.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
111	From behind...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
112	Even if I were to obtain someone by force, their heart will never belong to me. It's unfortunate.
113	Aghh!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
114	Seidaaaa!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0028
