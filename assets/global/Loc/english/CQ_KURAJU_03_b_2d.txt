001	Phew... I think that's all of them. Damn, I'm out of ammo...	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
002	Courage, watch out! I'm still picking up a signal for another exosuit!
003	Forgot about me, huh?! Get ready to meet your maker!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
004	You're kidding! I thought we'd got them all!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
005	Crap, gotta reload!	VO_courage.courage_battle_0019
006	Raaaaaaaagh!
007	Wha—?
008	What the...?! Another suit?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
009	Courage!	VO_regen.regen_battle_0020
010	Oof... Damn...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
011	Now that was close.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0018
012	You two holdin' up okay?
013	We are, thanks to you. But why did you help us?	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
014	We heard the caravan was being attacked, so we flew on over to do what we could.
015	I'm glad you did. You probably just saved my life.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0033
016	No sweat! It'd be a waste not to put these suits to good use, seein' as we've got 'em and all.
017	Well, I appreciate it. I've gotten some great data out of this.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0045
018	I reckon we can handle things from here. See you 'round!
019	Hmm... So that's the crux of it.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
020	Figured something out?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
021	Maybe so. I've realized that deciding who to trust with your creation is the most critical part of development, as well as the most challenging.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
022	Deciding who to trust...
023	(That reminds me of the first time my dad ever let me hold a gun.)
024	That thing in your hands could kill a man stone dead with a twitch of a finger. A gun is a powerful weapon, kid—and an even bigger responsibility.
025	You mustn't ever point a gun at a living creature unless it's for the right reasons, and you must be ready for the consequences.
026	Con-se-que...? Daddy, you're using big words.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
027	Maybe you're a bit young for this, huh? Then just remember this: Only point your muzzle where your convictions tell you to.
028	My dad trusted me with this gun, as well as his faith that I'd use it well.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0005
029	He taught me that a gun is just like any other tool. It can take a life just as easily as it can entertain a crowd at a sports contest.
030	Guns are capable of anything, he said. That's why we have to be certain to use them for good.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
031	He taught me by example to never point my gun at a living creature unless I'm certain it's the right thing to do.
032	So I know in my heart that he'd never betray those convictions.
033	Based on the available evidence, I think your conclusion is sound. Unfortunately, the only way to get a complete picture is to meet your father in the flesh.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
034	...
035	I think I do want to see him after all. I need to know the truth of him.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
036	Finally made a decision, then? What a fruitful trip this has been.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0044
037	Yeah, I think I have. Thanks, Reagan.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0033
038	Not at all. You'll function more efficiently with a clear head, and you'll treat your weapon better, too.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
039	Don't worry. My clubbing days are over, I promise!
040	Anyway, we should get back. The sooner I get packed, the sooner I can start looking for my dad.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
