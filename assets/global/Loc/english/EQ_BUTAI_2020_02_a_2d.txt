001	It's not like me to do any teaching, but let me ask you this.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
002	Do you think there's such a thing as perfection?
003	Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)
004	The world as it is now can hardly be called perfect—not by a long shot.
005	Yet is perfection even achievable? Of course, we ought to strive for a perfect world, but perfection in and of itself might be something twisted.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
006	Perhaps seeking perfection is just another form of pride.
007	...
008	All we can do is our best, and continue to pass this task onto the next generation.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
009	Records of those who have done so before us can be found throughout history, and traces of them remain in ruins such as these.
010	My goal is to unravel these things; to uncover the future that our ancestors sought for Babel.
011	Is that why you told us not to come looking for you?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
012	Those who wish to improve the future should first consider the past.
013	You're saying that we should turn our attention to history, and use that knowledge to gain a fresh perspective and learn new things about the present?
014	Exactly. And the greatest role I can contribute is that of the observer.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
015	What do you mean?
016	This is what I was born to do. The more I delve into these secrets, the more I want to know. I won't rest until I've dredged up the deepest and most ancient secrets of the past.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
017	Of course, not even these ancient records are perfect. There will be parts that I simply cannot penetrate, and parts that have been lost to time.
018	That's where my talent for inspired understanding comes in handy. When something's missing, I fill in the gaps—but that's half the fun.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
019	I don't understand.
020	I didn't expect you to.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
021	...
022	Kaya... You're needed.
023	Oh?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
024	The Holy Guard needs your strength.
025	You really don't understand, do you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
026	I just told you I didn't.
027	No, not that. I'm talking about me.
028	Enlighten me, then.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
029	You're a blockhead.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
030	That doesn't tell me anything.
031	You're a mystery to me, as well, you know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
032	What?
033	You've said that you want to become the light that illuminates this world.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
034	Right. And?
035	That fire has burned consistently within you. You reached the top of the Holy Guard, you became Lord Commander... and throughout it all, your dedication to the justice of the continent has not waned.
036	You continue to seek perfect, complete peace, even though it does not exist. Why?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
037	Simple. As Lord Commander, my purpose—
038	I'm not asking for the Holy Guard's stance on this. I'm asking for your own reasoning.
039	I...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
040	I'm sure that's the correct answer for a Lord Commander to give...
041	But it doesn't sound like you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
042	I...
043	I've been observing you for a very long time now, you know. I know you better than anyone.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
044	I... I am driven to pursue peace for the sake of the people of this world.
045	Hmph.
046	What was wrong with that answer?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
047	Really, now... Are you trying to provoke me?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
048	I could ask you the same question!
049	You said that the Holy Guard needs me. Correct?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
050	Yes.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
051	My strength?
052	What are you getting at?
053	If strength is all it takes to restore peace to this world, then make me return by force.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
054	H-hold on, Kaya! I'm not here to fight you!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
055	Ever the pacifist.
056	Hmhm... This exchange is making me rather nostalgic.
057	I've never understood what makes you tick. Never.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
058	Sometimes I don't know, myself.
059	What?
060	There are times when even I don't understand myself.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
