001	Grooooooarrrgghhh!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0001
002	H-hey! Nyx?! Are you okay?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
003	Ah, I'm fine, I'm fine... I just used a little too much magil...so I can't move...
004	I'm willing to bet that Mira collapsed in the castle just like me... There really is no end to her nonsense...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
005	I'm sorry. I may have pushed you both too hard.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
006	How are things here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
007	We've somehow lured Leviathan all the way to the border, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
008	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhh!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
009	Well, you saw what happened there... It somehow turns its surroundings into more ocean.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
010	...That water manipulation technique again, I see. If we don't do something about that, we stand no chance of winning against it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
011	You guys were looking for a way to deal with that, right? I'm assuming you're here 'cause you figured something out.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
012	Of course.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
013	...
014	Long time no see, little lady. Don't tell me—that's the Silver Shield?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
015	Hm, the shape looks the same, but it's giving me a different vibe now.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
016	That's because the shield was reborn as a Gear of Judgement.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
017	We've granted it a new name to honor the legend of the first shield maiden in this area: "Mesarthim."
018	And there's this...
019	Huh, you got something for me too?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
020	This pitch-black sword is called Hamal. When paired with Mesarthim, it forms a Gear of Judgement called Aries.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
021	Oh, so it's a set! Um... Why?
022	Mesarthim... The shield specializes in one specific thing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
023	Namely, repelling threats and establishing safety. Also known as the Silver Shield's divine protection.
024	However, that alone will not topple a Cursed Beast. Defense and offense are two sides of the same coin.
025	That's why we created the pitch-black sword "Hamal". We've imbued the blade with Anti-Curse magic, which should allow you to cut through Leviathan's carapace.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
026	Why are you giving it to me?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
027	Because I assumed that we'd have to fight against the Leviathan at sea.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
028	It's already hard enough to walk on water, and that's without a beast that can create tsunamis as an obstacle.
029	That means you'll need a place to walk, a path that can be created and adjusted on the fly as the battle rages.
030	Me and Yna will create such a thing by freezing the water through the power of Alchemy.
031	However, if the two of us are occupied, that doesn't leave a lot of people to actually battle the Cursed Beast.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
032	I see. So that's where me and the little lady come in. The perfect job for a pair of knights!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
033	Ack! Hey, think you can wrap up the strategy meeting?! I'm at my limit here, so put that plan into action already!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
034	Got it. Yna, are you ready?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
035	Yes. This Sephirium Sword was forged so it could amplify your alchemy.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
036	Let's see what it can do.
037	Here we go!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
038	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
039	"O Lord, though to supplicate is to be impertinent—"	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0004
040	...Yeah, this should work.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
041	Groooooarrrghh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0021
042	It's coming!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
043	Tch! The ice isn't stable yet! Still...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
044	Mesarthim, please lend me your strength...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0015
045	Whoa! Never thought I'd see an ice path in the middle of the ocean!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0009
046	Too bad there's not time to appreciate the sight. Time to fight!
047	We'll back you up with Spiritbonding!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
048	Thank you!
049	Imnus will be leading a unit our way too, but we don't have the time to wait for him.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
050	Which means... Daphne! Andechs! This battle is yours!
051	Ours...
052	Oh, we know! Don't we, little lady?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
053	What a question for a much stronger knight to ask someone like me with a smile.
054	He treats me as an equal.
055	(Now I think about it, it's always been like this. I've been supported by many, treated so well by many...)
056	Honestly, I still can't shake my fear. I'm so jealous of this knight that never seems to lose his fighting spirit.
057	(But even if that doesn't change, even if envy burns in my chest, I will keep facing forward.)
058	(Since I was asked to keep facing that way, so...)
059	Yes, we can do it! The two of us can do whatever we put our minds to!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
060	Oooh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
061	Uhm... What is it?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
062	Nothing! That's the spirit! I'll leave the defense to you, you leave the offensive to me!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0041
063	Let's hunt ourselves a Cursed Beastie!
064	Ah, but it looks like we gotta deal with some of its "leftovers" first! Don't let your guard down everyone!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
065	We've got the stage, so let's put on a good show! Whaddaya say, little lady?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
066	This is just the opening act, but it'll make for a decent warm up.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
067	I will do my very best!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
