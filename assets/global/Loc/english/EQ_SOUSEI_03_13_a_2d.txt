001	A black knight... Could he be...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
002	I'm sure of it. He's the corruption wielder who killed the last Vessel of Purification!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
003	We of the Infinite Serpent intend to save this world. Our goal is not to extend the duration of this filth-ridden land.
004	What harm could there be in leaving just one place steeped in sin like so?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
005	Can you not forgive such a small and insignificant blemish?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
006	...
007	If this little experiment succeeds, the Cursed Beasts will no longer be a threat to humanity.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
008	Then, we will have no reason to fear that little thing called "sin".	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
009	By owning up to their own sins and using them as a resource, every region could achieve new heights of development.
010	What brighter future could there be for the world?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
011	With minimal sacrifice, we could open the future to so many more...
012	That is the mission I delegated to myself as a researcher.
013	It's the very reason I live; the reason why I feel I deserve to exist.
014	Do you see? This is my salvation, Zafeiris.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
015	It seems that we cannot see eye to eye. As such, we can no longer remain allies.
016	It is time for you to be swallowed up by Belphegor's corruption.
017	Such is a fitting end for you.
018	Hm...?
019	I may not have had an advantage in the tunnels, but this clocktower is also my research facility.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0025
020	Don't think that you can take me out so easily on my turf!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
021	This is the same substance as the belt of magil that restrains the Cursed Beast...?
022	Yes, but not only that...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
023	It's...absorbing magil?!
024	This magil belt is an Anti-Curse device I created to quell the Cursed Beasts.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
025	Unless I'm quite mistaken, it should have a profound effect on the Fallen and those like yourself who use the power of corruption to your own ends.
026	You underestimate me.
027	Huh?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0026
028	"O Belphegor! Devour the Sloth that glints in thine eye!"
029	Groooogghhhh!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0028_a
030	The Cursed Beast... It's moving?!
031	Warning! Belphegor has partially overcome the restraints of the magil belt and is presently drawing on a vast quantity of magil from its outer shell.
032	No! Our bid for control...!	VO_icona.icona_battle_0022
033	Down with you, Pursuer of Sloth.
034	...
035	You will not escape. Your obsession with the future you dream of ends here!
036	"I am the key that opens the gate!"
037	Tch!
038	I didn't expect to run into you here and now, but I have a whole lot of questions for you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
039	Well, well, a survivor of the Sephira... The inhabitants of the Gula Belt Region who wield strange powers...
040	Nimul?!
041	Adaleigh! Get out of here and join up with the others!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
042	No, but—!
043	This man... He's the one who killed Emmel's predecessor...
044	Do you understand what that means?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
045	I... I do! Leave Emmel to me!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
046	Come on, Emmel!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
047	B-but...
048	Emmel...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
049	If... If you're fighting, I'll stay and fight, too!
050	There's no need. Have faith in me.
051	Nimul... Okay. I will. Just...be safe!	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
052	You may not believe me, but I will say it anyway...
053	I have no interest in that woman.
054	Either way, I cannot just let you walk out of here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
055	You're the one who threw our village—our home—into chaos! I can't just forget that!
056	Revenge, is it?
057	Maybe so, but it doesn't end there.
058	You've said it before... That you mean to save the world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
059	So why do you align yourself with the Cursed Beasts? Do you mean to steep the world in corruption?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
060	There is no point in answering you.
061	I just... I can't see you as someone who wants to hurt others and stamp out their hopes! That kind of villainy...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
062	Is necessary.
063	What?
064	I am willing to soak myself in sin in order to save this world. Such is the depth of my conviction.
065	No matter how much blood must be spilled... If it saves the world, then it is worth it.
066	There really is no meeting halfway for you and I, then... Our ways of thinking, and the futures we strive toward are just too different.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
067	What will it be, then?
068	I will defeat you here and now, and then join my companions to take on Belphegor.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
069	I see... Then you believe the world can be saved that way.
070	What do you—?
071	You have been found guilty of this crime. By the power invested in me, I sentence you!
