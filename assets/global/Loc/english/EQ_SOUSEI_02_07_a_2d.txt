001	Those who had partaken in lust became insects. In the end, it meant that everyone did.
002	That was the curse that the Cursed Beast inflicted upon this region. The new reality that it had shaped for us, which became our inescapable truth.
003	Why have I been spared? I was only a child when the curse was cast.
004	Just a child, who knew nothing of love or lust; who barely knew anything about anything.
005	Of course, I was not the only one. However, as we grew older, the remaining children became insects, one by one.
006	They were useless, apathetic people who did not share my goals to save this world. In the end, they all turned.
007	Only myself and my...special apprentices remained.
008	I do not know love. I do not even understand what that word means. How is it different from lust? I know only that it is useless to my research.
009	However...there are things I do understand. These feelings deeply-rooted in my being that I cannot contain...
010	Hate. Fury. Despair. I will never forgive. I will never forget. My hometown, my childhood, all that was taken from me...
011	That gentle place in my memories, its tree-lined streets, the leaves rustling in the wind...
012	The laughter of the people around me, the joy in their faces that I didn't understand... All of it, frozen in time, lost to both present and future.
013	Even now I cannot accept it. That is why it must fall.
014	The Cursed Beast will fall by my hand. The creature that stole everything from me... I will rob it of everything, including its very life.
015	Why do I despise the Cursed Beast so much? To be honest, I barely understand that hatred myself.
016	Or...
017	Perhaps...it is because I loved the people of this region, who will never be returned to me as they were.
018	Grooooooooooaagh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0019
019	That light...!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
020	Magic? The beast's shell is damaged!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
021	Was that...Ambrosia's...? What?! But I thought the rod hadn't been completed yet?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
022	Huh? What're you on about, Nyx?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
023	That light is from the magic rod Libra, which Ambrosia created to destroy Asmodeus!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
024	But...it hasn't been charged enough yet! We haven't finished our preparations! It doesn't have the power to take down the Cursed Beast right now!
025	Wait, so you're saying that it can't defeat the Cursed Beast?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
026	Nyx!
027	Mira! What's going on?! Why is Ambrosia using Libra?! What is she doing?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
028	I don't know! I have no idea what's happening either! All I know is that we need to get you lot out of here!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
029	Come on, Nyx! Give me your hand! I can't take this many back on my own!
030	Got it! Here we go!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
031	Tsk... This amount of power isn't enough to overcome the beast's healing ability.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
032	After all that time and effort put into trying to stockpile enough energy to damage you... Well, at least I'll be able to help the young ones escape with—
033	What the⁠—?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
034	Hey, Ambrosia...what's the point of this? Why don't you just give it up?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0001
035	Yeah, Ambrosia. Really... Why even bother? All this hatred, anger, and whatever else... Where has it ever gotten you?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0005
036	Mira? Nyx? No...
037	Asmodeus, you fiend... You must have made use of the same Space-Time Manipulation technique after seeing them in that ship.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0029
038	The future has an unlimited number of possibilities.
039	You filtered through all of them with Space-Time Manipulation and found one in which my apprentices had fallen to the corruption, then dragged them here?!
040	Leave the magic rod, Ambrosia. Forget this pointless revenge...and just rest with us.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0007
041	You don't have to carry so much responsibility all on your own. Is this world really worth saving? If you think about it, it really isn't, is it?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0010
042	You want Libra?! Don't think I'll make it easy for you to take it from me!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0013
043	(Still...this isn't looking good.)
044	(Most of my magil is being poured into Libra.)
045	(I really have no idea how long I can keep this up...)
046	Well, I suppose I have no choice but to make this work.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
047	Why? Why work so hard, even though it may all come to nothing?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0016
048	Huh?!
049	No matter how far you might have fallen, Space-Time Manipulation is subject to the same rules.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
050	You're on my turf now. I don't believe you can connect to the magil here as easily as you would like.
051	This is really becoming a hassle...	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0017
052	Still...can you handle this?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0007
053	Oh no! I—!
054	Gnrgh...!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0025
055	Heh. Perfectly executed, if I do say so myself. I suppose the us from this timeline haven't quite gotten the hang of magic yet.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0004
056	This shouldn't...be possible. Your magil should have been altered in order for you to use Space-Time Manipulation.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
057	You shouldn't be able to use magic!
058	How to explain this? I suppose you could say that we're...hybrids. There are an infinite number of timelines, and we're the sum of various parts taken from several different possible versions of us.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0005
059	Which means our pasts are just as uncertain as our futures.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0005
060	We two who the witch never took in as disciples, who were left to our own fates.
061	We two who were never loved by the witch who might have cared for us.
062	We two who never learned of her hatred, never sought to carry on the legacy of revenge she carried.
063	We two who have always wanted an opportunity to do this. The opportunity to kill the witch!	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0008
064	Asmodeus... How dare you drag my apprentices into something like this! How could you do this to them?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0013
065	This has been fun, witch. What was your name again? Oh, yeah. Goodbye, Ambrosia.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0008
066	The light is...fading?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
067	And the magic attacks from the witch's house have ceased...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
068	Nimul, you don't think...? It can't be...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
069	Hurry!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
070	We're back! Ambrosia?!
071	Ambrosia, tell us what's⁠—!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
072	Huh?!
073	Ugh, I'm gonna hurl. This method of travel is seriously no good for my stomach.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0028
074	Adaleigh. Ready your weapon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
075	Huh? What're you talking about, old dog?
076	The enemy is here.
077	Huh? Uh...Mira? Nyx? What're you...? Grandmother?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
078	Is everyone all right? Wait...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
079	Ambrosia...? Wh-what happened?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
080	You're the ones from earlier!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
081	Whoops. You're back already?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0044
082	Guess there's nothing for it. Given the chance, I would've preferred to take some of you out before it came to this, but...
083	Asmodeus was getting impatient. You'd think a Cursed Beast wouldn't be such an incompetent boss, but appearances can be deceiving.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0030
084	I see the Beast's point, though. It's not like we could just leave this magic rod alone. Something had to be done about it, sooner rather than later.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0030
085	No! Anything but that, you can't—!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
086	Give it back, or else. You can't just start taking Ambrosia's stuff!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
087	Well, well. Figured it'd come to this, but it's still a pain in the butt.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0006
088	Go ahead. Try and take it back.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0010
089	Emmel, the witch needs healing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0041
090	Understood!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
091	Everyone else, if you would lend me your aid... We must help Mira and Nyx defeat those Fallen!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
