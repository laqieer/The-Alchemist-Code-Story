001	I see. Suspicious humans in the forest...
002	That's right! We have Yura to thank that there were no injuries. She was patrolling there.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
003	Please, if you hadn't come when you did, I would be dead... I can't do anything myself...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
004	But if you hadn't been there, some of the villagers may have been injured.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
005	Not to mention, a therian could have been kidnapped. It's thanks to you that nothing happened.
006	There's been a number of reports of therians being taken from Envylia's forests. I'm in the middle of investigating these disappearances.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
007	The woman in the village was saying something about that too... You knew about this, captain?	VO_yura.yura_sys_0001
008	Yes. We're still investigating, but... It's possible that there's a group trafficking people.
009	Therians are often targets of such things.
010	...
011	It is our duty to protect all citizens of Envylia. We've been carrying out our investigation in secret so as to avoid drawing unwanted attention.
012	I volunteered to help. As a special forces unit, a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doesn't draw suspicion if they're traveling all over the place.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
013	When I heard that therians were being targeted, I couldn't just sit around and do nothing.
014	I...see...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0042
015	(Missions really are different when you get to Vice-Captain...)
016	(She really is amazing... She can do all that by herself.)
017	...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0030
018	To think they'd appear in the forest this close to the capital... It seems the situation has become worse than we thought. Commander Yura.
019	Y-yes!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0004
020	This is an order. I'd like you to cooperate with Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain D'Artagnan here and look into the situation.
021	M-me?! I don't know how much help a little platoon commander like me will be to a Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard...
022	Don't talk like that! We're buddies, aren't we? We joined at the same time!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0005
023	Th-that's true, but...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0016
024	Many of the therians who have come to Envylia came because they were targeted for being therian. I'm sure you're aware of this.
025	Because of this, many therians are increasingly unwilling to trust humans. That's why I'd like the two of you on this.
026	...
027	Commander Yura, this is a perfect chance to prove your talents.
028	Captain...	VO_yura.yura_battle_0019
029	I understand. I'll do my best.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0004
030	Good. Good luck.
031	Hooray! You always were the best at tracking in our class! This'll be easy with you aboard!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0009
032	I don't know about that...
033	We've had reports of our targets using incantation gear that suppresses the power of therians. Be careful.
034	Will do! Let's protect everyone together, Yura!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0038
035	Y-yeah...
036	...
