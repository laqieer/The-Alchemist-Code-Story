001	A trap?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
002	Your conceit in believing your alchemy would help you come out on top in any situation, has become the cause of your downfall.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0016
003	We, the Sephira, have a thorough knowledge of alchemy.
004	Though we may not be able to wield alchemy, we know plenty of methods to neutralize it.
005	Kill me already.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
006	No. You will live. You still have information we need.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
007	What makes you think I will talk?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
008	Whether you divulge information to us or not is irrelevant. You have already served your purpose.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0011
009	What?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
010	That we Fruit Peddlers were able to defeat a special ops team from the Holy Guard... That fact alone is valuable knowledge.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
011	Even if you lot are nothing more than traitors who defected to Gluttony as loyal followers of Ceclidis.
012	You mean to tell me you pitched a battle and captured us...only as a warning to other organizations?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
013	That's exactly what we did. Take them away.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
014	What just happened...?
015	Sorry to get you involved, but there is something you should know if you consider yourself to be a noble of the desert.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
016	We may have lost almost all of our abilities, but our blood is still strongly attuned to the use of Alchemia.
017	Those who have been quietly watching us from the shadows have recently emerged, hunting us down to take advantage of our blood.
018	Is that why Mother wanted me to stop pursuing my heritage?
019	Most likely. There is no need for those without the sephirah to be targeted.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
020	It would be inadvisable for we, the hunted, to lend you our aid; both for your safety and for the sake of your cause.
021	That is why we cannot walk the same path as you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
022	I...understand.
023	So this is goodbye. Though we may be following different paths, I pray that hope will light your way.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
024	Someday...
025	Someday, I will help bring vitality back to the desert!
026	I believe this will bring the people of this country together.
027	This country will eventually be a place where people can smile and be happy, from the bottom of their hearts.
028	I hope you are right.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
