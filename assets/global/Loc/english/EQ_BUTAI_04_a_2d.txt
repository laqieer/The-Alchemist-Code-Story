001	...
002	I'm sorry.
003	This isn't your fault. Please, don't apologize.
004	...
005	Forgive me. I can't even get you out of here.
006	This is all I can do.
007	This is...the dance of Wadatsumi.
008	All I can do is pray for your safety and well-being. All I can do is infuse this dance with how I feel, and dedicate it to you.
009	Chihaya...
010	Get rid of Chihaya, Kuza.
011	Wh-what?!
012	We needed her to manipulate the people of Wadatsumi and to draw the Holy Guard here. She has outlived her usefulness.
087	She will simply vanish if you undo the Alchemy you did that keeps her in this world.
088	She will dissipate on her own. Why must I go out of my way to do that?
089	I must see your determination.
090	You do not yet have my complete confidence.
091	...
013	...
014	Kuza!
015	You were ordered to eliminate me, weren't you?
016	I...!
017	No! Run, Chihaya!
018	It's fine. I've died once already.
019	Chihaya!
020	But please, as a parting gift... Tell me. Why do you work for Orion?
021	...
022	All those who live here know how much you've done for Wadatsumi.
023	So...why? Why are you doing this?
024	What difference would it make even if I were to tell you?
025	It makes all the difference to me. I want to know what is going through the mind of the one who takes my life.
026	Or are you telling me to die without knowing why? Like the people of Wadatsumi?
027	...
028	I entrusted the fate of Wadatsumi to you. I believe I have the right to know.
029	Entrusted?
030	P-please...
031	Please... Save...Wadatsumi.
032	You remember that?
033	How could I forget? I have faith in what lies deep within your heart.
034	...
035	I can see that you're trying to shoulder the burden all by yourself! Your commitment has even brought you to a place where you're playing the role of a villain.
036	Aren't you fighting for the restoration of Wadatsumi?!
037	Can we not work together, hand in hand?!
038	...
039	Why do you care so much about me? I'm nothing more than a deplorable villain.
040	Because I am here.
041	I never stopped praying for the sake of Wadatsumi. Even after my death.
042	It was your hope, your desire, that answered my prayers. Even though you can't use Alchemy, it was you. Am I wrong?
043	...
044	What do you mean?
092	Somehow, it was Kuza who summoned me. Waginau then bound me to this world, so that they could use me as they saw fit.
093	What an unorthodox summoning... That explains why I couldn't sense any Alchemia from you.
094	That summoning, distorted though it may be, shows how much you care for Wadatsumi.
095	The fact that I am here is proof that you still haven't given up on Wadatsumi.
096	Though I do find it vexing to be bound here against my will.
097	Is such a miracle even—?
045	Heh. Hahahah...hahahahahahah!
046	Kuza?
047	Was it really so foolish to try going on the offensive, once being on the defensive proved fruitless?
048	Wh-what?
049	I saw you dance. It was breathtaking. It was as beautiful as the memories I have of Wadatsumi.
050	Every time I see you dance, I am reminded of what I must protect. Was I so wrong?
051	Kuza...
052	I joined him to gain power. I waited patiently for an opportunity to avenge my home. I fought to put an end to the fighting.
053	I did all this to seize peace through power so that Wadatsumi would never again come to ruin.
054	At the cost of the destruction of the other nations? Many innocent people will die.
055	That's right. I am too weak to defeat Orion. So I'm spreading the flames of war⁠, flames that scorch even my beloved Wadatsumi.
056	You're aware of this, and yet you still...?
057	I am mired in this mess, and I cannot escape. I will not escape.
058	Wh-why? Why must...?
059	What are you crying for?
060	Because...this is all wrong. Why must we fight you, when all you want is to protect Wadatsumi? We share the same goal!
061	Would Wadatsumi be saved if I stopped?
062	I... Well...
063	What about all those who have been sacrificed? What of all the time that has been dedicated to this so far?
064	This is why you have ended up alone and misunderstood. Taking it all on alone like this...!
065	Even if I stopped this right now...who could ever forgive all that I have done?
066	You're so much like Kudan.
067	He's here.
068	Huh?
069	...
070	You are still the Kuza I know.
071	Do you have to fight against Kudan? Is it not possible for you to fight together as blood brothers, side by side?
072	There are still things I must do.
073	But...!
074	Things I must do for him, as his older brother.
098	K-Kuza?
099	I have a foolish plan.
075	Kuza!
076	We're here for Kagura!
077	There is nothing left for us to say to each other. I am not here to reason with you.
078	I understand. It is time for us to test our justices against each other.
079	Is the stronger one the righteous?
080	No... The stronger one is the older brother.
081	You're speaking nonsense.
082	We each have a justice that we represent.
083	Then I need only win to prove that my justice is greater than yours. I won't lose to you, Kuza.
084	Heh. You've never defeated me before.
085	Today is the day I do.
086	I'd like to see you try.
