001	Dias, are you still mad? If I offended you, I'm sorry. It's just...
002	We all have our individual ways of thinking. Don't worry about it.
003	Our methodology may differ, but we're both aiming for a peaceful world without sorrow, right? Hehe.
004	Huh?
005	Haha! After all, we've become knights who can "create a world where Agatha can be happy."	VO_dios.dios_sys_0008
006	You still remember that, Dias? Hahaha! Right!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0008
007	Creating a gentle and peaceful world for crybaby Agatha—that's our chivalry!
008	Yes. I'll use my own way to create a peaceful world. Our attack against the Lizard Brigade is just the first step!
009	Yeah! That said, why are they heading to the ruins?
010	Their aim, most likely, is the monsters who inhabit the Gilrack Ruins.
011	Father! 
012	When Alchemy was declared a forbidden art, the Gilrack Ruins was where the rebel Alchemists barricaded themselves.
013	It's said that numerous Philosopher's Stones remain there.
014	Philosopher's Stones? Are those the phantom stones that allow its owner to wield Alchemy easily?
015	Yes. The monsters inhabiting the area are said to have consumed those Philosopher's Stones.
016	If the rebel army wishes to wield Alchemy, those consumed Philosopher's Stones are their aim.
017	It'll be troublesome if they fall into the hands of Wratharis! Let's hurry!
