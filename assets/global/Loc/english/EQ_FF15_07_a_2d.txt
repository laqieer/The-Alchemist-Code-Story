001	I'm tired.	VO_noctis.noctis_chara_0006
002	Weak.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0011
003	Actually, I would agree that some form of respite is in order.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0020
004	Once we're in Slothstein there's no predicting what might happen. It might be better for us to rest a little.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
005	Indeed. Let's recuperate in that village.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0004
006	I hope they sell some kind of recovery item there. Like a Chocobo! Dude, I'd love a Chocobo just about now!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1031
007	There's a river. We might be able to fish!	VO_noctis.noctis_chara_1012
008	How festive. Oh? That scent... I think I've just thought of a new recipe.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0007
009	You're not going with them?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
010	They'll be fine on their own.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0006
011	... ...
012	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_chara_0009
013	...Who are you guys?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
014	Well, we might as well tell you. That's the Prince over there and we're his loyal companions.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0007
015	...Prince?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	Noct...Noctis Lucis Caelum. Appearances aside, he's the Prince of Lucis.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0005
017	I see...
018	And who are you?	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0001
019	I am Dias Elysion. I am a knight.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
020	So...you're a knight. I was getting that vibe from you. You might've not guessed it from the look of me, but I happen to be the Shield of the King.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0020
021	... ...
022	We were sent by his father...the king...to escort him. You're not buying it from the look on your face.
023	...You don't really seem like an escort.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
024	Guess you could say we're more like companions.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0008
025	You've got the smell of a lone wolf about you.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
026	... ...
027	(That's right. I chose to go my own path. Logi and Agatha wanted us to continue together, but it's too late for that now.)
028	Gladiolus! Over there, in that river...
029	... ...
030	Hm? What's going on here?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
031	I just informed him that we're traveling with Crown Prince under the orders of the king.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0005
032	...I see.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0044
033	Dias?! Who would've thought we'd find you here...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
034	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
035	Who are you guys?!	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0028
036	You traitor!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0012
