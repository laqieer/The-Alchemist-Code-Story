001	How? How could you break up my formation…?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
002	Your downfall was in repeating the same tricks. Any tactic can be dismantled if you're prepared.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
003	…Haha…I should've expected as much from you…Pursuer.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
004	But…I'll never give up…!
005	Don't be a sore loser!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
006	You're in no state to travel through time, anyway…
007	It's not a matter of can or cannot. I WILL…
008	Everything I've done up until now has been for this moment.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
009	Leaving my hometown, going into hiding…years and years of tireless research!
010	I can finally return…to that day. To our promised place…
011	I will save her! I will protect her! That's my reason for existing! That, and nothing else…
012	Even if her memory is gone…I just want to see her again…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0018
013	…You're wrong, Quence.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
014	…What?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
015	I don't think Master has forgotten. I mean, she was always looking up at the sky.
016	Snowy days, stormy days, even the unusual cloudy days--She was always looking to the skies.
017	Waiting for someone to return on a flying broom.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
018	That's why you should've visited her.
019	I bet if you had, she'd have welcomed you with open arms.
020	…
021	Pff Ha ha… Yeah right…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
022	My, how the pupil takes after the teacher. Both silver-tongued…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0022
023	Is it…finally over?
024	…
025	What the--	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
026	The corrupted magil is...increasing?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
027	…! Daphne! We need Mesarthim!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
028	Got it!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
029	The flames of corruption are…coalescing?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
030	Now, that Satna's free of Quence's control, it's trying to revert to its original form!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
031	What kind of form is that?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
032	*Roar*	VO_satan.satan_battle_0001
033	Ah, ahh…	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0027
034	I remember seeing the same thing at the borderlands…
035	Ah…Ahhh!
036	*ROAR*	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0021
037	*Snarl*	VO_satan.satan_battle_0002
038	Daphne, hang in there! We've got your back!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
039	…T-Thanks! I'm okay!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
040	It's HUGE! Is this what we've been fighting all along?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
041	*Bellow*	VO_satan.satan_battle_0003
042	…Bloody hell! It's trying to make the volcano erupt!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
043	…We're trapped…	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
044	Brace yourselves, everybody!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
045	We must defeat Satna to put an end to the "night of fire rain!"
046	Copy that!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
047	The influence of the Ira Belt's magil is strong… Libra, maximize pressure!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0032
048	Red Blade! Fulfill your mission!	VO_slba.slba_battle_0004
049	Alright, the magil in the area is stabilized--but not for long!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
050	…It should be enough time. Andechs, is your Hamal ready?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
051	Damn right! Finally, this is what I've been waiting for!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
052	I'll channel every fiber of my being into this sword.
053	Now give us back our homeland, Satna!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0011
