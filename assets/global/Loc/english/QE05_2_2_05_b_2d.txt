001	No matter how many I take down, they just keep coming back!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
002	I told you, all I needed was for you to buy me some time. You cannot defeat them. They are beyond this world, ghosts without real substance or will.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
003	Come, Kamui. Look.
004	This is your home. This is the miracle that you have brought forth as the last Protector of the Sephira!
005	Lord Waginau?! Y-you're...?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
006	Nngh... It seems like perhaps I overdid it. I suppose it was only to be expected, having used the Burning Seal to seal Sephiron.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
007	However, it was not all for naught. The Door within Sephiron has been closed, and shades have been drawn against the maleficent light shining down upon these lands.
008	Kamui, you who are my last disciple...
009	Yes, Lord Waginau?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
010	This is goodbye. Ha. Now that I think of it, you are the only disciple I have ever had.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
011	...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
012	Now this world has lost Sephiron, the Tree of Life. Such a waste... Another light lost from this world...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
013	Heed my words, Kamui. This will be a troubled time for the Sephira.
014	The world will treat the Sephira with suspicion. Fear and distrust will come to eclipse justice.
015	Remember that Emmel's deepest wish was, and always will be, this: "Even so, live on!"
016	Y-yes! I won't forget!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
017	Good. Then, you who remind me of who I once was... Farewell.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
018	Lord Waginau! No...but...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
019	There will be time to grieve later. First, I must rejoin the Liberation Army.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
020	I must go see what the situation is outside.
