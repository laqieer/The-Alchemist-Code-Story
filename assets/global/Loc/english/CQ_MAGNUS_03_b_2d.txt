001	Huff...huff...
002	Someone help. Woody...old man...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0028
003	Jeez. I guess I take second place to Woody. Oh well.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
004	Old man!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0019
005	You're safe. Honestly, don't do that to yourself.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0002
006	You're a kid. It's best that you act like one and hide behind my back.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
007	Well...I want to be useful to everyone.	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
008	Jeez... You're really similar to my sister in that way as well	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
009	You have a sister, old man?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
010	Yes...but I haven't seen her in a while.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
011	I abandoned both Alchemy and my family.
012	Why...?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
013	Whatever you might think of me now, I used to be called a genius Alchemist.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
014	But I got sick of it halfway through. After all, Alchemy can only create fake results.
015	In order to achieve true results, you have to achieve it with your own two hands. That's why I discarded Alchemy.
016	My family had placed their hopes in my talent of becoming an Alchemist.
017	That's why we ended up drifting apart, and that was that.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
018	Old man...that's not good!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0014
019	Mia?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0025
020	You're amazing, old man, so hang in there!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0012
021	Both Woody and I believed that you would come save us.
022	I was really surprised by the magic you showed me before.
023	You're not a fake, old man.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
024	...!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
025	For me, both you and Woody are real.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0011
026	I see...
027	(I wonder why I cared so much about what was fake and what was real.)
028	(After all, they're just tools that can be used to bring about results.)
029	(If it can be used to protect someone or make them smile...)
030	(That's right. I first started learning Alchemy, because I wanted to make my little sister smile.)
031	Mia, thank you. Woody, help us out as well.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0033
032	I'm going to rethink the way that I use this power. I'm going to try facing myself.
033	I appreciate you providing me with this opportunity.
034	Old man...
035	Just...one thing: I'm not an old man.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0047
036	All right, got it, Magnus!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0006
037	Seriously...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
038	(Even her smile is just like my sister's.)
