001	It's... It's you!
002	You're the one Soren went after!
003	...
004	Enough chatter. Come quietly or we'll make you wish you had.
005	That's what you think!
006	Annoying...
007	Impossible... She cut through them like aluminum foil!
008	Who ARE these people?
009	Blair, take Eira and Soren and leave, now!
010	Going somewhere?
011	Red, watch them. But make sure they're in one piece, or Queen is going to throw a fit.
012	Noted.
013	(Sieg, you dummy... Where are you?!)
014	No... Go away!
015	Well, well, if it isn't the little one. I'd recognize that hair anywhere.
016	Now, be a good girl and come with me, and no one gets hurt.
017	NO!
018	Eira...protect Big Bro!!
019	What's going on?
020	Eira!?
021	Eira, is that you!?
022	*gasp*
023	E-Emmy?
024	Why... Here...
025	Uuugh...!
026	Eira! Eira, no!
027	My sister needs medical attention immediately!
028	You do that. We're done here.
029	This ain't worth the pay...
030	Red!
031	Yes, Godslayer.
032	Secure the area. I'll take care of this one myself.
