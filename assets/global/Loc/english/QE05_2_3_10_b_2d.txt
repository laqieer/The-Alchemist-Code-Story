001	Nnrgh?!
002	Hm. Even if it is just a diversion, it looks like they are sending some of their people this way.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
003	Strange... I seem to sense something. Within my soul, the last of Sephiron's fire is responding to...something...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
004	Here we go.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
005	Hey... Show yourself.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
006	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
007	...
008	I'm not detecting any living beings in this area... A trick of the light...? No, but I'm sure I felt someone watching me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
009	Ugh, am I being too sensitive? I don't have time for this.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
010	I can't return empty-handed like this. I have to get my hands on the reward I deserve!
011	A skill to move between dimensions...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
012	It seems he is slipping through reality using the same kind of techniques I use to connect to the Truth.
013	I've never considered doing such a thing before.
014	Interesting technique. I shall remember it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
015	Thus, the Fruit Peddlers grew in number.
016	More people joined, bringing more baggage...but we never forgot our goal to protect each other. Our bonds grew stronger as well.
017	I believe this is why Sephiron saved me.
018	We all experienced unimaginable devastation, but learned to keep moving forward, step by step.
019	This is how we rediscover the promise of our future.
020	I truly believe that.
021	A-are...you there?	VO_malta.malta_battle_1028
022	Yes, I'm here. I'll always be here.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
023	I...had a beautiful dream...of the past.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
024	The two of us...on a picnic...near Sephiron...
025	Yes, that's right. A picnic.
026	We made a promise... It was...sad, but...you came back... You really came back...	VO_malta.malta_battle_1028
027	Of course I did. How could I do anything else?
028	(Malta's condition isn't improving. It must be a result of the resurrection ceremony.)	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
029	(This illness has plagued her ever since we managed to escape that wave of the Jam and made it to this village.)
030	(I...want to believe that I have protected her to the best of my ability, but...)
031	(Some fragments of her memory started to return, but...now it's all gone again.)
032	Kamui... I'm so glad you made it out okay. I'm...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
033	Yes, yes... There's nothing left for you to worry about. Sleep easy, Malta.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
034	Papa, is Mama already asleep?
035	Ah... Yes. Mama's had a tough day.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
036	Why don't we let her rest a little longer?
037	Okay!
038	The world has lost all sense of itself.
039	People cannot save everything in sight. There will always be unexpected loss.
040	All this pain, all this loss... There has to be a reason for it. It must lead to a new hope for tomorrow.
041	That is what I want to believe.
