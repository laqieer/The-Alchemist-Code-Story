001	They are here, my Lord.
002	Excellent. The rest of you are dismissed.
003	Yes sir!
004	Welcome, welcome. Had I known I'd have such prestigious visitors, I would have prepared for your arrival in a more acceptable way.
005	Ah, but where are my manners. We have not introduced ourselves.
006	I am Zheng Yi, lord of a noble house of Greed Dike. No doubt you may have already heard of my... interests, in this town.
007	And this is Asuka, head of my house guard.
008	Greetings.
009	Is it just me, or does Asuka look an awful lot like Shion?
010	Ugh. So that minx has a sister, and they're BOTH shady. I knew it...
011	Roxanne is right. That night in Lustberg, I had already suspected our friendly "acquiantance".
012	See, Sieg? You ARE dense! Teacher picked up on it, but you didn't!
013	Okay, okay, I'm dense...
014	Now, now, you can save your little revelations for later. Let us talk business.
015	First, I must commend your efforts on following the trail this far.
016	We were careful, but of course, there are things we cannot possibly have complete control over.
017	The laboratory ruins, the Constructs, and the Alchemia substances... Just what are you planning to achieve?
018	Exactly what your dear little speaker did in Sakris Village for a number of years prior.
019	You mean... The Divine Protector... And the ritual?
020	The one and only. At the time it was the only Prototype of its kind to be found. It was a key piece of the puzzle.
021	Such a shame that the raiders did a terrible job. I suppose you could say the Prototype brought its "divine judgment" upon them.
022	Don't tell me... YOU were the one behind the raiders?!
023	Mm, in a way, I suppose. Perhaps I should have engaged the services of more... disciplined help.
024	I would have had far more peace of mind in their abilities to secure potential assets...
025	Your raiders injured many innocent villagers, and nearly burned down Sakris Village!
026	Why? What have they done to deserve this?!
027	... ...
028	Hey, Soren, snap out of it!
029	Your sins will not go unpunished.
