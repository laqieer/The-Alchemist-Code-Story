001	There you are. I'm sure you've heard...we've discovered a settlement where the Wratharis troops have gathered.
002	We head out to annihilate them soon. Hurry up and prepare.
003	... ...
004	Are you still mulling over how you killed the Alchemists of the Lizard Brigade?
005	There's nothing to regret... You plucked the buds of rebellion. You should be proud of your actions.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
006	I understand. But, there's a part of me that can't innocently accept my own actions.
007	There are always two sides to the same coin. Great historical feats, depending on how you look at them, can often be seen as villainous massacres.
008	All of this is done for the sake of bringing peace to the world. There is no need to hesitate.
009	I'm sure Captain Zeke, your father, walked down this same path before.
010	My father did too?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
011	Indeed. In any case, we leave soon. Don't let your determination falter. Understood?
012	My father faced the same conflict...
013	A battle fought to protect the world, when flipped around, can also be seen as a villainous massacre...
014	It is true that Sir Zeke also faced that same conflict.
015	Bertrand...
016	However, from his conflict, he never reached a conclusion.
017	The Captain Zeke that I know continued to bear that sorrow.
018	Wait, did you know my father?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
019	We fought together in a certain battle. He saved my life.
020	My father?
021	I warn you because you are the son of the man who saved my life.
022	Dias, do not be swayed by flattering words. Be wary of Lord Gabirond.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0002
023	What?!
