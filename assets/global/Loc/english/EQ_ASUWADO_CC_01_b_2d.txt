001	I can't believe this! I dish out so much to hire those mercenaries, and for what?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
002	End of the line, I'm afraid.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
003	G-geeeh! Please, no!
004	Nice work! I owe you one, Lady Najam.
005	You owe me nothing. I'm just doing my job.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
006	Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always causing you trouble.
007	Your assassination techniques are so intricate and beautiful. I can't hold a candle to that. I've still so much to learn.
008	Faltering in the face of your target is not at all unusual. Don't let it get to you. You'll improve with time.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
009	Thank you! Hearing such words of encouragement from the great Lady Najam is truly heartening indeed!
010	Don't get so worked up. I'm no better than you are. We're roughly the same age, we come from the same place—	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
011	We're not the same at all! Yes, it's true that we're both orphans recruited by the order, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
012	But you stood out right away! I mean, you've already attained the top rank, earning the title "Hand of Darkness"!
013	We all revere and respect you. You've never failed a mission, not even once! You successfully execute your target every time, no matter who they may be.
014	You pursue Zalam Gaim's ideals, while at the same time holding yourself to a seemingly impossible standard. You're absolutely a role model to us all.
015	We all look up to you like the bright star you are, Lady Najam.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
016	Hmph. I suppose I wouldn't have that name if you didn't.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
017	We bestow upon you the name Najam, meaning "star." This name denotes a position of merit and authority within the assassins' order of Zalam Gaim.
018	Bear that name as you work to the order's benefit, and know that as long as your fulfill your duties, our door will ever be open to you.
019	I follow the creed of the assassins' order, Zalam Gaim. I seek nothing more than to complete the missions assigned to me.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
020	I may have been awarded the name Najam, but I put no stock in it. It holds neither meaning nor value to me.
021	How can you—?
022	Excuse me. Terribly sorry for the interruption.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
023	Dahab? What's an intermediary doing all the way out here?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0004
024	I come bearing your next mission. And this one's a priority. You are to postpone all others until its completion.
025	You want us to put off our current mission? But isn't completing jobs in the order received a rather important part of our creed?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0012
026	Yeah, Zalam Gaim's doctrines state that all deaths are equal, so assigning any one value over another is strictly forbidden.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
027	Of course, we subvert the universal equality of death by interfering with the natural order, but we offset this by working within our own strict rule set.
028	Surely, of all people, an intermediary should know this best! It's a basic tenet of the order, after all!
029	Ah, but Zalam Gaim's creed also states that assassins aren't permitted to turn down any mission the intermediary presents them, no?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
030	So I'd rather appreciate it if you two simply obeyed and took the assignment without any further question.
031	...
032	That's better. Now, your target is to be the guild captain of the Desert Wings, Ryle.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
033	I don't suppose we get to hear why he gets special treatment, do we?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
034	There is no need for you to know that information. Just make sure that he dies.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
035	Positively shameful! How dare he take that tone when speaking to you? And to ask us to postpone our assignment, no less!
036	Pay it no mind. As I understand it, he was raised in the aristocracy. In his eyes, I'm sure we're little more than filthy orphans. It's remarkable he even gives us the time of day.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0004
037	But, Lady Najam...!
038	...
039	So...will you accept this mission, then?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
040	Despite it running counter to one of the founding tenets of our doctrines? Should we not at least check the validity of this request with the Great Master?
041	The Great Master has fallen gravely ill, and should not be disturbed with such trifles. For now, we must do as we always have: complete our mission as assigned.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
042	...
043	The intermediary holds rank over us. It is our duty to do as instructed.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
044	That is equally a founding tenet of Zalam Gaim. And it's those tenets that made the order what it is today.
