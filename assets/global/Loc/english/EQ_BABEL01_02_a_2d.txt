001	You mean to tell me the assassinations of our nobles are being carried out by a single culprit?
002	That is correct, my lord. We humbly apologize for disturbing you with such foul news at this critical moment.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
003	Why not let the Blue Flame Guard rid us of the rogue?
004	The Blue Flame Guard?! But my lord, if we were to reduce the number of them guarding this castle, we may very well become the assassin's victims!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
005	Then what do you suggest we do? Are we to simply leave those beyond these walls to die?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
006	I-I would never...! Still...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
007	The mobilization of the Blue Flame Guard would cause much distress among the populace. We need something more...subtle.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
008	Have we the time to devise a plan for such an endeavor? Time is of the essence here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
009	With our legal reforms still under way, the absence of the knights may cost us dearly.
010	There is no other choice. We will have to employ mercenaries for the defense of nobles beyond our walls. Make a proclamation of this decision at once!
011	Yes, my lord!
012	Gah! Who would dare to do such a thing?! And for what nefarious reasons?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
013	Some people really just have it.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0023
014	"It"?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
015	Luck! Or whatever you want to call it! I mean, come on. As soon as Vettel becomes our captain, we get a national commission?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
016	...You make it sound as though I have no luck.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
017	Still, it doesn't mean we have accepted him as our captain!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_1047
018	Tsk, tsk. This kind of resistance to positive change is why we're seen as soldiers that can barely do more than hack and slash.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
019	Natalie, what are you trying to say?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0031
020	I'm just saying that accomplishing this mission is a big chance to get the Scarlet Legion's name out there and show the world what we can do! That is, if the assassin really exists.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
021	Well, it is a fact that the people in the upper crust of society in Envylia are getting assassinated.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
022	One would think the Blue Flame Guard would be the ones doing something about it.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
023	How pitiful. I understand they're still working out the kinks of governance, but it's shameful that they're failing to defend the lives of their own countrymen.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
024	That's a little unfair. I'm sure they're just following orders.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
025	They're probably stuck on guard duty at the castle, since the country declared independence only recently.
026	In any case... I suppose we should just be thankful we have this opportunity.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
027	Hey, you. What business might you have here at this hour?
028	What?!
029	Oh, well, you see...we were employed to do some patrols around here. Apparently, several crimes were reported in the area recently... And you are...?	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
030	I see. I serve as a footman in this mansion. I am just now returning from running errands for my lord.
031	You've heard of the recent incidents, have you not? Be cautious when walking out at night.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
032	My, my. Such kind young men! Thank you for your regards. Now, I must be off. Good luck with your patrols.
033	Everything seems to be fine here. Should we take a look around back?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
034	Go ahead. Vettel, I leave the rest of this to you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
035	Gerald? Where are you going?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
036	I just need to check something. I'll be right back.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
037	What? Wait, Gerald! Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
038	It's fine. He's not the kind of person who just does things on a whim. We can leave whatever it is to him.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
039	Really? Hmph. You'd think that as a former captain, he would know a thing or two about teamwork.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
040	We still consider him our captain, y'know.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_1047
041	Shut it!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
042	Whew... It's been a long day. Time for bed.
043	Not even a fragment of wariness. Pathetic.
044	Wh-who are you?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
045	Ugh! Boring! So very boring!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
046	How am I supposed to enjoy this?! What's wrong with you?! Did they forget to hook up the fight-or-flight instinct when they were building you?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
047	Y-you transformed?! Wh-what are you?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
048	Me? I'm an assassin. The last man you will ever meet. Heh! What do you think? Good catchphrase, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
049	I'm honestly a little disappointed that you're the only one here to appreciate it, though.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
050	An assassin?! You mean, the one that has been—?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
051	Gah! Literally every other one of my targets said the same thing! It's just like, show a little creativity! Is that too much to ask?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
052	S-somebody, help!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
053	Oh, wow. Not even your last words are original. C'mon, try another one.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0028
054	Give me a "Come at me, bro!" or a "Smite me, oh mighty smiter!" Hmph. The lack of respect in this industry is really appalling.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
055	Eeeeek!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
056	Oof. Nothing, huh? Well, I'm done here. It was barely worth crawling out of bed for this mission.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
057	Just...die already.	VO_ren.ren_battle_0014
058	Eeeek!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
059	Huh...?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
060	You've got quite a mouth on you. Assassin may not be the best job for you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
061	P-please, help me!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
062	No need to ask. That is my mission, after all.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
063	Who are you?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
064	I am Gerald, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Legion; a mercenary under the employ of Envylia.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
065	A mercenary? Heh... Hehehe...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
066	...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
067	Heh heh... Hahaha! Yes! Yes, finally!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
068	Oh man, oh man, oh man! This is exactly the kind of thing I've been waiting for!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0046
069	You're perfect!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0023
070	You're...a strange one. What's your deal?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
071	That's my line! What gave me away?! Was my wig crooked?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
072	What's strangest to me is that more people didn't notice. There isn't an old man in the world who can walk so silently.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0017
073	My footsteps?! Ugh, of course!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0045
074	The biggest issue, however...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
075	No matter how perfect the disguise, there's no way someone emanating so much bloodlust could fail to draw attention.
076	Bloodlust! Oh, you are good.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
077	What...?
078	This is so, so, so, so sweet! You are freaking great!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0046
079	This is the excitement I've been looking for! Yahooo!!!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
080	H-here he comes!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
081	Oh, yes! This! This is what I'm in it for! There's no thrill in killing the pathetic, gormless targets! It's only in outdoing their capable guards!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
082	Having the chance to witness such staunch, strong defenders such as yourself lose their cool when I flawlessly fulfill my mission objectives... This is the dream!
083	Thank you, you witless noble! As a reward for your participation, I will gladly win this game with your death!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0033
084	What?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
085	You definitely speak too much. You! Get out of here. You'll just get in my way.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
086	Th-thank you! Thank you!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
087	What the...? Hey, wait a minute!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
088	You're not going anywhere. You're not the only one here on a mission.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
089	Haha! A battle between two hired hands! Seriously the best!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0024
090	Why am I not surprised that you are committed to monologuing even right before a fight?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
091	"Before" a fight? Sorry, but it's already over.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
092	What...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
093	...Nngh?!  Wh-when did you...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0042
094	Oops! Did you forget? I'm an assassin! Duh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
095	My name is Ren, and I...am the last man you will ever meet.
096	Ugh...!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0022
097	Oh man. Thanks to you, this turned out to be an exhilarating night! After all that, I feel a little sorry to say this, but...I do have to go after that noble.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
098	A mission is a mission after all. Gotta finish what I came for. Bye, Vice-Something of the Whatever Legion!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
099	Huh...? Whoa!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
100	Urgh... I am Gerald, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Legion! You better not forget it again!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
101	Ouch... Well! Throwing people across the room now, are we? Didn't your mama teach you any manners? Heh...hehehe... You seriously don't disappoint!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0042
102	Argh! I am going to shut that trap of yours! ...Gah!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
103	N-not now! Come on, legs! Move!!!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
104	Aw, is this the end? I don't want it to end yet! I guess it's a sign of growing up to recognize that all fun times come to an end. Sorry Vice-Captain, but this is your time to die!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
105	Ngh! This can't be how it ends!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
106	...?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
107	I don't think I've ever seen you backed into a corner like this.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0002
108	?!
109	Sorry, was I late?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
110	Yeah...as usual.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
111	Uh-oh! Backup! Am I the one at a disadvantage now? That just adds to the excitement!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
112	"Excitement"...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
113	He talks a lot.	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
114	I wish I could spend a little more time getting to know you since you just got here, but I have a mission to accomplish. Sorry, but I have to end this now!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0035
115	Vettel, watch out! He's fast!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
116	...! No way! You can see my moves?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
117	Well, you're far from the first opponent I've faced who was quick on their feet. There were plenty of people like that when I was in the Holy Guard.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
118	Wow, really?! You're a Paladin?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
119	Ex-Paladin.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
120	Oh, this just keeps getting better! Can a Paladin handle this?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
121	Ack...!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
122	Wow! You really can keep up with me! You're fantastic!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0027
123	Vettel is the Scarlet Legion's Captain. You shouldn't underestimate him.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
124	About that...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
125	...?
126	He got you?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
127	He really is fast, isn't he?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
128	Oh man, seriously? Really? Wow! Me?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0023
129	I've never been praised by a member of the Holy Guard before! My bad!  Former Holy Guard member.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0009
130	Don't let your guard down, Vettel! This one can hit you with an attack out of nowhere!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
131	Gerald! Vettel! Are you okay?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
132	Natalie!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
133	Oh? My, my. Is Lady Luck smiling down upon me? Is that a weakness I can take advantage of coming this way?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
134	Natalie! Run!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
135	What?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
136	I'm so sorry, but this the way to get to those tough guys. Don't hate me, okay?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
137	Noooooo!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0028
138	What?!
139	Urk!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
140	Vettel?! Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
141	Alright! This turned out even better than I expected!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0009
142	Protecting your friend by giving up your arm? You guys keep getting cooler and cooler!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
143	Vettel... Bear with it just a little longer. This should be over in a moment.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0036
144	A sneak attack from behind? You shouldn't annou—	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
145	...?! What the...? Hey, let go! I said let go!!!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
146	Too late.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
147	?!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
148	You can't dodge from this close. This is the end.	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0004
149	Wh-wha...?! Whaaaa!!!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
150	Gerald! Wait!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
151	What...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
152	?!
153	Let me ask you one thing. What do you fight for?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
154	What? You mean, who's my client? That's the one thing I won't talk about. You might not think much of us, but we assassins do have something of a code.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
155	No, I mean...why did you choose a life of constant danger? Why do you wield a blade?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0021
156	Why? For...money? Nngh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
157	Don't move! I will cut you down!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
158	I am really not loving this situation...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
159	Money. You take lives for something like that?	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
160	Oh, please. If you're gonna lecture me, just don't. If I were to write on paper all the sermons thrown at me, it'd stack taller than the Tower of Babel.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0002
161	This is just the way the world is, okay? Kill or be killed.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
162	You little...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
163	Gerald, hold on! I'm sorry. I don't mean to lecture you. I just want to know if this really makes you happy.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0014
164	Happy?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
165	Y-yeah... Sorry, this seriously hurts. Do you mind if I get this sword out of my arm?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
166	I mean...sure. I'm not really in a position to say that you can't...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0037
167	Dead right.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
168	I said stop it. Ow! Huh... This is a good sword. Well maintained.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0014
169	Uh, thanks.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0034
170	You're very good with it. Don't you think your talents are wasted on something as frivolous as money?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
171	Uh...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
172	No matter what it costs you to swing this blade, you will only ever get those little pieces of paper. Instead...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
173	What if a single swing of that blade could make hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of people smile? Maybe it's just me, but it sounds a little more interesting than what you're doing now.
174	Millions? ...Smile?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
175	Well, we just started. So maybe a few dozen at best for now.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
176	But I truly believe that we can become an order of knights with that kind of influence.
177	What?!
178	Think about it. Taking lives, living hidden in the shadows...or saving lives, surrounded by happiness.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
179	I think the latter would be much more fun. Don't you think so?
180	What?!
181	What's the point of all your chatter? What are you getting at?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
182	Chatter? No, this is an invitation.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
183	Uh...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
184	Hey. Hey, wait a minute...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
185	The Scarlet Legion could use his help. My instincts tell me we could achieve more than we could have ever dreamed if he was with us... It's just...a feeling.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
186	What did you say?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
187	What do you think? Any objections?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
188	I do! I object! He almost killed me!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0040
189	Yet he didn't. He attempted to, and he failed. We'll get him to apologize properly.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
190	What...? An apology?! Really?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
191	Yeah, really.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
192	Haha... Hahahahahaha!!!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
193	What's so funny? I'm dead serious!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
194	Sorry, man! Really...but, seriously, did you forget? I'm an assassin. Do you need to hear it again? Assassin! Assassin. Assassin, assassin, assassin.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0035
195	I could do this all day. Honestly, how can one troop of mercenaries have this much character?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
196	...! Does that mean...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
197	Nah. Don't get ahead of yourself.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
198	Ah!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
199	The sword! Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
200	Wait!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
201	Ugh!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
202	Don't worry. There's no reason for me to fight you guys anymore. I mean, that stupid noble got away.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
203	Wait, does this mean I was bested by that idiot?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
204	I know you were hired for this mission, but if possible, I'd appreciate it if you'd let him go. I'd rather not fight you anymore.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
205	That's the first time someone's tried asking me something like that straight to my face. You really are interesting.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
206	Wait! Can I get your answer to my invitation?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
207	Well, I'll have to report that I failed the mission first, and then...who knows?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
208	I failed tonight, but it was still the best night ever! Thanks, weirdos!	VO_ren.ren_chara_2006
209	Wait!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
210	Who are you calling weirdos?!
211	Vettel! Are you okay?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0026
212	Y-yeah, I just lost a little too much blood.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
213	Aw, look at that. We've got a pretty ridiculous captain, don't we?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
214	Is "ridiculous" your nice way of saying "stupid"?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
215	Yeah.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0045
216	I can hear you, you know?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
217	Did... Did you guys call him your captain?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
218	Well...yeah. Maybe.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
219	What...?
220	I mean... He was willing to give up an arm to protect Natalie. Who can object to a captain like that?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
221	You...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0009
222	Come on. Get up, you stupid Captain.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
223	Natalie, you can fix up this idiot's wounds, right?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
224	I can hear you, you know!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
