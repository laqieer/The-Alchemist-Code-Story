001	Heheh! That was fun!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
002	No, it was not!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0025
003	Why did I have to get attacked?! Was there any reason why I had to get beat up?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
004	Did you have to attack us too?! Nyx and I are on your side! Your team!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
005	Don't mind the little details. Endure this for your frail old teacher, won't you? Would you truly begrudge me some entertainment?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
006	Who's supposed to be frail? We're the ones at death's door thanks to you!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
007	Give it up, Mira. You know how she can be.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
008	I don't want to hear anything from the loser who stayed in the back the whole fight!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
009	Come on, Mira. I'm always the one cleaning up your messes, the least you can do is deal with being in the line of fire for me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
010	Ugh, I wish I was an only child sometimes...
011	Anyway, I'm glad I got to see your skills. There were some amateurish moments, but you'll do.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
012	Aren't I generous?
013	Um, Miss Ambrosia...? What was the purpose of that little exercise?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
014	Hmm, well, as I'm sure you know, Asmodeus is stronger than I am.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
015	I wasn't exactly sure if defeating it would be possible, even after peeling away the Lust.
016	But seeing as your powers are reaching heights comparable to "her"... Truly, the things you come to see once you live long enough are incredible.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
017	What was that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
018	Ah, pay no mind. Now, let's get to work.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
019	I would estimate we have three days until Asmodeus heals from her wounds and strikes again.
020	Though the future is infinite, the time available to us now is very finite. There's no time to lose.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
021	What are you doing?! The way you're wiring that is so inefficient!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
022	Huh? Magically speaking, this makes the most sense. I'm taking fault lines and astrology into consideration.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
023	Right, okay, but you have to think of the conversion rate! We've got to redesign this whole section here, and...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
024	What? No! Yna, can you tell him to stop?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
025	I'm no expert, but if we redesign this part here, wouldn't we get the best of both perspectives?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
026	Huh...
027	Alrighty then! Almost done with the broth!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
028	Wow, Mira, I didn't know you could cook.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
029	What? This is basic stuff. Oh, wow...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
030	Is... Is something wrong?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
031	Well, I just thought, um, that's a very unique way of holding a kitchen knife. Have you...ever cooked before, Emmel?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
032	Uhm... Not really.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
033	Back home, they wouldn't let me. They said it's not something a Shrine Maiden should be doing.
034	Uh-huh... You're one of those princess types, huh? Well, now's a good time to learn! I can teach you.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
035	Really?!
036	Heheheh, leave it to me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
037	Even that nitpicky Nyx said my cooking was "bafflingly good, all things considered."
038	Was that supposed to be a compliment?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
039	Hnngh! Haah!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0016
040	No... This isn't enough to affect the Cursed Beast.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
041	I need to be better! Sharper!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
042	This fight will be our first step towards saving the Gula Belt Region, our home!
043	We cannot lose, no matter what!
044	Tomorrow...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
045	You've got quite a look on your face. You're ready, then.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
046	Miss Ambrosia. How are you feeling?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
047	Hm? My wounds are fine. Mira and Nyx are very efficient with their healing magic.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
048	...
049	What is it, boy? Is there something on my face?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
050	I just thought of something I would like to ask you.
051	Oh? What is it?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
052	You said all the people of this region were turned to insects.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
053	Why not Mira or Nyx? I cannot figure out how they evaded that fate.
054	Oh... I see.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0045
055	I know it is insensitive of me to ask. It is of course your right not to indulge my curiosity.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
056	It doesn't hurt to remember the past from time to time. I wouldn't say it's an interesting story, though.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
057	A long time ago, there was a witch obsessed with her own research.
058	That witch had an apprentice. She loved and cherished her dearly.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
059	This apprentice was so beautiful, no man could resist falling in love with her, even knowing that love would turn them into insects.
060	The witch refused to allow these men to turn her apprentice into an insect. She racked her mind for every method to keep them away.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
061	But it was all for naught. There was no way for her to control her apprentice's heart. The apprentice fell in love with a man behind the witch's back.
062	It was a pure love unbefitting of this region saturated with lust, and all the more beautiful for it.
063	And yet, the witch was enraged by it.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
064	Which is completely reasonable, you know?! I mean, getting in a relationship without her guardian's consent?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0020
065	Ahem. Anyway, the apprentice had learned both magic and stubbornness from her teacher. She eloped with the man and began a life with him.
066	From what I've heard, they were a loving, happy husband and wife.
067	Sadly, such happiness doesn't last long in this region.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
068	Soon, the apprentice conceived a child. The man became an insect and lost his self.
069	After having endured the witch's training, the apprentice was able to maintain her human form for a while, but ultimately could not resist fate.
070	As her due date approached, so did the limits of her endurance.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0018
071	It was then that the witch visited her and asked the question she had waited to ask.
072	You wretched fool. Was it worth it? Was the fleeting experience of love worth losing your entire self?
073	Not at all nice, was it? Thinking back on it now, that was a very immature thing to say.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
074	And yet, the apprentice smiled.
075	I have no regrets. I accepted it all the moment I loved him.
076	The apprentice said she wanted the same for her children: the chance to make a decision on their own.
077	Children born from insects are born as insects.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
078	To ensure her children would be born as humans, she needed to remain human herself to the end.
079	Respecting her apprentice's wishes, the witch cast a spell on her.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
080	It was a spell of death. It was the only way to let the girl, already showing signs of turning, die as a human.
081	Even with several lifetimes dedicated to nothing but the study of magic, this was all the witch was able to do for her beloved apprentice.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
082	To keep the children human, the witch killed their mother.
083	And the twins grew healthy and strong.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
084	Under the care of the one who ended their mother's life...
085	That's all there is to say about my apprentices and me. I told you it wasn't an interesting story.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
086	...
087	Now, now... What's with that serious face?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
088	Do you pity us?
089	N-no, not at all!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
090	Remember this, boy. What you imagine happiness to be is nothing more than happiness for yourself.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
091	Until you understand that, your lofty ideals may become something that only perpetuates sorrow.
092	My lofty ideals...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
093	Ah... Forget it. I seem to be getting preachy in my old age.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
094	We will soon be facing Asmodeus.
095	Rest while you can and make yourself ready.
096	My ideals...? How could wanting to free people from the Cursed Beasts cause sorrow?
097	No! There's no way! I won't let that happen!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
098	I have to... I mean, we have to end the cycle of irrational tragedies!
099	Got it! It's finished!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0009
100	All right. Not bad for something cobbled together last minute.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
101	Though I don't really care for needing two control sticks to accommodate the increase in functional capacity.
102	Truly? It looked to me like the rod was designed for exactly that purpose.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
103	Well... Ambrosia estimated that it'd take a generation to defeat Asmodeus.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
104	I assume she expected Mira and me to handle half each.
105	It sounds like things are miraculously going exactly as she planned.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
106	Anyway, we just need to link this to the airship's reactor and...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
107	Now we should be able to use the airship's mechanics to power the magic rod Libra's system!
108	We've also devised a plan to fight against Asmodeus as advantageously as possible.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
109	The key factor is how much Asmodeus will be able to heal.
110	We'll just have to deal with that when it comes up.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
111	First, we must halt the Cursed Beast's movements. That's when the magic rod will deliver the spell.
112	That should allow our attacks to be effective, if I am correct.
113	You are. But first, we will need to regain control of the airship.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
114	I'm not sure if Asmodeus will be there or not, but...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
115	We have to assume those ice beasts will be roaming around.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
116	When the town was assaulted, we were overwhelmed, partially because of the fact that we were ambushed, but...
117	A lot of it had to do with those ice beasts being more burdensome than expected. We can't have them using their numbers against us like that again.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
118	You're right. We'd better make sure we don't get surrounded by them again.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
119	That's why speed is going to be key in this mission.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
120	Mira, Nyx, can you two teleport us there?
121	Hmm... We might be able to do a one-way trip.
122	But we'd be severely drained afterwards.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
123	That might have an adverse affect on our plans ahead. Fine, we will walk.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
124	Regarding that, I have an idea.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
125	Really?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
126	Indeed I do. Winnick!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
127	We will deliver you.
128	But you cannot withstand the cold. Isn't it dangerous for you?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
129	Not a problem. Ambrosia is kind. We are legion. One life weighed against many, irrelevant.
130	That's just...!
131	Don't worry, they will be shielded by one of my protective spells.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
132	Winnick, is it just my imagination, or do you have a different attitude towards the others compared to me?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
133	...
134	Say something! That's the attitude I'm talking about!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0012
135	Ah, ahem! Well, like I said... You don't have to worry about their safety.
136	If you say so...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
137	We will gladly accept their help.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
138	Everyone, please listen.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
139	We will now head out to defeat the Cursed Beast!
140	This will be a perilous task. Possibly futile, even.
141	But to save the people of this region, and to save our own region someday, we must do this!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
142	I walk this path with no hesitation in order to save all! So I ask you to lend me a hand!
143	Let us go remake the world!
