001	Blast! How could they find us that easily?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
002	Old dog! Nyx! What's your status?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
003	It's not looking good. Once they appeared, my connection to Mira was severed.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
004	Someone somewhere in this forest is spilling out sinful magil. That's drawing out the Sinners.
005	That's not all...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
006	Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
007	Just as I thought.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
008	There's something different about these Sinners...
009	Huh? What does that mean?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
010	Their endurance, strength, and speed... They are leaps and bounds ahead of any of the Sinners we've fought before.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
011	The magil they have is on a different level. These Sinners were once Sephira...
012	"O time, spin on! All life be limited, and thou art no exception!"	VO_nix.nix_sys_0032
013	There's no end to them...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
014	We can't panic. We've just have to focus on finding a way through them.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
015	We won't be able to meet up with Nimul and the others until we do that. That's our only choice.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
016	Yeah... At our current strength, that's the only way we can deal with being surrounded like this.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
017	Shoot! Guess we've gotta do it this way! Immediately dispatching Engineer Soldiers to form a blockade!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
018	Corruption won't affect them! Everyone, take cover!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
019	Very well. Let's go, Nyx!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
020	Right. I'll bring up the rear!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
021	Mira, Nimul... Please be okay!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
