001	Sigh... It's pretty difficult...hmm?	VO_meria.meria_sys_0030
002	He-hey! Little rabbit, my feet aren't pillows! ...It's sleeping soundly.	VO_meria.meria_battle_0019
003	Ohh... I won't be able to practice.
004	Well, if I play slowly, it won't be that loud...right?	VO_meria.meria_sys_0031
005	Wow! It suddenly sounds nice! Okay...quietly...so it doesn't wake up...	VO_meria.meria_sys_0046
006	Eheheh. I'm starting to enjoy myself. If I play slowly, it sounds good! Just play at my own pace...slowly...eheheh...	VO_meria.meria_sys_0023
007	Oh dear... I seem to have forgotten the basics.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0020
008	When practicing an instrument, the most important thing is to play slowly at first. I should've taught her that...

010	Zzz...zzz...
011	She must be tired from the practice. That being said...this is amazing.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0011
012	Glurzzzz...glurzzz
013	Even the monsters have fallen asleep. It appears there really wasn't much for me to teach her.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0007
014	Listening to Melia play music at her own pace sounds like the perfect remedy for sleep. I think I'll join in.	VO_gato.gato_sys_0045
015	Eheheh... Yawn...zzz...zzz...	VO_meria.meria_sys_0008
