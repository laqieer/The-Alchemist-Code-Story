001	His bullets kept our clock in motion.
002	The people of the city continued on the path to reconstruction, one step at a time.
003	Leaving his fate to the wind, he continued on his path as well.
004	Maybe...I've just been standing still.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
005	Alvarez...Messiah... No response. Confirmed.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
006	Emergency protocol activation signal received.
007	I am AJ7000 Prototype. Clock tower. Last guard.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0031
008	Salvation. Human obliteration. Replicate.
009	Imperative.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0010
010	All of the Alkaroids should have stopped functioning when the Messiah in the guard tower was destroyed!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
011	So how...?!
012	I have an independent power source for emergency operation.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0037
013	My assignment was updated when the Messiah was defeated. Rebooting took longer than expected.
014	Directive confirmed. Human annihilation.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_battle_0009
015	However, there is a procedure that must be followed.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0031
016	What do you hope to gain by kidnapping me?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
017	This is the chosen place.
018	But why?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
019	You will marry me.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0010
020	......
021	I'm...not sure I heard that correctly.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1012
022	You will marry me.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0004
023	E-excuse me? Marry you?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
024	While I was booting up in the clock tower basement, I accessed a network of Alchemic energy and accumulated data.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0030
025	The population of Alkaroids is currently at its lowest. It will be difficult to increase our numbers with the factory out of operation.
026	A new method of manufacture is required. We Alkaroids have observed human behavior in order to understand your method of reproduction.
027	I studied Alvarez's actions as a point of reference, and selected you, Fiona.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0010
028	Hold on a second!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
029	Get married and create a child.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0031
030	Get married and create a child.
031	Imperative.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0004
032	This logic is too hard for me to follow.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
033	Do you take me to be your husband, in sickness and in health, until death do us part?	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0001
034	That's what the officiant is supposed to say.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
035	I mean—n-no! I don't!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
036	I do.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0007
037	Get married and create a child. I will be a good husband until the number of Alkaroids has increased.
038	You may leave everything to machines, and live a life without pain, fatigue, or want, as you always have. You will not have to lift a finger.
039	No, that's okay...!	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1001
040	"Okay." Acceptance confirmed.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0007
041	That's not what I said!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
042	People and machines can't do that! They can't get married or...m-make children together! It's impossible!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
043	What experience do you have?	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0002
044	Wh-what the heck are you asking me?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
045	With machines.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0004
046	Oh.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
047	Empirical data insufficient. Unable to confirm possibility. Further research and experimentation is necessary.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0031
048	E-experimentation?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
049	Imperative.
050	No! P-please!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
051	Piece of junk.	VO_taras.taras_battle_0006
052	I'm not the type of guy to interfere with people's love lives, but...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
053	Mr. Taras?!
054	Bad luck always comes in threes. Looks like my hunch was right.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
055	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
056	I decided to come and see for myself whether the Alkaroid threat was actually gone for good or not, but this basement is huge. It took me forever to find the storage area.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
057	Then I just followed your footprints and well, here I am.
058	Report: No parts damaged.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0010
059	Well, looks like everything's okay here.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
060	"Okay." Acceptance confirmed.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
061	Right.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
062	Because you can't break what's already broken. The beatin' starts here.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
