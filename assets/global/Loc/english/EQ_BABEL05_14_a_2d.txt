001	Grandma, I'm back!
002	Ahhh, what a day! I can't believe I got so lost, even though I've been there before! I was sure I'd end up passed out on the side of the road again or something!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0008
003	I didn't even get to see Lofia this time!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
004	Oh, yeah, she's my friend from Lustburg!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
005	Oh, oh! But the nice old wizard promised me!
006	He said that Lofia will come visit us soon!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0050
007	Oh, I almost forgot! I have a present for you! Here!
008	You said you've been getting cold lately, right? This should help!
009	I just keep remembering things from the past.
010	Things like...how the main reason to eat sweets is because they make you feel happy.
011	And...how the reason for inviting someone to a tea party is because eating together makes the food taste better.
012	I guess I can't help but reminisce.
013	There are many words that describe homesickness: longing, yearning, wistfulness...nostalgia...
014	It's not merely missing the place, but also the deep-seated fear that you will never see it again.
015	I couldn't bring myself to take up my Court Mage vestments after that.
016	I feared that, having learned the secrets of Alchemy and the Sacred Stones, I wouldn't be able to return if I donned them again.
017	Court Mages must be prepared to fight to protect their beloved nation.
018	That idea never sat well with me.
019	I was afraid that possessing such power would mean that I could never go back to the easy life I once enjoyed.
020	Yet...
021	I have a very important promise that I must keep.
022	Lofia...?!
023	I want to protect the things I love.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
024	If I can do that, then regardless of how terrified I may be...
025	Even if it means that I can never go home...
026	I have to live.
027	Y-you...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
028	L-Lofia! If you keep going, you'll—!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
029	I think I finally understand.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
030	Huh?
031	I am mostly made of sugary sweets, you know.
032	The sugary sweetness, the divine aroma, the squishy softness... I may not be able to enjoy these things anymore, but...
033	I know that eating together will make the food taste better.
034	Ah!
035	Kill her! She's weak!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
036	Hah!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
037	Grraaarrrggghhhh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0028_c
038	Huzzaaahhh!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0010
039	G-goodness!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0046
040	A talented Court Mage can work with any weapon at her disposal.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_2012
041	Nyx. You ought to help out, too.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
042	M-me?
043	I can't do this alone.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
044	Y-you know I can't interact with things.
045	I don't have the kind of power my sister has.
046	Urgh! All I've done is talk about fighting for the future! I'm sick of talking about it!
047	I want to do something, but what can I do?
048	If you don't have enough magic, all you need to do is use what you have around you.
049	What is that supposed to mean?!
050	The wintry magic that exploded from Ravina, the Alchemia diffused by Cheryl's Alchemy...
051	Take a pinch of this and a handful of that, throw it all into your cauldron, mix in some lizards and whatever else catches your eye, bring it to a boil, and poof! You've got magic.
052	I-I've never even done something like that before!
053	Give it a try!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
054	I...!
055	Once I've made up my mind, it's time to act! It doesn't matter if I have no idea how I'm going to achieve my goals!
056	There's no time like the present. What's the point of needless worrying?
057	Hahah! This is crazy!
058	What is?
059	I can feel this power welling up inside me...
060	It's just like magic!
061	Well, duh! You're just as magical as I am!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
062	I guess I am.
063	It always pays to have insurance.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
064	Insurance?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
065	The Demonic Soldiers are powered by the Alchemy Source.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
066	We have prepared things so that, should they be activated, they will carry out their objectives under Corpse's command.
067	I never dreamed that so many Demonic Soldiers would be roused from their slumber, however. In that regard, I am as amazed as you are.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0011
068	Resistance is, in a word, impossible.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
069	I am not fond of the word impossible.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0015
070	Be that as it may...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
071	To be a Mage is to make miracles happen, wouldn't you agree?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
072	...
073	That is why I am here.
074	What?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
075	I will not let you stand in my way anymore.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_1015
076	Grrrooogggghhhhh!
077	Nngh!
078	Groooohhhhh! Graaaaarrrrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
079	It is just as Lord Waginau said! The Demonic Soldiers have been stirred to life by their magic, and obey our commands!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0046
080	Kill the witches!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0014
081	This...is certainly not ideal.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
082	Can we handle this ourselves?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
083	Heh. We're not alone.
084	Time is ticking.
085	Groogghhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0003
086	I know now that this world isn't a lost cause.
087	Corruption, ruin... So long as time ticks on, these things will exist.
088	However, there are those who fight to protect their comrades.
089	Alchemy is surely...
090	Ngh! Wh-what is that?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
091	Lofia, Cheryl... This is all thanks to you two.
092	Huh?
093	You have carried your hopes for the hopeless future, and held on to them through despair.
094	Heheh.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
095	You are not alone.
096	You are alive. The past may be sweet...
097	Or it may be bitter. It changes nothing.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
098	I...!
099	I'll give it a try.
100	That's the spirit!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0041
101	The bridge formed by such convictions can only be traversed when the chasm between despair and hope is at its widest.
102	Everyone has people that they are determined to meet again, even in death.
103	I don't want to waste that belief I once held.
104	Time may be infinite, but I'll lend you my strength here and now.
105	Mira...
106	We'll meet when the time is right. If we work together, I think we can make it happen.
107	The nonexistent future, the devastated present... Let it all become a thing of the past!
108	I'll lend you my magic.
109	Take it!
110	Space-Time Manipulator!
111	Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, that I may see you.
112	Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.
113	Now, come!
114	Chance Encounter!!!
115	...
116	...
117	You did it.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0023
118	Yeah... I did.
119	I thought I heard bells ringing.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
120	Long time no see... I think.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
121	Something like that.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
122	You wouldn't call us for no reason, would you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
123	What a pleasant surprise to meet you here!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_1001
124	We need your help.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0041
125	You're that pretty lady from before!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0009
126	P-pretty...lady...?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
127	I've been meaning to thank you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0033
128	Th-thank you very much.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
129	Uh... Why are you the one saying thank you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
130	I-I...! I'm really not used to this at all!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0050
131	You mean, to being called a pretty lady?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
132	Oh, p-please stop calling me that!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0047
133	Come to think of it, what would have happened if Albea was in the bath when you called us?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
134	I-I wasn't in the bath!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
135	I know you weren't. You kinda stink.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0006
136	Y-you...! Just because I wasn't in the bath just now, doesn't mean that I don't take baths at all!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
137	You look annoyed.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_4001
138	That's because I am!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
139	There it is! There's that honesty! I love it!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_5001
140	Urgh! You haven't changed a bit.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
141	Heheheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0024
142	Lofia!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
143	Ravina!
144	L-look over there! That's...!
145	Huh?
146	Ohohohoh! If it isn't a certain special young lady!	VO_michael.michael_chara_0008
147	Michael!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
148	Nyx, is this...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
149	Ahuh. This must be Chance Encounter.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
150	Wh...? How do you know that?!
151	Wielding a thousand magics makes one qualified. Having more than ten thousand experiences makes one elite. Accumulating a hundred million pieces of information under one's cap makes them quite robust indeed.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
152	I've merely read my worth in ancient tomes, several times over. That is all.
153	Michael! You're alive! Y-you're really here!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0019
154	Come now, Ravina, you must be more considerate of the elderly. Perhaps you ought to rest a little longer.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0001
155	Huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
156	Hey, Nyx!
157	Mira?!
158	I finally found you! Where have you been?!
159	That's my line!
160	Heh! I've been working hard!
161	Wh-why are they here? They should be...dead.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
162	...
163	I think that's because...I'm always looking to the past.
164	When I connected you to the manipulator, I bridged myself to the convictions we hold in our time, and drew in the causality of the past.
165	You got Albea and Wilhelm caught up in it too, since they've been exposed to my Alchemia.
166	So you went back in time and brought Michael and the others with you? Is that what happened?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0044
167	Everyone has people they are determined to meet again, even in death. The people who believe in that possibility, and in turn, those for whom they yearn...
168	I figured we might as well bring them all together again.
169	Heheh.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
170	You have created a space that has transcended both the loss of life and the passage of time. This is most unusual.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0024
171	Amazing, ain't it?!
172	What are you looking so proud of?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0004
173	To put it bluntly...
174	You can only meet like this, irrespective of your past and future selves, right here, right now.
175	Is that so?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
176	...
177	I won't forget, even if you ask me to.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
178	But I won't see you...if that is how it must be.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
179	Heheheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
180	You know, these two are a royal pain in the butt.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
181	Yes, well... To put it bluntly...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0001
182	Hm?
183	I think you're a genius too, Nyx.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
184	Pfft. No way.
185	Thank you. Thank you so much.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0034
186	Huh? L-Lofia?!
187	Ahah... Ahahahahah... What should we do? I've run out of energy.
188	She's out of magic! All because she...gave it to me!
189	H-how about some sweets?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
190	She already ate them all!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
191	Ugh... Unnnngggghhhh...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
192	I'm so...cold.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
193	Grrroooggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
194	What in blazes is going on?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0028
195	I don't think we can keep this moment in time paused for much longer!
196	Showdown!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
197	Here I go... Campanella!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
198	I'll play.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
199	I'm gonna win this in one burst!	アルベル・ヴィルヘルム
200	Haa...haaa...haa...haaa...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
201	Lofia! Wh-what should we do?! Her body has gone all cold!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
202	I'm getting to be quite forgetful in my old age.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
203	M-Michael...? What—?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
204	I was going to give this to Lady Lofia when she left for Slothstein, but it slipped my mind.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
205	Wh-what is it?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
206	Ohohohohoh!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
207	Oh!
208	You forgot this.	VO_michael.michael_chara_1025
209	Welcome back, Lady Lofia.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
210	I... I... I'm...
211	I'm...back. I came...back.
212	Lofy! Lofy!
213	Oh!
214	What is this place?!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0028
215	Milis?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
216	I was chasing a water lizard when all of a sudden there was this explosion right in front of my eyes, and before I knew it, I was here!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0019
217	M-Milis...!
218	Oh!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0025
219	Lofy, you're down, and shaking. Did you pass out from exhaustion?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
220	Something like that.
221	Hahah! It's the opposite of when we first met!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
222	Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.
223	Ooh, are you talking about this?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0004
224	What is it?
225	It's called caramel jaeger.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
226	Caramel...?
227	It's this sweet alcohol they make in Slothstein! They've started selling it in Lustburg!
228	I bought it as a present for my grandma because she's been getting cold lately.
229	I can't believe you've never tried it, Lofy! You're missing out!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0008
230	Will you...let me have some?
231	Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0037
232	It's sweet...and warm.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0046
233	Grrrooogggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
234	Whoa! Geez, that scared me!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0026
235	Milis...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
236	Yeah?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0005
237	I'm going to keep the promise I made to you.
238	Huh? Did we make a promise?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
239	As you can see, I'm in a little bit of trouble right now.
240	Will you...help me?
241	Two is always better than one!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0038
242	We're friends, aren't we?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
243	That's right. You're very important to me, Milis.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0008
244	Would you like some pickles?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
245	Th-thank you for the offer, but I'm going to have to say no.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
246	I am a Sugar Wizard, after all!
247	Hmhm. Then for your fuel, I suppose you will take...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
248	Of course.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
249	Sugar Power!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0014
