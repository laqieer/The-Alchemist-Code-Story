002	U-ugh... Father...	VO_logi.logi_battle_0023
003	Logi! These wounds... Was it Dias?!
004	I-it's not his fault. It's my fault for not being able to understand his motives.	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
005	Dias...has your power consumed you after all?
006	Don't worry, Logi. As his only father, I'll open Dias's eyes.
007	I will go too! As his only brother, I want to save him as well!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
008	Okay. Dias...don't lose to yourself. Keep your heart strong!
