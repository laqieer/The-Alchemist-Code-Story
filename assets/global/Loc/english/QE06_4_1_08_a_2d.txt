001	Me...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
002	And you alone.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
003	And you said...my mother took you in? This is all so sudden!
004	That's why I'd like to speak with you right away. We must fight together, so that we may bring peace to Wadatsumi once more!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
005	...!
006	Well, it seems Monzein's words were no exaggeration. You came for your roots and your destiny...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
007	Th-this is much more than I bargained for, though! I'm not sure how to feel.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
008	I imagine it's a lot to take in. I'd like to know more about you as well. But I think our first order of business should be to explain the reason you've been summoned here.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
009	I need to tell you of the ties that were created in this place, the Malice that would destroy them, and the Wadatsumi royal blood that flows through your veins...
010	Not to mention the details of the Blade Fox...and about your mother, and the reason I've been searching for you in the first place.
011	...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
012	Logi...
013	I...
014	I understand how sudden this all is. And I know it's difficult to believe. But I hope you can see the sincerity in my face. Everything I've said is the truth.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
015	I... Okay.
016	I don't expect any part of this will be easily explained. But the fact is, we need you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
017	We need your power.
018	...
019	Is something the matter, Kamui?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0006
020	...No, it's nothing.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
021	Will you lend us your strength?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
022	So it was you, Amane.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
023	Judius!
024	I must say, I'm impressed you were able to take the Mikaboshi when it was so heavily guarded.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
025	Unfortunately, it is my prerogative that all variables must be eliminated. So I will be taking it back with me.
026	And all of you will die here.
027	Huh, what do you know? He's every bit the supervillain you made him out to be!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
028	You don't really think you can beat all of us, do you?
029	Oh, I don't think that at all. I know I can.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
030	Heh. The sad thing is, you actually believe that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
031	Ngh...
032	Logi?
033	I'm still not sure what to think, exactly. But it doesn't matter. You're in need of my help right now, and I intend to provide it.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0003
034	That's my only reason to fight alongside you at the moment, but you can rest assured I'll fight with you till this battle is won, and then we can figure out where to go from there.
035	I hope that's not a problem.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0011
036	Of course not!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
037	Logi Crowley... Son of the Blood Wolf Zeke, and Celis.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
038	All variables shall be eliminated. This place is to be your grave.
039	Shouldn't your attention be elsewhere?
040	What?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
041	Blade Fox Corps Second Squad Captain, Ugachi.
042	Well done, Captain Ugachi! Perceptive as ever.
043	I never let an opening go without jumping in.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
044	Still swinging a sword, I see, despite your obvious...disadvantage.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0044
045	I couldn't face my fallen allies again if I gave up the fight just for losing an arm!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
046	That's what I'm talkin' about! You got the passion, man!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
047	And what are you supposed to be?
048	I'm Edgar L. Leonhart. I came to Wadatsumi to help a friend.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
049	Leonhart?! Oh, dear. The variables just keep piling up.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0020
050	"I beseech the supreme..."	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0001
051	Spiritbonding, too?! So you're a descendant of the Sephira?! This just keeps getting more and more aggravating!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0018
053	So. Many. Variables! Rrraaagh!
118	Ngh!
054	Edgar!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0026
055	I hate variables! The future cannot be so random! Everything should work out as planned! All variables are to be eliminated!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0017
056	!!!
057	Every. Last. One!
058	Ghah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
059	Hyaaaaaah!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
060	What do you think you're doing? Out of my way, little one.
061	You're not eliminating anything! We will not allow you to use Wadatsumi as your plaything anymore!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0014
062	All is for Wadatsumi.
063	How dare you! How many innocent people have died because of your evil machinations?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0012
064	It is only natural for the weak to be stamped down. I've turned their meaningless existences into meaningful deaths. No doubt they're thanking me from the great beyond.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
065	Nothing I've done is worthy of anyone's hatred or disdain.
066	...!
067	The strong tread upon the weak. This is a fundamental rule of our world. And no one gets to decide that they don't play by the rules!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0007
068	The best you can do is hope for me to turn your death into something with meaning.
069	You fiend!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
070	I won't allow people to be abused anymore. I cannot abide any further pain and sadness.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
071	We will protect Wadatsumi from your Malice to the very end!
072	Rraaaaaaghh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
073	How can he still be standing?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
074	Is that the best you can do?
075	Wait! Stop! What are you doing?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0013
076	New plan. I have an understanding of your strength now, and intend to use that to my advantage.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
077	I think I'll have you fight each other like I intended from the start!
078	What are you babbling about?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
079	Now that I've confirmed the location of the Mikaboshi, I can take it back whenever I wish.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
080	Obtaining maximal results with minimal effort is another virtue I've come to know over the course of my tireless research.
081	And the outcome of that research is quite conclusive. There is nothing you can do to offset the results.
082	Incredible. He didn't even flinch!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0021
119	And on top of that, he pays no mind to the people he hurts, nor to the evil he spreads...
083	So am I to assume this is the man you wish for me to join the fight against?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
084	Our true enemy is a demon known as Malice.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
085	...?
086	We do not aim to eradicate the demons, but the Malice that fuels them—the Malice that stamps down all in its path with impunity, to achieve its own ends.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
087	It is Malice with a capital M, far better suited to the distinction of demon than those we typically label as such. Much like Judius here.
088	...!
089	That willingness to inflict pain on others to achieve one's own goals is the reason Wadatsumi has fallen as far as it has.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
090	That is the terrible and insidious enemy we face here. Even knowing this, will you still lend us your strength, Logi Crowley?
091	It is only natural for the weak to be stamped down. I've turned their meaningless existences into meaningful deaths. No doubt they're thanking me from the great beyond.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
092	Nothing I've done is worthy of anyone's hatred or disdain.
093	I have heard your pleas, and though I have yet to fully comprehend everything that's happened, my course is clear.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
120	I absolutely wish to help you defend this land... This land my ancestors and my mother fought to protect.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
121	The blood that flows through my veins was born of that desire!
122	...!
095	I don't yet know how I can help. But whatever it is I can do, I will do it. I promise you that, Amane.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
096	Thank you, Logi Crowley!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
097	You needn't be so stiff as to use my full name with every address. Logi alone is fine. So, what's the plan?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0003
098	The Blade Fox has been anxiously awaiting your arrival. I believe your first order of business can be found in Castle Aquila Rubrum.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
099	There's something there which only you can do.
100	Learn the sacred art of Kagutsuchi, right?
101	I shall guide you. Come.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
102	Excuse me, Logi? I'd like to request to break rank here and pursue a separate task on my own.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
103	Kamui? Is something the matter?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
104	I've been sensing a strange energy since our arrival. I can't quite describe it, but...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
105	I have a feeling that something related to my own destiny may be waiting for me here in Wadatsumi.
106	?!
107	I'd like to follow this lead and see where it takes me.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
108	All right. But at least allow the Blue Tongues to—
109	There's no need to worry. I won't get in your way. Or are you more concerned about me going alone?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
110	Ah, no, of course not.
111	Then I shall take my leave here. Thank you very much. I will return, safe and sound. You have my word.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0034
112	Do you have any idea what he might be sensing, Amane?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
113	I'm afraid not. Could there be even more we don't know about Wadatsumi?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
114	...
115	There's no time to ponder that now. We have a lot to do.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
116	Yes, Captain! Come, Logi. We begin our journey to the stronghold of the royal family of Wadatsumi:	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
117	Castle Aquila Rubrum.
