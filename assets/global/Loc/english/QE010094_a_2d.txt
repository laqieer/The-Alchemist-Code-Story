001	Aghhh! Ack! Huff...huff...! So...this is the price of power!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0022
002	Are you all right, Dias?
003	...Don't come near me! It's nothing!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
004	If you insist. We greatly rely on you gaining power.
005	However, it is also a worry as to whether the body and mind can keep up with the rapid growth in power that can destroy a Demon alone.
006	Heart...? The will of men cannot surpass power. There is no need to worry about such things.
007	What...?
008	The Holy Guard's Bertrand shattered my wishful thinking.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0020
009	Have you forgotten...his end?
010	Despite his sacrifice...it meant nothing in comparison to the overwhelming power of the Demon.
011	Ah...!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0044
012	In other words, what lesson did you gain from Bertrand's end?
013	That power is justice...the light that leads to the future.
014	I will wield this weapon of light. There's no need to worry.
015	Hmm... How reassuring! Well then, I hope you can exert your power that will lead us to the future!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
