001	You get kidnapped way too much, young lady. You gotta be more careful.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
002	......
003	Bad luck comes in threes. Looks like my hunch was right. You get what I'm sayin'? I'm talkin' about you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
004	Not that I'm one to say anythin'.
005	I'm...sorry.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0036
006	I guess you're Redington's mayor now, aren't you?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
007	Mayor Edward is gone—Alvarez's dead, too. The city's restoration still has a long way to go.
008	That preening fool ain't here, either.
009	Who'd want a mayor like you at a time like this?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
010	I...	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
011	You don't know nothin' about anythin', not even yourself. You're not ready.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
012	You might be right.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
013	Hey, do you understand why that piece of junk ran off?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
014	...?
015	Didn't think so. From this moment on, I'm the city's enemy. That means I'm your enemy, too.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
016	What?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
017	Ain't this just perfect? I'm gonna turn the rest of this city into a world of chaos just like Real Heaven.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
018	The city's just been destroyed. Everyone's runnin' scared, but they ain't got no place to hide. That's where I come in.
019	No one here is tough enough to do what really needs to be done. I've got no choice but to be the law myself.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
020	You intend to rule the city?	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1012
021	Yeah. Like a true mafioso.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
022	I...	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
023	I'm not going to simply stand back and let you do what you please.
024	Oh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
025	Father never lost his faith in people, right up until his dying breath.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
026	I, too, will fulfill my duty. I won't let you turn Redington into a living hell!
027	Look at you. You're shakin'.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
028	S-so what! I will protect this city from you and your kind, just like my father before me!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
029	You really go all out, huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0038
030	......
031	Consider our debt settled, Mayor Edward.
