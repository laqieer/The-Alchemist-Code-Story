001	Hey! Got something for ya.	VO_tsanglei.tsanglei_sys_0001
002	Good work. For your own sake, I hope you didn't get curious and take a peek at the contents.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0034
003	I really didn't care enough to try. You know I only took this job so that I could get myself out of Greed Dike.	VO_tsanglei.tsanglei_sys_0010
004	Whatever you lot are schemin' with Greed Dike, it has nothin' to do with me.
005	Hmph. Very well, then. Leave!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0010
006	Hmph. That Orion... It seems that he intends to start a great war—and soon, too. However, for him to ask for our aid...	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0031
007	We will not be left behind by the likes of Greed Dike! We will need to put our own ambitions into action soon.
008	So that's what's happenin', huh?	VO_tsanglei.tsanglei_sys_0044
009	You...! I thought I told you to leave!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0027
010	No, this is great! Now that I know your secrets, you'll attack me and I'll have to flee the country.	VO_tsanglei.tsanglei_sys_0008
011	Just tell everyone that I'm missin', all right? I'm sick of bein' in Greed Dike. I wanna experience...more.
012	I wanna visit new places, and find a way to get stronger. If I don't, there's no reason for me to keep on livin'! So just forget about me!
013	Tch... What's wrong with that man? Well, it is of no consequence. We must make our move before the Corpse does!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0018
014	We will begin by taking possession of the survivors of the Sephira, who are finally within our grasp!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0007
015	Then we will set out to obtain all of the Alchemia in the desert. I wonder how powerful the Philosopher's Stone will become? It will be interesting to find out.
016	Those who know nothing will be used as tools by those wiser than themselves. I will take advantage of the situation!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0008
017	My apologies, Ramses. This will be finished shortly. I hope you don't mind waiting just a little longer.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0035
018	Of course not! I will wait as long as it takes, wondrous sister!
019	Be that as it may... Does this mean that Rashba intends to use Carla?	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
020	Yes, it is as you feared.
021	Well, we've already started taking precautions, so we can simply watch things progress for the time being. Did you manage what I asked without any trouble?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
022	Yes, but, my sweet sister, why are you—?
023	I believe I already told you that you don't need to know that. Oh, my. It seems we have some unexpected guests.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0015
024	It is so rare for you to come all the way here to see me. Is there something you need?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
025	Will you give us the remnants of the Sephira?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
026	My my. What is this all of a sudden? I'm afraid I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
027	All the other nobles, who seem to have gone into hiding since, say they know nothing. I thought you might know something about it all.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
028	I believe I just stated that I have no idea what you are talking about.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0010
029	Regardless, you were warned. Your time is now up.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
030	As was agreed, we will now be taking those with large amounts of Alchemia...by which I mean the remnants of the Sephira.
031	I already know the nobility of this land is responsible for the safekeeping of the Sephira and any information regarding them. There is no way you of all people know nothing about them.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0014
032	What...?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
033	Tell us the truth. The remnants of the Sephira will help the world a great deal.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
034	I cannot speak about matters I know nothing about. I ask that you withdraw for today.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
035	Hmph. Shrewd woman.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
036	This is a message from Lord Waginau. He says that if you do not offer up the remnants of the Sephira before your time is up, then we will retrieve them ourselves, by any means necessary.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
037	......
038	We are the Holy Order's shadows, but make no mistake: we are still of the Holy Order.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
039	I'm sure you know what refusing our demands would mean for you.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
040	I am not sure that it is right for us alone to bear the burden of supplying Alchemia. Perhaps there might be another way.	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
041	You are in no position to negotiate. It is regrettable, but if you continue to conceal them from us, then we will have to take them by force.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
042	Of course. I understand perfectly.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
043	Hmmm... So now I have the Corpse to worry about as well.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
044	Dearest sister! That was...!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
045	Forget about it. This isn't something you need to concern yourself with.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0014
046	But...!
047	A pretty stone viewed from afar may lose its glamour when viewed up close. There is no need for you to be disappointed by such things.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
048	I...understand, sister.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0018
049	Thank you, Ramses. However, it seems that I was correct in keeping my measures a secret from the rest of the nobility.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
050	It all went well, didn't it, Ramses?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
051	Yes, beloved sister! I did everything just as you asked. Here is my report!
052	Thank you, Ramses. It seems like everything will go exactly as I have planned.	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0017
053	Information must not be allowed to be leaked. It has been the duty of the nobility to maintain the desert's secrets since the court was first established.
054	These are the tools that I have to fight with!	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0010
055	Master Ryle, may I have a moment?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0003
056	What is it?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
057	Those bandits I mentioned have disappeared. However, they have left some chaos in their wake.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
058	The guild members are saying that there are not enough guards for their caravans. What shall we do about it?
059	You handle it. Just do what needs to be done.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0029
060	This is merely my humble opinion. However...might we not enlist the help of the Sand Hawks?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
061	They are strong and their prices are fair. Considering the current position of the guild, would they not be ideal?
062	Ideal? That's certainly one word for it. Carla is being targeted by Rashba. We don't want to get caught up in that.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0014
063	How unlike you not to recognize that risk for yourself.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
064	Is that so?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0004
065	Come to think of it... It's rare for you to suggest hiring another guild. Did something go down?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
066	You'll never know unless you try! I know that deep down inside the people of this desert are hoping for a peaceful home!
067	How is that not incentive enough?!
068	I think only of the Desert Wings. I have no ulterior motives.
069	Ankh... Can I ask you something?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
070	Of course, anything.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1038
071	Do you know anything about the remnants of the Sephira?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
072	Nothing. Why would you ask me such a thing?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0035
073	Just a hunch. I'm going to think on the matter of the caravan guards for a while. I'll come back when I've reached a decision.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
074	......
075	Hello, Ankh. It's been a while since we last saw each other.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
076	Lady Nefertiti?! What are you doing here?!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0027
077	My my. Why shouldn't I be here? I came to visit you, Ankh.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
078	Oh, save it! There's no way you'd show your face here without a motive!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0013
079	Dear Ankh, are you sure you want to take that tone with me? Tee hee hee. There's something I wish to confirm.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
080	I simply desire to know whether or not you have leaked any information about the Sephira.
081	I'd prefer it if you wouldn't make me out to be some sort of fool. You should know that there is no way I would do such a thing.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0042
082	Of course! I was just checking in. Thank you very much. I hope you do not think that I doubted you.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0035
083	Stop right there. What do you intend to do with Carla?	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
084	Tee hee hee. I've already taken measures. I won't disappoint. Surely you're not secretly hoping to be disappointed, either.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
085	You never change. I suppose I'll have to take action, too. You're right about one thing: I don't want to feel like that ever again.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
086	Ankh! Soldiers from Gluttony just came out of nowhere! We await your instructions!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
087	So...they're done putting on appearances, are they? It would be quite inconvenient if they were to disturb the peace of the desert.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0029
