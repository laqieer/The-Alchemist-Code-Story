048	Arghhhhhh!	VO_slba.slba_battle_0022
049	…! Sulva! Be careful--	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
050	Dammit…!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0015
051	I don't understand. What did Terese and King Arius entrust to me?
052	Whatever it is, I can't let things end here.	VO_slba.slba_battle_0019
053	That much I know! So…
054	Andechs! You, who are the most lauded knight in the land--
055	Deliver us a new dawn! Deliver us hope! And give us time to sort through this chaos!
056	May your blade be swift!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0002
057	You got it, kid!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
058	*Growl*	VO_satan.satan_battle_0002
059	…I am Andechs!
060	My desire to save my homeland--
094	Led me to betray my countrymen. I struck them down, amassing countless sins and corpses.
061	I don't expect any peace for me in the afterlife. I know my sins are too great.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
062	But--
063	I'm not dead yet! This is not the end for us!
064	Darkened Sword - Hamal! Heed my call!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
065	I, who carry the weight of my sins on my shoulders!
066	Let me open the path of hope for all who need it!
067	There! Now's your chance, Andechs!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
068	Hrrraaaahhhhh!!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
069	Andechs! Look out!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
070	Thanks! I owe you one!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0036
001	*Roar*	VO_satan.satan_battle_0003
071	Do you understand, Satna?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
072	I'm a criminal--a sinner who doesn't deserve forgiveness. But…I have allies who believe in me, nonetheless.
073	That's why I can fight! That's right. THIS--	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
002	This strike, the weight of my blade, this is my people's primal cry for life! Know it well!
003	This Wrath is my justice! It radiates the heat of life!
004	May it rend you asunder, beast of ruin!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0012
005	Is it…over?
006	...! Andechs! Satna is still--	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
007	…No, it's alright.
074	…!?!?
075	Wait, did you use magil to induce a delayed slash?
076	It's my special move. I call it…uh…"Death at Dawn Wahrheit!"	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
077	…Pff! Do you really need to name it?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
078	Oh, c'mon! It sounds cool, doesn't it? Who doesn't want to yell out a cool skill name and go wild?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
079	Did we really…defeat it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
080	Yeah. My sword most definitely captured its core.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
081	Then let's hurry up and get out of here. We've come too far to let the Ira Belt fall to corruption.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
082	Right. I'll leave that part to you. I'm only good with swords, anyway.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
083	Thanks to that sword, a path of hope has opened up in this region.
084	…I hope so. I really do.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
085	…
086	…Did you accomplish your goal?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
087	…Yeah.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
088	I said what I needed to say. I feel like I've been entrusted with something…very important.
089	I'm not sure exactly what that "something" is…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0031
090	But maybe that's okay. There's no right answer… I have to decide for myself.
091	I see…	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0020
092	…Let's live to the fullest, Andechs. For all those who couldn't be saved--for Terese and King Arius.
093	Well said. I couldn't agree more.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
008	…?
009	…The core…appears uncorrupted?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
010	What could this mean? Leviathan's core was certainly corrupted…
011	Huh? Did you hear something?
012	Nuh-uh. Why're you looking at me?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
013	Never mind. I thought I heard a weird sound just now…	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
014	Holy smokes! L-Libra!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0022
015	What're you doing, Mira! Stop Libra's pressurization!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0026
016	I-I'm trying! But nothing's working!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
017	What!?
018	Eek! At this rate, Libra's magil will overflow--	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
019	…! Don’t tell me all of Satna's corruption transferred to Libra!?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
020	Too bad…Pursuers. I'm a man who always has a plan B.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
021	The Space-Time transfer operation was designed to take place…no matter what…
022	Quence! How can you still…
023	Now then, Pursuers of Truth. I invite you on a journey to the past--	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0008
024	Tch!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
025	Brother, give me your hand!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
026	…Alright. Let's call it a day, shall we? Good work, everyone.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
027	…Looks like the town's repairs are on track. All that's left is to await Nimul's return…
028	…With everyone away--
029	It sure is quiet…	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
030	I never thought I'd miss Adaleigh's antics…	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
031	(…Maybe I should've been more insistent about joining them…)
032	No! What am I thinking? Nimul left me to look after this town!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
033	…I need to do more training. Maybe I should practice a bit--	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
034	…! Who are you?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
035	…Only an amateur would approach this close.
036	But desperate times call for desperate measures.
037	Are you…? That aura! You're…Zafeiris!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
038	Bravo, Seeker of Truth.
039	You, and only you, are unique. Unlike the other Pursuers, you have potential.
040	Potential?
041	The Pursuers of the Gula Belt are in danger. You must make a choice--
042	In order to save your companions, are you prepared to submit your body to corruption?
043	What!?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
044	The world will end, sooner or later. No matter how much humankind struggles or how much we pray...
045	But…is our fate truly set in stone?
046	I can't say for certain. How could I? All I know is--
047	That decision sparked a change. That much I remember, even now--
