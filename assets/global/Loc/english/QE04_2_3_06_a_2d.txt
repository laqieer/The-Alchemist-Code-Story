001	I wonder how the Gluttony army is cultivating the Jam?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
002	They were doing something to the trees...but I'm not sure what exactly...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
003	Maybe the Jam have some kind of eggs or something, and those were being hatched?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
004	Considering how many of the Jam there are, they would need a lot of eggs. I doubt that the Gluttony soldiers are walking around with bundles of eggs.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
005	Also, there don’t seem to be any traces of eggs on the trees.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
006	Look at this. This is one of the trees that the Jam emerged from.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
007	Hmm. Maybe they're invisible eggs?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
008	That would mean the Gluttony soldiers are able to see them somehow.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
009	It didn't seem like they were wearing any special equipment for that.
010	Right. Well, if not eggs then what?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
011	Voda wasn't certain, but she did mention that she might have an idea...something about breeding...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
012	When you say breeding, the first image I think of is eggs, but...oh...maybe they split apart?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
013	Split apart?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
014	You know, they're kind of soft and flabby like jelly. Wouldn't it make sense if they split apart in order to multiply?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
015	That's an interesting theory, but they would need an original form from which they can split apart from.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
016	Also, when they split apart...they would normally become smaller.
017	Right. In that case, I really wonder what it could be. Are they born from nothing?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
018	...Hmm.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
019	They emerge in various places...and suddenly increase...no, I can't think of anything.
020	...Achoo!
021	You scared me... What's the matter? Have you caught a cold?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
022	No, I just have a bit of a runny nose. I'm fine! There's no time to be catching colds right now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
023	Exactly! What if it's contagious and you give it to me...oh...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
024	What's the matter, Tina?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
025	Breeding...emerging in various places...the sudden increase...could it be...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
026	Did you figure something out?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
027	Well, I'm not certain yet...but, this could explain what's going on. I'll ask Voda about it.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
028	But...if my prediction is correct, it'll be quite troublesome to handle.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
