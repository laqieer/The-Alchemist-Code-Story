001	...
002	Why are you following me?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
003	Listen! It's too dangerous to go alone. I was worried!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0016
004	I'm not weak! You don't have to worry about me.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
005	And what're you trying to say? You think that I'm not strong, too?
006	I didn't say that! But...I can't just leave you alone.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
007	What's that supposed to mean?
008	I don't know... You're always trying to take off on your own... That kind of worries me.
009	Shut it. You don't know the first thing about me.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
010	They took everything from me. My family. My home... Everything!
011	I understand. I went through the same thing.
012	Huh?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
013	My home is gone. My Papa, my Mama... Besides my big sister, everyone was killed.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
014	When I got the news, I flew home from boarding school. But by then, I had no home to go back to.
015	O-oh...
016	I could only stand before the burned remnants of my home and cry. I couldn't even tell if I was angry, sad, or lonely...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
017	Something deep inside of me was set aflame, but even I don't know exactly what it was.
018	They say it was Alchemia that got out of control. Even though I understood that, I couldn't stop myself. I was so frightened I cried even more.
019	...
020	And then my big sister came and held me close. She told me that it would be all right.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
021	"You're not alone, Silma." "I'll be here for you. It'll be okay." She told me that.
022	If I was angry or sad or lonely, my big sister would take care of it. It must have been painful for her, too, but...
023	Because she was there for me, I knew that I wasn't alone. She saved me.
024	Ila, you remind me of me from back then. So I just can't leave you like this.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0002
025	...
026	I don't want to leave you alone. You've got friends that care. So...
027	Shut up!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
028	Ah!
029	You don't want to leave me alone? What do I care? I never asked you to do that!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
030	I'm fine alone! Don't go forcing me to be friends with you! I don't need anyone else!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
031	Ila!
032	(Ugh! She makes me so furious!)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
033	(What's the point of friends? Only weaklings gather friends around them. If I did that, I'd become a weakling, too.)
034	(And you can't trust weaklings. When things go wrong, they'll betray you. That's right, I saw horrible things in the back alleys...)
035	(When the going got tough, the weaklings would throw the weakest and the slowest to the dogs to save themselves.)	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
036	(The friends you shared a meal with yesterday will pretend they don't see you get kidnapped. No one will bother to save you.)
037	(You can't trust friends. I became stronger so I never have to rely on anyone else.)
038	(Right. I'm not weak. I'm strong! So this is a mission I can handle on my own. I'll prove it to Corvus!)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
039	So this is the place that guy was talking about. The hideout full of people that hold a grudge against the Shadow Messiah...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
040	Hey, you! What do you think you're doing over there?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
041	Oh!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0026
042	Oh, it's just some kid. What are you doing in a place like this?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
043	...
044	Hm? Wait... You're the brat that was with the Shadow Messiah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0003
045	We could use you to get revenge if we captured you.
046	Hmph! You think you can take me? Just try it!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
047	Uck... What a pain! Hey, everyone! Over here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
048	It doesn't matter how many of you weaklings there are. I won't lose!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0011
049	But there are way too many of them...
050	No...!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
051	Gya!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0001
052	What?!
053	Tadah! It's me, Silma!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0030
054	Silma? Why...?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
055	Ugh! Damn! She brought a friend?! Let's round 'em up and take them out!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0020
056	We can talk later! Now's the time to attack, Ila!
