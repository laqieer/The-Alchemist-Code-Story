001	Arghhh!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0043
002	Hmhmhm... What's wrong, dearie? I thought you were going to prove your love of Shayna to me.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0008
003	Nnrgh! Who the hell do you think you are?!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0018
004	If you claim to be a fan of a shining star like Shayna, you had better be possessed of both strength and beauty, just as I am!	VO_laura.laura_sys_0010
005	The most important qualities in a fan are strength and beauty...
006	And the purpose of these Fan Club Events is to both heighten those qualities and contest them! Are you prepared?	VO_laura.laura_battle_0010
007	H-hold on a moment! This is the first I'm hearing of such an objective!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0025
008	She's right! Merchandise and length of membership have nothing to do with being a fan!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
009	Yeah! Yeah!
010	Wh-what?! You guys actually agree with her?!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0026
011	Tch! Just because you're a Fan Club veteran, doesn't make you better than us! I've had enough of you acting all high and mighty!	VO_keibi.keibi_sys_0010
012	The fact that you've fought with Shayna herself puts you out of bounds of the fandom, for starters! It's downright unfair, that's what it is! You sly fox!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
013	What's going on over there? I had better nip this in the bud!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0026
