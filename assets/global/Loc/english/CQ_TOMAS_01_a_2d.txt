001	Wow! This town is as busy as ever!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0046
002	Oh, looks like there's going to be a festival!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0008
003	Fons, Reeves—stay close to me, all right?
004	Grr.
005	Lots of people are gonna need to take hangover-prevention meds beforehand.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0031
006	All because they have to go work the next day! Poor adults.
007	It'd be better if they just didn't drink so much that they needed to take the medicine, but what would I know?
008	Grrr...
009	Welcome!
010	A bottle of hangover-prevention, please!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0001
011	That'll be 800 Zeni.
012	What?! Not 600?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
013	We had a bad harvest for the herb we need for the medicine, so we had to bump up the price a little. You know how it is.
014	Uh-oh! But the village mayor only gave me 600 Zeni...	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0020
015	Aw, man. I just don't have enough. I'll be right back!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0035
016	All right. Sorry about that.
017	Yah done, kid?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
018	Oh! Uhh... Yeah!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
019	(Wh-whoa... This person is huge! They're probably super strong, too!)	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0046
020	...
021	Oh! Sorry for staring.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0035
022	No, no. I am impressed that you have tamed some Tigferes.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
023	You know about Tigferes, Mister? Haha, these two are my family!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0023
024	Really? Well, well. That is impressive. Perhaps I might even be inspired enough to lend you the remaining money you need for that medicine.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0044
025	Whoa! You'd lend money to a stranger, just like that?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
026	Thanks for the offer, Sir, but I'm good. I'll just come back later.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0033
027	Alright, then. If you say so.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0005
028	Yep. Well, I'm gonna head out now. Bye!
029	Whew. This seems like a good place for Fons and Reeves to cool off, too.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0005
030	C'mon, Fons! Reeves! Let's share this kebab I picked up from that food stall.
031	Hey.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
032	Grrr...
033	I've been looking for some exotic animals like these. I don't suppose I could take them off your hands?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
034	I bet creatures as magnificent as these could learn at least one trick... I think I could make better use of them than you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
035	Excuse me? There's no way I'd hand them over to you! Fons and Reeves are my family!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0015
036	Hey. I saw them first.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
037	Oh yeah? How about I show you my fist in your⁠—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
038	G-Gormalas?! What're you doing here?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
039	What?!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
040	You're Gormalas, the infamous pirate?!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0024
041	Tch! Noisy brat. Pipe down and let me deal with the problem at hand first!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
