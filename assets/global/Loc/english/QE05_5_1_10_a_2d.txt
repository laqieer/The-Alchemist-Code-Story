001	There! That must be the Liberation Army's camp!
002	Take the carriage to the back of the formation. Be sure to keep it away from any water.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
003	Yes, Sir!
004	Kamui! Glad to see you've made it!
005	Sorry to make you wait, your Highness. We've brought all that we could carry.
006	Now, the question is simply whether it will work or not.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
007	It worked on some of the Jam we encountered along the way. If there're no differences in the individual creatures, it should work just fine.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
008	Were you able to prepare what we discussed?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
009	Yes, we managed to build several large catapults. We've also issued slings to each soldier.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0004
010	But...these still may not be enough to cover the entire battlefield.
011	Don't worry. I have an idea.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
012	Is there something I can do to help?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
013	Perfect! Wind like this should be able to carry the agent anywhere on the battlefield!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0024
014	Wind Ouija isn't really meant to be used like this.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
015	Sorry, but we have to use what we can, however we can. We'll need you to deliver the drying agent throughout the battlefield.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0039
016	Using Ouija over such a large area would cost me a lot of energy. I'd only be able to do it a few times.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
017	Mocca should be getting here sometime soon. Wouldn't it lighten your load if you two took turns over time?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
018	Maybe, but I'll have to work alone for a while either way, won't I? Ugh, this is going to suck.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
019	We'll need you to coordinate the details of the distribution, Adelbert.
020	Me? I feel like I should be on the front lines leading the soldiers, as their commander.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
021	Ceclidis is at the arboreal altar beyond the ruins of the Sephira village.
022	The Sephira village is well hidden. Someone who knows the terrain should stand at the front.
023	Very well. Then I'll leave the soldiers to you, Kamui.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0037
024	It's for the best.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0034
025	Here's the plan... First, Logi and I will lead the Blue Tongues to the base of Sephiron.
026	That will draw the Jam out to face you, won't it?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
027	That's what I expect. Ceclidis uses the Jam as extensions of his own limbs.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
028	Once we engage, I'll use Spiritbonding to raise hell.
029	That's when we'll use the catapults and Tina's Ouija to rain down the drying agent, huh?
030	Speed is key for this plan. We only have a limited amount of drying agent, and—
031	The resurrection ceremony...
032	If what we heard at the royal capital is true, the completion of the ceremony would mean their powers will grow exponentially.
033	Not to mention, Marie's safety will be at stake.
034	Exactly. We will charge deep into their formation and disrupt their plans as quickly as possible.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
035	And if possible, we will take Ceclidis out on the spot.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
036	He is the source of Jam in this country.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
037	Removing him from the equation should rid us of all the Jam, if not weaken them significantly.
038	That would help us end this conflict very quickly.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0024
039	Exactly. Now, let's get everything ready.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
040	...!
041	Logi, are you ready?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
042	Yes, as are the Blue Tongues.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
043	...
044	Are you worried about Agatha and Dias?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
045	Dias said he would not fight with us, did he not?
046	He's always been so hardheaded. He never goes back on his word.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
047	Agatha used to be able to drag him out no matter what, but I'm not sure if she can do so in her current state.
048	Don't worry, Logi, I've already advised her on the matter.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
049	You have?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
050	We'll head out if you're ready. We'll take the shortest route possible to Sephiron.	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
051	Y-yeah!
