001	The time has come. We will finally resurrect the Demon.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
002	Reconsider this, Sabareta! Listen to what I'm telling you!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
003	The Demon is our last hope. Do not attempt to meddle any further.
004	Wait! What do you mean by "hope"?
005	Are you trying to tell me that the Demon's revenge is the hope of the people of Wratharis?!
006	Why not?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
007	Why not end the reign of Alchemy at the hands of the ultimate creature of Alchemy. Doesn't that sound satisfying?
008	The purification of this foul, rotten world... What other hope is there? This is the long-cherished wish of our people.
009	No... That's wrong! That will only give birth to further hatred!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
010	The resurrected Demon will bring about the end of the world!
011	Those who are killed and the families they leave behind will be in the same circumstances that all of you once were in.
012	Are you telling me that's your hope?!
013	...!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0018
014	If that were to occur, the descendants of those from Wratharis will eventually encounter the same revenge!
015	The cycle of grief will continue on forever!
016	The Alchemy, which you intend to eliminate, will cause this conflict to continue for hundreds of years to come!
017	The die has already been cast. It cannot be helped.
018	It can be helped! You can stop this cycle of grief!
019	Precisely because you are Sabareta, knight of Wratharis, who has experienced the pain caused by Alchemy.
020	Don't be absurd. What other option is there? You're speaking in ideals. It's nothing more than a pipe dream.
021	No! There is just one other option! It's to restore the Kingdom of Wratharis!
022	What...?!
023	You and your people are going to restore the Kingdom of Wratharis!
024	Envylia will support your effort! If our two conflicting kingdoms can work hand in hand, then I am certain there can be peace in the world.
025	That's absurd—a humorless joke. What you are suggesting is impossible.
026	We won't know until we try! I will personally negotiate with Envylia!
027	What?!
028	As a novice of the Holy Order of Babel, I will convince King Patrick!
029	You cannot say there's zero chance of it working! So, please...promise me you won't resurrect the Demon until then!
030	... ...
031	Lord Sabareta! The enemy is attacking!
032	Fine. I'll be there soon.
033	Wait! Please, Sabareta! This is something only you can do! Sabareta!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
034	You speak nonsense.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
035	Enough... The wheels of fate have already been set in motion.
036	For the sake of the families that were murdered, casting aside our blades of revenge is something I cannot do!
