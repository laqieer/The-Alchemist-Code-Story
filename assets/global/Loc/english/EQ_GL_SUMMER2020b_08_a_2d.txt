001	Shion! Eira! How did you know where to find us?
002	Foxes... found you!
003	They found the clothing scraps nearby while playing around in the forest, and then they stumbled onto you.
004	We came as fast as we could.
005	They warned us right in the nick of time!
006	If you guys hadn't jumped in when you did, we would have been in some real trouble.
007	That was some horde that ambushed us here.
008	If the monsters are showing up in force like this, Roxanne might be in serious danger!
009	Not a moment to waste then, Eira, can you track the beasts' trail?
010	Mm! Dormarch... chase!
011	Awooo!
012	Let's go!
013	Stop!
014	... many... monsters!
015	Woah... that's an even bigger horde than the one that attacked us earlier!
016	I don't see Roxanne anywhere... did she manage to escape them?
017	Wait, look! That wolf's biting down on some fabric... is that from Roxanne's swimsuit as well?
018	There's no telling from this distance, we're going to have to get up close!
019	And that means taking all of them out! Let's do this!
