001	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0019
002	This isn't working! Every last drop of this ocean acts like a shrine for that thing!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
003	The territory it controls is on a whole different level from other Cursed Beasts!
004	We have to separate it from the ocean if we want to stand any chance at all!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
005	Indeed.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
006	Daphne, can you handle it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
007	Yes, I will... Leave it to me.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
008	Eh? What do you plan on doing with that shield?! Surely you don't believe you can actually stop a tsunami with that!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
009	I'm not planning to stop it. I will simply create a safe place for us.
010	To give the citizens of this kingdom a safe place to reside... That has always been this shield's true purpose!
011	"We are the ones who embraced Envy—"	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
012	"My body is a shield, a silver barrier that blocks and breaks all that attempt to cross it." Mesarthim, please grant us a safe place free of sin!
013	What's happening?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
014	Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh?!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0020
015	It dove back into the ocean?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
016	No... No way! Did you cleave the ocean in half with that massive magil barrier?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
017	Now we can separate Leviathan from the ocean's magil! So the next course of action is—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
018	Combining our powers so I can slam this blade right down its throat!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
019	B-be careful! Splitting the ocean in two has left Mesarthim at its limit!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
020	We don't have a lot of time before the barrier cracks and the ocean breaks through!
021	Don'tcha worry 'bout a thing, Daphne. This won't take long.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
022	After all, your everyday righteous knight is here!
