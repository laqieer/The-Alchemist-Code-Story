001	Sir Knight! Please, wait! What do you plan to do with them?
002	What does it matter to you? The monsters have been taken care of. They aren't your concern anymore.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
003	Bu-but, the Wratharis soldiers also protected the village.
004	As Dias smiles coldly, Logi and Agatha come rushing up.
005	Dias! What are you doing?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
006	You came just in time. Help me get these guys to talk.
007	Hey! Where is your leader Sabareta? Hurry up and spit it out!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
008	Dias mercilessly kicks the Wratharis soldiers. 
009	Agh...!!!
010	Dias! How could you?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
011	I-I've told you already! I'm not saying a word to you, you religious dogs! Hurry up and kill me!
012	I see. In that case, I'll grant you your wish right now!
013	Saying this, Dias swings his sword upwards.
014	Stop!!! Don't do it, Dias!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
015	Let go! Why are you stopping me?! They are the ones that bare their fangs at us. Are you trying to defend the enemy?!
016	You lot are always the same!
017	You've destroyed our kingdom and continue to rob us of our home.
018	Our wrath has awoken a mighty power! Foolish Envylia... Your day of reckoning is at hand!
019	Shut up! Quit using your rebel logic to justify your heinous actions!
020	Dias kicks the Wratharis soldier even more violently.
021	Stop! What're you thinking, Dias? Even if they're enemy knights, we should give them medical treatment.	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0006
022	Hearing her voice, Dias falls still. However, dissatisfaction remains etched across his face.
023	I-if it would be all right...I'd like to use this herbal medicine to treat them.
024	Yes, of course. Please.
025	Logi? You too?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
026	The Envylia citizens bow their heads to Agatha and the others before they begin to treat the knights.
