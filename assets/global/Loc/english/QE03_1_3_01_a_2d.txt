001	It's creepy no matter how many times I see it. Why do these insects that are supposed to be small become so big?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
002	I heard they evolve because of Philosopher's Stones.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
003	Philosopher's Stones? Are those the ones we learned about in class?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
004	Are you saying that the insects eat the bits of Alchemy scattered throughout the world?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
005	They're too big for a small insect to consume. It's the sap.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0039
006	The sap?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
007	I heard rumors that there's a tree on the outskirts of the forest that was raised using Philosopher's Stones as fertilizer.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
008	The insects consumed the sap from that tree and thus grew to be so big. On top of that, they apparently became resistant against the cold.
009	I've been thinking this from before, but the information you have, Alma, um, you can't really call them...rumors.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
010	They're practically top secret information. Rumors are rumors because they're common knowledge. Where are you getting your information from?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
011	Never mind the details. So, apparently, they tear off the shells of those insects and use them as armor—that's why they're called Bugmail.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
012	Tear off...?! But those insects were once men, right?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
013	Maybe they think that if they inflict pain on the hateful witches, it would bring peace to the men now being used as armor.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
014	How terrible! This is so...wrong! Why do men and women have to fight each other in the first place?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
015	Hey...calm down! If you make too much noise the Bugmail will find us!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
016	Then we'll just stop the Bugmail! Everything is wrong with this situation!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0013
017	Wow...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0044
018	You've gotta be kidding me!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
019	A portion of this country seems to be wary of the Holy Guard—of me.
020	Soon the Mage's will come from the Royal Palace in order to suppress the resistance.
021	Should I use that opportunity to slip into the Royal Palace? Or...
022	Huff...huff... Ohh!
023	You...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
024	Captain Dias?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
025	Why did you come out? You understand that it's dangerous, don't you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
026	I'm going to stop...the Bugmail!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
027	What?
028	This conflict...it's all wrong! Why do men and women from the same country have to fight?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
029	If only everyone would drink and talk, they'd be able to get along like my mom and the old men who came by frequently.
030	People aren't that simple. The same battle will continue over and over again...until the world changes drastically.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
031	You're talking about on a continent-wide scale, aren't you?
032	...!
033	True, I don't think that it's possible for people to get along on a continent-wide scale just by talking.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
034	...But we're talking about men and women who were born and raised in the same country!
035	They're the individuals who are supposed to love each other the most. I'm sure they can learn to understand each other!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0014
036	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
037	Honestly... There's never a dull moment with you.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
038	I've never seen a Paladin that could be reasoned with to this degree.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
039	Alma! Rebecca!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0009
040	But there's truth to what Liz said.
041	Well, when it comes to animals, it's normal for the males and females to get along.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
042	This isn't a dream or an ideal! It's just a matter of someone acting on it! So...I will!
043	... ...
044	Well then...what are we gonna do?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
045	There are countless insects on both sides of us.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
046	Let's find this Salomo guy! If we can stop him, then all of this should end!
047	In order to do that, we need to break through the swarm of insects.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
048	Complaining won't decrease their numbers. We've just gotta do it.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
049	Let's go, everyone!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0015
