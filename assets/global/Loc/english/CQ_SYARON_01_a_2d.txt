001	I'm told this village has been experiencing an unusual outbreak of monsters recently?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
002	That's right. All of a sudden, whole packs of them have started attacking out of nowhere... We've been at our wits' end.
003	Well, you are in safe hands now. We'll put an end to this before anyone else gets hurt.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0037
004	You will? I can't thank you enough!
005	(Finally, my first mission in command of my juniors. If I do a good job, it's sure to reflect well on Bertha too.)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
006	How did Sharon end up in the Royal Knights anyway? Wasn't she hoping to get into the Scarlet Flame Guard?
007	Maybe her instructor set her on the wrong path? Poor girl, being let down like that...
008	...
009	(Bertha was the one who inspired me to join the Royal Knights. I've got to show her that she was right to have faith in me.)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
010	We're going to split into two groups, so please listen carefully.
011	Group one, I want you to scout the area. Group two, help shore up the village's defenses. If anything happens, report it to me immediately.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0003
012	If I may, commander, wouldn't it be easier to head into the forest and track these monsters down ourselves? If we leave now—
013	We can cross that bridge when we come to it.
014	But I want to do this right. All I need for the moment is for you to follow my orders.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
015	I... Understood.
016	...
017	(The sounds around me used to be so much nicer when I was with Bertha and her squad.)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
018	(Here, they sound so suffocated... All these sighs and weary footsteps. I thought I'd given reasonable orders, but...)
019	Hey, what gives? What about our deal?!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0025
020	Erm... Well, it's unfortunate that things have turned out this way, but it looks like we'll have to cancel our arrangement.
021	I'm sorry to have called you out here for no reason, but as you can see, the Royal Knights are here now.
022	Well, we're all fired up to kill some monsters, so let us at 'em! C'mon, I'll even cut you a discount!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0030
023	The infamous Won, giving up on the chance for more coin? Before you took on disciples, you would have snatched it out of my hand.
024	Hey, I haven't gone soft! It's just, y'know... Money's not the only reason I'm... Look, can't you cut us a break?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
025	I suppose you've helped us out on more than a few occasions. If it's that important to you...
026	Excuse me, good knight, but would you mind taking on a few extra hands? Won's no slouch in combat, I assure you.
027	So you are the ones responsible for keeping the monsters at bay.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0045
028	We would be glad of your assistance.
029	All right! Thanks a bunch, miss!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0023
030	I'm Won, Greed Dike's finest jack of all trades, and these fine folk are my disciples. Nice to meet you!
031	I'm Sharon of the Royal Knights of Envylia. It's my pleasure.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
032	Oh-ho? We've got visitors! Look lively, you lot! Show me all that training wasn't for nothing!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
