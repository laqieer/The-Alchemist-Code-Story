001	What is this place?	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0027
002	Oh, that's strange. Your soul also exists in a distant world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0044
003	I am...huh? My memory... What's going on? Hey, who are you?
004	I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
005	Hm...I see. I sense an energy within you that's different from Alchemy. Are you a warrior from another world?
006	Yeah, I'm Vargas! Ah, that's it! I'm Vargas!	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0037
007	My head's messed up, and there's a lot I can't remember. I guess it'll come back to me eventually.
008	So, what is this place?
009	The Door of Truth.
010	What happens here? You said you're the observer of destiny?
011	Warrior from another world, I will observe what you bring about in this world.
012	What I'll bring about in this world?
013	Yes.
014	Hm. I see. My memory's still a little foggy, but there's only one thing for me to do.	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0045
015	Is that so?
016	Well, just watch!	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0038
017	Very well. I will observe the energy of your soul!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
