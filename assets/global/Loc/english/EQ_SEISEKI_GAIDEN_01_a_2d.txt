001	I knew it... It's just like I thought. This...is a record of a war fought in the distant past.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
002	If this is true, it's a discovery that ought to be written into the history of Alchemy. Mm... I'm going to investigate this some more.
003	Kaya...
004	This part is interesting. Don't disturb me, okay?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
005	Kaya, bout with me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
006	What?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
007	I must surpass you, Kaya, and give you a proper send-off toward your new path.
008	This is the resolution I have come to.
009	Heh heh. You're tactless, you know that? And you're as clueless about women as ever.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
010	You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.
011	Nngh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
012	But...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
013	I do like that look in your eyes. Allow me to test your resolve.
014	I suppose this is a good spot for it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
015	Nn...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
016	This is unusual for me...but I won't hold back.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
017	Come to think of it...this is our first bout, isn't it?
018	If you let your guard down, you won't get off lightly. You do realize that my Alchemia is of an irregular class, do you not?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
019	I possess Alchemia on par with the Sephira... "Alchemia Pura".
020	That is exactly why you're worth defeating. I will surpass you, here and now, as both your Lord Commander and as an old friend.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
021	Kaya...as you set out on your new path, this is my parting gift to you! For I am a bastion of absolute justice!
022	There's that fire of yours. If you truly are capable of shouldering the justice of Babel, then come... Show me!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0009
023	The Holy Guard, who administer justice in Babel. Shortly after the tenth Lord Commander is appointed.
024	This is the untold record of the days of the Lord Commander's youth, inscribed into a Philosopher's Stone.
025	Sacred Stone Memories
026	Before daybreak. At the Gates of Sin.
027	Um... Lord Zain...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
028	Hm?
029	What is it? Why is your face so red?
030	Lord Zain... I've always adored you! Please...allow me to stay by your side!
031	What...? A-always?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
032	Yes, always! And I want to remain with you, to be forever by your side!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0004
033	With me..forever... Hmm...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0044
034	Yes, so please... Please!
035	Oh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0024
036	I see! I'm incredibly moved!
037	So then...!!!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0025
038	Yes! Of course! It is reassuring to know that you will always be by my side. I thank you!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
039	We are comrades, fighting side by side to uphold justice in Babel! I'm counting on you!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
040	No, wait, that's not what I...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0028
041	No... Never mind. Please...forget I said anything!
042	Why do you look so sad?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
043	Lord Zain...
044	Othima? Oh, and you, too, Monzein... Was something I said to her strange just now?
045	A little, Lord Zain. You can be a bit...clueless...about women, at times.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
046	What? I don't think his response was strange at all.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
047	Hush, Monzein! A fuddy-duddy like you will just make things worse!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
048	What did you say to me?! You little...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
049	Just drop it and be quiet!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
050	I see... I wronged her without even realizing it. I must go and apologize immediately!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
051	Wha—?! What are you doing, Othima? Unhand me! I must apologize to her!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
052	You can't! It will have the opposite effect! Monzein, don't just stand there! Help me out here!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
053	Why should I? There's nothing wrong with apologizing!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
054	Argh, you two don't understand women at all!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
055	Hmph. If you insist, then I suppose I had better not.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
056	Oh man... The perfect Lord Zain's only flaw...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
057	By the way, Monzein... Have you heard from Kaya?
058	Yes... Lady Kaya will step down from her rank as Captain of the 2nd Regiment.
059	If she told even you that, then I guess she must be serious about it. I was hoping that she was just playing a trick on me. Where is Kaya now?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
060	Actually, about that... There was a note on her desk. Here.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
061	I'm setting off on a new journey. Don't come looking for me, okay? If you do, you'll get hurt. I'll return my coat of arms the next time we meet.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
062	Is this all? That woman...
063	She was talking excitedly about some new ruins that she discovered recently. I assume that's where she's gone.
064	Ruins again... I have no choice but to follow and persuade her to not to leave.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
065	Frankly, losing Lady Kaya will strike a blow to the Holy Guard.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
066	There's a reason why she's called the Crimson Dragon. Not only does she possess an incredible amount of Alchemia in her body, the "Alchemia Pura"...
067	But many have said that her extensive knowledge, combined with her skill in battle, make her superior to the previous Lord Commander.
068	I already knew Lady Kaya was incredible, since we are in the same regiment, but to hear such praise coming from you...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0024
069	Well, I know I wouldn't feel confident taking on someone like her, with her encyclopedia of knowledge.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
070	Besides, isn't Lady Kaya an old friend of yours, Lord Zain?
071	That's right. Both as friend and as Lord Commander, her resignation as Captain hurts me deeply.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
072	For now, I suppose I must go to these ruins.
073	Thank you. I am sorry, but I will be unable to go with you. I have my duties in the 2nd Regiment to attend to.
074	I'm rather busy myself. I think you're the only one who could convince her anyway, Lord Zain.
075	Alright then. Leave it to me. Return to your duties.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0037
076	Yes, sir!
077	(That being said, I'm not sure even I can do this. It's times like this that I wish I could call on Cadanova for help.)	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
078	(I have no idea what Kaya's thinking... Does that mean I really don't understand women?!)	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
079	(This isn't good enough.)
080	(I can't save the women of Babel if I don't understand them!)
081	(I will convince Kaya to stay, no matter what, and I will become a Lord Commander who can save all in need of help!)	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
082	Oh, Lord Commander!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
083	You... You're the one who stood against Zahar at the graduation trial... Kanon?
084	(She's the one who witnessed Cadanova's end.)	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
085	Oh, oh my goodness! For the Lord Commander to remember my name... I am so honored.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
086	You don't need to be so nervous...and you can just call me Zain.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
087	Ah... Yes, Lord Zain, sir!
088	Hm...
089	(I sense something like a shard of light from within her...but I don't think she is yet aware of its existence.)
090	(I wonder what would happen if she met Kaya.)
091	Is something the matter, Lord Zain?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
092	Kanon, I have a task for you. I will join you later.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
093	A...task? To receive a task from Lord Zain himself... I am so honored! Where am I going?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
094	There are some ruins I want you to visit. The Captain of the 2nd Regiment...the Crimson Dragon...Kaya. She should be there.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
095	Lady Kaya...? At the ruins...?
096	That's right. I'll join you later. I'm counting on you, Kanon.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
097	Hmmm... This mural is even older. An enormous...beast? What could this possibly mean?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
098	Could this be...the Cursed Beast?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
099	There is a blank period in the history of the Holy Guard... A small piece of that might lie here, and if it does...
100	This is a greater discovery than I had expected. I need to leave my post as Captain as quickly as possible, so that I can reach the truth behind this mural.
101	Ooh, this is so exciting. Now then...what do you have to show me?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
102	I finally found you! Lady Kaya! Ah... Oh... Oh nooooooo!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
103	Ow...	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
104	Just who are you? That was quite a noisy entrance.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0004
105	Right now, I'm trying to begin some very important research, you know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
106	Oh, I'm sorry! My name's Kanon! I'm a new recruit!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0035
107	The gods only know why, but I assume the gist of it is that Lord Zain told you to bring me back to him.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
108	Wha—? How did you...?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
109	Hm? Oh. You're that girl... The one who did so well in the final trial.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
110	If the Order has members like you, then I am certain that I am no longer needed.
111	It is you who should support the Holy Guard from here on.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
112	That's why Cadanova gave you that sword...isn't it?
113	Wow! You know so much about me!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
114	There's not a single person in the Order who doesn't know who you are at the moment, Kanon.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
115	The Flame Dragon King himself told you that, didn't he?
116	Hm, yes... I am curious about you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
117	Heheh, this isn't like me at all, but since you're here, I will give you some personal training.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
118	Huh?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
119	Don't just stand there... Come on, get ready. You don't want me to change my mind, do you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
120	But...there's no reason for us to fight, Lady Kaya!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
121	So you need a reason... Let me see... In that case...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
122	Allow me to test whether you are capable of wielding Cadanova's sword and continuing his legacy!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
123	Eek!
124	I guess she was hurt by Lord Zain's comment, after all...
