001	Oof. Strength in numbers really doesn't seem to mean a lot to him right now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
002	Rraaaaaaaahh!!!
003	We'll collapse from exhaustion alone at this rate! Is there no way for us to at least wear him down?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
004	Hyaaaaaaaah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
005	Gnn... Hrgh!
006	Did that do the trick?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
007	No. It's not over yet.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
008	Oh, come on, already! Is there really nothing else we can do?!
009	If only I could've managed to draw out all of Sumeragi's powers...	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
010	What do you mean?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
011	The Black Star Clan is tasked with the forging of Sumeragi, but for the blade to truly shine, it needs to taste the blood of one of its brethren.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
012	Well, then what are you waiting for? Pull it out and drip some blood, if that's what it takes!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
013	You misunderstand. My blood would offer some power, perhaps, but Sumeragi's true brethren would be the Kagomurasaki Clan, and they are...no more.
014	Ugh, that figures. Amane! Got any ideas?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
015	...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
016	(If only Azami were here...)
017	Oh! Wait!
018	Maybe... Just maybe...
019	Amane, watch out!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
020	Agh!
021	Captain Ugachi!
022	Haaaaaaah!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0032
023	What are you thinking, rookie? If you've got a plan, then spit it out already! Ngh...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
024	Captain Ugachi!
025	It doesn't matter that I lost an arm.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
026	I'd never forgive myself if we got defeated because we just stood around doing nothing!
027	...!
028	Even rushing in without a plan is better than that. I'll be your shield, or whatever else you need. Just stop dawdling and tell me what to do!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
029	...It's practically a suicide mission, though.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
030	You still don't get how the Blade Fox works, do you, rookie?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
031	No, unfortunately, I do. Captain Ugachi, please work with Edgar to stop Tamba's movements. Even the smallest opening for just a moment would be good enough.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
032	Give me that, and we'll get this thing finished.
033	You heard her, Edgar!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
034	Sounds to me like her plan involves us just rushing in and dying! What kinda crap plan is that?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
035	So, what is my role?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
036	I need you to offer some of your blood to Sumeragi, Jubei...then pass it to me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
037	To...you? But—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
038	Don't worry. As soon as we have our opening with Tamba, I'll give the signal and Logi will use Kagutsuchi.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
039	What will that accomplish?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
040	If I'm right about this...it'll finish this fight.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
041	Well, it's not like our current plans are getting us anywhere. I'll follow your lead.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0037
042	Same. You got this, Amane.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
043	...Glk...!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0019
044	Through the blood of the Black Star Clan...Sumeragi, I offer you this power.
045	Treasure Blade Sumeragi, forged to slay demons... The thoughts and feelings that dwell within the Sacred Three shall serve as our ultimate weapon!
046	With all three in hand, we cannot lose!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
