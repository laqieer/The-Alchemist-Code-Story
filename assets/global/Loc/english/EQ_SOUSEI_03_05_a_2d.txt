001	The Cursed Beast is here with us?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
002	You mean it's not sealed?
003	As its name suggests, Belphegor is a beast of sloth.
004	It rarely ever moves. It sleeps beneath the ground, reveling in its laziness.
005	It only moves when it turns in its sleep, but even that is a matter of life or death for us.
006	That's why the most vital facilities of this region are kept on the floating islands.
007	So everything and everyone considered valuable escaped to the sky, while everyone else was left to suffer down here to maintain them.
008	And that's how the people of this region live.
009	That's so awful...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
010	As long as the Cursed Beast exists, there will be no safety for the people who live on the surface. That's just the way it is.
011	Let's not dwell on that. Now that we're done with the Fallen, let's go back to the village.
012	The miners might have found signs of the inspection team.
013	Right—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
014	Another earthquake?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
015	This one is huge! Everyone, brace yourselves!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
016	Over here! I've locked my spatial coordinates, so you should be safe next to me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
017	Quickly!
018	Ahh!
019	Emmel?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
020	I'm closer! Nimul, you help the twins secure their—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
021	The ground is breaking apart!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
022	Ahhhhhhh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0028
023	Emmel! Damn, I can't reach!
024	The shaking stopped?
025	Yes, but...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
026	Emmel! Adaleigh! Can you hear me? Answer me!
027	Damn it... Did they fall into a lower tunnel? There's no way we can get down there from here. We'll have to go around.
028	I'm on my way, you two! So hold tight!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
029	Urgh... Where are we?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
030	Emmel! Are you hurt?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
031	Adaleigh? Where are we? Oh, right! We fell down here!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
032	W-wait, Emmel! You can't move around like that!
033	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
034	You're bleeding from your shoulder! Where's that first aid kit...
035	Huh...
036	Found it! I'm surprised you can move at all with that. Doesn't it hurt?
037	Yes, but I'm used to this kind of injury.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
038	Don't push yourself too hard! I'm sure Nimul is worried. I'm worried!
039	Thank you, Adaleigh, but I'm really all right.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
040	I can use Spiritbonding to stop the bleeding.
041	O-okay.
042	But where are we? It looks like we fell quite a long way.
043	I think we fell into an old tunnel they don't use anymore. The Engineer Soldiers can't sense any Stones of the Gods here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
044	If so, it will take some time for Nimul and the others to come and find us.
045	Yeah, probably...
046	What's wrong?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
047	It's just that I'm now wondering if Icona had an accident like this.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
048	I think she'd be okay, but still...
049	You're worried.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
050	Yeah.
051	I'm sure she's all right. We'll all meet up again soon.
052	Okay.
053	You really care about Icona, don't you?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
054	What?! N-no, it's not like that!
055	I just have a debt to repay to her. She can't get killed or anything before that.
056	Debt?
057	Right after we became apprentices to an engineer of Redington, there was an accident. She almost died.
058	There was an experiment with a magil compression reactor. It exceeded criticality and everything went flying.
059	Icona protected me. She lost an arm and an eye because of me.
060	Even though it was all my fault, she always tells me to forget it, to smile, because she can just build new ones.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
061	She's a strong one, isn't she?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0044
062	Yeah, she's great. She always had more talent than me.
063	So there's no way she'll go and die in a place like this!
064	Adaleigh...
065	Grrr, arrgh, ngh!
066	Fallen?! All the way down here?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
067	Emmel, stay back!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
068	Huh? But—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
069	You can't fight with a wound like that! I'll handle it!
070	I'll protect you, I promise. So leave it to me!
071	Ngh...
072	Take this!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1030
