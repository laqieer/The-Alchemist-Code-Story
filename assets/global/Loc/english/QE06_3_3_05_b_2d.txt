001	Is that the best you've got?! That didn't even require our full force as we are, much less the awakening of anyone's demon powers!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
002	Oh, certainly, but that was just an appetizer while the main course was being prepared. Your true fight begins now!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
003	Is this more to your liking?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
004	Dismortants!
005	Not quite. They're duplicates of myself, subdivided from my own body. Though this does little to distinguish them from those...other beings.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
006	I don't much care for those so-called Dismortants, you see. So I'd prefer not to use that label, even if that man did help awaken my ability to subdivide.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
007	But when the duplicates are my own, we can all more easily function as one!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
008	It's galling to rely upon anything given by that conniving human, but it would be foolish not to make use of every advantage at my disposal.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
009	This should turn the tides, and bring you Blade Fox down once and for all!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
010	Hyaaaahhhh!!!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0032
011	Now's my chance!
012	Whew. Thanks, Azami.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
013	Keep your head in the game, Amane. That goes for you, too, Captain Ugachi. And you, Captain Tanosuke!
014	...
015	We Blade Fox demon slayers cut down demons by fang and claw, and are always ready to perform our duty to the last.
016	We are demon-splitting blades, in the flesh! To that end, we must be resolute. Do not allow yourselves the luxury of distraction!
017	I would never! And you've got some nerve, including me in that speech...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0047
018	Me neither. Let's all remember our oath, because this is exactly what we made it for. This is the time to fight like you all mean it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
019	(Right. I took that oath, too.)
020	(Celis, I've been blessed with such fine allies.)
021	(You feel the same way about them, don't you? You warned me not to get too close, but that's kinda hard, all things considered.)
022	(I can't just let people this good die in a such a pointless battle.)
096	(I want them all to enjoy your excellent cooking again, like always.)
023	(Of course, it'd be more fun if I were there too, but I don't wanna push my luck asking for the moon.)	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
024	(So instead, I'm just going to pray that you, at least, make it back so you can watch over these fine people properly. And until then, I guess that'll be my job!)
025	Ghk!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0042
026	I never thought you, of all people, would lose focus so easily! Will we ever see that classic Captain Tanosuke spark light our skies again?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
027	It certainly has been a while, come to think of it. But if ever there were a time to bring it back, that time is now! So get it together already!
028	Haha... Hahahahahaha!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
029	She's got me there. These lot really are just the best. And when people this brilliant are counting on you...
030	...you can't let 'em down, no matter what.
031	Is this to be our last stand? Hardly. However many of us you cut down, I can readily replace them all!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
032	!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
033	This will be your end, Blade Fox!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
034	...
035	Seal!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0011
036	!!!
037	Well done. All right, everybody, take five. I've got it from here.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
038	What do you think you're doing?!
039	Seal.
040	!!!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
041	Captain Tanosuke... Don't tell me...
042	Captain Ugachi, I'm sorry I've always played so fast and loose with rules and procedures. I know I probably gave you gray hairs, but I love you like a brother.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
043	And you know how you always tell me to stop fooling around? Well, I'm not fooling around this time. I want you to see my true potential.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
044	Tanosuke!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
045	Azami, you've had things pretty rough. If I had it my way, I'd see to it that you lived a normal life in a peaceful world. If only it were that easy, right?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
046	Captain Tanosuke!
047	Last but not least, Amane.
048	...
049	I'm going to be the one doing the protecting this time...because I choose to. So don't push yourself so hard anymore, okay? I'll keep you all safe.
050	These sound a lot like final farewells. Whatever you're thinking, don't do it! Please!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
051	Looks like I really won't be able to come back. Sorry about that, everyone.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0035
052	Captain Tanosuke!
053	How is he this powerful?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
054	What kind of person am I? I've been asking myself that a lot over the years. Am I more demon, or human?
055	After a while, I kind of just stopped even bothering to question it. I figured it didn't really matter, in the end.
056	What do matter are the people in my life who are important to me. Protecting them is, always has been, and always will be priority one. That's just what I'm about.
057	Without fail, whenever I'd go out of my way to protect something, a voice would always echo through my head:
058	Strength... I must gain the strength...to protect...
059	You might think I was scared to unleash my power because I was worried people would condemn me for being a demon. But that was never it.
060	I just knew in my gut that if I were ever to answer that voice, I wouldn't be able to come back from it.
061	I was never sure if I were the only one who could hear it or not.
062	I also didn't know what, exactly, I wouldn't be coming back from. Maybe I'd just look different, or maybe I'd lose myself altogether. I had no real idea.
063	But if I can protect my friends by turning to the demon side, then I'm all for it. Losing my friends is a fate far worse than losing myself.
064	So now, it's time. It's finally time to answer that voice and see what happens.
065	There's only one singular sentence echoing through my mind now: I must gain the strength to protect that which I hold dear...
066	You're far stronger than anticipated.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
067	But I have the numbers. This "generation" of subdivisions may be lacking, but they can and will learn. And with enough iterations, they will soon surpass your power.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
068	Strength... The strength...to protect...
069	Whoever that voice in my head belongs to, I'm calling you out. What is it you're trying to protect?
070	Is it weird that didn't feel like the first time you've pat me on the head? It felt...strangely familiar...
071	Ahh, I see now.
072	Those random moments of nostalgia, or the feeling I'd get when looking at certain scenery... They were all your doing.
073	Makes sense. And it also means it was worth putting everything on the line for. Even if you and I have different burdens to bear...
074	...we both have the same need to protect.
075	...
076	Captain Tanosuke! Can you hear me?! Captain Tanosuke!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
077	Don't worry, I hear you loud and clear. And at this moment, I'm still Tanosuke. I serve the Blade Fox Corps.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
078	And to that end—to protect all that I hold dear—I will now answer the voice that's been bugging me for years!
079	Tanosuke, wait!
080	Captain Tanosuke!
081	Can I make one last request of you all? A selfish one, really. And one for you to fulfill only if the spirit so moves you.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
082	I'd like it...if you didn't forget me.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
083	!!!
084	My name is Tanosuke, Third Squad Caption of the demon slayers known as the Blade Fox Corps. And this...is me giving it my all!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0032
085	Captain Tanosuke!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
086	What the...?
087	...
088	Captain...Tanosuke?
089	Gah! What's happening to him? It's like his aura is pushing even the ground away to form a crater!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
090	Tanosuke!
091	...Tanosuke? Who's that?
092	!!!
093	I've just awoken from what feels like an eternal slumber, and my mind is still hazy. But I know my name, at least. My name... My name is...
094	...Tamba.
095	?!
