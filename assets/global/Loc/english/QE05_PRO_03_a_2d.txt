001	Urgh, ngh! G-get off of me, you fool!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0042
002	That's my line, you lop-sided ape! Your oversized widget is hitting my—who-ho-hoa!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
003	Ahem. People are free to have whatever hobbies they like, yes, and I don't judge, but...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
004	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
005	Don, this is the middle of the street. I don't think the citizens appreciate seeing this...display. The gang's gonna get laughed at for this.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0029
006	Tango?! N-no! You've got this all wrong, you idiot! We didn't do this to ourse—	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
007	Hey! That girl! Where did she go?! The one with black hair and a katana!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
008	It looks like she left the city. We followed her, but she was too fast for us.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
009	Argh! All this trouble and she got away?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
010	We were able to get some clues about what that girl's looking for though. Hey.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
011	Eek! D-don't hurt me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
012	She asked me 'bout the Mikaboshi, but all I told her was that I don't know anything!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
013	The Mikaboshi?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
014	You ignoramus. It's a stone in Wadatsumi that is said to have power comparable to the Sacred Stones.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
015	Power comparable to the Sacred Stones?! Are you serious?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
016	If we had that, then...!
017	If such a thing really existed, I would have already informed Miss Fiona about it.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
018	The Mikaboshi has been lost since the age of the Lion Monarch's Charge. Don't you know anything?
019	Excuse me?! Whatever! Why would she be looking for some ancient relic anyways?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
020	Hey! Tell them everything!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0002
021	Eek! I told her th-there was another guy that came by asking the same questions. She...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
022	She suddenly became so violent!
023	Another guy? Who?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
024	He said he was a Holy Guard knight from Lustburg!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
025	That said, he had long hair and didn't have any armor on, so he didn't really look like a knight to me...
026	A long-haired...Holy Guard knight?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
027	Didn't you come to Lustburg in order to revive this stone?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
028	It's him!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
029	I told her he mentioned heading to Gluttony Foss, and then...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
030	Th-that's it! That's all I told her! Please let me go!
031	Tango, do me a favor, would you? Get this idiot off of me! I'm starting to get sick. Hey! Comb-head, are you listening?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
032	Gluttony Foss...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
033	Like I said, the city's almost completely restored. If it wasn't, I wouldn't be here dawdling around.
034	It's so nice to see people helping each other!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
035	Well, once the queen allowed us to make compromises for each other, things just sort of worked themselves out.
036	That's such good news! Now all I need to do is get Voda to teach me how to change the insects back to human form!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
037	That's nice, but aren't things worse here in Saga than in Lustburg? Saga suffered more direct damage to infrastructure and—
038	No worries! All the tribes that were quarrelling with each other have come together to help rebuild!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
039	I bet everything will be back to normal by the time you come to trade again!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
040	In a month? I doubt... Well, sure. Why not? Anyway, next time I'm in town, I'll bring you news about Lustburg.
041	Thanks! Oh! If you see Alma or Rebecca, let them know I'm doing great!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
042	I've told you, I don't know who those people are. Good day.
043	Thanks, Mister! Oh man, I can't wait to hear more about all my friends!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
044	If you wish to know more about Lustburg's current affairs, I may be able to help.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
045	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
046	Eek?! S-since when were you standing there?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
047	You are Lisbeth Finn Lustburg, I presume?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
048	Huh? Uh, y-yes! Nice to meet you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
049	Nice to...meet you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
050	Uhm, who are you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
051	Never mind who I am. I will tell you news of Lustburg in exchange for information on a man named Dias Elysion.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
052	Information about Dias?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
053	While in Lustburg, I heard that you were close to this man. Could you tell me more about him?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
054	Um...
055	What do you intend to do about him?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
056	Do not fear. I mean you no harm. I just wanted information about him before I met him.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
057	I... I can't.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0014
058	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
059	I don't want to! I don't even know who you are, so it would be wrong for me to tell you anything about Dias!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0040
060	You are just like that blond man.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
061	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
062	Hmph. I cannot reveal my identity.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
063	If you know too much about me, harm may come your way. That is not my intention.
064	You're lying.
065	Huh?
066	You were concerned about how close Dias and I were... You like him, don't you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
067	As...a love interest? Really, it surprises me that you've survived these violent times with such a naive soul.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0012
068	Naive? You think a person can't fall in love unless they're naive?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
069	Whatever. I simply wanted to gather information on the man in case I needed a contingency plan. Sorry to bother you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
070	Are you running away?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0022
071	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
072	Are your feelings for Dias something you can just cast aside like that?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
073	What are you...? I was simply trying to keep you from getting too invo—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
074	It's fine. I just want you to know that I won't let myself be outshone by someone who runs away from their feelings!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
075	...
076	You're so flat, though...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
077	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
078	Your chest. You have a flat chest. How can you be so confident with such inferior assets?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
079	I...!!! How dare—?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
080	Even if we were to become rivals in love, I will never be bested by the likes of you. You have the figure of a boy.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0008
081	I-it's not like you have any, ahem, assets!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
082	Excuse me?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
083	You're flat-chested, too! Who gives you the right to judge me?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0010
084	I am not flat-chested!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
085	Liar! You can hide behind that armor, but I can tell from your figure!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
086	I am most certainly not! I wear a binder to—what are you making me say?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
087	This is a fight I cannot lose!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0013
