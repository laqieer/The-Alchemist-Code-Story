001	...It's over.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
002	Yes...it is.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
003	Oh! Look! I can see the sun! The eclipse is over...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
004	The three look up at the sky...
005	The rays of the sun begin to unleash even stronger light as they emerge from behind the shadow of the moon.
006	The sun that shines over the continent of Ragna.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0018
007	The sun that warmly glows over the continent of Babel.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
008	The sun that watches over the people of Zipangu.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
009	Three symbols of our trio's bittersweet memories...
010	It's dazzling...
011	I guess it's thanks to...Amaterasu.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
012	...Yes.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
013	... ...
014	Was this really...how it was meant to be?
015	...!!!
016	I know how you feel, but...it was what Amaterasu wished for.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
017	There was nothing we could do about it.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0018
018	But...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
019	...!
020	But...the truth is...all of us...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
021	Lisbeth...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0018
022	...?!
023	Th-this place...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
024	Hey.
025	...! You...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0020
026	Watching you is making me really frustrated.
027	...Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
028	You have the power to change your destiny, but you haven't realized it. You want to save Amaterasu, right?
029	There is still something that can be done. Something still not realized.
030	... ...
031	Something still not realized...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0029
032	We should try to remember...no, come up with something new.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
033	Hmm. I'm not really good at thinking. Oh, Captain, can you think of something?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
034	Let me see...Amaterasu said that the captain of this pirate ship can go back and forth between worlds.
035	She also said that this Golden Compass points to the Twilight Zone.
036	Amaterasu said it was hers, but if she stays in the Twilight Zone all the time then she shouldn't need it...
037	Now that I think about it... a compass is a necessity for a ship, so...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
038	It's more natural to think of it as a pirate's possession.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
039	Exactly!
040	So it was originally a pirate's possession that was handed over to Amaterasu.
041	Well done, Captain! In other words, the previous captain had sailed to the Twilight Zone before!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
042	Are there no records that he left behind? Since this is a ship, there must logbooks.	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
043	They have those in the captain's cabin! Just a second.
044	Yes...there's a record in the logbook of them having gone to the Twilight Zone.
045	Wait, more importantly, look at this...
046	What's the matter? Did you find out anything new about the Twilight Zone?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0025
047	Oh...well...we've found out a little more about what the captain thought of Amaterasu, but...
048	There doesn't seem to be any new information regarding the Twilight Zone.
049	...I see.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0020
050	I guess it's not gonna be that easy.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
051	But we did find something interesting.
052	"When the sun, moon, and world overlap...ride the three drawing forces and move beyond time."
053	If we could travel through time...
054	Maybe we could go and save Amaterasu...?
055	Indeed. Well done.
056	"When the sun, moon, and world overlap"...that's talking about the solar eclipse.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
057	In other words, doesn't that mean right now is the time when we can travel through time?!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_1047
058	...Really?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
059	In that case, we should hurry. The sun is beginning to appear again...the solar eclipse will be over soon.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0045
060	I'm not really sure about whether or not we can really travel time, but...
061	With this ship that has traveled through worlds and this Golden Compass that points to the Twilight Zone...
062	As well as the determination that rests within this pirate hat...I'm sure all of these things will lead us to Amaterasu.
063	We will travel through time and, this time, we will save Amaterasu...
064	Just so you know, there is a limit to a pirate's power as well.
065	Once you travel through time, you cannot reverse it.
066	In that case...wouldn't it be best if we re-fought our last battle with Kayako?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
067	No, that would change the situation very little.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
068	We might as well prepare more carefully by returning to when we first met.	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
069	That makes sense.
070	Hey, little dog?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
071	When we travel through time...can we only select from within the time period that we knew Amaterasu from?
072	Is it possible to go back to before we met her?
073	That will depend on the power of the pirate who wields it.
074	If you can firmly imagine where you wish to go to, you can go anywhere.
075	Oh...in that case...it doesn't have to be before the other Sun Keys were stolen.
076	Then we should go back to way before Kayako showed up, that way she won't get in our way.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
077	But then we would have to hold onto the Sun Keys until she attempts to take them...I don't think we can keep them that long.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
078	I remember something that Amaterasu said.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_1047
079	She said that the Twilight Zone is protected by the sun so that only she can enter.
080	The Twilight Zone was engulfed with negative energy that removed the sun's protection.
081	Oh, yeah? All I remember is that she let her guard down...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
082	Kayako aimed for when Amaterasu was busy and she disabled her absolute defense.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
083	Kayako's plan was a clever one...but if it's known beforehand, it can be stopped.
084	That's it. We can go back to right before Kayako attacks and help protect the Sun Keys.
085	It's decided then. Let's go, <p_name>!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
086	Let's return to the Twilight Zone, right before the Sun Keys were taken!
087	All right. This time we're going to save Amaterasu...
088	O, once-legendary pirate...give us your strength!
089	When positive energy grows stronger, there's a possibility that it will give birth to an even stronger negative energy.
090	An ambitious endeavor like this might be worth trying.
091	This is the Twilight Zone...but with none of the heavy atmosphere.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
092	The Twilight Zone we know must've been engulfed in darkness because of Kayako.
093	Amaterasu...oh, there she is! But she doesn't seem to be in very good spirits...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
094	Sigh... Always alone, day and night, night and day...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0030
095	Ohh, everyday I'm just repeating the same thing. There's no stimulation and I get tired...
096	I'm always alone...but I guess it can't be helped since a lot of people would suffer if there was no sun...
097	People wouldn't be able to go on adventures. Isn't that right, Captain?
098	...Um, Amaterasu? Sorry to bother you while you're working...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
099	Eeek?! Wh-who are you people?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0027
100	You appeared so suddenly! How did you get here?!
101	...You seem really surprised.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0027
102	...I see. I guess this situation would make it easy to launch an attack.
103	An attack?! N-no...did you come here to steal the Sun Keys?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
104	No, it's the opposite, Amaterasu! We're here to help you stop the Sun Keys from being robbed!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
105	Help?! I don't need your help!
106	This is the Twilight Zone where I manage the sun. You can't come here without permission!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0016
107	If you don't leave immediately, I'm going to make you leave with force.
108	What?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
109	...Oh, in that case, how about we go play somewhere together! You just said you wanted stimulation, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
110	Y-you were listening?! Th-that was just me talking to myself...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
111	It doesn't change the fact that I'm the only one who can enter here! I'm chasing you out now!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0016
112	Please don't do that! Considering how we'll have to engage in battle with Kayako after this, I don't want to use unnecessary power.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
113	We are not your enemies, Amaterasu!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
114	We came to help you from the future. We're your friends.
115	Friends...? I have no need for friends...and...I don't have any...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
116	That's not true! We were called by the future-you and we became friends while traveling across worlds together...
117	The future-me? Wait...hey! That hat!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
118	Why do you have that pirate hat on?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0014
119	Why? Amaterasu, you're the one that gave it to me.
120	You prepared the pirate ship for us and you gave me the Golden Compass that leads to the Twilight Zone.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
121	We used the logbook in the ship as a guide to travel here from the future.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0004
122	Umm...something about "the sun and moon and stuff overlap...making three forces or something beyond time..." Wasn't that it?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
123	How do you know about that?! Besides, I keep my cherished Golden Compass close to me at all times...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0026
124	There's no way I'd give it to you!
125	Is that because it was a gift from the pirate who came here to the Twilight Zone?
126	Eeek! How...how do you know about that?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0027
127	Because it said so in the logbook that the pirate left behind.
128	It said that when he was using the Golden Compass to head for the sun...
129	He "met a girl that was like the sun..." I'm sure he was talking about you.
130	Huh...do you mean...o-oh, I see...a girl like the sun, huh? Heheh♪	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
131	Um, Amaterasu, what kind of relationship did you have with the pirate who wore this hat?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
132	A long time ago, there was a pirate ship that arrived here in the Twilight Zone. Just like when you guys came, I was taken by surprise!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
133	The captain of that ship turned out to be a legendary pirate...I found out later.
134	Discovering that I would not leave here...
135	He delighted me with many stories of his adventures.
136	As I listened to his stories, it made me long to go on an adventure with him, but I couldn't allow myself to leave my post.
137	I told him how much I envied his ability to live freely and go on adventures.
138	In response, he said...
139	"The reason we live happily is because the sun is in the sky.
140	Without the sun, no adventure, taste of wine, or experience would be worth it."
141	Saying this, he thanked me.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
142	Those words gave me the will to do my job and made me realize how useful I was...
143	Ultimately, I wasn't able to go on a single adventure with him. But when we last parted, he gave me that hat.
144	He said it was a symbol that I was one of his crew members...and that, one day, I would also find my own friends.
145	But, you know...my true desire was to be his friend and go on adventures with him, I guess...
146	Then why don't you become our friend?
147	We can go on adventures together! Any trouble you encounter, we can help...
148	Well...when you put it like that...a part of me wants to go along with it, but...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
149	But no! My work is very important.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0016
150	If I make any mistakes, it can really cause problems through the many worlds. Besides, managing the sun is something I have to do alone.
151	When I remember his gratitude, it keeps me going on my own...I can keep doing my best!
152	If someone were to exploit the management of the sun, it could lead to dire consequences. Okay? So leave now!
153	It's a good thing to have a strong sense of responsibility, but...if you continue to shoulder all the weight on your own, you'll always be alone, you know?
154	Ugh?! We-well, that might be true...but...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0019
155	But what choice do I have?! I can't necessarily trust anyone who tries to get close to me...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0017
156	I shouldn't be making friends! I need to keep working hard on my own...
157	That's so sad! Don't say that!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
158	?!
159	Yuri's right! If you don't make friends and just work all the time, you'll go crazy!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
160	There are times when I want to be alone and even times when I feel like fighting alone is easier, but...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
161	Still...having friends is...something good.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
162	Even if it were a different time and place than now, we were once your friends, Amaterasu.
163	That's why we still consider you our friend...are you really sure you don't want friends?
164	Well...I mean, all things considered, we've just met and I don't know what type of people you are.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
165	I understand that, but...how about we start by trusting in each other...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
166	Wh-what was that?! The light just broke!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
167	Was that...negative energy?! That negative energy was strong enough to take down the power of the sun surrounding the Twilight Zone...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0020
168	It looks like Kayako's assault has started. She should appear any moment now...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
169	Huh?! What are you people doing here?!
170	Wh-what is going on?! Another intruder in the Twilight Zone...?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0027
171	We won't let her. That's what we came here for.
172	How did you know I was coming here?! Well, never mind. Don't get in my way!
