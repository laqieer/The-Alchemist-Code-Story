001	Looks like the fence is complete.
002	Hey! Where are you going?
003	There's nothing more we can do here!
004	This is only a temporary countermeasure. I'm here to solve the problem for good.
005	We still need to resolve the real issue here. These beasts have nowhere to go. We can't say this problem has been resolved until we find them a new home.
006	That's true, but...do you really think that we can make a difference?
007	We? I've never seen you so eager to help before.
008	I like it. Let's go see what we can do!
009	H-hey! Stop pulling!
010	Lady Mirianne! What a surprise. I suppose I should have known someone of your stature would visit this mine sooner or later.
011	This is a very lucrative mine. Here are some samples of the gems that can be excavated here. I'm sure you will appreciate their value.
012	They are quite beautiful. I will take the lot.
013	A-all of them?!
014	Are you sure?!
015	Absolutely. The gems excavated here are truly wonderful. I hope we can establish a lasting business relationship.
016	Oh, of course! That would be fantastic!
017	If we are to continue working with each other, however, you will have to cease any operations that are destructive to the environment. I would hate for these gems to earn a negative reputation.
018	Wh-what?
019	I've heard that the beasts that were driven from their homes because of the mining are now attacking nearby villages.
020	It apparently became such a problem that they had to hire this soothsayer here.
021	Huh?!
022	Isn't that right, Madam Soothsayer?
023	Huh? Oh, uh...indeed.
024	I...I had no idea such a thing was happening.
025	Mining facilities that cannot coexist with their neighboring residents are sure to fail.
026	I understand the importance of mining as many jewels as possible, but I would appreciate it if you could consider the effects your operations might have upon those around them.
027	Y-you're absolutely right! I will immediately review our operations!
028	That's wonderful! I look forward to doing business with you!
029	Hmm...
030	Case closed! What do you think of that, Madam Soothsayer?
031	You didn't have to use me like that.
032	Yet...how curious. He seemed surprisingly willing to change his ways, despite your criticisms of his mining methods.
033	Well, his priority is the sale of his gems.
034	Even if some issues seem like they can't be resolved without one side suffering a loss...
035	If you dig deeper into the motivations of the involved parties, you might just find common ground.
036	I see. In other words, looking past what they say they want to get at what really drives them, huh?
037	I guess sometimes getting involved can actually bring about wonderful results.
038	Besides, what's truly important is that you do what you want to do, what feels right in the moment. Just like how I'm always acting on my motto.
039	Wouldn't that cause a conflict of interests?
040	Not necessarily. Thinking about what you truly want allows you to find the best way to resolve an issue.
041	Like how you wanted to protect those children and secure them a safe place to play.
042	I...!
043	Hey, you're back! Mom said we can play outside again! It's all thanks to you!
044	Oh...right...
045	You've taught me a lot, Mirianne.
046	What was it? Noblesse Oblige? I thought it amounted to nothing more than an excuse to meddle in other people's business, but...it's not a bad motto.
047	Well, it's better than doing nothing, at least.
048	Heh. I'm honored to have the soothsayer's seal of approval.
049	Don't poke fun.
050	Hmm...maybe I could stand to be a little more optimistic about things.
051	Then maybe I can go and see what I can do for Saga.
052	What're you doing? Come play! We're gonna play tag!
053	Yeah! Let's play a bajillion rounds!
