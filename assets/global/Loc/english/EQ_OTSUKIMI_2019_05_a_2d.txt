001	Hazel...
002	I'm getting pretty used to these prosthetics. I can fight again.
003	But why? Why do you still want to return to the battlefield? You were so badly hurt.
004	Half of your body was blown off. You could have died!
005	I've been prepared for that since the moment I became a mercenary.
006	Are you not afraid? The battlefield is... I'm just so...
007	I'd be lying if I said I'm not afraid.
008	Then...
009	Still... I'm more afraid of failing to protect a friend. I'm glad you're okay, Evelika.
010	...
011	The sky... It's so gloomy.
012	It is. The clouds look so heavy and dark... They're making me feel gloomy too.
013	You know, there's a beautiful moon beyond those clouds.
014	Just as the moon still glows behind that curtain of clouds, I won't give up as long as my hope hasn't faded away. Even during this dark time when I must confront the adversity of my injuries.
015	...
016	You're so strong, Hazel. I can never be like you.
017	I can't see anything beyond those clouds, but you make me want to believe...
018	...
019	If the sky ever clears, I would like to see the moon with you, Hazel.
020	That would be nice. Someday...
021	(I was really looking forward to this. That promise we made was the one thing that kept me going.)
022	(But maybe I was the only one that thought of it as a promise.)
023	...
024	The moon... It's already so high up.
025	I wonder why... I was so looking forward to this, but...
026	I can't bring myself to think it's beautiful.
027	Evelika...
028	Tamamo...
029	I'm sorry! I really wanted to do this so badly, I was getting carried away!
030	Moon-gazing is a human thing. We used to just watch from afar.
031	But my friend that taught me about moon-gazing, Mikoto, said she'd never done this either.
032	I am sure that everyone will enjoy this day in harmony, united under the majesty of the full moon. I cannot deny that I am a little envious. I would very much like to enjoy it alongside them, but alas...
033	Okay! Then I promise you that we'll go moon-gazing together someday!
034	Mikoto grew up in the shrine alone, so she never had the chance to enjoy events and get-togethers.
035	So I wanted to have everything made ready and bring her down to surprise her.
036	I see...
037	When I mentioned it, Hazel said she'd like to help.
038	Hazel did?
039	She said she wanted to do something to welcome you here.
040	I think Evelika is troubled over me being summoned with my prosthetics.
041	It reminds her that she made me take the more dangerous route while keeping herself safe. Even though I've never thought of it that way.
042	She won't say, but I get it. She's the kind of girl that tries to shoulder burdens all on her own.
043	But it'll be such a waste of a clear sky to have that weighing over her mind, forcing her to hang her head down.
044	Hazel...
045	Evelika...
046	Um, I'm... I'm sorry, I...
047	You know, I'm really enjoying tonight! I mean, we had fun together back then, too! I just want you to know, I have no regrets!
048	But...
049	I think you can tell if I'm lying or not, right, Evelika? What do you think?
050	I...don't think you're lying.
051	So you have nothing to worry about! Understand?
052	Y-yes.
053	Chestnuts, pumpkins, and potatoes.
054	Huh?
055	A feast full of seasonal dishes. Carol cooked all of this for us!
056	So, let's finish getting ready for the moon-gazing! Together!
057	Okay!
058	All right! Let's do this!
059	Dumplings, ready! Feast, ready! Silver grass, re...
060	Hm?
061	Crap! They're back! Run!
062	Th-those men, they had our silver grass! They're getting away!
063	Is this... Is this a good fortune thing too? Are they allowed to take silver grass like the dumplings?
064	Uhm... What do you think, Tamamo?
065	Probably not. So... Come back here!
