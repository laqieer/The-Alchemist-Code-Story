001	――――	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0021
002	Summoned us again? Ugh, you're always putting us to work.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0030
003	I'm curious. I know now that you've been weakened, you're the least powerful of the Cursed Beasts.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0030
004	I doubt you have an abundance of resources to spend on summoning us.
005	――――	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0020
006	Ah, I see... So that's how it is.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0038
007	You really hate being alone, don't you?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0007
008	――――
009	Then... Let's talk. About the "us" and events that, apparently, cannot happen in this universe.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0004
010	What's the point? I mean, it's about a timeline entirely separate from us, right?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0016
011	It's not like we have anything else to do until her wounds are healed. Why not?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0005
012	But what exactly should we talk about? Let's see...
013	What about love?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0007
014	Uhm... How is Ambrosia doing?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
015	She's all right. The anesthetics have her sleeping now.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
016	Her wounds have been treated, so she should be fine when she wakes.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
017	Her injuries were pretty severe, but...she'll make it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
018	I never, ever believed I'd see the day...
019	Yeah... Seeing her like that...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
020	U-um... It might not be my place to say this, but those two were shams fabricated by the Cursed Beast, right? I don't think you need to feel responsible for—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
021	I never thought that we had that kind of potential.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
022	I get it. I'm genuinely surprised to know we might be able to take her on like that.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
023	Wait, what? Uhm...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
024	Ah, sorry! We just got a little distracted thinking about our future potential.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0035
025	Phew... You had me worried there! I thought you two were feeling upset about...you know.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
026	Hahaha, sorry! We're fine!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
027	How's everybody else?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
028	Adaleigh and Yna are out. They said they wanted to go check on the town.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
029	They had the idea that if they followed the footprints the Cursed Beast left behind, they might be able to find some clues as to how to defeat it.
030	That sounds like something Adaleigh would do.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
031	What about Waginau and your brother?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
032	Those two are training in front of the mansion. My brother was worried he'd lose his touch if he missed a day of training.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
033	I thought your brother was more of a bookworm... I mean, seeing as he'd holed himself up in the library all those days.
034	That's just how he is, always prioritizing what he wants to do at the time.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
035	Ah, yeah, I get it. Nyx baffles me with his silly behavior.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
036	Are you trying to be funny? You do realize you're the silly one, right?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
037	What are you trying to say, Nyx?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
038	I just said what I was trying to say, Mira.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
039	Hehe!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
040	Did I just hear you giggle, Emmel?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
041	I'm sorry. This isn't the time for laughing, is it?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
042	It's fine, it's fine! Ambrosia's a tough one, and it's times like these that we need to be reminded that we can still smile.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
043	Nothing good ever comes from feeling down.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
044	I guess you're right. Thank you, both of you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
045	So! I say we go join your brother!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
046	I do have some things I want to ask him!
047	Huh? B-but—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
048	Come on! You gotta act on your impulses! Let's go!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
049	I've got you!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0004
050	Not yet you don't!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
051	Then take this!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
052	Good try, but for naught! You still have a ways to go until you can best me, Waginau.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0008
053	You're better than ever, Nimul. Looks like it'll be a while before we see you retire from as commander.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
054	Hahaha! You plan to work me to the bone?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
055	Besides, you're not seeing the full picture. If battle was close combat alone, you have the skills to defeat me.
056	That's rather hard to believe.
057	It's true. It's just that you and I are seeing a different field of battle.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
058	What do you mean?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
059	What are your eyes on in the midst of battle?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
060	Well... My opponent's posture, the angle of our weapons...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
061	Those are important, true, but I also keep an eye on the terrain.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
062	The terrain...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
063	Ha! I can see the doubt in your eyes. If I read your mind right now, I suspect you would be thinking something like: "What warrior doesn't know something so basic?"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
064	It is one of the most basic principles of combat. Still, what part of this terrain is there to take advantage of?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
065	The ground is solid stone tiles and we have ample space to maneuver. I see nothing that could—
066	There is, Waginau. There always is something that can affect the outcome of a battle.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
067	For example, that tile you stepped on before your last strike.
068	If you look closely, it has a slight bump on it compared to the others. That caused a minor alteration to your footing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
069	Minor as it might be, it was enough so to allow me to topple your posture.
070	You were fighting with all that in your mind?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
071	That's how you win. You are already several steps ahead of me in terms of skill with a sword.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
072	Still, I cannot defeat you.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
073	That's where wisdom comes in. The strongest weapon available to humans.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
074	Reading your opponent's next move, foreseeing their reactions, and countering them appropriately.
075	By doing so, you should be able to defeat anything in this world.
076	...You're thinking about the Cursed Beasts.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
077	I was. We have to accept that we know so very little about them.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
078	Ever since we came to this region, I keep having to ask the question, "Why?"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
079	But I do see hope. The witch Ambrosia... She was able to wound the Cursed Beast. If we could match her powers...
080	Match the strength of one who has lived since before even the Cursed Beasts? That's an ambitious statement to make.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
081	That is why we must act now. We have no time to be buried in books!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
082	You have finally decided to emerge fully from your den of books? Of your own volition? A miracle indeed.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0011
083	Did you just make a joke, Waginau? A rather hurtful one, as well...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
084	Do my ears deceive me? Did I just hear you talking about my dear teacher, Nimul?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
085	Mira, Nyx... Emmel? What is it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
086	Well, we were wondering if we could join your training session.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0003
087	I suppose you could say we're curious about your methods.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
088	We promise to not be a nuisance. Do you mind?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
089	So I take it you want reassess your capabilities.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
090	You're pretty sharp.
091	You've chosen to take on the Cursed Beast Asmodeus. I believe that makes this quite meaningful.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
092	Very well. Let's do this.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0038
093	Here I come, Nyx!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0012
094	Yeah, yeah... Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition! Preparing to connect to space!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
095	Time is finite!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0032
096	Yet also infinite! Libra has granted us control! Spin the hands of time round and round!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0032
