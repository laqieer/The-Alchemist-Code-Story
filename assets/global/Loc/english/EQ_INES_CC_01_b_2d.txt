001	What's going on?! You're normally so well-behaved!	VO_ines.ines_battle_0019
002	They're overstimulated. If they won't calm themselves soon, we may have to intervene with force...	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0031
003	Numa?!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0021
004	No...!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0020
005	Wait! Stop!	VO_craris.craris_sys_0014
006	?!
007	A...human? What is a human doing here?!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0025
008	We'll talk after we deal with this!	VO_craris.craris_sys_0002
009	If memory serves, the way to calm a Ratty is to approach it slowly while staring directly into its eyes.
010	Numa?! Numanuma! Numa? Numa...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_c
011	Numyua...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
012	W-wow! But, it was so agitated! How did you manage that so easily?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0024
013	It was nothing. Just applied knowledge. I did some research on the Rattys a while back.
014	One time with my family, I saw a monster show where the performer tamed a wild Ratty in front of a live audience. It fascinated me so much, I knew I had to learn the trick myself.
015	Amazing! ...Wait. This is no time for admiration!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0043
016	You're a human, aren't you? So if you're here...	VO_ines.ines_sys_0003
017	That must mean...
018	The spirits of the forest have granted you safe passage.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0006
019	Yes. I am the appointed guide for the festival. My name is Claris.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0005
020	I'm Nasario. It's a pleasure to meet you.
021	U-um... My name is―	VO_ines.ines_sys_0001
022	Hee hee. I know who you are. It's been a long time, Ines.	VO_craris.craris_sys_0007
023	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0006
