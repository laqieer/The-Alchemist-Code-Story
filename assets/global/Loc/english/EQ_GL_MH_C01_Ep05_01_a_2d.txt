001	Following their discoveries at the Lustberg ruins, Siegfried and his party gather at his former mentor Minerva's home to discuss their findings.
002	The "Alchemic Constructs," inorganic creations powered by Alchemia particles, had brought them one step closer to the mastermind's objectives.
003	After a week of recuperation and research, Minerva manages to mark out another area where similar ruins were rumored to be found.
004	That's near Greed Dike, isn't it?
005	Yes. One of my colleagues working there mentioned a small town on the outskirts that was said to harbor "strange energies."
006	However, ever since it fell under the jurisdiction of a Greed Dike noble several years ago,
007	its folk legends have been labelled as pure fiction by the local governor.
008	You think this might be the same kind of ruins as the one here in Lustburg, Teach?
009	I have good reason to believe so, yes.
010	He was able to procure a small sample of earth, and my tests have shown a higher than average concentration of Alchemia particles.
011	This supports my theory that these facilities were, indeed, spread throughout the area.
012	Unfortunately, he was unable to help me further, citing... "difficulties."
013	Difficulties, huh.
014	I'd wager someone has beaten us to the ruins in search of the same objectives.
015	It does mean we are on the right track, though.
016	Shall we make our way there?
017	Soren, my dear. We will be heading once more into laboratory ruins.
018	I know this is much to ask of you, but I would like if you could accompany us.
019	We may be able to find more clues pertaining to your condition in the process.
020	Umm... I...
021	Teach, you do know he passed out last time, right?
022	I put him to bed real early that night we came back, and he wouldn't stop mumbling in his sleep.
023	Oh... I had a lot of weird dreams. I can't help but feel like they're familiar...
024	Hmm...
025	Soren, you mentioned you simply woke up one day with no memory in Sakris Village next to the Construct, yes?
026	Perhaps the Constructs and their origins are tied indelibly to the hazy past you've lost.
027	...Ultimately, though, I would like to leave the choice to you.
028	... ...
029	I'll go. I've come this far, haven't I?
030	Everyone at Sakris Village wanted me to go with Sieg, and to find myself. I won't let them down.
031	Well, I can't say no to determination like that.
032	Atta boy, Soren. It's not going to be easy, but we're here for you.
033	Don't worry too much, okay?
034	Thanks, everyone.
035	Well, we'd better get packing for the road.
036	And from here... it should only be another hour's travel.
037	This is near the outskirts, so we should keep an eye out for bandits and monsters.
038	Roger that.
