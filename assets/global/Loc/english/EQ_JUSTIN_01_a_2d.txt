001	Justin of the Peacekeepers!
002	Yes!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0037
003	We give honor to you for your brave achievements in solving unprecedented cases...
004	Saving both Redington City and thus Slothstein!
005	Detective Justin! Is there anything you'd like to say?
006	Please tell us the details about how you caught that corrupted politician?
007	Detective! Look over here, please!
008	Calm down, everyone.	VO_justin.justin_chara_1005
009	The achievement today is the result of the Peacekeepers joint effort...in other words, the victory of our justice!
010	On this, I promise all of you! Justice for Slothstein as long as the Peacekeepers exist!
011	We will never let evil prosper!
012	Bartender, can I get my usual espresso?	VO_justin.justin_chara_1003
013	We actually only serve alcohol here, but we'll make an exception. After all, if it's the request of the undisputed detective, I can hardly turn you down.
014	That being said, you went all out there, didn't you? Evil will never prevail as long as the Peacekeepers are around?
015	With the revolution of technology in this country, the very foundation of life is beginning to change. There are many citizens who are afraid of this.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0004
016	But what remains unchanged is justice! I wanted to reassure everyone by telling them it was present in our country!
017	All that aside, Detective! That was quite a catch, wasn't it? I can't believe you were actually given an award by the mayor!
018	Hey, you drunk! Stop saying strange things!
019	Oh, did you want to hear?! About this talented Detective Justin's fabulous investigations!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0009
020	It happened one night, after the rain and before dawn, one of my underground investigations had paid off and I was stepping into the mansion of one of the industry’s top dogs.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0010
021	Oh, here he goes again... If only it weren't for his long bragging sessions he'd undisputedly be a great detective.
022	Yes, that's when I pointed that out! The alibi you are relying on his nothing more than a house of cards!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0008
023	Ba-bad news! Cha...Cha...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
024	Hm? What's the matter? Why don't you sit down? The story is just starting to get good.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0016
025	Chat Noir is back! He sent a notification to the mansion from across the street!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
026	Oh my god! Are you serious?!	VO_justin.justin_chara_1006
027	Ack! Time is of the essence! Bartender, sorry, but please put it on my tab!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0012
028	Got you. Seriously, that's one busy fellow.
029	I won't let you escape this time, Chat Noir!	VO_justin.justin_battle_0013
030	Huh?! There's no casino?!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0026
031	Idiot! Shut up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
032	Oh, sorry.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0036
033	So, what's the matter? According to the rumors, I thought they're gonna make a large scale backdoor casino, right?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0002
034	Yeah, those plans did exist...until about two weeks ago.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
035	The newly appointed Peacekeepers have gone and taken down all the backers of the backdoor casino.
036	Now that their head is gone, the crippled organizations have been chased out by the local mafia.
037	For law-abiding citizens, that's good news.
038	For me, it's a big problem!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0048
039	What am I even doing in this city then?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0021
040	Where are my fun, gambling-filled days? Where is the champagne bath?!
041	It's time you gave up. If you want to gamble in this town, you'll have to go to one of those old fashion gambling joints.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
042	People say that Don Taras' gambling joints have moderate rates!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0022
043	Oh...if it was gonna be like this, I should've worked near Envylia.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0020
044	Anyway, right now this city is cleaner than most places. In other words, it's not for the likes of you and me.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
045	If you want to take out some of the clean businesses, I can get you information, you know?
046	No, no. I only take from the people who've been naughty.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0014
047	I see. Well then, I hope you enjoy the new wave of clean air.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
048	There's no clean air in a back alley like this. Honestly...	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0012
049	Sigh. What should I do? I feel like all my motivation has been sucked out of me. It feels like a hassle to even find a place to stay tonight.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0030
050	...Huh?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
051	Hey, did you find him?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
052	No, I lost sight of him! Argh, that scum! He's too fast on his feet!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_1047
053	Whew. It looks like I lost them. Hey, lady. Do you mind if I borrow this spot with you?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_1001
054	Where did you come from?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
055	Heheh. If a lady like you wasn't able to notice me, I'm still not altogether useless.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
056	Oh? I don't what you're suggesting about an innocent lady.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
057	Well, we're in the same business, aren't we? That informant you were using is the same one I hire.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_1005
058	Were you eavesdropping? You wouldn't happen to be one of the naughty ones, would you?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
059	Oh, that`s so scary for me! But that's one of the reasons why you can trust me, eh?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0009
060	Listen, lady, I know you're looking for a thrill. Can you hear me out for a second?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_2001
061	He's gone. Seriously. I've got a real losing personality.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_chara_1001
062	Argh. This is the only alley I haven't checked yet...huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
063	Well, I'll be. It's rare to see a pretty little lady in a place like this. Would you like to play around with me?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
064	I'm sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm a little busy right now.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0035
065	Come now. Don't be like that. If you just accompany me to right over there...wait, that toy you have in your hands!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
066	(Hmph. He's surprisingly sharp!)
067	Sorry, lady. Can you hear me out for a minute?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
068	A clean city, huh?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0030
069	(It can't be helped. I don't want to cause too much of a scene, but I'll have to use force here.)
070	Wait, you lot!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0002
071	Huh? What business do you have with us...Ju-Justin?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
072	Indeed. I am Detective Justin from the Peacekeepers.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0005
073	And what business do you have with the lady? You seem to be quite the chit-chat today.
074	I-I was just doing a little picking up! I didn't have any bad intentions...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0047
075	Pick up? Hold on a second. Just the other day, weren't you held for detention when you had a fight in the tavern? If I remember correctly...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0006
076	Yes, it was your lover who came to pick you up. Her name was...
077	D-don't talk about my girlfriend!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
078	Seriously, why do you even remember something like that?!
079	Heh. I'm constantly paying attention to the lives of others. However, I see. I guess she called it off.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0010
080	...! I'm gonna kill you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
081	What? What are you upset about? You realize that you've committed an act of public altercation, you know?	VO_justin.justin_chara_1008
082	Shut up! Die!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0009
