001	Save her...Tina. It's all my fault Tamis is...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0018
002	Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
003	I'm so powerless in the end. Tamis had to go and fight the ancient dragon with her Wind Matter still dormant.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0019
004	How is it that I'm so weak? How long will I continue to be useless?!
005	(Such a delicate body...and yet she's been supporting us all this time...and continued to encourage us, no matter the circumstances.)	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
006	...
007	Mocca...I'm sorry. I've been by your side for so long, yet I never truly understood you. I'm finally wide awake now!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
008	I'll repeat the same words you said to me! I'm proud to call you my friend!
009	If you don't have any faith in yourself, then..then put your faith in me! I'm never going to leave your side!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
010	Ouija and alchemy are powered by the same source.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
011	In that case...I won't just rely on my wind power. I'm going to pour every fiber of my being into this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
012	Eh? I can see!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
013	Oh, Moc... Sis? Is that you?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
014	Tamis?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0018
015	Your eyes! They're beautiful!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
016	Tamis! But...how come you're safe?!	VO_moca.moca_battle_1028
017	It was all Tina. She restored the Wind Matter to its original state! Sis...I've missed you so much.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0037
018	Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
019	Tina, thank you... Thank you so much!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
020	We're not losing anyone else. No one's going to take you away from us, Tamis. Let's put an end to this.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
021	Time to right our wrongs...and ensure we never repeat our mistakes again!
022	We're going to confront nature head-on for the right to all live in this land together; the right to kindle warm fires, nurture the earth, be surrounded by pristine waters, and live free like the wind!
023	I will take you all up with a gust of my wind! It'll whisk you across the sky and set you on top of the dragon's back.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
024	You can do that?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
025	Yep, and now that I have the Wind Matter fully restored...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0037
026	I'm no longer the only Wind Shaman who can't use Ouija!
027	This isn't a power I've gained on my own... It's a power that was created by everyone combined, for the sake of protecting Saga. I'm going to use it to keep the future burning brightly.
028	And I will see the return of the peace we've had for eons!
029	I finally get it! The reason I was blessed with the gift of foresight...is so I can spot a bleak future from a mile away and then change it for the better!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
030	No matter how many times I'm knocked down, I'm going to get right back up! I'll use my gifts to pave the way for an even brighter future!
031	Let's do this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
032	I can't believe it! I didn't know wind could do this! We're really flying!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0024
033	Right? Right?! I'm totally amped!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0046
034	It's completely different from flying on Broom Ace! What a rush!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
035	Tamis, are you sure this isn't going to harm your body? If the Wind Matter is stored inside you, then wouldn't using Ouija—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
036	I'm fine. Using Ouija won't affect my body or the Matter in any way. Think about it...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
037	I've been given the power of the Sprite Trio's Matter!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0007
038	You're right!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
039	The Matter were originally a means of restraining the dragon. Ouija, charged with tending to Matter, are a tremendous threat to the dragon, you see. Watch this!
040	O wind, tear it to shreds!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0032
041	Wow. It tore the tentacle to pieces!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
042	It's because I have the power of all four Matters! Let's head inside and finish this already!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
043	We can finally put an end to this chapter. Alia... Voda... Fuu... Tehre... Georgios...your sacrifices and those of our ancestors, spanning over a hundred years, will at last bear fruit today.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
044	The Saga you desperately wanted to protect, father...I will do so in your stead, right here and now!
045	I—No. We will be the ones to put an end to all of this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
