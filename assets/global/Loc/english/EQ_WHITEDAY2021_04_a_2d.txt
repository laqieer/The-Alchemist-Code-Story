001	Whew... We've driven off the monsters. We should be safe for now.
002	Still, the air here is think with that smell. It's only a matter of time before any addicted monsters show up.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
003	......
004	Those monsters just now are docile creatures. Usually they'd never attack a human habitat.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
005	I imagine they ate some of the marshmallows stolen off the merchant on the road, and now they're obsessed with the stuff.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0030
006	You're kidding me... I had no clue mashiro flour had such dangerous side effects.
007	All I wanted was to help save my shop. If I could make cheap treats to entice people to our place, the whole business could make a comeback.
008	But my pops is a stickler for ingredients, and refused to acknowledge my creation. No good for traditional sweets, he said.
009	So you ran away from home, and sold your mashiro flour know-how to a noble.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
010	Then the guy abused your formula to make addicted marshmallows he could sell in town. Sound about right?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
011	I just...wanted to protect my shop. I thought a good chunk of change could keep us above water.
012	"Baking sweets that bring sincere smiles to our buyers." Your father told us about that.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
013	"Be it recipes or ingredients, there's no cutting corners when it comes to making customers grin from ear to ear."
014	The way you hold your shop dear tells me you feel the same way.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
015	"Sweets that bring sincere smiles"...
016	The mashiro flour I invented is cheap and economical. The sweet aftertaste keeps people coming back for more.
017	But... Even if that taste offers momentary bliss, it eventually gives way to despair.
018	So in that sense, they don't bring smiles to anyone. So that's why pops...
019	Thanks, you guys, I get it now. I see where I've lost my way.
020	Is that right? You and your father have the same objective in mind. A meeting of minds couldn't hurt.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0005
021	He believed you'll come back. "No one loves my sweets more than him," he said.
022	Pops...
023	You and your father should keep making sweets befitting your shop's motto.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
024	But the thing is, I—
025	Don't worry, there's always a chance to turn things around while you're alive. So use it! That's my way... The way of the life-giving swordhand.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
026	The life-giving swordhand...
027	I beg of you, please dispose of the mashiro flour we have in the storehouse. The job should fall to me, it's just...
028	The noble hired mercenaries to guard it, I suspect? Leave this to us.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
029	Works for me. I've got a bone to pick with that corrupt noble, anyway.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0004
030	Thanks so much! I'll throw out all of the mashiro flour here, mark my words.
031	Sounds good. And when that's done, you should head back to see your father.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
032	Hoh boy... You really gonna take him at face value like that?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
033	Uh, yeah? Why not?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
034	That boy, man.
035	He may have earned your trust now, but there's no telling if he'll pull something like this next time money's to be made, no matter how he repents here.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
036	People like him are a dime a dozen. So what'll you do if it turns out that way?
037	Well I—
038	I don't see it happening. I've got an eye for wickedness; I'm talking the worst of the worst out there.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0001
039	That's why I was shocked to find not a trace of corruption on that guy's countenance.
040	I saw a light in his eyes the moment you brought up his father. Like a bad guy seeing the error of his ways.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
041	......
042	Allow me to answer your question, Reimei.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
043	If things turn out as you say, then... He can redeem himself again. And again, and again.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
044	That naive streak of yours hasn't changed one bit.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
