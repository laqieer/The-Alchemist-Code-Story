001	Heheh. If we're this far from the port, you won't be able to do anything. I'll let you down now, Kanon.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
002	... ...
003	You seem to have calmed down a little. Seriously...you're quite the rowdy child.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
004	Wh...wha...
005	What's the matter?
006	Oh! No, um...it's nothing!
007	...?
008	Wow!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
009	What is it? If you have something you want to say then say it quickly.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0008
010	W-well...how do I say it...you smell good, Captain Yauras.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0011
011	What?!
012	You...do you understand what the situation is?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
013	I-I mean...I never imagined being carried by you, Captain Yauras, who I admire so much.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
014	You admire me?! You're a strange one.
015	What are you talking about?! You're the most popular person within the entire Holy Guard, you know?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
016	Huh...?
017	You're the most powerful person with a sword, yet you have the beauty and smarts as well.
018	Also, not all your fans are male Paladins. You have hidden female fans as well. Of course, I'm one of them...
019	...!
020	Huh? You didn't know?
021	D-don't say stupid things like that and focus on your mission!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0047
022	Y-yes! Excuse me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
023	H-honestly...you're a full-grown adult, so you try to aim towards becoming a sophisticated and beautiful woman.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0006
024	Rumors...how shameless.
025	Hmph. How can you say that? Seeing you walk into battle with your feminine charm is enough to drive the wind of any young soldier's sail.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0010
026	Be quiet, Suzuka.
027	Wha?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
028	So, Captain Yauras, actually I have another question.
029	Kanon...!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
030	Huh?! B-but...in some ways, it's a question about war strategy!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
031	What do you mean how can I look so strong and graceful?
032	What a silly child.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
033	Well, if there's one thing...it's that I had rivals.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0031
034	Rival?
035	Yes. Not wanting to lose to that person, I chased them until I naturally became this way. I didn't do any thing especially special.
036	Hmm. I see. In that regard, I can highly agree with you. It sounds familiar to me too.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
037	You had someone like that, Captain Yauras?! Who could it have been?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0025
038	It was Captain Cadanova. The man whom you witnessed his end.
039	Huh...?
040	Oh, looks like we've been interrupted.
041	We can continue our conversation after we take them down. That is, if I haven't changed my mind.
