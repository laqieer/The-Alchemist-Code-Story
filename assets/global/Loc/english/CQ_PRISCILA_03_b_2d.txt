001	Intriguing. You are on your game more so than you were before.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
002	Huzzzaaaah!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0032
003	Oh! There's something in your eyes... I see. You've thrown away your indecision.
004	Or have you simply faced the conflict within yourself?
005	Yes... There is a conflict within me. I loathe battle, and yet I am also drawn to it. I cannot get enough of the fervor and the excitement of it!
006	However, that dilemma I hold within myself... It has nothing to do with what I have to do now. I must carry out the duty my father passed onto me.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0007
007	For that matters more than my conflicted feelings, more than the thrill of battle. Everything I feel should be channeled into protecting the country that my father left to me!
008	As a lance instructor of Envylia, I use my lance to protect. It will pierce through any opponent who dares face me, and you are no exception!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0012
009	Let's see you try.
010	The battles will never end if we don't fight them. Isn’t that right?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
011	Indeed... Most interesting.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0020
012	Why are you lowering your weapon?
013	Let this be the end for now. I would rather not fight you as you are.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0031
014	What...?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0025
015	I do not believe that we will have to wait long before we meet on the battlefield again.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0001
016	I fight to end the fighting. It is the phenomenon of battle itself that I want to eradicate.
017	I understand. I will keep that in mind when I stand against you again. For I must, so long as you are the enemy of Envylia.
018	I owe you thanks. Although you are my enemy, it is thanks to you that I have become stronger this day.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0034
019	Don't get the wrong idea. Next time we meet, I will grant you no mercy.
020	I would expect nothing less. Please pass on my regards to Lamia.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
021	Of course. Goodbye for now, Priscilla.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0037
022	Theresa, the Ruinmaker... How terrifyingly powerful she is.
023	Despite that, it is only thanks to her that I have figured out a way forward.
024	Do not weep, daughter. The battlefield is a place for death. Still, we must fight to protect that which means most to us. I leave Envylia...to you.
025	Are you watching, Father?
026	The conflict within me hasn't been completely resolved, but at least I now have focus. I will devote myself to fulfilling my father's wish that I should protect Envylia.
027	I must fight, or else the battles will never end.
028	For if I don't fight...there will truly never be an end to war.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
029	When next we meet, I will not lose. I will protect Envylia and all within its borders, this I swear!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0007
030	Just wait, Theresa... My lance will bring you to your knees!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0010
