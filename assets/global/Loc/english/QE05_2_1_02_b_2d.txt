001	Huzzah!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0032
002	Isidore, what is this power?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
003	I...am not sure. I just suddenly found that I could use it.	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
004	My purifying powers as a Sephira seem to have diminished in exchange, but...I need this new strength to fight.
005	...
006	(This feeling... Has Isidore turned to the darkness? Isidore? Of all people? Why?)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
007	Is everything okay, Kamui?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
008	I am just concerned for you. Any power in excess will bring ruin.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
009	I am aware. I will not make the same mistake again.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
010	Their reinforcements have arrived!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
011	I will slaughter them! I will shred their flesh with this—
012	Nngh... No! No, I can't. Losing myself to battle wouldn't solve anything. I must...suppress it. Hold on...!	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
013	(Isidore is beginning to lose control of himself. We should fight as few battles as possible...but...)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
014	We must fight through this wave if we are to catch up to everyone.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
015	Kamui, I will cut a path for you. Go to them.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
016	What are you saying? There's no way I'm just going to leave you behind!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0012
017	We will both fall at this rate!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
018	Something is wrong, Kamui. I'm burning up inside. It's like a fever I cannot shake.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
019	Isidore?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1009
020	It's too late for me. All I feel is fury. All I can do is hate the enemy.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0019
021	The voice in my head... It demands that I kill...and kill and kill...!
022	Ignore it, Isidore! That is the darkness tempting you!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
023	That voice is trying to turn you away from your righteous self!
024	I...know...b-but this hate... It's part of me! It's too difficult to resist!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
025	Your death will break Malta's heart!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
026	Wha—?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
027	That is the price of your death! Think about it, Isidore!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1009
028	You're...right. It isn't like me to be swayed by such dark thoughts.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
029	Urk! There're too many of them!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
030	Urgh! I...can't move?!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
031	Isidore, behind you!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
032	Behind me?!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0022
033	Kamui! Are you all right?!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
034	Teona?! What are you doing here?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
035	I rushed here when I was told a village was on fire in this area.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
036	I'm so sorry. Had I been here sooner...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
037	But there are still lives we can save! Right?
