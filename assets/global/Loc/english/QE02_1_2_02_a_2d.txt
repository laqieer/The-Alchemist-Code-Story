001	N-no way! You took down a Guard Droid?!
002	I'm sure the Beckrams knows where you are now, aye.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0030
003	Either way, it doesn't matter. Ron, was it? Are you hurt?
004	Shut up! Just because you helped me, doesn't mean I'm giving you back your wallet.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0011
005	You don't have to. It was my fault it got stolen. More importantly, do you know where Don Taras's mansion is?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
006	The Don Taras Family's mansion? Wh-what are you planning on doing? Of course, I don't know!
007	Well, that's what I thought you'd say. I guess we'll have to find another way.
008	See you around. Try not to make your mother worry too much.
009	My mom?
010	You have to buy her medicine, right? Hurry along then and don't get caught again.
011	Tsk...!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0016
012	Idiot! Even if a foreigner like you infiltrated the Neo Victor mansion...
013	You'll just end up getting kicked to the curb! See ya!
014	Did you realize he just told us the location of the mansion?
015	Hah. Honestly. What a strange kid!
016	He may be a kid, aye, but that's the first male I've seen you treat kindly.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0022
017	Are you talking about Ron?
018	Heh. You've still got a lot to learn. Come on, let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
