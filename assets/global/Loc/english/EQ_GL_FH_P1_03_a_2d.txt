001	- Greed Dike, Grand Hall -
002	The low murmurs rippling across the gathered nobles ceases as Li Wang makes his entrance.
003	Friends, esteemed lords and ladies! My thanks for coming to this most important of meetings, for it concerns our great nation this day.
004	As you know, Zheng Yi's disgraced house has come under intense scrutiny these few months.
005	Out of an abundance of caution, I have ordered my men to block their attempts at destroying evidence of Atropos's Core.
006	Sadly, it appears that the head of their house remains recalcitrant, and few, if any, of our investigations have borne fruit.
007	I'd say it was a miracle he wasn't ordered to be immediately executed outright for the abuse of Alchemy.
008	The Greed Dike nobles mumble their agreement, eyeing Zheng Yi and Asuka's battered bodies.
009	And so I turn to you, my countrymen. After all he has done, I propose that we exile him and his house to the borders while he awaits further judgment.
010	I am loathed to see Greed Dike in such a state, and I will be glad to carry out this unenviable work myself for the benefit of all.
011	I trust that I have the support of my noble compatriots?
012	A-A fine decision, Master Li Wang! We stand with you and Goetia!
013	Greed Dike is better off without such a dangerous man!
014	Then we shall tarry no longer.
015	Inform the guards. Have them move in fifteen minutes.
016	I expect you to be waiting at their destination.
017	Of course, Master.
018	Have you any last words, traitor?
019	None...
020	Save for a last bit of friendly advice about biting off more than you chew, perhaps.
021	But it falls on deaf ears, surely—deafened as they are by the sound of coin.
022	Take him away.
023	- Greed Dike outskirts -
024	Flanked by two rows of stern-faced guards, Zheng Yi and Asuka are led through narrow alleys into the outskirts of Greed Dike.
025	A guard runs over from the road ahead and salutes the captain.
026	All clear ahead, sir. Ready to take over upon your inspection.
027	Alright.
028	You there, bring up the rear! We're running on a tight schedule here!
029	(I don't see any openings, my lord. The best we can hope for is the next change of guard.)
030	(If we can make it there alive, that is.)
031	(Knowing Li Wang, he has every intention for us to not survive the trip.)
032	(Bah, I can just hear it. "Self-inflicted out of guilt".)
033	Hey. Stop whispering.
034	Do you want to be gagged as well?
035	(This guard seems familiar...)
036	Aagh!
037	What the-
038	Gwaah!
039	They've got conspirators!
040	Beautifully done.
041	Thanks to your clever ruse that got us here in the first place.
042	Shion?!
043	How-
044	There will be plenty of time for explanations later, my dear sister.
045	Are you all right, my lord?
046	Well enough. Now, before that woman arrives...
047	Ah. Speak of the devil.
048	Oh my! A harlot AND a fox?
049	I expected an attempt to run, but this is a surprise!
050	Unfortunately for you, Lord Zheng Yi, you and your little friends have squandered all of Master's goodwill...and patience.
051	Grind them all to dust, won't you?
052	Yes, my lady!
053	The captain pulls out a remote, activating several Constructs.
054	Such sweet sorrow to part like this, don't you think?
055	But, oh, the irony of being crushed by the very Constructs you labored to build.
056	I won't be held responsible for their savagery, you know.
057	If you'd given in to begin with, things could have gone a lot better for you...
058	*WHIRRRR...*
059	Suddenly, a Goetia guard bot stomps out of the brush, its shell sporting several strange additions.
060	Sorry to keep you waiting!
061	Target...and, activate!
062	*BZZZZP!*
063	What?! What's going on?!
064	The Constructs aren't responding, my lady!
065	BZZRT... WEAK SIGNAL. WEAK SIGNAL.
066	COMMENCING EMERGENCY OPERATIONS.
067	Grr...
068	Deploy the rest! I do not care if the prisoners are in pieces!
069	Y-yes, my lady...!
070	Heh, looks like the Professor and Blair managed to get the Alchemia jammer working.
071	Asuka, take our lord and get behind cover.
072	We'll handle this.
073	Be careful, Shion!
074	Ready when you are.
075	Let's give them a taste of their own medicine.
076	*BZZP!*
