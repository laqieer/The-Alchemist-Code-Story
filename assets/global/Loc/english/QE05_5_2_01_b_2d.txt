018	Ghaaaaarrrgggh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
019	It was a mistake for you to take on the form of a monster.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
020	Logi! There's no need to keep things hidden anymore! Use the drying agent you've brought with you!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
021	Right! You heard him, everybody!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
