001	Kukk...gaa...krchhh...
002	Huff...huff... Looks like it paid off. Hahah. Flat lines really can become three-dimensional!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
003	Both a gunshot and a sword slash is a flat line, but, by intersecting them, we created a three-dimensional effect. For something we improvised, it worked pretty well.
004	We can use it again in the future! We'll need a name for it! How about we call it Cluster Buster?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
005	You've horrible at naming things.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
006	Y-you...imbeciles! The Messiah...! The crystal of this country's evolution...	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0020
007	It's a pretty fragile crystal. Breaks pretty easily.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
008	What did you say?!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0013
009	It's true that the Messiah was a well-made AI. It registered all the methods of human warfare and ways of conduct as data. Then, it used that data to evolve itself.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
010	But haven't you realized? The people who created the Messiah and all the material the Messiah learned from...
011	They were all humans!
012	!!!
013	We, humans, have held our ground in the face of adversary over and over again. That's what makes us relevant. Machines are no match for us when it comes down to that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
014	It's true that it'll be inconvenient for the people of this city if there aren't any machines, but it'll also mean they're free. If you can't enjoy freedom, then...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
015	There's no point in being born human. It's idiotic for humans to try to live the life of a machine!
016	...!
017	Get up, you big imbecile. It wasn't energy that was sucked out of you, but the will the stand on your own two feet...and this has been going on for years now.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
018	In this country that relies on machines, I thought I had trained all of you to at least think for yourselves.
019	When you said that you were gonna leave, I thought you were going to become independent, but it seems like I woefully misguided.
020	Now get up! As long as you can stand on your own, I drag you with me where ever I go!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
021	Do-Don...! Sob...I-I was a real idiot. I'm...sorry!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0018
022	Heh. Well then, Mr. Unbalanced, now that I've rescued you, we're even!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
023	Huh? What are you prattling on about? Did I ever ask the likes of you to rescue me? And who are you calling unbalanced?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
024	For starters, if it weren't for you I'd still have the energy in my right arm and I wouldn't have had to receive a beating from that pile of scrap!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0040
025	What?! Is that how you speak to the man who saved your life?! Your mom isn't here to rescue you, you know?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
026	You comb head...I'll blow you away!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0026
027	H-hey, what the...?! What are you trying to do me?! Let me...go!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_battle_0021
028	If you have time, then help out with the restoration of the city. You're partially to blame for its destruction, so you should fulfill your responsibility.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0010
029	Do-don't speak nonsense! It's one thing to be told by Don, but why do I have to listen to the likes of—	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0027
030	In that case, would you like to get involved in that situation?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
031	... ...
032	Maybe...we're also like bullets fired from a gun. Once we stop, all that's left for us to do is fall.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
033	Stop speaking nonsense, and stop those two!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0022
034	Just let them go at each other until they feel better. The same can be said for this country. Stagnation and fatigue caused it to fall as low as it could before it finally began working again.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0008
035	Those two will eventually begin working again too. They just have a little too much energy on their hands so that's their way of releasing it.
036	... ...
037	Today is the day that we settle this!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0010
038	Right back at you! You're going down!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
039	Blade Striker<br>PATK and DEF ignored for selected target<br>All Buff/Debuff effects disabled [Range: 4, Height Range: 2]
040	Combo Skill and Learned Quest released! “Blade and Gun”
