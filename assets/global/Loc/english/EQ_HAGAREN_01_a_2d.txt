001	Wh-where...am...I?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_chara_1007
002	This drowsiness... It feels familiar...
003	I'm not sure what it is... Like I've gotten stuck at the bottom of a dark pit; stuck between unconsciousness and consciousness.
004	Where exactly am I?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0016
005	You are in Northern Pride, the capital of the holy land, and this place—the Holy Order of Babel's Headquarters—lies at the very heart of it.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
006	What?! Wh-what did you just say?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
007	Response verified. Transmutation of consciousness complete.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
008	Um... Good morning, I think. My name is Alphonse Elric. Pleased to make your acquaintance.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0031
009	...
010	So who might you be, and what am I doing here? I've never heard of a country known as Northern Pride...but have you seen my brother by any chance?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0001
011	How wondrous, Lady Toritoh!
012	O Holy Order! Almighty Paladin of the Holy Guard! Blessed One!
013	O Majestic General of the Holy Guard! Performer of Great Deeds!
014	Whoa! Wh-who are all these people?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0026
015	Quiet, men! Don't agitate the outsider. He is a very important source of information!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
016	A s-source of information?! Hang on a second! I don't know much of anything!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
017	Outsiders are full of useful knowledge. Especially you, you talking mass of steel! Looks like I'd better dismantle you before I get to investigating—	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
018	No! Don't take me apart! Hear me out first!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0042
019	You're still in one piece, Alphonse? I trust you haven't told them anything!	VO_roy.roy_sys_0001
020	We're breaking out of here! I'll cover you, so hurry over this way!	VO_riza.riza_sys_0016
021	Colonel Mustang! Lieutenant Hawkeye! You've come to save me!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0024
022	Do you think I'll just let that happen? Do you have any idea how much it cost us to transmute you?!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0019
023	Not our problem! Don't even think of moving, unless you want me to turn you to ash, that is!	VO_roy.roy_sys_0016
024	Don't make any sudden moves, men. That flame alchemy of his could be problematic.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
025	This otherworldly power... It is both something to be feared, and something we must attain.
026	It's been a while since I made the trek to Northern Pride, but it's just as bleak and dreary as ever. The gambling dens and bars here are bland at best.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
027	The worst part is the way everyone cowers at me... I'll just have to finish up quick and head on to somewhere more entertaining.
028	Whoa! What the hell happened here?! The front gate of the Holy Order's been blown away!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
029	Where are we?! What kind of a place is this?! I've never seen anything like it in all my travels!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0026
030	That's because this isn't Amestris. We're not even on the same continent. In fact, this might even be an entirely different world.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0004
031	Wait, what? What does that mean? Colonel, do you know something about it?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
032	Colonel, this way. It doesn't look like anyone's following us. We should find somewhere to hide.	VO_riza.riza_sys_0002
033	Good idea. This city is rather peculiar. It's massive, yet it seems like no one lives here. You'd think someone would come to investigate all the commotion.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0005
034	It reminds me of Amestris at the height of turmoil.	VO_riza.riza_sys_0031
035	Everyone shut away... Afraid to even peer out of their windows...
036	You're right. Still...the air itself—even the sense of the people here... It feels different. This really isn't our world.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0031
037	We woke up in this country yesterday. Based on what they were saying, I believe we have been transmuted into what they call "Phantoms" here.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0004
038	They used their own unique style of alchemy to—
039	Alchemy?! Are you saying they carried out human transmutation?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0027
040	I doubt it. I have no recollection of dying in Amestris, nor do I feel as though I were transmuted from a corpse...	VO_roy.roy_chara_1009
041	Apparently, Phantoms have lines of blue light permeating their bodies...	VO_riza.riza_sys_0031
042	We have that same blue glow, ourselves, as it happens.
043	Th-then that lady from before was basically a State Alchemist from the country of Northern Pride?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
044	Judging from the power and authority she wields, it would appear so.	VO_riza.riza_chara_1003
045	Colonel, someone is following us. Just one lone unit. My guess is that she's...	VO_riza.riza_sys_0027
046	...
047	Impressive... I can see that my men will be unable to handle someone of your abilities.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
048	Therefore, I, Blessed One of the Holy Order, shall take you on.
049	Behold the depths of my power and the strength of my Phantoms!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0014
