001	Um... Dias?
002	I'm so glad you're alive.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
003	Erm, yes.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0004
004	You seem to be doing well. Are you eating well? How are you getting along with Logi?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
005	I think we're doing fine.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0016
006	...
007	Did...I say something weird?
008	So you really did lose your memory, huh?
009	I-I'm sorry... Am I that different from before?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0035
010	You have nothing to be sorry about. I think you're fine as you are. There's no need to hold onto bad memories.
011	But...
012	Hahaha. Logi and I have lots of memories with you that we'd rather forget, to be honest.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
013	W-was I really that harsh?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
014	...
015	Sorry to interrupt your precious moment, but we do have to discuss something important with you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
016	I know. You want me to mobilize the 4th Regiment to aid the Liberation Army, correct?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
017	If possible, yes.
018	To put it simply, I cannot fight alongside the Liberation Army.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0036
019	Why not? Ceclidis will wreak havoc upon this continent!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
020	Will the Holy Guard do nothing in the face of his savagery?
021	We've been ordered to stand down.
022	Could you not help us for old times' sake?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0041
023	I assume it was Kamui's idea to have you come ask me, but as the Captain of the 4th Regiment, I cannot mobilize the Holy Guard's paladins on a personal account.
024	Our Lord Commander considers this matter an internal affair within Gluttony Foss.
025	We exist to maintain order on behalf of the Continent. We do not get involved with each country's welfare.
026	But, still...!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0017
027	Don't make me repeat myself. I cannot—
028	Captain Dias!
029	What is it?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
030	The Jam are approaching our barracks! They are clearly targeting our forces!
031	What?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
032	Take up arms to counter! The Jam will riddle their opponents with curses, so keep your distance and fight with alchemy!
033	Yes, Sir!
034	What is going on? Our barracks are concealed with alchemy.
035	The Jam lack the necessary Alchemia detection to find them.
036	Ah, um... Sorry about this, Dias.
037	I'm being used as a distraction to keep Ceclidis' eyes off of our soldiers' movements.
038	What?
039	The curse upon me seems to attract the Jam.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0011
040	Kamui told us that if we were to approach you, Ceclidis would suspect cooperation between us.
041	He believed Ceclidis would send most of his forces this way.
042	We had to take some desperate measures.
043	I-I'm sorry...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0035
044	You...!
045	Kamui has a message for you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
046	"An enemy's enemy is an ally, right?"
047	Sorry to force your hand.
048	That weasel!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
049	Well, you know... Do your best. I mean, we'll help if you need us to.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
050	That won't be necessary! Keep yourselves hidden in the camp, out of our way!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0040
051	Everybody! Form ranks! Get ready for a fight!
052	Yes, Sir!
053	Protector Kamui! You will pay for this!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
