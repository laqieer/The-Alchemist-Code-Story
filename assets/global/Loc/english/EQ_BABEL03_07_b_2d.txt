001	Ah, welcome back, Master Ryle!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0027
002	Honestly... Thanks to jerks like that, my work never ends. I wish they'd let up a little.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0029
003	Do you have a plan?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
004	I do. There's been talk of some mercenaries who are making a name for themselves lately. They only seem to be taking requests as individuals, though, not as a guild, so send someone to go and negotiate with them.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
005	Understood.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0006
006	Hmph. These outsiders... They think that they can just do whatever they please, but enough's enough!	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
