001	Wow!
002	This is our home now. A hidden village built by an ancient people...or what's left of it, anyway.
003	Incredible! It's like a magic kingdom!
004	We're back.
005	Oh, my! So this is the Phantom Soldier who will seal the Darkness!
006	Haa...
007	What's wrong? The summoning worked, didn't it?
008	No... You don't mean to say that it failed? Why did you bring her here, then? Are you just going to dump her on us?
009	We don't have room for layabouts!
010	I-I...!
011	K-Kasumi!
012	Haa...
013	Bwirr!
014	Are you all alone, little one?
015	That makes two of us.
016	Bwirru!
017	Look at you! You flap those little wings! Hmm...
018	I think I'll call you Flappy. Would you like that?
019	Bwirruru?
020	U-um...
021	Liz...
022	I... I'm sorry! We called you all the way out here, and...tasked you with all of this...
023	Not at all! I mean...I'm useless to you otherwise, aren't I? There's no denying that.
024	K-Kasumi...
025	It's strange, though... I would have thought that only really powerful or talented people would be able to become Phantom Soldiers. It just doesn't make sense for an average high school student like me...
026	High...school?
027	Oh, um... You don't have schools here? S-sorry... I shouldn't have brought it up.
028	No! I want to hear about your world. I'd love to! We do have schools here, so that part I understand.
029	Well... I attended my high—my school every day, but I was just a normal student. I never had any special abilities or...anything special, really.
030	I was there today, too. At school, I mean. Then I went to bed, and heard a strange voice calling to me...
031	Th-then...!
032	Before I knew it, I was here.
033	I-I'm so sorry! It sounds like I summoned you while you were still alive!
034	Really...?
035	I don't understand. Why did this happen? You're clearly not the Phantom Soldier who can seal away the Darkness.
036	Unless... There's some other meaning behind it?
037	No need to waste your energy pondering that. You should be thinking about how you can send her back. We need her gone, fast.
038	I...!
039	We can't afford to keep her here. We're hanging on by a thread as it is. Even one new addition is more than enough to sink this ship.
040	Edgar! That's enough!
041	If she's no good to us...then we can't afford to waste our resources on her. It's as simple as that.
042	All those children... Their families aren't...?
043	...
044	No...!
045	K-Kasumi...?
046	Is... Is there anything I can do to help? Anything at all?
047	Who's this?
048	I guess she must be the useless Phantom Soldier the grown-ups were talking about, huh.
049	Ngh...
050	You can't do anything. And even if you could... Pfft.
051	Well, we haven't finished making dinner yet. Aw, man... I'm getting really sick of eating the same stuff every single day.
052	Dinner? That's something that even I could help with!
053	H-hey...
054	What's this?
055	It's a shellbug shell. You can't eat just the shell, so it's no good.
056	Okay! I'll use this to...and then...
057	There we go! It's all ready!
058	Whoa! It smells really good! Can I try some?
059	Of course! Eat as much as you like!
060	Umgf... Yum! You're amazing, lady!
061	Can I have a taste? Oh! This is delicious!
062	...
063	Come on, Edgar! Try some! It's really good!
064	It's been a while since I saw the little ones smiling like that.
065	H-huh?
066	I'm heading back. Time for bed, you three.
067	Yessir!
068	Edgar...
069	I know he seems cold, but I hope you won't think too poorly of him. He was a completely different person, once.
070	Compassionate, easily moved to tears and easily carried away... Finishing every sentence with a punchline...
071	Really?
072	Never let a girl cry: that's my policy. Nothing in this world could be more important to me than that.
073	That's something he used to say a lot, back in the day.
074	Pfft! Are you serious? I totally can't imagine it...
075	Yes, well... Then he got caught up trying to save everyone, going around fighting the Demons of Darkness... I think it's left him scarred in more ways than one.
076	I... I see.
077	Huh? Wh-what the...?!
078	L-Liz? What's the matter?
079	It's only faint, but I can feel Alchemia! It's coming back! But...why?
080	What? I thought you said that Alchemy was sealed because the...the Destrolurk possessed the Tower of Babel?
081	Right! That's exactly why it's strange!
082	Maybe I could fly on Broom Ace again! No, better still...
083	Maybe I could use magic!
084	Y-you can fly? Wow... You're amazing, Liz!
085	No... No, I'm really not. I used to be a student, too, you know; and a terrible one, at that. I was always falling behind at school.
086	What? Really?
087	Yes. The only reason I've managed to come so far is because of the help I've received.
088	I see...
089	I... I'm...
090	Bwirr?! Bwirru! Bwii!
091	Flappy...? What's wrong?!
092	We're under attack! The Demons of Darkness are here!
093	No!
094	How did they find us?!
095	Come on, Lisbeth! I need your help! We must keep them from the village at all costs!
096	Okay! Kasumi, there's a shelter behind the village. Go! Take cover!
097	B-but I...!
098	I...!
