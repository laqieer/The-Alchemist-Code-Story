001	I've heard that cats disappear when they near their time of death.
002	A few weeks ago - Therian Care Center Ruins
003	The left over research notes are evidence?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
004	A successful specimen of beast transformation. That's what they would call me, but that's just a glorified way of saying I'm an incomplete product of repeated experimentation.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
005	They drew the beast nature out of my body, applied enhancements, and forced it back into me.
006	Your biological balance is off. That shadow you keep with you, not to mention your transformations, are heavy burdens on your physical body.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
007	Were the drugs they were giving you here what kept you alive? Then now that the center's destroyed...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
008	I never had that long to live.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
009	...
010	So...  So I...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
011	I want to be strong enough to help Dead Nine.
012	I want to see the blue sky with him.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
013	I want to do what I can while I'm still alive.
014	...
015	Be tenacious.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
016	Huh?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
017	I do not want to see you give up. I want to see you overcome sadness, hardships, and even your own desires.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
018	Keep walking forward, and I know you will one day find your way outside.
019	With him, of course.
020	What?
021	I want you to be our second member. Then, with him, you can—	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
022	...
023	I am now Zwei.
024	I will not give up until the end.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
025	But... I am still a little scared.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
026	Aren't we, Kuro?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
027	I've been waiting for you, Dead Nine.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
028	Yo... Are you alone?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0002
029	No.
030	Not anymore.
