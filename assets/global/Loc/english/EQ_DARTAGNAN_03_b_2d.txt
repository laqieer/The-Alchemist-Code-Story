001	Seriously...I said I'll leave it to the two of you, but you took it way too far.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
002	Do you two understand?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0022
003	Yes, yes. We're sorry.
004	I'm sorry...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0035
005	Further information leaks, removal of prototype weapons, and organizing the infiltration of foreign knights into our country...
006	Everything worked out in the end, but it could very well have ended up with something far worse than me being fired from my position!
007	In this one day, I feel like I've aged a decade's worth...	VO_amis.amis_sys_0018
008	Ack...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0022
009	But everything worked out in the end, right? Come on.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1017
010	Don't 'come on' me! After blowing up this situation to this scale, I can only imagine what he'll say...	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
011	He? Who gives the head of the Technology Division grievances?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
012	Well...	VO_amis.amis_sys_0018
013	You two really pulled a number, didn't you?	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0030
014	Vi-Vincent?! The Wizard of the Machine World'?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
015	Don't call me that, Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0002
016	Fo-Former Director...	VO_amis.amis_sys_0027
017	Oh...right, I forgot about him.
018	Amis...why do you think I pushed you into the position of Director?	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0001
019	Even if I throw you a handful of a job, your talent is supposed to be that you can always complete it tactfully!
020	So why am I being bothered by this fiasco? I retired because I didn't want to get involved in this kind of stuff.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0016
021	I have no excuse...	VO_amis.amis_sys_0018
022	Huh? Wasn't that just plain abusive?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
023	When that guy's in a bad mood, there's no talking logic to him. Let it go...	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1006
024	Well, it's over now. Regarding what happened this time, part of it can be handled by calling in some favors.	VO_vincent.vincent_chara_1005
025	The joint training should handle any inquiries by Gluttony...we can throw what happened with Saga into the mix as well.
026	Unlike Michael, I'm not the type who takes care of other people's messes, but...	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0030
027	We're on board now so we might as well. I'll have a talk with the person in charge of Northern Pride's external affairs.
028	Th-thank you, Former Director.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0018
029	I won't be going out of my way. Just know that. Oh, as for you from the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0010
030	Y-yes?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
031	If possible, I'd like for you to keep hanging out with them.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0003
032	Technicians tend to withdraw from the world and become closed off in their thinking.
033	A-ah...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
034	Who's he calling closed off?! He's the textbook example of that term!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
035	Totally...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
036	You seem to be lacking energy. Are you feeling down about something?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
037	It's not that, but...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
038	I was just thinking how there really are a lot of countries with different ways of thinking.
039	I need to learn to understand that better.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0022
040	I want to do something for all the knights that I serve with...
041	And for all those who've accepted my savage ways...
042	... ...
043	Why don't you just do what you can?	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1017
044	Huh?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
045	Us technical types tend to be completely useless outside of our expertise.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
046	That's why we put our heads together and brainstorm, which eventually progresses into research.
047	Even then, you'll still get tired of always failing. You'll have days where you give up and get depressed, but...
048	There's no need to do everything yourself. You just need to know what it is you can do.
049	I think you're pretty good at that. More importantly, you're endearing to those around you. Trust is one of the biggest assets you can have.
050	You think so...?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0022
051	You know, we're chasing the impossible dream.
052	Huh?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
053	I'm talking about the airships. They're the image of our dreams. They're pegged to be the symbol of Slothstein.
054	To be honest, we still don't have a clear set time for completion. Everything is just an estimate.
055	Still, we believe that it will, one day, be finished.
056	What I mean to say is that the airships are our pride.
057	Because we share this same vision, we can remain as friends and colleagues. It's all about a state of mind.
058	That's why you and Amis are always so passionate.
059	You have that as well, don't you? That kind of pride.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0003
060	Y-yes!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
061	(My pride is to make the Captain and all the other knights smile...)
062	In that case, stop worrying about it and just do what you can do.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
063	What you can't do, somebody will help you with. That's what friends are for.
064	Megistos, I used to think you were just a cannon-wearing idiot, but you're actually contemplating a lot of stuff in your mind.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
065	(Yes, I've changed my opinion of him just a little. Maybe...)
066	Well, more than you with your savage mind.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1017
067	Hey, wait! What did you just say?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
068	Shut up! Look at you, worrying about something so stupid! You ruined the positive atmosphere!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
069	Huh?! I never asked for your encouragement!
070	Hey, but that's the kind of vibe you were giving off! You were like a cat wanting attention.
071	Don't call me a cat! I'm obviously a tiger! A tiger!!!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0012
