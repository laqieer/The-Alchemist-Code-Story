001	Tsk. I'll admit defeat just this once. I'm assuming that's the mystery man you were referring to.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
002	He seems to be a mercenary hired by the Beckrams, but there's something different about him. Be careful.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
003	An Alchemist, huh?	VO_edgar.logi-b_sys_0029
004	Tsk. I guess I'm getting old. The way he fights reminds me of someone...but I can't remember which battle.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
005	Right then. Let's hurry up and get this over with. Afterward, we can try to remember who you're talking about over drinks.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
006	Not a bad idea. Here he comes!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
007	No time to waste. Let's make every move count!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0013
008	I've run into a tiring amount of opponents who prided themselves on their speed. You're lacking in experience, boy!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0017
009	No matter how fast a bullet is, it can only fly straight. That makes it easy to read. Your guns can't stop me!	VO_edgar.logi-b_sys_0010
010	He disappeared?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
011	Behind you, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
012	As a rule of thumb, those who pride themselves on their speed like to be counterintuitive. I'll leave the rest to you, comb head.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
013	Shut up, Mr. Unbalanced.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
014	You read my moves?!	VO_edgar.logi-b_sys_0027
015	Your mistake was to underestimate my strength! If you're gonna blame anything, blame your own hubris!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0003
016	Ack! Huzzzaaaahhh!!!	VO_edgar.logi-b_battle_0008
017	What...?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
018	Sorry...but you played right into my hands.
019	Agahhh...!!!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0025
020	Edgar!!!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
021	No way! Did he just deflect the bullet path with his sword?! He's toying with us!
022	There's still something I need to ask her. I cannot give her up.
023	Agahhh...!!!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0042
024	Don!!!
025	Sorry. You'll have to accompany me a little longer. Come. Let's go.
026	N-no...!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
027	Agh...! Wa...wait! You...!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0043
028	...?! Knight...?!
029	Th-that coat of arms...it belongs to Envylia! Agh... Wh-who...are you?!
030	Me...? My name is Logi, the successor of the Blue Flame	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0014
