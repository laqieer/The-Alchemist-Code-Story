001	Phew... I hope I didn't get in your way too much.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043
002	(Oh! The shadows surrounding Nefertiti are disappearing! Is it possible that fate is not as set in stone as I thought?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
003	Not at all. If you hadn't been here, I don't know what might have happened to me.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
004	Thank you, Uzuma. Truly. Now I can focus on the task at hand.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0033
005	(Oh, no! New shadows have appeared! So I didn't change anything... What was the point, then?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
006	(I managed to chase the first shadows away somehow, though... So maybe—even if it's not a lot—there is something that I can do!)
007	Lady Nefertiti... I don't know much about the burdens you carry, but if there is anything I can do to help, I want to do it. I want to be there for you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
008	So, please... Don't fight on your own anymore. I worry about the new shadows that have come to haunt you.	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0015
009	You are concerned for my well-being?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
010	Of course I am! You're a very important person to everyone who lives in the desert!
011	I had...never considered such a thing. It seems that instead of saving you, I was saved by you. Not only thanks to your fortune-telling; you brought your strength to bear in order to help me.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
012	I... I have been called the Messenger of Death because I've foretold so much of it. I never considered before now that I could actually do something to change the fortunes I've seen.
013	Today I learned that I am all the more powerful when I believe in myself! I will never forget it!
014	Hmm... I also ought to remember not to become so preoccupied with whether or not I will disappoint anyone.
015	It is only thanks to you that I was able to realize how much pressure I have been putting myself under.
016	Uzuma, I was wondering... Would you mind lending me a hand?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0038
017	Oh! Yes! Of course!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0008
018	My, what a lovely smile. Hmhm. It really makes you sparkle.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
019	Oh! That's so kind of you to say! Ooohh... This is just like that dazzling light.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
020	Dazzling light...?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
021	The dazzling light I felt when I received this hourglass from the person who taught me not to fear death. They were so strong, and so filled with light...
022	That person inspired me to work hard, to get stronger at things other than fortune-telling. It hasn't gone very well, though...
023	I even messed up today. Sometimes it makes me want to give up on trying to interact with people.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
024	I see... I suppose my timing is quite good, then?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0045
025	Yes! The best! I really feel that fighting at your side has changed me for the better, and will continue to do so!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
026	I now know that there are things that I can change by taking action. I want to become stronger, so that I can keep trying to change people’s fortunes for the better!
027	I want to be just like you, Lady Nefertiti. I hope that I, too, can become someone that the people of the desert and their defenders can count on!
