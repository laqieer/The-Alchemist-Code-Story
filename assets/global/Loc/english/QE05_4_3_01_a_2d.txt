001	Kamui. It is a pleasure to see you again.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
002	How are things progressing here?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
003	The Liberation Army is here, and virtually in full force at that. They've set up camp outside the port.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0004
004	It appears that the guards of the royal capital were not expecting us. They have been scrambling to respond, clearly unprepared for an attack at this point in time.
005	Now that we're all here, let us take the main road. On to the royal capital!
006	Blue Tongues, reporting for duty, sir! We have finished disembarkation!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
007	Good! Then we're ready. Kamui!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
008	Mocca?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
009	I guess this is where we part ways. I promise to keep Agatha and Marie safe.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
010	Logi...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_favorite_0001
011	I'll join you soon, Agatha. Please, be safe until then.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_1011
012	You too.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0037
013	Let us go, then. It's time to bring the fight to our enemies! To the royal capital!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
014	Wow! Despite the number of people here, we're really making good time! In Saga, even with just half the number, with sheep it took much longer.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
015	This road between the port and the royal capital is where the bulk of commerce happens in Gluttony Foss. For that reason, it has been well maintained.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0007
016	I had hoped that would mean that we would be able to make good enough time to make inroads into the city before they had formed their defensive lines, but...
017	It seems that was a vain hope.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
018	Troops! At arms! It is our duty to protect the royal capital!
019	Defend the city, or your worthless hides will be out of a job!
020	This seems like it could become quite a mess. Regardless, we cannot let them stop us here. We must break through their ranks and into the royal capital!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0012
