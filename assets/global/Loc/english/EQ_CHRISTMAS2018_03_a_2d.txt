001	We've been walking for forever. Are we there yet?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
002	Just a bit further!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
003	I'm pretty sure you said that an hour ago. Well, whatever.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
004	It must be nice to be so young. I am already quite tired.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0022
005	Shouldn't be too long now. Keep going, Birgitta!
006	Not too long, hmm? By the way, Klima, did you feel the flow of Alchemia, too?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0006
007	Yes, I think so. I can sort of...feel it on my skin.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
008	I can't really explain it, but I just know that someone is interfering with the weather.
009	I see. So we felt the same thing, then. It appears that you and I share the same sense of intuition.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0009
010	I can't believe anyone would want to get in the way of the Winter Holiday that everyone looks forward to so much. It's...unforgivable!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0015
011	Now, now. Calm down, Klima. There's no point in getting all wound up—you'll just tire yourself out more.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0012
012	I-I know...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
013	You really are fond of the Winter Holiday, aren't you?
014	When I was little, we used to celebrate it every year in my village.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
015	Everyone was so warm and kind... It was so much fun, even though Santa never came to visit.
016	It does sound like it has given you some wonderful memories.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0007
017	Yeah... Even though there was no Santa.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
018	Klima, do you want to meet Santa?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0044
019	I do. I heard that you can meet him if you're really good.
020	So I'm going to be good, and do my best to make it snow!
021	We're here!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0019
022	This is the village of the guardians of the Winter Holiday, the home of the Maruda Tribe!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0001
023	So this is the Maruda Tribe's village, huh?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0025
024	No way! There's no snow at all?! I thought this was supposed to be the land of snowmen!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0016
025	It's not the land of snowmen. It's the village of the Maruda Tribe!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0002
026	Like we told you already, it hasn't snowed at all. We have no idea why, but—	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0003
027	It's because you desecrated the Winter Holiday!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0002
028	Huh?! You're...!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0020
029	W-wait! What are you talking about?! D-desecrated...?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0025
030	You humans spread our beloved Winter Holiday across the world and got it all twisted! You ruined it!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0003
031	We have to right the wrong of the Winter Holiday! Yuki, Kyu... You were the ones who said that!
032	O-of course! That's why we left, so that we could teach the humans about the true meaning of the Winter Holiday!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0019
033	Yet here you two are, with your heads held high like heroes, when all you did was let yourselves get won over by the humans and didn't even change anything!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0019
034	Th-that's...!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0028_b
035	Now look at them! The humans are trying to start another poor excuse for a Winter Holiday all over again! You've been too soft on them!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0001
036	Anything other than a real Winter Holiday is inexcusable! Humans just do it all wrong! I won't let them mess it up again!
037	You don't deserve to have snow!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0002
038	Goodness! It appears that we are only making things worse.
039	This unnatural Alchemia flow... So you're the one preventing the snow from falling, are you?
040	So what if I am?!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0020
041	I will not allow it.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0016
042	How could you interfere with the holiday that everyone is looking forward to—and for such a selfish reason? It's...inexcusable.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0015
