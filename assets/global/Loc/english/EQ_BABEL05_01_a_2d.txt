001	Justice, justice, justice... That's all anyone ever talks about.
002	How boring. "The future of this world"? Who cares!
003	How presumptuous of people to think that anything they do matters in the grand scheme of time!
004	Time is forever. This world is nothing more than a blip in its infinite flow.
005	At the very least, people should try a little harder to figure out why they even want to, well...try harder.
006	Tsk, tsk. People are simply going to run themselves into the ground like this.
007	Well, have no fear, for the amazing Mira has a wonderful idea!
008	I'm going to go fix things.
009	Once I've made up my mind, it's time to act! It doesn't matter if I have no idea how I'm going to achieve my goals!
010	There's no time like the present. What's the point of needless worrying?
011	Okay, so... I just need—hah!
012	The Space-Time Manipulator!!!
013	My destination? Now that's just obvious!
014	I'm headed for the time when Alchemia drew the name of the Cursed Beasts upon the pages of history once more.
015	Heheh!
016	Here we go!
017	To the future!
018	Hm...	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
019	Mm... Another good, long sleep.	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1005
020	The stars look especially beautiful tonight, too.
021	Their light, casting gently down after traveling so far...
022	Yes...
023	I think I'll have some tea... Perhaps go into town?
024	Slothstein - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization
025	...
026	What are you doing here?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
027	I'll be asking the questions here. What reason do you have for trespassing on this site?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
028	Yikes. It doesn't seem like you're prepared to listen to what I have to say, but...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
029	I'm just looking for someone.
030	An alchemist, with the same hair color as me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
031	There might be clues here...
032	Clues about the Alchemy that he used.
033	Right. So that's why you're poking around here, is it?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
034	Hmph. You know something, don't you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
035	Only that you are suspicious.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
036	See? I just knew you wouldn't hear me out.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0045
037	I have listened, but the dead tell no tales.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
038	...
039	Die.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
040	Nrgh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
041	Heheh. Well, well. You're an unlucky one, aren't you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
042	My timing couldn't have been better!
043	Who are you?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
044	They call me Troublemaker.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
045	What?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
046	You're looking for this, aren't you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
047	You...! That stone! Where...?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
048	This old thing? Found it here in the ruins. Decided to borrow it for a bit.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
049	You missed it by just a minute, my little Corpse friend.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0024
050	You know about Corpse?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
051	Oh, but hey. There's a face I haven't seen before. Do you know who I am? No? Seriously?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_1013
052	Anyway, finders keepers, yeah?
053	You cool with that, Pinky?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
054	Excuse me?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0012
055	The name's Wilhelm.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_2001
056	You must be Albea.
057	What? How do you know my name?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
058	What did you expect?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
059	They don't call me Troublemaker for nothing.
060	Anyway, what a pleasant surprise to meet you here!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_1001
