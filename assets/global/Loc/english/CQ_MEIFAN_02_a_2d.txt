001	I beg your forgiveness, Supreme Commander! I swear it will never happen ever again! It was only a—	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
002	Fraternizing with the enemy is a grave sin indeed. I would have thought you'd know that, having served at my side for as long as you have.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0029
003	It seems that I was mistaken. Take him to the block.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
004	Yes, Supreme Commander!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0001
005	S-Supreme Commander! Please! I beg you! Supreme Commander!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
006	Those who betray me will pay with their lives. You should consider yourself lucky to be granted a quick death.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
007	She won't overlook even the smallest act of betrayal, and cuts down even her longest-serving followers without mercy. She's truly terrifying.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
008	Well, I'm impressed that she found out about his, uh, "fraternizing", even though it only happened once.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
009	I bet she doesn't trust any of us, not even a smidgen.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
010	Tch. Why must everyone cause me trouble?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
011	Hm...? There's something outside my window... Ah! Intruder!	VO_meifan.meifan_chara_1002
012	Ooops! You caught me!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0011
013	Ah!
014	Identify yourself this instant!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
015	Who, me? I'm Vivi, from Wratharis.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0005
016	(She gave up her name that easily?! What is she playing at?!)	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0025
017	I'm just out on a little errand and, well, I found myself staring at you.	VO_vivi.vivi_chara_1018
018	I couldn't help it! You just looked so lonely.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
019	Me? Lonely? Tch, don't be ridiculous! Is that all you have to say for yourself?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0012
020	That's it! Right there! That's the face I'm talking about! You know, if you're always so serious and pouty all the time, you won't grow any taller!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0003
021	Wh—?!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0027
022	I'll keep you company if you like.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
023	...
024	Hee hee...hee hee hee...	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0011
025	It is insolent for you to stand before me without a shred of fear, but also...interesting.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
026	Come to think of it...she's always been a strange one, since the time we first met.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
027	She may be a spy for Wratharis, but she has never shown so much as an inkling of having reported about me to her superiors. Furthermore, she comes and goes from my room without a second thought.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0029
028	And I... I accepted all of that. Even though she was a stranger to me—and an informant for a foreign nation at that! But now, I...	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0020
029	Ah!
030	Supreme Commander of the Greed Dike Navy, Mei Fang... It's time for you to die!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
031	(Ngh... I can't believe I got so caught up in my thoughts that I fell prey to a surprise attack! How could I be so careless?!)	VO_meifan.meifan_battle_0019
032	(If Vivi is my weakness, then I will cut her out of my life! It's better to trust no one at—)	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
033	Mei Fang!	VO_vivi.vivi_battle_0019
034	V-Vivi?! Why...?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0025
035	Sorry I haven't been able to come around for a while! I was doing this job that was just dragging on and on—but I'm here now!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0035
036	You have some real nerve laying a hand on my friend! You'd better be ready, because you're not going to be getting up after I'm finished with you!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0013
