001	So you want me to betray this region. Me.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
002	Indeed, these lands are already beyond salvation.
003	...
004	Of course, I understand that a knight such as yourself may have some apprehensions about this.
005	Please understand that I am not telling you to besmirch your honor—
006	I'm not worried about such things.
007	I am simply afraid, Your Highness.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
008	Afraid? A knight of such power and renown as yourself knows how to feel fear?
009	Haha! I dedicated my life to training so I might someday become a knight like that!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
010	But...this road is a hard and dangerous one to walk alone.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
011	I see what might await me at the end of the road, but I do not know if I have the resolve to carry my feet to meet it.
012	I understand.
013	But there is no need to fear. After all, you are not alone on your path.
014	No matter the trials and hardships that cut them down, humans always find a way to get back up again.
015	King Arius...
016	Keep those words close to heart, Andechs, most prestigious knight of these lands.
017	Keep walking this path.
018	As long as you do not stray, you shall never be alone.
019	――――
020	Sin, sin, sin—yes, that is the crime these humans carry.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
021	All this sin and corruption has grown rampant while I laid idle... Haha, it's funny to think I myself might've succumbed to sloth.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
022	Now, where do I start...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
023	Lust. Sloth. Gluttony. I shall deal with those places first.
024	Unfortunately, what I can do is limited. Temporary measures, at best. After all, time waits for no one.
025	What will you do? How will you face your doom as you stand on the brink of destruction?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0008
026	Why...
027	Princess... Why?! Why should you have to clean up after their mess?!
028	...Zafeiris.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
029	If the humans wish to slay the beasts, the pillars of this world, then they only have themselves to blame when their world starts breaking at the seams!
030	If that place were to be banished from the Cosmic Egg, just like the Avaritia Belt—
031	Silence, fool! There's nothing worse than a sore loser who doesn't know when to give up.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
032	You, slain by human hands, have already lost the form that connected you to these lands, and with that, any qualification to choose the fate of this world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
033	But...!
034	I have already decided they are the ones who shall carry forward the next generation.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
035	I'll be their shepherd and guide, the one that leads them into a new world. It'll be alright to help them a little.
036	...You'll help them?
037	If we want a world where humanity can prosper, it's a foregone conclusion, don't you think?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
038	Hah... Finally, there's an end to this meaningless, worthless existence.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0016
039	...Princess.
040	This world is already at its end. All that's left is to see whether or not they will find the future they are longing for.
041	Meanwhile, we ought to quietly accept our fate. We're little more than ghosts of the past, there is no reason for us to linger.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
042	...
043	It's blue...
044	This endless ocean, these skies covered in silvery clouds. And somehow... A yearning exists within me. I cannot find peace.
045	What am I here for? I don't understand. I'm not good enough. Not strong enough.
046	This shield was too heavy for me, so I thought I simply had to keep training till it felt like an extension of myself.
047	So why?	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
048	Why, why, why? I can think of nothing else. Why? Why am I still not—? I sit and wait for dusk to swallow me...
049	Lady Daphne! We've finished inspecting the cargo!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
050	We got lucky, the storm barely left a scratch. We didn't lose much at all.
051	That's a relief. Please let the captain know we can resume our voyage.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0007
052	This cargo is irreplaceable to the royal capital of Sodom. We must continue to do our utmost to ensure its safety.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
053	Yes, ma'am!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
054	Haah...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0030
055	Oh my, did you let a sigh slip there? That won't do. You shouldn't keep all your worries to yourself.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0005
056	Ah, forgive me! I lost track of myself! How embarrassing!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0035
057	Oh, don't mind me! I'm not scolding you or anything.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0035
058	But you looked so worried, so I couldn't help but say something.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
059	No, no, my lady, this is just how my face always looks, but I appreciate the concern.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0011
060	Is that so? Oh dear, don't tell me I'm bothering you with my chatter.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
061	Ah, not at all! It's just that I've never had the chance to talk with a noblewoman such as yourself before...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
062	Does status bother you? You shouldn't worry about where or to whom someone was born.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0005
063	Relax, and please call me Nicaea. That's what my father and Imnus call me.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0001
064	I-I couldn't! If I dared to call a princess by her first name, it'd be off with my head!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
065	Oh, don't be silly. What kind of king would behead his knights over such a minor thing?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0008
066	You understand, right, Daphne?
067	Y-yes, my lady.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
068	You hold a proud and noble position in our army. The one and only Shield Maiden who commands the shield regimen of the Purple Flame Knights.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0003
069	In fact, I'd argue you have more right to pride than someone like me, whose only good quality is her birthright.
070	My lady, please, I...
071	Bwrzz! Bweep!
072	Look, Selsieg agrees with me, too! So be a bit more confident already, and just call me Nicaea! No more of this 'my lady' or 'Your Highness' nonsense.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
073	I-I can't! Please forgive me, but I must at least insist on Lady Nicaea!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
074	I see... What a shame.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0022
075	Ah well, at least I got you to let down your guard and relax for a moment here. I will take the little victories.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0008
076	My lady...
077	I understand why you're so concerned. Our lands are surrounded by the ocean on all sides, so maritime trade is of vital importance to our citizens.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0001
078	But you wouldn't be assigned such an important escort duty if they didn't think you were able to do it. That means everybody recognizes your abilities.
079	You're not just protecting cargo! Think of the smiles and happiness of the citizens all over our country. I know you can do it if you just think of it that way.
080	When you put it that way... Yes, I love this place and its people. I want everyone who lives here to be able to laugh their days away.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0005
081	Then I ask you to relax a little. We all know you can do it, so there's no need to be so tense.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
082	Bwreep!
083	See, Selsieg believes in you too. So please, be a little more confident.
084	Y-yes, my lady...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
085	(Nicaea's smile is so bright and gentle, I don't doubt her sincerity, but...)
086	...This is how I always feel.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0030
087	Huh? Did you say something? I didn't catch it...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
088	Ah, it's nothing! Nothing at all.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
089	I'm sorry, but I really should return to my duties. Let us continue this conversation some other time.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
090	Ah, of course. I'm dreadfully sorry, once I start chattering away I find it hard to stop.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0011
091	Imnus is always scolding me for such things too. "A real lady should have some more discretion" and so on.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0030
092	The captain said that?
093	Yes, he's always telling me I should mind my reputation more if I am going to be his wife... Ah, sorry, here I go again.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0037
094	You just told me you had to get back to work, and here I am, holding you up.
095	Please don't look so glum, my lady! If people noticed you looking so downcast by my side, it'd be my reputation getting dragged through the mud—!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
096	BWIRR BWRI!
097	Huh? Selsieg, is something wro—	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0005
098	Eeek!
099	Lady Nicaea!
100	Gggraah!!!
101	Stand back, my lady!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
102	This is an emergency! Shield regimen, formations! We're dealing with the Leviathan's leftovers here!
103	Yes, ma'am! We're ready to fight!
104	Send a messenger to the sailors that we've got to get out of here immediately!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0002
105	Understood!
106	Daphne, I could...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0001
107	Don't worry about a thing, my lady. We can handle this, so you and Selsieg should get to a safe place.
108	GRAGH!
109	We might not need to fight the real thing! As long as we get rid of the ones on the ship, we can still escape!
110	Get back where you came from!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0010
111	...Tsk. This just got messy.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0017
