001	Ugh! You better believe I'll be back! You'll regret this!
002	Milis, are you hurt? I didn't think this would become such a ruckus...
003	I'm totally fine! Jeez, that guy was such a butt. I can't believe he grabbed you like that! He even called you a monster! Were those eyes in his head just for show?!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0017
004	Hmph. As if any disciple worth their salt could just sit back and let someone treat their master like that!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
005	By the way, is your gracefulness because of—you know—the whole mermaid thing? Do you have any tricks you can teach me?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
006	You must have understood by now, but I'm not the kind of woman that anyone thinks particularly...highly of. I'm sure there are others out there who are far more suitable to teaching you what you want to learn.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0031
007	Who cares what they think?! I don't know them!
008	Milis... You...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0003
009	I want to be just like you, Miss Tethys! You're exactly the kind of lady I'd love to be!
010	Milis... You say that, but I'm actually quite jealous of you.
011	Huh?! Seriously?! Why?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0025
012	You possess many wonderful qualities that I do not, such as candor, kindness, earnestness...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0005
013	I think that there is much more that I could learn from you than I myself have to teach.
014	Milis, this disciple thing is a bit much for me. What do you think of just being...friends?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
015	What?! Miss Tethys, you... Well, I guess I should just call you Tethys, then...	VO_milis.milis_sys_0026
016	Tethys, we're already friends! Anyone who's eaten a meal together with you is a friend!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
017	Milis...
018	Next time a lame buttface like that guy shows up, I'll definitely be there to kick their butt for you again, okay?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0016
019	(Ever since I was a child, whenever anyone said something mean to me, Perez would come to my rescue. Perez said the same kind of thing back then, too.)
020	(To be able to just shrug off other people's opinions like that...)
021	(I suppose Perez and this girl are a little similar in that respect.)
022	Hmhm...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0007
023	Wow! You look even lovelier when you smile! How do you do that? Do it again! Can you teach me how to do that?!
024	Cause, I mean... We're friends, right?
025	Yes, of course. Anything for a friend. Hm... I suppose we'll have to start with etiquette lessons. Of course, I will have to lend you one of my dresses.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0037
026	Huh? Dresses? Uh... But I'm, like, all sweaty from the hunting, and I don't want to get your clothes dirty, so, uh... Let's just forget the dress thing.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
027	There's no reason to be shy! Why don't we head back to my place and you can clean up and change there?
028	Usually I don't allow anyone but Perez into my room, but I'll make a special exception for you!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0038
029	After all, you're my very precious, second-ever friend.
030	I'm sure the two of us will become very close!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0023
031	Yesss! All right! Thanks, Tethys!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0009
032	Oh! I'm sorry, but no hugs! I'm only telling you this because you are my friend, and I want you to understand. I don't like being touched. I only allow it if I have some time to prepare myself first.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
033	What?! Aw, man! Fine... But be prepared for next time!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0012
034	Oh, right! In celebration of our newfound friendship, I'll treat you to some water lizard dishes!
035	What? Erm... Lizards, you say? I... Well, if that's what you want, Milis...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0025
036	Of course! It's delicious! Especially when roasted whole. Mmm...	VO_milis.milis_sys_0004
037	Urk... Milis, I... I am afraid that I might have to respectfully decline...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0018
