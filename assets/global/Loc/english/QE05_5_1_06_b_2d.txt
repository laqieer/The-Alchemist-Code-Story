001	The Liberation Army left their stronghold?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0006
002	They are headed straight towards this arboreal altar. What will you do?
003	Hmph, my forces are now innumerable. The Liberation Army is of no concern, but...	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0005
004	He would not send the soldiers to their deaths. Kamui...what are you planning?
005	What?! You want to procure a shipment of lime? At a time like this?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
006	We need as much as possible. Do you happen to have any leads as to where we might find some?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
007	Well, we use it for farming, building, and even art...so there is a large stock of it in the warehouse, but...
008	What do you need lime for? You planning on making incendiary grenades?
009	Hey! The evac ship is leaving! Are you coming or not?!
010	Aw, snap! Fine, fine! Take what you need! I'll be charging you later for what's used, got it?!
011	Not a problem! We owe you one!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0034
012	Kamui!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
013	Tina! How's your end going?
014	Yeah, I found a merchant willing to give some away. It was apparently just slowing them down as they're trying to get out of here.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
015	Perceptive merchants are foreseeing a major loss if they linger in this country too long. They're fleeing like there's no tomorrow.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
016	With the royal capital in the state it's in, it can't be helped. This is good for us.
017	Logi, I'll need you to get the Blue Tongues to carry as much lime as they can out of this warehouse and deliver it to the Liberation Army.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
018	Got it!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
019	But...this is a lot more than I expected. You're saying that heat treating this will make quicklime?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
020	It might take some time.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
021	It will. We'll be needing temperatures well over a thousand degrees.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
022	Even searching for a facility that can treat this much lime would cost us precious time.
023	Then what are we to do?
024	We're going to have to resort to desperate measures.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
025	H-huh?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
026	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0032
027	Wha—?! No, wait, wait, wait, wait!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0028
