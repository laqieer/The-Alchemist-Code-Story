001	Whew. We managed to drive the monsters back.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
002	Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_b
003	Nngh... The wind is getting stronger! Now not only can I not see, but I can barely move!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
004	The Cursed Beast must be causing this storm!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
005	Nimul, what should we do? If this continues...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
006	We have no choice. We must use the Matter.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
007	What?! We need that to seal the Cursed Beast of Gluttony!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
008	That is exactly why we must use it now! We must test it, and it had better be before this ship gets any closer to the Cursed Beast!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
009	This ship is absolutely indispensable in traveling between the Belt Regions.
010	We must do something before it takes anymore damage!
011	Orb of Si Xiang the Protector! Hear our cry! Lend your strength to this blade!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
012	Huzzaaaaah!
013	Did the blade's light reach the Cursed Beast?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
014	A torrent of magil...this must mean...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
015	Groooogghhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0020
016	Th-this... Ngh... Matter of the swirling winds above! Save us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
017	Huh?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
018	Agh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0022
019	Tch!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
020	Nimul! Waginau! Yna!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0028
021	Oh! Their magil response has been confirmed! They're still alive!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
022	I can't understand it, though. Despite that huge wave of magil, it doesn't seem like the Cursed Beast has been affected at all!
023	I have to go out there!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
024	Emmel?! Where are you going?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
025	They must have been hurt! I have to use my Spiritbonding to heal them!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
026	And...I am the Vessel of Purification. There is a possibility that I can do something to stop the Cursed Beast as well!
027	Calm down! If you go out like this, you'll just be another target for the Cursed Beast to destroy!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0014
028	When you stopped that dragon, you could barely even stand!
029	If you fall here, who is going to save the Gula Belt Region of Gluttony?!
030	I... But what can we do?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
031	I'll force the engine to fire up again and get the ship moving.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
032	If we do that, maybe we can distract the Cursed Beast long enough to give Nimul and the others a chance to strike back!
033	What? But earlier you said—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
034	Like I said, I'm going to force it! But it'll strain the power reactor, and the repairs that'll be needed to fix it will be way more comprehensive.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
035	Still, it's better than just sitting here and watching them die, right?!
036	All right. So first we'll need to—
037	Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0021
038	Yikes! Here it comes...
039	Is it...looking at us?
040	Emmel! Watch out!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
041	Nngh... Yna, Waginau...are you all right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
042	Yes...somehow.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
043	It shattered my sword...with only its roar.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
044	How can this be? With the magil intensity of something like Matter, my plan ought to have worked.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
045	We should have been able to break through the Cursed Beast's barrier of corruption!
046	Was I mistaken? Then all of the sacrifices we've made, everything that I have done up till now...was it all...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
047	...
048	The Cursed Beast...is looking at the ship?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
049	Wait! No! Stop!
050	Grrrrrr...	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0003
051	Emmel!
052	Uhh...? Is it not going to attack?
053	My, my! Adaleigh, how could you? You've changed since the last time I saw you! Pushing a woman down like that—I didn't know you had it in you!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
054	Give him a break, Mira. Adaleigh is a man, after all. Er, not that I would know anything about that...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
055	Wh-what? I know those voices!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
056	Adaleigh, are they...friends of yours?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
057	Hey there, Adaleigh! It's been a while! Who's this lovely lady? Nice to meet you!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
058	I'm Mira, a Space-Time Manipulation apprentice!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
059	And I'm her younger brother, Nyx.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
060	Oh, I'm⁠—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
061	Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_b
062	Whoops! Did we come at a bad time?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0035
063	Get ready, Nyx! Spin that magil!
064	Yeah, yeah... Space-Time Manipulation: Anti-Curse Reignition! Preparing to reconnect to space!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0038
065	Time is finite!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0032
066	Yet also infinite! Libra has granted us control! Spin your magil round and round!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0032
067	The Cursed Beast's attack...was stopped?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
068	Intensity lowered! Hm. Guess that's about all that can be expected from a prototype.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
069	True. Worked well enough to give us a chance to get away, though!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
070	Yep! Unless you've got a better idea?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
071	I've got nothing! Shall we get out of here? C'mon, you two! You'll want to hold on to me pretty tightly!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
072	Wh-what?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
073	You're planning to jump?! But...we've got friends outside, too!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
074	Don't worry! Our teacher's got them well in hand!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
075	Nngh... Mira...I can't hold this for much longer! Hurry!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
076	Aw, Nyx. I thought you were made of sterner stuff than this! All right, time to get this going!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
077	Coordinates confirmed, jump initiated! Uh-oh. Too far? Hm. This might be a little tough for me on my own!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
078	Mira... Come on...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0026
079	Just a moment! I'm going to borrow a little more magil from Libra!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0014
080	All right, activation complete! Let's get outta here!
081	What is this? The reality before me is...becoming twisted?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
082	Time to go home! Ready or not, here we come!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
083	It stopped the Cursed Beast's attack? What was that?! Is Emmel okay?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
084	Not very smart, hm? Come, my apprentices have already jumped to safety.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
085	Tsk... This is what I get for being curious, I suppose. I sensed the magil of someone I remembered, and ended up in the middle of a battle! Ridiculous.
086	...
087	Is that...a child?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
088	Ha! Foolish boy. You're showing your immaturity by judging someone before you've even gotten to know the first thing about them.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
089	Foolish boy?!
090	Er...excuse me. Miss? Who are you?
091	Well, you're a little more clever than the rest, aren't you?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
092	Let's save the introductions for later. Other ice beasts will be headed this way, drawn by the corruption of the Cursed Beast.
093	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
094	Ngh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
095	Better to run and fight another day, don't you think? What, you don't trust me?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
096	Well, not that I don't understand where you're coming from, but...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
097	The way I see it, your options are to either come with me and live, or become the prey of these creatures and likely not. Which will it be, gentlemen?
098	I have no intention of dying here!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
099	Of course not. Are we agreed?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
100	We are.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
101	Naturally!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
102	Good, good. You mustn't give up just because things grew a little difficult. That would be beyond foolish. Now...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
103	I suppose I don't mind helping you out a little.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
