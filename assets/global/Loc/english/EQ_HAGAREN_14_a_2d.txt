001	The Gate...is closing...! My... No! This body...fails me as well...
002	You humans... You always ruin everything! Don't think I will forget this...!	VO_pride.pride_battle_0022
003	Oh, good. We...won. The Dimensional Gate...is closed. What...a...relief...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
004	Toritoh? Toritoh! Stay with me! They didn't drain your soul, did they?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
005	No...but I seem to have...used up all of my strength... It's fine. This...is what I wanted.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
006	We have only known each other a short time...but it has truly been a blessing... At least...I still have my soul, if nothing else...
007	Toritoh, no! What was the point in everything we've done until now if we can't even be together after all this?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
008	I'm sorry, Edgar...and thank you. This time that I've spent with all of you...is very precious to me.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0018
009	With the people of this world...with Alphonse, and the people from Amestris, and...of course...with you, Edgar. You...
010	Toritoh!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
011	Toritoh... Edgar...	VO_riza.riza_sys_0018
012	There's nothing I can say that could make this any easier for you. Toritoh... You did well. As did you, Edgar.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0035
013	We won't forget this. This world, this moment, these people...and Toritoh, especially.	VO_riza.riza_sys_0002
014	Lieutenant, Colonel... Thank you. Oh... She's...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
015	Oh, I see... Her soul is using the closing Gate to return to her own world, so this transmuted body is no longer needed.
016	Edgar, wish we could've stayed longer, but I'm glad we met!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0004
017	Thank you. Goodbye, everyone. Alphonse...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
018	I feel like I've known all of you forever. I'm sorry to think that we may never meet again once the Gate is closed.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
019	Don't think like that. I believe that we are connected now and always will be, even if the Gate is closed.
020	We might make it back here again, if you ever need us...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0007
021	...to fight by your side...as if we never left.
022	Toritoh...too.
023	Wait, what? What are you talking about, Alphonse?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
024	Hey, Al! If the Gate closes, we won't be able to go back!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0001
025	Got it, Ed! Well... Goodbye for now, Edgar.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0004
026	H-hey! What do you mean...? He's gone.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
027	Ha. They're gone. That's a relief.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
028	I didn't want them to see me cry. Kids shouldn't have to watch a man cry. Right, Toritoh...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
029	Oh... Well, I have to believe that Toritoh's spirit will always be with me.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
030	So, Toritoh...let's do all the things, eat all the things, and meet all the people you always wanted to.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
031	We can take my bike, and I'll show you this whole, wide world!
