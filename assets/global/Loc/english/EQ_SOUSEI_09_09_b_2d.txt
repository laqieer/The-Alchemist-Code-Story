001	So Bianca failed and left things here to him, did she?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0005
002	How inspiring to see them refuse to give up! Makes me almost want to follow them.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0009
003	Father...
004	There you two rascals are! How glad I am that my dying breath wasn't wasted on you.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
005	The plans of the Infinite Serpent have failed. You don't have to do this anymore.
006	Do what, exactly?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
007	Let's help Emmel and the others, Father. In Superbia Belt, they still honor your name.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
008	What we should do now is lend them a hand!
009	No. That is not the path I have chosen to walk.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0039
010	Father!
011	Daughter, our paths have already diverged. I have chosen a world where humans are little more than puppets, and you have chosen the humans themselves.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0020
012	We are no longer on the same side. I reject your proposition.
013	Fa...ther...
014	Ugh! You're so stubborn!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
015	Tsk, tsk. You really are nothing like me, Helene. So emotional.
016	I...
017	But you, my beloved child! You did well. You are free to do as you wish, and follow whomever you wish.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
018	You say that so lightly.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
019	Our human lives are much shorter than yours. That's why we're willing to bet a whole lifetime on faith alone. There's no time to see every alternative through.
020	Yet now you're telling me to just...throw all of that faith away?!
021	Throw it away? I said nothing of the sort!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0003
022	...
023	You are more than welcome to hold true and tight to your faith.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
024	But if you should determine it a waste of your time, there is nothing holding you to it. You are unbound now.
025	...I'm free, you mean.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
026	Yes.
027	Then this is what I choose to do, of my own free will!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0045
028	Ignacio?!
029	Of course it is.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
030	Goodbye, Father.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
