001	Where is he? Where's my brother?	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
002	Wratharis - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization
003	This blood... It looks like there's a trail of it, leading deep into the ruins.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0021
004	What is going on?
005	Your brother's star has sunk to the depths of the river of rage, leaving its light scrambled upon the surface.
006	The river of rage? Does that mean...Wratharis?
007	Upriver lies the source of the star stream itself. It lies still, with open maw.
008	The source of the...star stream?
009	The ancient capital, tied to the forbidden art.
010	The forbidden art? Alchemy? The ancient...?
011	Wait! Does this mean that there are ruins in Wratharis like the ones in Slothstein?
012	Eventually, your brother's star will be drawn spiraling into the center and engulfed...
013	Taken to the place of the sealed.
014	My brother is...in here?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
015	Wait!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
016	Tch! Are you still following me?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
017	Yeah, and I'll be sticking to you like glue for as long as it takes to get you to quit while you're ahead!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
018	This is a very unwelcome favor.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
019	What are you doing here, anyway? Your brother wouldn't—	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
020	The stars guided me here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
021	This isn't the time or place for jokes! Now get out of here.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0015
022	I will not.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0040
023	Albea.
024	If I don't see him now, I'll never get to see him again.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
025	Somehow, I... I just know that to be true.
026	Albea, I...!
027	Will!
028	Mira?! Where have you been this whole time?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
029	Run!
030	What? What's going on?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
031	Hurry! You've gotta get out of the ruins!
032	I won't let you get in my way, either, Mira!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
033	No, no, no! That's not what I'm doing!
034	Nng?!
035	What's that sound?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
036	Something's coming!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
037	Wait a minute, could this be...?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0026
038	It is! It's those things you were researching in the lab in Slothstein, Will!
039	Grroogh... Rrroooohh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0021
040	Wh-what are they?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0021
041	Demonic Soldiers!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
042	Grrrroooaaaarrrr!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
043	Who would activate them?!
044	Demonic Soldiers?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
045	They're weapons of destruction, much like the Demons I told you about.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
046	There still hasn't been a thorough expedition into these ruins in Wratharis or the ones in Slothstein, but...
047	It is believed that if the Demons are weapons of mass destruction, then that makes these Demonic Soldiers weapons designed for slaughter.
048	(The Alchemia powering them... I feel like I know it.)
049	(No, it's more than that... Why is it so familiar?!)
050	Raaaaah! Rraaaaahh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
051	(This can only mean that their power is comparable to that of the Cursed Beasts!)
052	Run! Get out of here!
053	Run? And go where?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
054	Anywhere! Just wait until this all blows over!
055	I've waited long enough.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
056	I'm tired of waiting!
057	Albea?!
058	I've always gotten rid of problems as they come up!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
059	Why are you—?!
060	I think you know.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
061	Huh?
062	You have a little brother, don't you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
063	You said that he's your only family.
064	I do, and I understand—but still!
065	I'm sorry.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0035
066	I'm a little hardheaded.
067	...
068	You can run if you want to.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
069	You know I won't.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
070	You said you're neither friend nor foe to me, right? You said you don't know anything about my brother, right?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
071	That's what I said.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
072	Then you have no reason to stay here and fight.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
073	I also made a bet.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
074	What did you wager?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
075	Life itself.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
076	On what?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0006
077	Hmm... Brotherhood?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
078	...
079	Heh.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
080	That's so cheesy.
081	Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
082	I get that a lot.
083	Grrrroooaaaarrrr!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
084	(Such strong convictions.)
085	(They are so determined to march into the future...)
086	(Even though they can't see what lies ahead.)
087	(If this is to be our future...)
088	(I have to know.)
089	(I have to know that the battles we fought... That the lives my friends sacrificed... That the end of our world, our history, our Alchemy...)
090	(I have to know that it wasn't all for nothing!)
091	(I have to see that our past can be entrusted to this future!)
092	(No matter how cruel reality may be...)
093	(I can't turn my eyes away from it.)
094	I'm going to go see my brother.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1007
095	I won't let you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
096	(If you can find some small sliver of hope in the absolute despair brought on by the flow of time...)
097	I'm going to him.
098	Even so, what I need is for you to live.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
099	(Then time just might ally itself with you.)
100	(All I can do...is pray.)
101	I'm not going to die.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
102	Dang straight.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
103	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
104	Because I'm going with you, to ensure your safety.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
105	Oh!
106	Well, if you insist.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0041
107	Just this once! Don't get used to it!
