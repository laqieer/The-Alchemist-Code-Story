001	Are you telling me...you're dead?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
002	I underwent...a very strange...experiment.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
003	Since then, the idea of life or death no longer applied to my body.
004	Experiment...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
005	The Door of Truth. Half of my life...was cast to the other side of it.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
006	The Door of Truth...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
007	An attachment to life...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
008	Having been raised as an assassin...if you look at it the other way, he has seen more of life and death than anyone.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
009	He continues to search for the meaning of human life.
010	Are you telling me his attachment with life is what led to the experiment succeeding?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
011	Yes. The world behind the Door of Truth that consumes everything...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
012	In contrast to that...he possessed an attachment to life that is not tied down to this world.
013	That twin power of Fung Liu balanced each other out, miraculously resulting in his survival.
014	So you're saying that, because Fung Liu confronted life more than anyone, he was able to return to life?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
015	Hmm. And you lot robbed the idea of life and death from such a man...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
016	Honestly, I am rendered speechless by the outrageousness of you from the Corpse.
017	It's difficult to believe that you work within the shadows of the Holy Guard which advocates absolute justice.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
018	Heheh. I'll take your words...as that of the highest praise.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
019	Ack! So you sacrificed half your life to obtain an immortal body?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
020	In other words, you transformed yourself into half a phantom soldier!
021	It appears that's the case. That being said...I find myself more surprised by you.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0031
022	What do you mean?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
023	You have managed to obtain the power of darkness...without having paid a price. That's phenomenal.
024	The world beyond the Door of Truth attempts to consume everything.
025	Your attachment to this world appears to overturn that power.
026	My attachment to this world...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
027	Kudan!
028	...!
029	It is extremely unstable, but you embody it.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
030	I am extremely curious to what that is.
031	You didn't have anyone you wanted to protect?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
032	Someone I wanted to protect...?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0025
033	There were those I was supposed to protect...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0009
034	But they were sacrificed because of my lack of power. I guess you could say that the one I wish to protect now symbolizes the debt that I owe the others I could not save.
035	Are you telling me that this person you're supposed to protect is the light that keeps you attached to this world?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0044
036	That's right...! Back then, Zain said that my technique succeeded!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
037	There's still a chance that Kagura is alive!
038	I need to protect her from those who want to take advantage of her!
039	You're regaining your power again! The existence of the one you need to protect is giving you power!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0027
040	What about me? Is there someone that I should protect?
041	I'm wasting time here. I'm gonna go and talk with Orion.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
042	...Clear off.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_1014
043	I have a...mission. All I need to do is execute that!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0021
044	Huh?!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0025
045	...Hey.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
046	Yes, Emperor!
047	Kudanstein will be here soon. Prepare to welcome him.
048	Yes, Emperor!
049	I don't understand. Do you full grasp the power of Prototype 0?	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
050	Hmph. Fung Liu is nothing more than a distraction.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
051	A distraction...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
052	A regular knight may be stopped by Fung Liu, but Kudanstein won't be stopped that easily.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
053	Do you think I would have an eye on someone of that degree?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
054	... ...
055	What...?!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0028
056	You're strong...as an emotionless human weapon, I doubt they are many individuals who can compare to you.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
057	Ack!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0029
058	That being said, there's no way you can beat me.
059	After all, you don't have a reason to fight.
060	Do you mean...?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
061	Yes. I'm talking about someone you want to protect.
062	There's a reason why that I cannot lose! My mission in life does not simply consist of annihilating my opponent in front of me!
063	Agh...!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0019
064	Right now, you're nothing more than a weapon that devotes itself to fighting.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_1002
065	How can I lose to a husk like you with no will of your own!
066	I...I'm...a husk?! ...Hwooooohhh!!!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0008
067	If you're going to blame anything than blame your life that's drained you of all emotions! It's high time you reconsider your priorities!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
068	Aghh!!! Ug...ugh! ...Uckkk!!!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0022
069	That's right. You're not capable of dying. If you want to attack me again then go on. I'll take you down as many times as you want.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
070	Ugh...I-I'm not finished yet! I defeat the enemy in front of me...that's all. That's the meaning of my existence!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0029
071	Hwaaaahhh!!!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0009
072	No, it's over. You've lost to his powerful determination.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
073	You...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
074	Having fought against him, I'm sure you know that he's not your average knight.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
075	I can't imagine this strong determination of his ever being depleted. Don't you think so?
076	... ...
077	No matter how much you challenge him, you'll never be able to beat him now.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
078	More importantly...I think it might also be fun to see how far this guy can go.
079	Don't be an idiot. If you're gonna follow me then hurry up.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
080	Got it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0038
081	Let me give you one piece of advice.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
082	...Advice?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
083	Even if you have someone that you need to protect...it doesn't change the fact that you're in a state of instability.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
084	If you don't want to fall into the darkness...you shouldn't try to seek any more power.
085	Hmph. Unfortunately, my determination will never be depleted. Let's go.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
086	Kudanstein...
