001	Oh! It's Captain Vettel! We are truly grateful for your protection!
002	Thank you. We'll do our best not to lose!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0034
003	With you here, Captain Vettel, you add the strength of 100 men!
004	Right. Let's do our best!
005	Captain Vettel is so lovely! Wha...eeek?! A-a bee! There's a bee flying about! Someone...Captain Vettel, please drive it away!
006	M-my apologies...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
007	Right now, there are soldiers calling to me over there, so I must hurry. You there, please take care of this young lady!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0035
008	Understood, Captain!
009	Ohhh, Captain Vettel!
010	Phew. Jeez.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
011	That's one of the only things I can't handle.
012	Ah, if it isn't Captain Vettel.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0006
013	Dilga...!
014	Is something the matter? You look pale.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
015	Oh, no, I'm all right. Please do not bother yourself with me. I am just a little tired.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
016	Hmm. I guess even Captain Vettel can accumulate fatigue after such a rigorous regiment. Please do take care of yourself.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0045
017	You're right. It's not good to push oneself too hard. We must keep our body and mind sound in order to protect the people when it becomes necessary.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
018	Well said, Captain Vettel. I have nothing to add to your words.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0007
019	However, if you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to tell me.
020	My offer extends to outside of the battlefield as well. Age is the one thing I have an advantage over you.
021	Thank you, Dilga. I'll keep that in mind.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
022	See you on the battlefield then.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0030
023	Dilga is quite reliable.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
024	But that's one thing that I can't discuss with him...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
