001	You again... You just keep meddling in everything, don't you?
002	We don't need another woman of your...talents, in the house.
003	Why? Because they've already got you?
004	I've heard worse.
005	Oh, I'm sure words won't hurt you. This, however...
006	(Her dagger... It's glowing like that greatsword!)
007	(This means...)
008	Agares... I give unto thee a bouquet of red for the taking.
009	Deliver unto the heavens this piteous woman, and cleanse her of her sins!
010	The glinting dagger Agares floats under the ashen moon, its tip glowing red-hot from latent energies.
011	A silver chain whips forth with a life of its own, poised to ensnare.
012	Shion!!
013	Ahhh!!
014	Asuka?!
015	Asuka, no!
016	The crimson flowing over my beloved sister, staining her body red, red, red.
017	Asuka laid motionless before me, those cruel silver chains glinting in the moonlight with her lifeblood...
018	Ahh... Asuka...
019	Asuka? What's—
020	No... NO!
021	AGHH!!
022	Sloppy work, Zheng Yi...
023	You're wide open!
024	Ugh!
025	I believe this farce has gone on long enough...
026	Master.
027	All yours for the taking.
028	Nicely done.
029	So. You're the little bird, aren't you?
030	Never thought you'd be a pretty little thing, though I suppose it helps.
031	Tch. And she calls me a harlot.
032	Can I have her, then?
033	I want to hear every song this little birdie can sing.
034	A symphony for my Master it shall be.
035	Asuka... Asuka...!
036	Shion... My beloved brother.
037	You have to run.
038	No. I won't.
039	I won't leave you and Zheng Yi here.
040	So long as I am still here, our house yet lives.
041	At the very least, they will keep Lord Zheng Yi alive. They have to...or the secrets of Atropos die with him.
042	Please, Shion.
043	You are our last line of communication with Soren and the others.
044	If Goetia catches them off guard, all will be lost.
045	Do what you must, my dear brother. Whatever they're after...they must not have it.
046	...
047	Running? Foolish.
048	You'll have to get past us.
049	Cover Lady Shion's escape!
050	Grr... If you're so willing to die, then so be it!
051	I'll have your bodies fuel your masters' pyres!
052	I heard the shrill cries of our loyal retainers on the wind as I ran.
053	Their voices, along with my sister's and her beloved, would come to haunt me for a long time...
054	But I swore, then, that no matter what happened, I would be back.
055	And I would have Li Wang answer for his crimes.
