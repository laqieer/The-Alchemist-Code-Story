001	That strength...it's no ordinary monster. We have no choice, but to temporarily fall back...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
002	Get out of my way!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
003	With just one blow, he destroyed that monster we were struggling against...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0020
004	You came at the perfect time. After you take care of all the bandits, clean this up as well.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
005	Did he take out all the bandits on his own? Wait...no, please a moment, Sir Dias!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0021
006	Stop following me.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
007	As much as it hurts to admit, his ability with the sword is the real thing. Furthermore, his calmness and stability in dealing with that monster...could Sir Dias be a hero for the ages?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
008	I'm home, Yuffie...sorry I haven't been back in a while.
009	I want to make a more beautiful tomb, not something as simple as this. Just give me a little more time.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0035
010	I must've been getting carried away, having made a new brother and sister. Because of that, I'd forgotten...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
011	The world is a hopelessly distorted place tainted with despair.
012	But don't worry. My eyes are finally open. No longer do I dream some naive fantasy.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0050
013	Yuffie, when I come next time, the world will be different. I will create a world of peace where everyone can live happily.
014	Brother!
015	?! ...You're the child who was caught by the bandits.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	Um...thank you. This is for you.
017	This small, blue flower...is it a begonia? Do you know the language for this flower?	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
018	For this? Um...I think it was "I forgive all."
019	Forgive...I see. Thank you.
020	(...It's a flower far removed from my own life. Yuffie, why this flower...?)
021	Thank you for saving that child. May god shine down on you, Sir Paladin.
022	Stop!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
023	Sir...?
024	Do not pray to god! Prayer will not save anyone.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
025	If you have time to be praying, then work towards obtaining the power to change this twisted world. That is the only thing you need to survive.
026	O-okay...understood.
027	Who would've thought you'd come home in two days. You also seem quite refreshed.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0044
028	Who knows. So? You obtained some information regarding the Sacred Stones, didn't you?
029	That can wait. Rejoice, Dias. You have been officially appointed Captain of the 4th Regiment.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
030	Me, a Captain? Well, that's a rather shallow endeavor you've got going there, Gabirond.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
031	What did you say?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
032	It's pointless to try to use that title to shackle me down. I realized this during my assault on the bandits.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
033	I will move on my own. It's more efficient.
034	If you become a captain, you will be given command and authority over an entire battalion. It'll become much easier to search for the Sacred Stones.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0001
035	That would be one thing if each Paladin equaled in skill to that of Bertrand, but Paladins these days...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
036	Does such a knight even exist?
037	The Peacekeepers did nothing more than get in my way.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
038	I much prefer the alternative of searching for the Sacred Stones on my own.
039	Wait, Dias! Do you think I would allow such insubordination?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
040	Allow? Who is commanding who?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
041	What are you saying? I am the commander of the Corpse.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0030
042	I see. Then it's just a matter of switching the head of the Corpse.
043	Gabirond, if you die, the Holy Order will send in a new commander for the Corpse, correct?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
044	For me, it doesn't matter who it is.
045	You take advantage of my power. If so, then make sure you're providing me with enough value that equals this.
046	You can either die here and now, or you can let me remain on my own. As commander of the Corpse, the choice is yours.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
047	... ...
048	Just don't shirk your period reports.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0017
049	Yeah, I won't.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
050	What's with those eyes?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0016
051	Such emotions as anger, hatred, sadness, impatience, and fear are easy to manipulate.
052	He was supposed to be a tool that easily expressed such emotions.
053	However, he was looking at me the way one would look at the gravel on the side of the road. What is going on?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0021
054	Ack. Something bad may be brewing beneath the surface. Just in case, I'll report to Lord Dario.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
055	Please wait, Sir Dias!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
056	You're from the Peacekeepers... Is there something you want to say to me?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
057	Your victory over the bandits was highly impressive. We wanted to apologize for our earlier rude remarks.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
058	Moving forward, we of the Holy Guard will follow you without hesitation.
059	It appears that we will be joining your troops.
060	Please, we humbly ask that you let us serve as your troops.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
061	Sir Dias...?
062	I'll act on my own. There is no longer...any whom I trust to have my back.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
063	Sir Dias?! Please wait, Sir Dias!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
064	(What simplistic animals. However, that is the nature of man. To clamor to the power stronger than your own.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
065	(That is why I must obtain absolute power.)
066	(Only by ruling with absolute power can the world be changed. I will fulfill the promise that I made them.)
067	(Agatha...this time I will follow through. I will protect you.)
068	(Logi...if your naive self were to see me like this, you would look me straight in the eye and try to stop me.)
069	(Yes. You can come at me whenever you want to, but you will never be able to stop me.)
070	(To fix this distorted world...I will gather the Sacred Stones and obtain absolute power!)
