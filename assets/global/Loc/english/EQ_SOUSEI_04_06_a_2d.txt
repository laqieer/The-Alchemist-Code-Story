001	Has Nimul really been corrupted?! Seriously?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
002	Adaleigh...
003	Eulalia is doing what she can to purify the corruption, but...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
004	"Those who have succumbed to corruption can never return to what they were." That's what she said, wasn't it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
005	Yes. That is the conclusion that generations of Sephira reached after countless failures to change the inevitable...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
006	This means that Nimul's already...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0021
007	C'mon, Nyx! Don't say such a thing!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0020
008	Seriously. Seriously?! We finally figure out how to defeat the Cursed Beasts and set off to save their homeland, and then this happens?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
009	...
010	I...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
011	I...failed Nimul when he needed me most.
012	If only I were stronger... No, why didn't I shield his body with my own?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
013	Waginau...
014	Are you all friends of Nimul?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
015	Eulalia! How is he doing?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
016	He is stable at the moment, but the corruption is still eating at his body...
017	No matter how much of my powers of purification I use on him, I can't stop it...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0018
018	How much longer do you think he has?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
019	At most, until sunrise tomorrow. After that, I think Nimul will...
020	...become a Sinner.
021	And there is no way we can heal him?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
022	Well...
023	You mean, there is? Let's do it! Anything is better than this!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
024	Perhaps...? No. This method is perhaps too extreme...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
025	Eulalia, what are you talking about?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
026	Those who have succumbed to corruption can never return to what they were. Not... Not in this life, at least.
027	Wait, you don't mean...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
028	The Reincarnation Ritual. To save Nimul, at this point this is the only way. That is what I believe.
029	But our priestess, Emmel, isn't here...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0040
030	That is fine. I can perform the rites. I know them all, same as she does.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0039
031	But—!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
032	Hey, hey! What the heck's going on here? Someone care to break it down for us?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
033	Reincarnation... I've heard that word somewhere before.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
034	In the Avaritia Belt Region, death is not the certain end.
035	"Reincarnation" in this world means that all people repeat the cycle of life and death.
036	I assume you are referring to a ceremony that facilitates something similar?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
037	Yes, but there is a slight difference. In this case we want to make sure the target is revived in their original form.
038	Let me explain...
039	In our land of Sephiron, this ceremony is performed if someone who must not die has been inflicted with injuries too dire for healing...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
040	It is a ritual that calls forth the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg, and uses the magil of Dragons...
041	Nidhogg...? You mean...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
042	Correct. To perform that ritual, we need a priestess who is a Vessel, and the power of the Guardian Dragon!
043	If we perform it with only one person, we cannot know how effective it will be...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
171	But I do know that if you try to perform such a thing, there is no guarantee that you will live!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
172	Do you think that Nimul would have wanted anyone to give up their life for him?
044	It is fine. I will not die.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
045	How can you be sure?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
046	Here we have a priestess, remains of Nidhogg, and Matter created from crystallized souls...
047	In this sacred place, the spirits of this land will lend me their power.
048	Will you trust me?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
049	I...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
050	Waginau!
051	Adaleigh...
052	I don't want Nimul to die. Seeing him become a Sinner is even worse...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
053	If there's a chance to avoid that, I want to try it. You really want that too, don't you, Waginau?
054	I...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
055	I trust you! Nimul spoke so highly of you, Eulalia!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
056	For him to praise you like that means that you're someone who we can trust to do this. It will be fine! Definitely!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
057	I feel the same as Mira. I'm sure that Nimul wouldn't want to become a Sinner like this.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
058	Mira... Nyx...
059	Is there anything we need for the ritual?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
060	Yna...
061	My apologies for my unwillingness to accept reality, but it's too difficult for me to accept losing a friend such as Nimul.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0035
062	I want to do everything I can to help.
063	I see... All of you are right.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
064	I wish to fight alongside Nimul again...
065	Thank you, everyone. We don't need anything else to prepare for the ceremony, though. As I said, we already have all we need right here.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
066	There's just one thing. For the duration of the ritual, neither Nimul nor I can move from this holy place.
067	You mean we have to hold down the fort, right? We should prepare in case any more Sinners attack.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
068	Then there is much for us to do. The enemy has already discovered this place, correct?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
069	I think so. If that lady comes back, it'll be a problem for sure.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
070	She came here using by manipulating space, didn't she? We can prepare for that.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
071	Yep! Just leave all the Space-Time matters up to me and Nyx!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
072	Actually, we had a pretty poor showing before... We better do better this time around or Ambrosia will somehow find out and scold us to death!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
073	Just imagining it gives me the shivers... We absolutely can't mess this up.	VO_nix.nix_sys_1017
074	Yeah!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
075	So, it's settled! I'll make sure to unload the Engineer Soldiers from the airship...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
076	Ah... Lady Eulalia!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
077	Oh! What happened? You're injured...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
078	I'm sorry... But we need your help!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0035
079	Calm yourself, warrior of the Sephira! Settle down and report what happened.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
080	Lord Waginau? You've really returned! That is a relief!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
081	A short while ago, the temporary settlement in the desert was attacked by swarms of Sinners.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0021
082	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
083	We are defending ourselves with all we have available, but against their numbers our lines will surely fall...
084	At this rate, we can only last one more day or so.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
085	And until this point, Sinner attacks have been haphazard, and not necessarily targeting people.
086	Yet these Sinners moved and acted as if they were trained as a military force!
173	Soldiers? That's right, Julia was...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
174	Ugh... But now...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
087	For this to happen right as we have to perform the ritual...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
088	It's as if they predicted that this happen...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
089	But there is no way that we can just let those in the desert weather this alone.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
090	Not in spirit, and not in force.
091	Are you expecting me to make this decision?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
092	It was Nimul that brought us this far. We were all supported by his conviction.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
093	But now that Nimul is unable to lead, we need someone else to do so in his place.
094	The most appropriate person for this is the person who has followed Nimul longer than anyone... That is what I believe, at least.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
095	I have no objection. Even back in Acedia, Waginau's leadership was top-notch!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
096	I don't know if I agree... Well, it's better than Nyx could do.
097	Anything's better than being commanded by Mira. All her orders are nonsense.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
098	...
099	...
100	Well, ahem, seems like we're all on the same page. Is it too heavy a burden?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
101	Ah...
102	So many are looking to me for direction... This is my first experience with that.
103	When I think about it, I was always behind Nimul, offering him support. I believed that was my life.
104	So I don't have the same conviction.
105	The resolve to save our home; to overcome the world...
106	Nor have I fangs sharpened for revenge against a world that treats its people as dispensable.
107	I can't match that same steel-tempered passion and single-mindedness in purpose to defeat the Cursed Beasts.
108	I only have the obligations I have always had as a man of Sephira. I always admired Nimul and his fierce pursuit of his ideals.
109	But to have Nimul taken away from us; the man who led us this far...
110	What I have isn't determination, nor is it resolve.
111	It was...inertia, wasn't it?
112	Even though the Gula Belt is my home. It is mine to defend.
113	So...!
114	All right. I will take command!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
115	Our goal is to save everyone, in all regions.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
116	(That is what Nimul wanted. So...)
117	Let's head to the desert. I will save as many people as I can!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
118	Okay, that's the plan! Hang tight while I bring the airship over!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
119	We've gotta practice some counter attacks!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
120	We'd better prep Libra. We don't know what might happen.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
121	I will wield my blade as I always do. Will things be fine here without us?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
122	Of course! When the ceremony is completed, Nimul and I will join you all. I promise!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
123	Then you should have this.
124	A bow...?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
125	Nimul and I constructed it using data we collected from our battles with Cursed Beasts. The gear of judgment, Sagittarius.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
126	Even when used with standard arrows, it is quite a capable weapon. Should you need to use it...
127	Thank you!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0034
128	Let's set off.
129	Yes, hurry!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
130	Pitiful. This is the best the warriors of the Sephira have to offer once they've lost the advantage of being on their own soil?
131	Glurrrrrp!!
132	No fear! Press forward! This is the end for us if we let them break us here!
133	Huzzaaaaaaaah!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0006
134	Ah... At this rate, we're...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
135	Pathetic... If this is all, then I shouldn't have even bothered to come myself.
136	...That sound...
137	This is bad! The defenders have been pushed so far back, the Sinners are nearly at the settlement!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
138	We're here to stop that from happening!
139	Mira, Nyx. Is your attack ready?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
140	Yes, but...
141	Waginau, you've got some pretty crazy ideas, you know? It's like you have a bit of Nimul in you now...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
142	Don't say that! Yna, are you ready?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
143	Yes. I am ready to depart at any time.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
144	All right, we're off then. Adaleigh and the others will provide backup from the airship!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
145	Roger! Opening the hatch!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
146	...
147	Oh, he's shaking in his boots.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
148	Mira, that's the kind of thing you politely pretend not to notice.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
149	I'm just preparing myself!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
150	My word...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
151	Ugh... This is...it...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
152	Urk... Yes, we were in a hurry, but perhaps there was a better plan...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
153	S-soldiers attacking from the sky? What in the... Watch out!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
154	Ugh...
155	Gah!
156	That was much worse than I'd had imagined. The wind technique we're using as a buffer is also unstable. That's another worry...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
157	I told you! I'm bad at normal magic!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
158	Anyhow, I've finished setting up the spatial connection with Libra! Now you'll be able to hear us wherever you are!
159	Great. Then... Now, Adaleigh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
160	Roger! Deploying Engineer Soldiers!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
161	Gah!
175	I thought that they'd come, but a surprise aerial attack? However—
162	Despite losing your leader, you still dare to come face us, do you?
163	Yes!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
164	We won't give up yet!
165	Ridiculous. Do you really think you can handle us with your meager forces?
166	Underestimate us and you'll be in trouble. Let's show her the power that felled two Cursed Beasts!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
167	Oh, maybe this will be interesting after all. I accept your challenge!
168	I know her... I know Julia's swordsmanship.
169	I should be able to fight against her. So...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
170	Everyone fall back! I will take over.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
