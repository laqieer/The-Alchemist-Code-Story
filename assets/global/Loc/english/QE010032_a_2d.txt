001	Our strategy is to capture two major Wratharis strongholds. We need to cut off their coordination and their means of escape.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
002	We can't afford to be late. Let's increase our pace.
003	U-um, dad... Why did you make Dias join the Holy Guard?
004	I told you it was necessary to learn Alchemy amongst the seasoned Holy Guard, didn't I?
005	Yes, but then what about me?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
006	You are constantly thinking of protecting others, am I correct?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
007	Yes, that's my intention.
008	Having more power than necessary can cause people to go mad. Dias especially needs to bear this in mind.
009	Of course, my other intention was that he keep an eye on the Holy Guard.
010	An eye?
011	Don't dwell on it. Let's go. We've no time to waste!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
012	Ye-yes, Sir! Dias, do your best!
