001	"Have you ever wanted to die?"
067	Many times.
002	"Have you ever tried to kill yourself?"
003	Many times.
004	"Have you ever wished the opposite—to survive?"
068	Well...
005	Only once.
006	"A miraculous survival, huh? Wow." "Everyone's dead—except her."
007	"The people of Wadatsumi must have something pretty powerful protecting them." "Wish I did."
008	"Not me. You couldn't pay me to be one of them." "I don't even like being on the same team as 'em."
009	"So, the Holy Guard is an organization that uses force to deal with problems caused by Alchemy."
010	"Meanwhile, the inquisitors of the Holy Order of Babel keep watch on the Holy Guard and all others who would misuse Alchemy. They keep them on a leash and everyone else in line."
011	"But what happens if there's a Paladin they can't stop?"
012	"That'd throw 'em for a loop, huh?"
013	"Why won't she die?"
014	"To hear her tell it, she just forgot how."
015	Nothing is more frightening than a human who is unafraid of death.
016	When such a person is also highly proficient at wielding Alchemy, and well-versed in the martial arts of Wadatsumi... That is fearsome indeed.
017	Aw, shucks. You're making me blush, Captain.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0001
018	My apologies. I simply find myself at a bit of a loss for words.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0035
019	There's no right answer. I don't know what it might be, myself.
020	From what I gather, you are incapable of death.
021	Yet nobody knows why. It could be a disease of some sort; it could be magic. Even the Holy Order of Babel has been unable to determine the cause. You yourself claim to have simply forgotten.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
022	...
023	Some suspect that you have made a contract with the darkness. Some within the organization view you as a dangerous entity.
024	To make a contract with the darkness⁠—to receive immense power in exchange for your flesh or senses⁠—is an act so forbidden as to eclipse the taboo of Alchemy.
025	Yeah, so?
026	What?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
027	I don't care what was taken from me. I'm not going to die.
028	Sure, I'm an unknown and my background isn't pretty. The Holy Guard doesn't want my existence going public, but it'd be a waste not to use me.
029	I've heard people whispering about sending me and my powers off on some impossible mission that I'd have no chance of coming back from alive.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
030	To be frank, there are those here who would attempt to use you in such a way. I, however—	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
031	I think that'd be the right thing to do. It'd make things more peaceful.
032	Ikasa...
033	I accept my mission as a Secret Knight.
034	You might not be under my command anymore, but you will always be part of the 4th Regiment.
035	You can come back and rejoin us, anytime.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
036	Thank you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0034
037	I'm really happy to hear that...even though I know I'll never see this place again.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
038	"You're up, Obliviated."
039	Hmph.
040	"Finished putting on your makeup?"
041	Hey! You said you wouldn't peek.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0012
042	Wait, Wadatsumi?!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0025
043	"The prolonged internal conflict incited by the powerful clans of Wadatsumi is dying down."
044	"Yet there are countries who would use this opportunity to threaten the weakened nation."
045	You mean Greed Dike?
046	"They're demanding that Wadatsumi relaxes its restrictions on foreign policy, while secretly laying the groundwork for political sanctions and economic interference."
047	"It's only a matter of time before they declare war. Of course, the general public is being kept in the dark about it all."
048	They're planning to invade!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0019
049	"Maybe, but Greed Dike has a pretty sound pretext for doing so."
050	"When Wadatsumi started opening up to foreign relations, it became clear that they misuse Alchemy within their borders to a shocking degree."
051	"So they plan to justify the invasion by playing it off as a righteous punishment."
052	Tch!
053	"That's where you come in. Your assignment is to get a certain shrine maiden as far away from Wadatsumi as possible."
069	"In its current impoverished state, Wadatsumi doesn't stand a chance against Greed Dike's attack."
054	"It's almost guaranteed that if Greed Dike begins its invasion, Wadatsumi will fall."
055	"That's why our client, clan of the shrine maiden, decided to have its promising shrine maidens flee the country in secret."
056	The Holy Guard cannot act for the benefit of any nation, whether that be Wadatsumi or Greed Dike.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
057	Wadatsumi's misuse of Alchemy has only taken place within the nation's own borders. Its sovereignty protects it from the Holy Guard's judgement.
058	"Exactly. It goes without saying that they can't give the shrine maidens safe harbor after they escape, either. Therefore the only thing the Holy Guard can do is—"
059	Use their Secret Knights.
060	"The Holy Order of Babel would prefer to prevent those shrine maidens, whose powers violate their precious code, from wandering around willy-nilly."
061	"They also want to avoid having Alchemy run rampant in the war with Greed Dike."
062	"That's why the shrine maiden you'll be taking care of is going to be sent overseas on a study trip, without being made aware of the real situation."
063	"If Wadatsumi doesn't get invaded, wonderful. She'll enjoy herself and head back home. This plan is just a precaution, in case war does break out."
064	"If it does, though... Well, you might not make it out alive."
065	Hmph.
066	You know I can't die, right?
