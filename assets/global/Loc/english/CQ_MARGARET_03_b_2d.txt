001	Morning, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
002	G-good morning, Miss Elizabeth.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
003	Oh! You're looking much better. You should be able to start going outside soon!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0045
004	Um, M-Miss Elizabeth? Th-thank you for staying by my side, and...t-taking care of me for the last few days.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
005	It's fine! I'm just trying to get this new medicine to work.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
006	Um...p-please, let me thank you, s-somehow.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
007	I-it's fine, really.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0011
008	(I can't exactly tell her that the side effects were so bad that I was afraid to leave her alone for even a moment.)
009	Besides, you've got a home to go back to soon, right?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
010	I...don't have any family left. I-I'll do anything you want! I-is there anything you would, um, like?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
011	Hmm... What do I want, you wonder? Well...how about a magical cure-all?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0020
012	Ah! Th-that's...um...I... I don't think I can do that! I'm so sorry!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0035
013	Hahahah. Don't worry about it. If I had to name something else I want... Well, that'd be a little sister.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
014	A little sister?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
015	I'm sure that would make Mother happy, too. It would be nice, but—	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
016	All right. I understand.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
017	H-huh?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0025
018	Then...I'm going to call you Lizzy, like I would my own big sis!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_1030
019	L-Lizzy?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_2011
020	I've already injected you with an antidote. You're going to be all right. Now, what happened here?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
021	Wh-what are you doing here?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
022	I thought that I had stumbled across some excellent test subjects when I saw two people lying on the ground, but it turned out to just be you and that suspicious-looking scientist fellow.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
023	You've been working non-stop these past few days, and today you ran off unprepared, without any warning. I was quite worried about you, you know?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
024	I-I'm so sorry. I know I shouldn't have. I caused you trouble again.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0035
025	Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0020
026	L-Lizzy... Um...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
027	What is it?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
028	This is the second time you've had to heal me. I'll do anything you want! Please let me make it up to you!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0011
029	All right then. Please don't make me worry anymore.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
030	Ah...to think that I would end up with such a clueless, clumsy little sister.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
031	Ngh! I-I promise I'll come home safe!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
032	Margaret?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
033	I will find any ingredient you need. I'll even find a magical cure-all if you ask it of me. I'll go anywhere and everywhere for you!
034	I'll make sure I'm prepared, though, by, um...figuring out how to get there first, and, um... Anyway, I won't make you worry about me anymore!
035	I'm going to be a good little sister!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
036	I feel like the conversation has strayed somewhat... Well, in any case, that sounds good. Do your best.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
037	And you can use me for your experiments any time!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
038	That won't be happening.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0039
039	Why not?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0039
040	Make sure you come home safe, all right? I'll be waiting for you.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
041	Got it! You can count on me, Lizzy!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
