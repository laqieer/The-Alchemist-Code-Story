001	Sigh... We're finally through the forest.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0030
002	This place... It seems like we've distanced ourselves from the castle town.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
003	What? Did we get lost in the forest?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
004	Yeah...but we might still be able to make it if we go all the way around!
005	Sigh... So, we have to walk further? I'm exhausted...	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0022
006	Prinny, carry me on your shoulders.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0001
007	Geez, Madam Overlord, I told you already that it's just not possible! You're too heavy...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0012
008	Agh...!	VO_prinny.prinny_battle_0022
009	Hm? That sound...	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
010	Don't worry about it, plip. It's just business as usual.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0001
011	...It would be nice if you were a little worried, dood...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0018
012	Hey, get a grip! Let's hurry on!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0001
013	What's gotten you all cheerful suddenly?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_chara_2001
014	Ah, well, I don't know exactly how to put it. This desolate feeling reminds me of the Netherworld of Scorching Flames!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0031
015	Scorching Flames... Is that your home?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
016	Yep! It's the super ultimate Netherworld ruled by me, the supreme one!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0006
017	Let me see... Well, if the earth was cracked and magma was erupting from it while pillars of flame rose to the skies, it would look even more similar.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0007
018	That description alone pretty much sounds like the opposite of this place.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0022
019	Enough with the minor details!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0004
020	They're not minor at all!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
021	Heheh. For some reason, I have a lot of fun hanging out with all of you.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
022	Really, plip?	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0025
023	Yes!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
024	By the way, route aside, which direction is the castle town?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0001
025	Hmm... All right! I'm gonna climb that rock mountain and take a look!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0031
026	Done!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_battle_0017
027	What? That was incredibly fast... And? Did you see the castle town?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0025
028	I super couldn't see anything!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0006
029	What the...?! You useless muscle-brained monkey!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0012
030	But I did see someone headed this way.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0031
031	A traveler? Perfect. Let's ask for directions to the castle town.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
032	...? Wh-wha...?! De-devils...?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
033	Hey, hey. Calling us devils is super rude! We're Overlords! We live in Netherworlds and rule over demons.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0039
034	Hyaah?! Sp-spare me, please!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
035	What's the point in scaring him?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
036	Ugff...!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_battle_0022
037	Ah-ahh...?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
038	Madam Overlord Seraphina, you're scaring him even more, dood.	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0022
039	Sorry to have frightened you. We're not nearly as suspicious as we look.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0036
040	B-but you're O-Overlords...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
041	Yeah...but, well...	VO_killia.killia_chara_1012
042	A non-suspicious Overlord doesn't sound very persuasive, dood...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0002
043	Huh? I'm Rin. Would you happen to be a peddler?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1009
044	Ye-yes...I am.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
045	A peddler...? You wouldn't happen to have any spices, would you? I'd like to take some off your hands.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
046	M-my sincere apologies! I sell silk fabric, not spices!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
047	Pl-please, just don't take my life!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
048	Don't worry. We're not gonna take your life. I see...so you don't have any.	VO_killia.killia_chara_1012
049	Well, can you tell us how to get to the castle town?
050	What?! The castle town...?! Hold on...you don't plan to invade it...do you?	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
051	No. It's to procure spices.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0027
052	B-but...you're Overlords, right?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
053	Yeah...
054	Sir! Please, let me speak it with him!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0001
055	I'll leave it to you, Rin.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0036
056	Mr. Peddler, how do we get to the castle town?	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
057	A-are you really sure it's all right to say? Um... Well, from here...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
058	Seriously. What is that jabroni scared about?	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0010
059	It's pretty rude, to be honest. We would never even think of invading the castle town.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0016
060	Actually, I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the way you came across...	VO_killia.killia_sys_0030
061	(A hot, steaming curry...)	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0031
062	...Usalia, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0004
063	Huh...?! I was just contemplating why we're alive, where we came from, and where we're going...!	VO_usalia.usalia_chara_1009
064	You're not really interested in road directions, are you, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0022
065	Yes! All right! Thank you, Mr. Peddler!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
066	Well then...
067	Well then, let's hurry to the castle town.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0005
068	Too bad. If that jabroni just now sold spices, he could've sold some to us.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0030
069	Hm?
070	There's no point in mulling over it. You can't make curry out of silk fabric.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0022
071	Oh...just wanted to confirm, Rin. Can you use HL in this world?
072	HL? Is that some kind of money? No, you can't use it here.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0005
073	Right. One more thing... Rin, you wouldn't happen to have any money on you, would you?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0020
074	Nope. Nothing.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
075	Right. Dangit. I can't believe I forgot about something so basic...	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
076	What should we do?! Even if we go to the castle town, without any currency for this world, we won't be able to buy spices!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0020
077	Aaaaaghhhh...!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0026
078	What was that?!	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
079	Wasn't that the jabroni from earlier?	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0004
080	O-oh...he-help...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
081	The peddler is being attacked by a Phantom Solider!	VO_rin.rin_battle_0019
082	Oh dear! Everyone, we must hurry to help him immediately!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0009
083	Wh-what's gotten into you, Sera? It's super out of character for you to suddenly want to help people.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0025
084	You muscle-brain. He's a peddler, right?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
085	I'm sure, if we help him...he'll give us a bit of money!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0010
086	Ac-actually, that's a super plan!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0026
087	Pl-please, help him regardless of profit!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
088	Let's put monetary profit aside for now and prioritize his rescue, plip!	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0003
089	All right! The supreme one is on his way!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_battle_0018
090	Sir Killia! Please, hurry!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0012
091	W-wait...! I'm in the middle of Mushroom Cream Sauce Spag..."!	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
092	Although the cream tastes rich, there is a certain smoothness...	VO_killia.killia_sys_0009
093	Enough with the food commentary, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0027
