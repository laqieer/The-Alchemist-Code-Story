001	Ack! I can't see him anywhere!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
002	Looks like he's gotten away. He's quick on his feet.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
003	But it was foolish of him to flee into the buildings!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
004	We've practically cornered him. We'll chase him down!
005	Do you really think it'll go that smoothly? He's not stupid. He may have even set some kind of trap.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0031
006	But he's looking for the Sacred Stone, right? What if it's in the ruins?
007	It's not. I'm sure of it.
008	Huh?
009	Also, as far as I can see, the only exit is back the way we came.
010	It'll most effective to wait here and ambush him when he returns.
011	But what if there are other exits?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0016
012	Please...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
013	I don't want to lose anyone else. Let's not do anything reckless.
014	Bu-but...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
015	Hey, Seida, there's something I want to ask you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
016	How can you be so certain that the Sacred Stone isn't in the ruins?
017	Um...
018	Not just that. You were sure that it wasn't in Gluttony either.
019	... ...
020	This is just a guess...but do you know where the Sacred Stone is, Seida? Where it's truly located.
021	At this point, it'll be more inefficient to hide the truth.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
022	Fine. I'll share with you everything that I know...
023	...after we defeat this monster!
