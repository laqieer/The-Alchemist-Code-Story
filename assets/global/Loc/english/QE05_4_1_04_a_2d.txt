001	Ughh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
002	Gah!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0026
003	So? What is all this ruckus about?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
004	Uh, well... I tried to stop them, you know?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
005	I just didn't expect the fight to spread like wildfire.
006	Ah, this could partially be my fault. I was so concerned with gathering numbers that I didn't consider how best to organize the troops in the barracks.
007	We are an army comprised of people from different backgrounds and upbringings. It wouldn't be at all surprising for a small dispute to turn into a fight.
008	I should have been more considerate.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0036
009	How can this happen? They were fighting side by side only days ago.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
010	It's not that easy for people of different cultures to understand each other.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
011	Once the enemy is out of sight, all we can see is what we don't like about the person standing right beside us.
012	Especially now, as we prepare ourselves for the battle to come, the charged air can easily cause a fight to erupt among the ranks.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
013	I'm sorry. That mood must have gotten to me as well.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
014	Still no sign of Mocca or the Blue Tongues?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
015	Nah. They shouldn't be too far away, though.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
016	Unlike in Saga, the voice of Mother Nature is faint here in the desert. I can't sense their trail.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
017	I see.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
018	Regardless, we are going to have to do something to boost the troops' morale.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
019	Perhaps we should do something to help the troops relieve their stress?
020	What can we do? It's not like we can just give them time off or anything.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
021	Come to think of it... If they have so much pent up energy, should we not just let them fight it out?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0007
022	Huh?
