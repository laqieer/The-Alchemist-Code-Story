001	I-it's pitch black! I guess they haven't set up the lights yet!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
002	Yep. Other than our headlights that extend only a few meters ahead, everything is pitch black.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	And we've got to speed through the pitch dark at maximum speed. It's quite a thrill.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
004	Eek! A-are you sure it's okay?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
005	Obstacle detected on radar! But...at the speed we're going, we can't avoid it!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
006	Heh. Sounds like life. There's always a light at the end of every storm.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
007	N-now isn't the time for such leisurely contemplations!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
008	Don't worry. Your old man is watching over you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
009	My father...?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
010	If it weren't for this road that your old man was planning on opening, our chances of rescuing Ethan would've been reduced drastically.
011	Maybe it was your old man who made you remember this road as well, little lady.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
012	True...!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0037
013	Squeak...! A pack of Hounds is approaching from behind, aye! That no-good Alkaroid is with them!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
014	Too bad for them. We've beat them by a hair's breadth.
015	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
016	The light from above ground is coming into view! Come on! It's time to turn the tables!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
017	Okay!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
