001	We've got to hurry! Nimul and the others are still fighting near the border! Every second counts if we wish to be in time to offer them aid!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
002	Yes, sir!
003	We're looking at rough waters ahead... It must have begun already.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0029
004	(We might not make it.)	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
005	But we still have to try. Our arrival may make a difference, no matter how small.
006	Are we ready?! Hoist the sails!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
007	We're the knights that protect this land! Some turbulent waters aren't going to stop us!
008	Nimul... Daphne... Please be safe!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0022
