001	Haaa... Haaa... We somehow got away from the tentacle and all the Jam.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	Guh...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
003	Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
004	Seems like I used far too much of my purification power. However...I did manage to retrieve Beelzebub, so the risk was worth it in the end.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
005	What in the world was that tentacle?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
006	I'm not sure. Maybe it was formed from the dragon's fixation with Beelzebub...? Or from its desperation to cling onto life...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
007	It's odd, though... We extracted Beelzebub. Shouldn't that weaken the dragon?
008	...?! Georgios! Behind you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
009	Umph! Impossible!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0043
010	...! The tentacle's come all the way out here?! How can this be?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
011	Jam?! No way! Didn't we purify Beelzebub?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
012	...?! The dragon's chest is glowing a bright yellow now!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
013	Do not falter! We must focus on crushing the enemy before us. That is all there is to it!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
014	Georgios...how can you keep up in your condition? Dang it...it's just like he says! We'll just have to crush them!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
