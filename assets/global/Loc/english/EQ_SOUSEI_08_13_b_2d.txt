001	Why are you fighting me? Look inside yourself. You should know better than anyone that this is the only way.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
002	I know nothing of the sort, and I dispute the very claim!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0015
003	I will never approve of a single sacrifice, from anyone! And that includes you!
004	Especially you... Everything I've done has been for you—to save you from the Truth of this wretched world!
005	Poor, sweet Nimul... You dream so big.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
006	But this world is not so kind. There's always a price to be paid. In order to save one thing, you must inevitably hurt another.
007	Everything we've seen, all this time, has proven that to be the case. There's just no getting around it!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
008	...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
009	You think of the lives that have been lost along the way as people you couldn't save. But that's not the case at all.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
010	They're people who thought long and hard about the choices they were given, and made their own decisions. Some of them just chose death! And that's not your responsibility to bear.
011	You are not the arbiter of other people's wishes and dreams. You do not get to determine if they are acceptable or not. To think otherwise is nothing more than sheer arrogance on your part.
012	But...I—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
013	What?! What is this light...?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
014	It may be arrogant of me. I'll grant you that. But I still intend to take responsibility for every single person I wasn't able to save!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
015	If only I had been stronger or smarter, maybe I could've found a way. If only I'd known more, maybe I could've come up with an alternate solution to their problems!
016	Those people died not because they wanted to, but because they felt they had to. And if it's arrogant of me to say that I don't want anyone to ever have to feel that way again, then so be it; I am as arrogant as they come!
017	That is my sin of Pride, and I bear it with further Pride; I will never stop wishing for a better future!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
018	I'll save everyone next time. And if not then, then the time after that!
019	Let my prideful arrogance be a beacon of light upon this darkened world! And may that light lead people away from ignorance and hopelessness, and toward a better tomorrow...
020	That light called Alchemy!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
021	Override access to Superbia Belt confirmed.
022	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
023	The domain established between Lucifer and I...has been overridden?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
024	Let's work together, Emmel. If I become too idealistic, then you can scold me for it. If you go a little too far, then I can snap you back to your senses.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
025	We can forge on ahead, little by little. Together. It's how it was meant to be; I mean, we are brother and sister, after all!
026	Nimul...	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
027	Oh, thank goodness. Are you two all right?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
028	We're just fine.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
029	Eulalia, I...
030	I'm glad you two made up. That was the biggest fight I think you've ever had!
031	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
032	Fight as in, quarrel. As siblings. You two are always having trouble figuring out what's best for each other, and then you end up fighting about it.
033	But until now, those fights have always blown over in the end, with you two making up and winding up on even better terms than ever with each other. This time was just a bit more...intense than usual.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
034	I suppose you're right. I hadn't thought about it before.
035	My goal hasn't changed, Emmel. I'm still going to save everyone and everything in this world. And that includes you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
036	But—
037	But nothing! Your plan was far too extreme. So let's try to think of something better...together.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
038	We have to figure out how to teach Alchemy to everyone, throughout the Belt Regions. And until they've mastered it, we need to figure out how to keep them safe.
039	It's a lot to manage, and I could sure use a hand with it. Think you can help me out, Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
040	I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
041	Please? If you want, you can just think of it as donating your time to keep your hopelessly incompetent brother out of harm's way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
042	...I can do that.
043	Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
044	Nimul!
045	Hrk!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
046	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
047	I'll heal her with my magic! Nimul, step aside!
048	Why...? Why?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
049	What did you do, Ignacio?! Why would you do that?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0020
050	Ignacio, you shot her?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0013
051	That, I did.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
052	What will you do now—you, who have been chosen to bear the fate of this world? What will you do, Nimul, Child of God?
053	Will you still cry out for a salvation that will never come, and ignore the ideal sacrifice that lies before you?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
