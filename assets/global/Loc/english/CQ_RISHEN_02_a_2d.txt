001	Yaaah!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0009
002	Ugh... This teamwork is...
003	You were all talk. Just a pathetic excuse for a man with an underhanded plan.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
004	You could never beat us like that!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0013
005	Heh heh... So naive. Even as we speak... Our fleet is moving to send your ship to the bottom of the sea.
006	What? Your target was never us... But the Xiao Shenmei!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0016
007	The young must have their wings clipped early. Heh... A bunch of leaderless rabble were never any match for us.
008	Liu Shen! Everyone's in danger! We must get back to the ship!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0020
009	...
010	I'm sorry, Xiao-Xiao...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0035
011	I wanted to ally with these pirates because I figured if we were enemies, they would crush us.
012	But in the end, it has come to this. Therefore, I will take responsibility and return to the ship.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0020
013	But you, Xiao-Xiao...
014	If things do not go well, Su Yi cannot be left all alone.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
015	I will not flee.
016	I believe in our crew, and they have put their faith in us. We will fight together as we always have.
017	It is the strength of our mutual trust that has led the Xiao Shenmei through even the darkest of times.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
018	Xiao-Xiao...
019	And of course, I believe in you too, Liu Shen.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
020	This is your captain's order! Let's find a way out of this... together!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
021	...!
022	I guess I lost sight of who my people are...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0030
023	But no more. For those who fight even now, we'll go forth and turn the tides!
024	Yes! And that's why you're the first mate!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
025	But even if we hurry, it's just the two of us. We're vastly outnumbered, and we don't know what state the ship is in.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
026	Oh! Then we should increase our numbers too!
027	But how will we...?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
028	We'll need to negotiate.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
029	There are a lot of monsters in their cages. They seem starved and ferocious.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
030	These monsters are won over and controlled using food.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
031	Whatever direction they all happen to look is likely where the food will be.
032	I noticed you'd paid close attention to the other's ship. So this is what you saw!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0045
033	Now, if we get them out of their cages, we can turn the battle around.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
034	I'll break the cages, and you'll need to get to and warn the crew.
035	Okay, let's go.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
036	But make me a promise. You will be sure to protect yourself first.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0041
037	Okay, I understand.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
038	They just came out of nowhere... Damn... Hold your ground! I'm sure the captain will be here soon.
039	All hands on deck!
040	Captain!
041	Cease fighting! Make a retreat!
042	And the first mate! But even if we fall back, how can we possibly get away?
043	Just trust in us! We've fought hard to make it this far, and we'll see this through too!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0038
044	Yes, Captain!
045	Heh, don't think you can run from us! Wait... What's that sound?
046	M-monsters! Someone broke the cages?! They're attacking the main ship! You there, fight them off!
047	All right, the enemy forces are starting to fall! Now's the time to fight back! Have at them!
048	Everyone, chaaarge!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0010
049	Aye!
