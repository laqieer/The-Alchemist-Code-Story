001	Simply...amazing...
002	Let's leave this area. If they surround us, they'll cut us down easily.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
003	Do you truly think you can escape?	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0016
004	Kubera!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
005	You have done well to survive my elite Avaritia soldiers.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0031
006	However, I told you, did I not? The people of Avaritia strive to be the strongest.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
007	We spare no one who gets in the way of that ideal.
008	You don't need parts from a dragon to defeat a Cursed Beast.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
009	Oh?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0012
010	What is needed is a spell to strip them of their sin, and gear with that spell carved into it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
011	Yna and I can prepare that. However—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
012	You, too, have faced one of these beasts, have you not?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
013	You have learned of how to cut down a Cursed Beast with your own hands and come to tell us how to do so. Is that right?
014	Nevertheless, what we seek is an unparalleled blade! Not just the Cursed Beast, but even the gods who lord above us...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0039
015	I will cut them down with these two hands. It is for this purpose that I desire the ultimate gear.
016	Even gods?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
017	The gods that decided the laws of this world. Their true form is as descendants of the dragons that have lived since ancient times.
018	Master...
019	Dragon scales are nigh indestructible. A regular sword cannot scratch them.
020	Which means, we should use the dragon. Gear made with the magil and hardness of its scales would possibly be enough to lop off a god's head.
021	While that may be true...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
022	Skreeeee...	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
023	You really intend to take the life of this small creature?!
024	If it is the path to strength! We will proceed without hesitation!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
025	Ngh!
026	Surrender, traveler.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
027	The strange technique you use is indeed troublesome.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0031
028	However, no matter how you struggle, my blade is faster than yours at this distance.
029	Ngh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
091	(My wound has reopened.)
030	Nimul, watch out!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0022
031	What?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0027
032	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0019
033	Huh?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
034	B-Benika?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
035	Benika! Why did you...?
036	H-he's...your friend...right?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
037	I'm a failure, so I cause...a lot of problems for you...
092	And you two had to fight...because of me.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
038	Which is why...it should be me who...
039	Why would you do something so stupid?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
040	Ehe...he...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
041	I'll use a healing spell! To be honest, my Spiritbonding-based spell doesn't work so well on the Fallen, but...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
042	Aghh! Hurts...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0042
043	The bleeding isn't stopping. Why...?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
044	Grrr... Healing that's not purification... Damn it, if only I had learned a little magic from Ambrosia!
045	Why do you look down on us?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
046	Now's not the time! Can't you see that?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
047	Is this sentimentality, protecting the weak and prioritizing healing? It is an unfamiliar principle to us.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
048	Nevertheless...
049	What are you doing?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
050	It vexes me that such a trivial matter should ruin my chance of meeting someone powerful and measuring my own strength against them.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
051	This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
052	We Avaritia soldiers are born with a resistance to corruption because all those who could not resist it died.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
053	Therefore, to us, corruption is either meaningless, or some bond that forms flesh and blood.
054	If this girl is a Fallen—if she is struck with the same corruption as us—her wounds should be healed.
055	Ahh... Gaahhh...!
056	What is it?! She's in pain!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
057	That is the girl's weakness, being unable to control the corruption within herself. However, that is what is keeping her alive.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
058	What follows is your own decision. You can take pity on her and kill her. Or you can force her to stay alive.
059	In this region, all is forgiven of the strong.
060	All...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
061	Arghhh!	VO_benika.benika_battle_0019
062	Are you all right, Benika?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
063	Y-you can't...come...out!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0027
064	This miasma is...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
065	Grrooooooarrrgghh!!!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0043
066	...
067	Benika was born a Fallen. Chosen as a part of the sin of greed and sent to corrupt this realm...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
068	She is Mammon's priestess.
069	Ahhhhhh!	VO_benika.benika_battle_0025
070	Scrah...aaahhhhhhhhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
093	The corruption overflowing from its body is...turning into the Fallen? What is going on?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
094	It's just like what happened to Julia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
095	Producing Fallen from nothing is the power of a Cursed Beast!
071	Benika. You were destined to succumb to sin from the moment you were born, you wretched weakling.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0022
072	Your corruption will not work on us.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
073	For we have no sin to be corrupted by.
074	Through our long history of self-discipline, we left the sin of greed behind long ago.
075	It's laughable that you think you can deprive us of our rapture! There's no meaning to prosperity at the expense of others!	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0016
076	What we seek is the pinnacle of strength! Where no one can defeat us, a place no one else can reach!
077	We are bonded by blood and the hope that one amongst us can attain that ultimate position.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
078	If sin dwells within the weakness of the heart, then we have no more use for sin.
079	You said you would leave this to us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
080	Benika is still fighting it. She's fighting the sin she was born with.
081	Lord Kubera, if you are a man who values power above all else; a man who considers continuing to fight honorable...
082	Is wresting my sister away from me in the midst of her battle truly the correct action to take?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
083	Heh. Well said. Then demonstrate to me how you will stop your sister.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
084	She will turn into an instrument of corruption—of Mammon—momentarily.
085	Nimul, lend me your power.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
086	But Yna... Since she's been a Fallen since birth, the power of purification would—
087	I know. I want you to ward away the surrounding corruption.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
088	I will handle Benika.
089	All right. Leave the surrounding Fallen to me, Yna!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
090	Aaaarrrrrggghhh!
