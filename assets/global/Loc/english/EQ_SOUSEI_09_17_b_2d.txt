001	It's no good! This corruption is just too dense! No matter how much we purify, it's never-ending!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
002	...!
003	Don't push yourself, Emmel! This degree of corruption may be too much, even for you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
004	No, Nimul. This is exactly the kind of situation where I need to push myself the hardest!
005	That sound...is Waginau. He's using that dark power to keep Ouroboros at bay.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
006	He can't keep that up for long! We need to purify the core as fast as we can and go help him!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
007	Eeek!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0025
008	Emmel!
009	I'm fine. How's the core, though?
010	Oof. We may not be able to purify it from the outside.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
011	What? We can't?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
012	So, we may have to do like we did before? Purify from both the inside and outside at the same time?
013	Emmel? What are you talking about?
014	Emmel?!
015	I'll go inside. It'll be cramped, but I can still sense Lucifer within.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
016	So I'm confident I'll be permitted entrance.
017	No! It's much too dangerous! You'll be consumed by the corruption!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
018	I will not fall to sin. I am the Vessel of Purification. This is the sacrifice I am meant to make.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
019	Nimul, this is something only I can do. You understand that, don't you?
020	Even so...!
021	It'll be fine, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
022	Emmel?
023	I came this far knowing such an eventuality might come to pass, and that if it did, I would need to fulfill my destiny.
024	So everything will be all right. I'll take care if it, Nimul. I swear.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
025	I will enter Grand Excelsior and purify it from the inside, while you purify it from out here. If we work together, we will succeed.
026	......
027	I understand. And...I believe in you. You and I really are cut from different cloths. And yours is of a much finer make.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
028	"I beseech the supreme...!"
029	Just like with Beelzebub...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
030	So if I just clear the corruption from the inside...
031	"I beseech...the supreme!"	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
032	"The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!"
033	"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads."
034	"Save us, the lost souls!"
035	I swear, I won't let you be a sacrifice! We can resolve this without any such need! I'll see to it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
036	"I am Transcender of the Seven Gates!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
037	"Let Truth descend upon the kingdom from the crown, and all the people share equally its golden treasure."
038	"Genesis Arts: Grand Excelsior Reformed!" Purge the corruption that dwells within!
039	We did it! Emmel, we've done it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0009
040	We did! We fought off the corruption, and control of the tower is now ours! The culmination of your dream is finally within your grasp!
041	Now, you need to hurry up and get out of there, before—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
042	No.
043	Emmel?
044	Ouroboros is sure to try and steep the tower in corruption again.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
045	I should stay here to protect the core.
046	But—
047	It'll be fine. I can use the power of the Cursed Beast cores just like you, remember?	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
048	And...it'll be safer for me to deal with things from inside the core. Right?
049	That may be true, but—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
050	...!
051	Nimul, you should hurry! Waginau needs your help!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
052	...All right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
053	But promise me that if you're in any danger at all, you'll get out of there right away. Promise me!
054	Of course. You have my word.
055	...I hate telling lies and making false promises. But I said what needed to be said. And I should be fine here on my own.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
056	Nimul is the only one in the long, long history of the Sephira with the ability to completely clear away corruption.
057	I can't control the power of the cores nearly as well as he can.
058	That's why I need to merge my soul with all seven of them.
059	If the cores have my characteristics—that is to say, those of the Vessel of Purification—they should be able to withstand the corruption.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
060	Nimul might not realize it himself, but there are certain things only he can do.
061	And as his sister, this is what I can do. What I have to do...and what I want to do.
062	Just as all of the Vessels that came before me, I will seal the corruption within my body to help the world reach equilibrium once again.
063	(I've used my power so many times before to seal the Cursed Beast cores within me, but this time is different.)	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
064	I've kept this from Nimul for so long now...
065	Though I'm sure he must have realized the truth.
066	My body just can't hold out anymore. One more shot as Vessel is all I've got left in me, I think.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
067	But it's fine. It won't be in vain.
068	I'm giving my life to help Nimul realize his dream.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
069	I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!
070	That's my dream, okay?!
071	This is the future that Nimul wished for, all those years ago...
072	Is it safe?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
073	Looks like the coast is clear, at least.
074	Ooh...ahh...	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
075	Eulalia!
076	Those wounds are deep. They don't look fatal, but you need to rest or that could easily change.
077	What's...going on?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
078	We've retreated, and are presently hiding from the enemy.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
079	Matia is almost certainly trying to sniff us out even as we speak.
080	And she's moving pretty quickly through the city center in the process...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
081	All the while hunting down Fallen, for some reason.
082	Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on with that either. But what I do know is that more than half of our own troops are hurt. We can't afford to get into any more battles.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
083	One way or another, we need to buy more time.
084	Nyx! Behind you!
085	Huh? How?! We shouldn't have left any signs of our presence!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
086	Wait... Crap! We used magic! Matia can easily spot the residual magil from our Space-Time Manipulation!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
087	We've got to move! Now!
088	It's too late...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0027
089	...!
090	Ha! Found you!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
091	Matia!
092	Huh? Something's not right. She's...different.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
093	She's fallen into sin! Matia, did you consume the Fallen?!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0003
094	What? Are you serious?!
095	I was running short on magil. It seemed the best way to replenish my supply.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
096	You're going to turn into a Fallen yourself! You do understand the repercussions of that, don't you?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
097	It won't be the first time I've died.
098	Ugh. We've got to do something, quick!
099	Mira! Use Space-Time Manipulation on me again!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
100	Your body won't be able to handle that! Come, on, think; what do we do?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
101	Eeek!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
102	You're first.
103	Tut-tut. Do you really think you can take out one of my disciples so easily?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
104	Well, who do we have here?
105	Sorry to tell you, this is the end of the line for you. No more of your nonsense!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0003
106	Combined forces of Invidia and Ire, prepare to attack! The number of Fallen surrounding us is increasing. We must drive them back!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0004
107	Yes, sir!
108	Huh? What?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
109	Is that...Ambrosia's magic?!
110	Honestly, I have the worst luck when it comes to taking on disciples. Always getting themselves in trouble!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
111	Ambrosia?!
112	You saved me! Thank you!
113	Wow, you're keeping it short and sweet for once, huh? I must've really caught you by surprise!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
114	...! Ambrosia, behind you!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
115	Worry not. We'll handle them. We're not human, so the Fallen can't take us over.
116	Winnick! You're here, too? What are you all even doing in Superbia Belt?
117	We can talk about that later. First, we have to—	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
118	You are...all...such...eyesores!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
119	Well, we'll just have to make something more of ourselves, then, won't we?
