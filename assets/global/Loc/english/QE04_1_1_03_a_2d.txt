001	They're attacking us from downstream as well?! The villagers are a disorderly bunch...they shouldn't be able to use any of the arts!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0005
002	No! It's the wind! It's pushing our attacks back. The villagers are taking advantage of it!
003	At this rate, we're sitting ducks!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
004	Ack! How can we be driven back by the wind?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0016
005	This is unbelievable! Quickly! Open a path!
006	Sorry, that's not happening!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
007	So you were the ones who opened this path! How dare you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
008	Can't you hear the voices of the trees? They spent tens of hundreds of years growing here!
009	Hmph. That sounds like something someone from the nature-worshiping Voda faction would say.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
010	We can't lose to an old-fashioned bunch of crazies like this!!!
011	I am Tina, daughter of Adone, chief of the Toxotes tribe!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
012	You fools who dare underestimate the power of Mother Nature! Now it's time for you to pay for the disruption you caused to the harmony of this land!
013	Wh-what is this wind...?! Aggh!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
014	Whoa! He...heheh...! If her armor-piercing arrows don't hit us, then they are harmless!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0026
015	If you're going to blame anyone, blame yourselves for having laid your hands on this land.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
016	What? Aghh...!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0005
017	U-ughh...! Im-impossible... I dodged that arrow... Why...?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0020
018	It was a whirlwind that turned that arrow back on you. Think of it as Mother Nature's wrath.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
019	A-a whirlwind...?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
020	Because you hacked down a path, you allowed new wind to enter.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
021	Combined with the backwind...it's natural for a whirlwind to occur.
022	Wh-wha...?! Aghhh!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0028
023	You brought this upon yourself. If only you'd listen to the voice of Mother Nature.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
024	...Grrr...
025	Badalf...!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
026	Thank you for saving me, Kiki... Tell Leoferes that the forest is in danger.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
027	Grrr...
028	Yes...I'll be okay. Thanks.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
029	All right...let's go Badalf. There's so much we need to tell Father.
030	Was that a wind Ouija? No, it couldn't be...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
