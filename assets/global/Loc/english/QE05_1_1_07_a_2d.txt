001	I am Ceclidis, General of the Third Legion.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
002	My apologies. My name is Kamui.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0003
003	Hrm. Never heard of you. Judging from your garb, you are from one of the southern tribes.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0031
004	(He seems suspicious. Does he believe I might be a spy for the rebel forces? Then...?)
005	I once called that place my home, yes.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
006	But no longer?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
007	Indeed. Now, I am a mere wanderer, plying divination as my trade.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
008	A fortune-teller, huh? You're not planting foolish thoughts into the king's head, are you?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0045
009	I am not sure what you may be implying, but I did indeed divine the answers to some questions the King had.
010	Of course, of course. We are in trying times. I can see why the King might seek solutions in omens and conjurations.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
011	So? What did he ask?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0037
012	Forgive me, sir...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
013	You cannot tell me? I must say, this only makes me suspicious.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
014	Are you interested in having your fortune told, Ceclidis? In that case, I may be able to humor you.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
015	Who...?
016	You! When did you...?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0027
017	(He got this close without my noticing?! Who is this man?!)
018	I apologize for startling you. I could not help but interject.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
019	I am Waginau. I command the scouting legion of the Holy Guard.
020	The Holy Guard?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
021	Lord Waginau, how may I be of assistance?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0020
022	No, no. I simply found it rather peculiar to hear the general of the Gluttony Army's Third Legion seemingly interested in fortune-telling.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
023	I am certainly no expert, but I thought I might lend my meager abilities to satisfy your curiosity in the matter.
024	What exactly do you want?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0012
025	We are simple scouts. We don't have any particular expectations.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
026	Or do you know of some affair that may require our attention, General Ceclidis?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
027	Hmph. Your humor leaves a lot to be desired.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
028	If it will not leave you too bereft, may I borrow this man for a while?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
029	Me, sir?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
030	As I suspected. You hail from the same village as I.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
031	I would be much obliged if you would tell me stories of my old home. I recently find myself missing it.
032	If you wish, gladly.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
033	...
034	Unless you take issue, General?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
035	Oh, no. I apologize for keeping you. Please, by all means.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0039
036	Thank you. Excuse me, sir.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
037	Hmph. Divination, huh?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
038	There is no way that straight-laced king of ours would rely on such parlor tricks to make decisions.
039	Who was that man?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
040	Interested? Shall we lend you one of ours to tail him?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
041	No, we have more important things to worry about. First, we must locate the Sacred Stone.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0039
042	I suppose this is as good a place as any.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
043	...
044	No need to feel so threatened. I do have something I wish to discuss with you.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
045	I appreciate you getting me out of that situation, but the Holy Guard maintains the balance of this continent's Alchemia.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0003
046	What would a member of such an organization have to discuss with me?
047	I was speaking truthfully earlier.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0011
048	I could not neglect one from the same village I came from in their time of need.
049	What are you talking about?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
050	Perhaps you will understand me better if I show you this...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0003
051	That symbol on your neck is...a sephirah?! The mark of wisdom found only on our people! Then you are...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
052	I left home a long time ago. Since then, I have joined the Holy Guard.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
053	I am acquainted with the current village chief, Iakov. Perhaps you could try to trust me a little.
054	Even if that is true, what is the Holy Guard doing in Gluttony?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
055	The Holy Guard's presence here during a civil war is tantamount to adding fuel to a fire. What business do you have here?
056	Well, well. You are shrewder than I had expected.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
057	There is a possibility that Alchemy may have been abused here. The Holy Guard is here to verify that suspicion.
058	What?! If that is true...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
059	We are not yet sure. That is why I have come here with my legion to investigate.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
060	We are taking every precaution not to disturb Gluttony's current state of affairs, for example, by bringing only the minimum required number of men.
061	Unfortunately, as you well know, for investigation and nothing more, having foreigners snooping around may agitate this country's situation.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
062	That is why I have decided to hire a bodyguard.
063	In particular, my mind would be put at ease if it were someone from my hometown watching my back.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
064	Besides, the well-being of that child with you at the Arena seems to weigh heavily on your mind.
065	You...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
066	You were watching that?
067	Of course. It would have been a waste to miss such a wonderful display of skill, on par with any veteran gladiator.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
068	That fight in the Arena is another reason I decided to ask you for this favor.
069	It is highly unusual for a Sephira leaving the village on official business to bring a child along.
070	I can only assume you found him somewhere on the course of your journey here. While your intentions are admirable, you haven't any plan for him, have you?
071	If you take this job, we would be happy to take him into our care.
072	I believe the Holy Guard would be of some assistance in finding the child's family. Would you not agree?
073	I am sorry, but...I am not in any position to make such a deal.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0039
074	Why is that?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
075	As you know, I am here on official business from Chief Iakov.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
076	Even if you were born a Sephira, you now belong to the outside.
077	I cannot lend my strength to an outside organization of my own accord.
078	I also cannot simply leave that child in your care.
079	It is not impossible that you are plotting to manipulate me into doing something I would rather not.
080	If that is the case, I cannot allow the risk of that child being used as hostage.
081	Ah... It seems that in attempting to sweeten the deal, I have invited your suspicion.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0011
082	Then I must show you some of my cards.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
083	Specifically, there may be an opportunity for you to find the source of your Sacred Stone problem.
084	That's...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
085	There was some kind of large-scale movement of Alchemia somewhere in southern Gluttony.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
086	The Holy Guard sent us to investigate that unusual event.
087	Are you saying Sephiron may be—?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
088	That is part of what I am here to investigate.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
089	Chief Iakov is aware of the urgency of this matter, though we do not have the time to wait for you to confirm the matter with him.
090	You must believe me when I say that I do all this in the name of "absolute justice"—and for the sake of peace on this continent.
091	I see you are indeed pressed for time.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
092	Still, I will give you what time I can to think about it. If you wish to take the job, meet me at the West Gate of the royal capital tomorrow morning.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
093	So, Hisham, are you interested in becoming a gladiator?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
094	Becoming a...? I think it's cool, but I don't think I could ever do anything like that.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
095	You're too young to be so pessimistic! You definitely can if you train!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
096	Ooh, I know! What do you think about coming to see the training school?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
097	There are a lot of students who go there, so you might find someone from the same place as you!
098	Mmm, but I—oh, hey! Kamui!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
099	Welcome back. Did you finish your errands, Kamui?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
100	Yes.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
101	Is something wrong?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
102	Hisham, it seems our time together ends here.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
103	What do you—?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
104	I was hired as a guide for the Holy Guard. I will be leaving the royal capital as early as tomorrow.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
105	It will be a dangerous journey, not suitable for a child.
106	...
107	Teona, I know this is asking a lot, but do you know of anybody who would be able to take Hisham in?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
108	I think the training school may be able to help, but...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
109	N-no! I don't want to be left behind, Kamui!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
110	Hisham...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
111	I-I know I'd just be a burden, b-but please don't go without me!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
112	Do not treat your own life so cheaply!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
113	You survived until now to come to Eos so you could find your family, did you not?
114	Y-yeah, but...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
115	Then...I will be Hisham's protector.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
116	What? We may be heading straight into the fray of battle!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0012
117	Did you forget? My whole purpose here is to challenge you to another fight.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
118	If I lose sight of you here, who knows if we will ever cross paths again!
119	Besides, I already promised Hisham that I'd help him uncover his memories.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
120	Thank you, Miss Teona!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_battle_0018
121	You, of all people, know my strength, Kamui. There shouldn't be any problem.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
122	Fine. Do as you like.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
123	It is time.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
124	We will head first to the harbor city to the West. Everybody keep up!
125	Why the harbor?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
126	Do you know what the largest industry is for this country?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
127	I dunno.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
128	Mercenaries, right?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
129	I've heard that mercenaries from Gluttony are making a name for themselves in the Desert Lands and Greed Dike.
130	Close, but no.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0044
131	International trade. Goods from the desert, Saga, and Slothstein are traded overseas.
132	Of course, mercenaries are among those "goods".
133	So the wealth of this country is concentrated in the harbors.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
134	Exactly. A perfect place to gather intel on this country's state of affairs.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
135	I had no idea...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0044
136	I've heard that the maritime trade here is strictly under the control of the government.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
137	It's no wonder civilians would not be familiar with it.
138	Lord Waginau, are we going to follow this road straight out?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
139	That's the plan. This road connecting the royal capital to its harbors has been well maintained.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
140	It may be risky, but it's the quickest route.
141	Um, risky?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
142	Like Kamui mentioned earlier, the harbor is this country's heart.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
143	So the rebel forces will naturally want to move to occupy this area.
144	I see. That was why you were looking for bodyguards.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
145	Right. As representatives of justice, we cannot run or hide, no matter how outnumbered we may be.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0038
146	Which means—
147	There they are! Like the intel said, it's the Holy Guard!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
148	It is for situations like these that we need your help.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
