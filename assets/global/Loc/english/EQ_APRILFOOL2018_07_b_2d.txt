001	Whew...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
002	Numaa...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0002
003	After all that, I finally remember...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
004	I'm just a Lizardman—nothing special about me. That's why they were calling me a bug.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
005	Koohhh...	VO_Kurokishi.kurokishi_battle_0028_a
006	Thanks, Black Knight, but even I know where my place is.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0003
007	Don't say that! You're a one of a kind, Lizardman.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0039
008	But I... I...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
009	No normal Lizardman could have taken on Kanon's role without any preparation!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0005
010	Don't you remember? You used to help us with our PR work.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0001
011	The so-called bug wasn't you, personally, but the very circumstances.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
012	Oh, you...!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
013	You gave your all to change your fate. I respect that bravery.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0016
014	Even considering how Ouroboros had a hand in this, that was only the advent of the chain of events. You proved yourself a true warrior!
015	Mandra, mandra!	VO_Mmandragora.Mmandragora_battle_0020
016	It's too early to celebrate! Being a warrior was difficult! I feel like this experience was more than enough for me.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0021
017	...Sorry, I already registered you as a unit.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0036
018	You can do it!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
019	Well, we're finished here, so it's time for us to head back. We were able to implement the DLC quickly, but this won't fly next time!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0022
020	Seriously? Um, I'm just saying, I think I was really okay the way it used to be!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
021	But...I guess I'll do my best...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
022	Heheh. They forgot to deal with me.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0022
023	In a (so-called) smartphone game world like this, even a background character can become a hero.
024	Both the Management and the Truth itself waver, as if they are but hazy illusions...until we are unable to grasp what is right or just. Now that is most amusing!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
