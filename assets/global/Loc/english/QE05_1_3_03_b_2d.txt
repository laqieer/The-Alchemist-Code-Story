001	Alchemy?! What do you mean by this, Lord Waginau?!
002	The Spiritbonding of the Sephira, this work of miracles gifted by Sephiron, is the original form of that which this world has deemed taboo: Alchemy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
003	Alchemy was originally Spiritbonding?!
004	Nimul and Emmel, the founders of Alchemy, were of the Sephira tribe.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
005	With their deep understanding of Spiritbonding, they deciphered the wisdom engraved upon Sephiron and laid their hands on the Truth of this world.
006	The Truth. You have mentioned this word several times before. Lord Waginau, what is this Truth you speak of?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
007	Only the two founders know the answer to that question.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
008	Fortunately, the Tower of Babel still remains to lead us to that answer, and within it lies the Grand Excelsior.
009	The Tower of Babel is said to have been the gate to the beyond, an imitation of Sephiron's role as the pillar of this world.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
010	A gate?
011	Why was such a thing built? If Spiritbonding was the foundation of Alchemy, then...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
012	Having devoted your whole life to this technique in this small village, it is no wonder you would think like that.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0011
013	Spiritbonding does have one major flaw.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
014	A flaw?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
015	Only the Sephira can use Spiritbonding.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
016	Sephiron selectively chooses humans with potential and provides them with a key.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
017	A key? You don't mean...
018	I do. The key is the sephirah upon your body.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
019	The mark every Sephira is born with.
020	It was the symbol of a pact between Sephiron and the Sephira, the chosen people, that represented our right to wield powers above our station.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
021	Nimul opposed this idea. He claimed Spiritbonding was a power that should be granted to all and help bring peace to the world.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
022	For this, Alchemy was created and the Tower of Babel was built to be the door accessible to all who seek this power.
023	But...in all the stories, it was Nimul himself who destroyed the tower.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0026
024	Nobody knows what Nimul saw when he crossed over to the beyond.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
025	Whatever it was, it caused the tower to be destroyed and the door was closed.
026	Closed? How...? Alchemy yet exists in this world. That is why we have the Magna Code.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
027	The Alchemy we have in this world is merely the remnant of what Emmel left us through the Holy Order of Babel.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
028	Now it does little more than utilize the Alchemia of this continent to shape the world.
029	Though it is still far more dangerous than magic, Alchemy as it is today is nothing compared to the Alchemy Source that drew power directly from Truth itself.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
030	Today's alchemists simply cannot recreate miracles of the same caliber as the Sacred Stones.
031	But Spiritbonding can?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
032	Yes. Spiritbonding is connected to the Truth through another path, Sephiron.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
033	I assume I do not need to explain what would happen if the Sephira people knew of this?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
034	...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
