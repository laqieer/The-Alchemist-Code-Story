001	We did it, Birgitta! We got them to leave!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
002	It was a pretty forceful method, but...it worked, I suppose!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
003	Well, we should probably settle on a tree quickly. The sun is setting after all.
004	That's right. Let's pick a tree! The biggest one!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
005	I'll also look!
006	Me too!
007	"I'll go with you!"	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
008	They're all gigantic trees, just look at 'em all!
009	...
010	Ravina? Is Winter Holiday not fun?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0002
011	Hmm... I mean, everyone seems to be having fun, I'm not saying Winter Holiday isn't fun, but...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
012	Everyone is having a great time. When I was younger there never were events as fun as this. I'm kinda jealous!
013	Really?
014	Really!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
015	Apparently, Winter Holiday comes from another world. Some people brought it here to "bring smiles to the children."
016	Wow, you know so much.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0045
017	Heh. I've been doing some background reading so I can be ready for this Winter Holiday duty.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
018	One person wanted to share this joy around the world and has made so many people happy.
019	All who cherishes this wonderful event are good kids!
020	...I also think so. Michael, as well as Lofia, they're doing their best for the sake of Winter Holiday.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
021	You are as well, Ravina, right? You yourself said you wanted to help out with the festivities, right?
022	...but, that's only because I thought I could be with Michael and Lofia.
023	They always have to work this time of the year, that's why I thought that if I also worked on Winter Holiday, I could be with them.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
024	I requested to do security alongside them...but they wouldn't let me.
025	Is that so? Well, me too, Ravina.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0005
026	Huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
027	I also requested to work security on Winter Holiday.
028	Really?! Why?
029	Well, Winter Holiday is when all the cake shops put out their best cakes, right?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
030	Lofia said there's always a ton of sweet cakes on Winter Holiday. So I thought, I definitely gotta get in on that!
031	There are also cakes that aren't found in Gluttony Foss, I need me some of those cakes.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
032	I thought there'd be a chance to eat those yummy cakes...
033	...but, but while I was looking into it, I realized something.	VO_lotia.lotia_chara_1011
034	Realized what?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0005
035	Well...if you don't reserve a cake ahead of time, you can't get one!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0018
036	Ah, yeah, I suppose that's true.
037	I thought to myself, "How awful, how terrible! I won't be able to eat Winter Holiday cake! Even though it's Winter Holiday!"
038	But, then I thought, the decorations around town are really exciting, and preparing for the party with you and everyone else was really REALLY fun.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
039	Winter Holiday, a day when we work to make others smile, how wonderful!
040	Even if there is no cake?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
041	Even if there is no cake.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
042	...
043	Of course, it would be even better with cake! That goes without saying.
044	But that's fine. It's okay to say we're lonely. It's okay to say we crave cake.
045	...I guess so.
046	It is!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
047	Wanting to eat cake, loving the Winter Holiday... I really feel those things!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
048	...
049	(But I feel lonely when Michael and Lofia are not around)
050	(So I thought I wouldn't enjoy the Winter Holiday. But...)
051	...I see now. It's okay to feel both.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
052	...Thank you, Lotiyah.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0034
053	This tree is the biggest!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0009
054	Great. Ravina and everyone are here already. I lost...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0009
055	It's not about winning or losing!
056	(I really just stumbled upon this spot...)
057	Everyone found the tree together!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0005
058	I lost...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0016
059	Heh, but don't you think it's great we found a tree we can all agree on?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
060	Yes! Very true!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
061	So, let's take this tree and decorate it with Michael and Lofia in mind!
062	Then it'll be the most wonderful tree ever!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
063	...yeah.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
064	Okay, let's ask the Maruda tribe if they will carry it back for us while we go home first.
065	Phew, we are finally home.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0022
066	The Maruda tribe said they would deliver it to the party by sled for us, so that's settled...
067	Hm? What happened to Klima and the rest of them?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0006
068	Hehe...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
069	I... I think I'll just stick with what I'm wearing now.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
070	Nope! This is a Winter Holiday party! Dress like it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
071	Exactly.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
072	B-but...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
073	Ooh! I'm good at this! Perfect! You look so cute!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
074	Wow, Ravina, you look great!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
075	Y-you think so?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
076	Of course! You look so festive, Michael and Lofia are sure to be thrilled!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
077	Mhmm. For sure!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
078	...
079	...Thanks.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
080	Amazing! The town is all glittery, like the starry night sky!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0009
081	You were in the Maruda tribe village, Nina, so you didn't see it happening, but Ravina did all of this. Look, and over there!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
082	Hey you two! Don't run! Wait!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0012
083	Oh, no, it's not that big of a deal.
084	What are you saying?! This is positively wonderful! It's as if the entire town is celebrating Winter Holiday!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
085	The town, the people, everything is in the Winter Holiday spirit! And it's all thanks to Ravina. Look!
086	Mommy, look! The decorations are so pretty! Winter Holiday is so much fun!
087	Don't run! If you don't behave, Santa won't bring you a present!
088	What, no! I'll behave!
089	Well, we better do our shopping and get home quickly then, huh?
090	This year's decorations are so cute! Everything sparkles!
091	Only someone who truly loves Winter Holiday could decorate like this.
092	Everyone loves your decorations, Ravina.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
093	Thanks.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
094	You will certainly get your wish from Santa.
095	That would be nice.
096	Although, first we need to complete that tree.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
097	Right!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
098	Even so, where did those two go? I thought they would be back by now.
099	Shall we go look for them?
100	Hm? You guys...
101	Hey! Good timing! Didn't you guys see Santa?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
102	There's been a report of a sighting nearby. We'll catch him this year!
103	Huh? What are you talking about?
104	Those two... Those two are trying to catch Santa and expose him...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
105	They can't just go causing trouble for Santa like that.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0012
106	Hmm, have you two actually finished all of your work?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0030
107	"Bringing presents to unfortunate children everywhere," isn't this your task?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
108	Hm? We were doing our work! But, something more important came along, so we put it on hold...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0005
109	That's right! It's our dream to catch Santa!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
110	So, you're saying you haven't finished your work...
111	We'll finish everything once we've caught Santa!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
112	Santa isn't some thing you can go and catch!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
113	By the way, what was that about sightings being reported?
114	Oh yeah! Someone had a composite sketch drawn. The person looks like this, apparently.
115	Th-this is...
116	This person kind of looks like...Michael.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
117	That's what I thought too!
118	Which reminds me, we mistook Michael for Santa before and attacked him.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
119	What?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0012
120	Seems so! He looks just like Santa.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
121	...
122	Causing trouble for Michael... I won't allow that!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0016
123	R-Ravina?! Calm down!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0027
124	That person just now... He kind of looks like the sketch.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
125	True! Red hat, white beard, glasses!
126	Which means... THAT's Santa! We gotta catch him!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0032
127	Oy... You don't want to stop Santa Claus doing his work, do you?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
128	Huh? Who are you guys?
129	I don't know, but they don't look like one of Santa's pals, do they?
130	It's time for us to make some money. And I'm not gonna let you get in my way.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
