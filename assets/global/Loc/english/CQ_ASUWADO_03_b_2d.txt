001	A-argh! You'll pay for this!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
002	What idiots to so foolishly overestimate their own competence.	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_1029
003	You understand now, don't you? This world isn't filled with good people. You'd better be more careful in the future.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
004	But I was all right this time too because you saved me, Aswald. Thank you!	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0033
005	... ...
006	Besides, I'm sure those people had their reasons. I pray that their souls may find peace.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0031
007	They were nothing more than thieves. As a Shrine Maiden, there's no need for you to consider the "reasons" of those who live in the world of darkness.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
008	You know my identity? I feel embarrassed... I'm still so immature.	VO_kuon.kuon_chara_1006
009	If only I had a lot more candy, I'm sure I could have healed their hearts without any conflict.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0020
010	I don't understand you. How can you speak that way about people who pointed their swords at you?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
011	Mmm. People often tell me that I'm too blissful, but here's what I think:	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0016
012	How wonderful of a world would it be if everyone trusted each other and lived in bliss?
013	In order to achieve that, I'll have to start with me. After all, it's my idea! If I want others to trust me, I have to trust first.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0007
014	A world where everyone lives in bliss? What a naïve idealism.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0044
015	Eheheh. Do you think so? ...Sigh. Maybe I am too blissful in my naivety.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0010
016	Yes, you are...but, maybe that's the reason why people reach out to you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
017	Huh?	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0006
018	In order for others to trust you, you have to trust them first, huh? I see. That's the reason why everyone seems to place their trust in you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
019	Shrine Maiden Kuon! Who are you doing out here all alone?! You're putting yourself in harm's way. Come now. Let's return home.
020	It looks like your people have come to take you back. See you around.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
021	Oh...wait, please! Take this, Aswald.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0017
022	This...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
023	It's the rest of the candy. I want to give it to you! It's really delicious, so, if you eat a lot of it, it'll make you really happy!	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0007
024	... ...
025	I guess you won't take any candy that's offered to you?	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0031
026	No. I'll take it. It's a candy so delicious that it'll bring peace to this world, right?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
027	Yes, of course! Please, put some faith in my taste buds♪	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0005
028	Thank you for saving me over and over again! Well then, I have to say goodbye now.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0033
029	Let's eat candy together again next time!	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0002
030	Next time, huh? I doubt that will ever happen. The world that an assassin and a Shrine Maiden live in are too far apart. There is a darkness to my world.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
031	Still, I'm glad to have seen that not all worlds are filled with darkness—that there are those overflowing with light.
032	That'll probably be the last time anyone ever calls me a "good person." It really threw me off my stride.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
033	...Still, it's not bad to have days like these.
034	The candy... It's sweet.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
