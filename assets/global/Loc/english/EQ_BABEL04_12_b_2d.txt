001	Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.
002	Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.
003	Count to one hundred, and you get a demon!
004	According to Yomi's memories, this is the Kagomurasaki Clan's demon statue.
005	Once I release the corruption from inside it, that will be the end.
006	Good, good! Finally!
007	The end of the world of humans...
008	And the beginning of the world of demons.
009	At long last. I have been waiting for so very long.
010	Oh man, me too!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
011	Hm?
012	I was starting to go nuts waiting!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
013	It's not all about the chasing, you know.
014	When you play tag...
015	Sometimes you have to, y'know...go for the ambush.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
016	Ah... A Black Star.
017	Did you know that I've never failed to kill anyone I've set my eye on?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
018	No one, except for Jin—oh, and one other numbskull.
019	What are you talking about?
020	It's my clan's duty to exorcise you demons.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
021	I just couldn't bring myself to kill Jin after you took possession of him, though.
022	You know, I always thought that things like faith, and intent...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
023	Were just a means for us to live by.
024	Funny isn't it? People change so easily.
025	Once upon a time, there was a boy who believed that static things like codes and traditions were everything. He didn't mind following them, either.
026	But, Jin, now... That guy never changed.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
027	Well, right up until the point he turned into a demon, anyway. Grr, argh, and all that.
028	He chose his own path.
029	He decided whether he would follow the rules, turn his back on them, or serve his own interests.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
030	His sister is the same, come to think of it... Quite the pair, those two.
031	You are every bit the dutiful little brat, aren't you?
032	Me? Nah. I just wanted to give choosing my own path a try, for once.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
033	Hm? That's—
034	Huzzaaaah!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0032
035	Ngh!
036	Losing someone you stood back to back with once upon a dream is...kinda lonely, you know?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
037	So I'm really just being selfish here.
038	Cause I really don't like you.	VO_ren.ren_battle_0010
039	That's...
040	Sumeragi?!
041	I totally called it, by the way.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
042	Jin's body was stolen, the Discarnate Power disappeared...and protecting Sumeragi fell to me.
043	I couldn't refuse the head of the Kagomurasaki, though.
044	So...I didn't.	VO_ren.ren_chara_2006
045	Hmm, y'know what?
046	Lending someone a hand isn't so bad.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
047	You...!
048	And as it turns out...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
049	I don't hate doing things fair and square, either.	VO_ren.ren_battle_0011
