001	It was my intention to decline, you know.
002	Let me guess, you couldn't because you're on the job?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
003	No, I am an adult. I was merely being polite.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0031
004	Well, you did a great job. Here, have some marshmallows!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0044
005	Please, you enjoy them.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0040
006	They're so squishy and delicious!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0024
007	Marsh...mallows?
008	Wouldn't you like some, too?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
009	I-I told you! I'm not really here! I can't interact with things.
010	Oh, I know.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0004
011	H-huh?
012	Ooh, they're so sweet! Squish, squish!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0046
013	N-now that's just mean!
014	Magic is merely a branch of Alchemy. Your country, Lustburg, has expanded upon it most successfully.
015	Lustburg... The matriarchal society and land of the witches.
016	Matri...archal?
017	Yes, and even that is merely a twisted kind of order brought about by power run rampant.
018	It is the curse of the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.
019	So Asmodeus...is a stone? A sacred one?
020	Don't you know about the Sacred Stones?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
021	Not a thing.
022	Is that true of everyone from your time?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
023	It's true of me.
024	Anyway, what's this about a curse?
025	A very long time ago, there was a witch who made a pact with Asmodeus in order to proliferate the curse. She is known as Mother, for being the mother of sin and calamity.
026	When a male child is born of man and woman, it becomes an insect. Such was the disgusting curse she inflicted upon her people.
027	(The power of Asmodeus...)
028	It's mostly women who possess the capacity for magic in the first place.
029	Those who are bereft of it are oppressed.
030	Wow. You've really done your homework on this! Here, have a scone.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0044
031	I'd really rather some tea.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
032	What's a scone?
033	You can...not have one, because you're not really here! What a shame!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
034	Y-you...! You knew I couldn't...!
035	Ahem. Those who are bereft of it are oppressed.
036	Right. O-oppressed...
037	The entire country is steeped in the tradition of matriarchy, in which its government and culture are also deeply-rooted.
038	Yet, some men from Lustburg—a select few—were once a part of the Holy Guard.
039	According to the database contained within my monocle, there was a man called Wilhelm...and, of course, there was Othima, the previous captain of the 6th Regiment.
040	However, even having made a successful career for themselves outside of Lustburg, they were always belittled upon their return. They were not allowed an iota of pride between them.
041	...
042	It is not my intention to denounce the entire nation, however. I know that the Court Mage Order, for example—of which Lofia, here, is a member—exercises its powers appropriately.
043	So those who can use magic are the ones who take care of the country?
044	Court Mages are the highest-ranking mages in Lustburg. They are proficient in and knowledgeable of both magic and academia, and they use their powers to maintain public order both within and beyond their borders.
045	However, those with strong magical leanings are almost exclusively women.
046	We're the right people for the job.
047	We have the power to protect nations, so we make use of it.
048	There are also those like Michael, who may not wield the strongest magic, but are still recognized as Court Mages for qualities such as wisdom and work ethic.
049	Just as there are those of us who believe that it would be better if the curse and the ridiculous discrimination simply disappeared.
050	I feel that way, and that's why I've been researching magic.
051	I've done what I can to protect my country. I went to those ruins, I found that book, and Milis, and I even...
052	So why is it...? Why did things end up like this?
053	...
054	Discrimination brings nothing but misery. I wish it'd all just go away.
055	Sometimes, I wonder why magic even exists.
056	Are you cold?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
057	I'm used to the cold, but...
058	I guess I'm still recovering.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
059	Here. Try eating this.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
060	What is it?
061	It's a pickle.
062	A pick...?
063	Go on. Have a nibble.
064	Umgf...
065	...
066	Bleuggghhhh! It's spicy! It burns! Bleugh! Gross!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0028
067	Th-they are meant to be a little spicy...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
068	Yikes!
069	Arrrgggghhh! It burns!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0027
070	To think, they're actually quite tasty.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
071	Y-you...! You...!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
072	This is my revenge for your staring earlier.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
073	Why don't you drink some tea?
074	T-tea. Th-that's a good...idea—arggghhhhh! It's so hot! It burns!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0028
075	Hahahahah! And there goes my revenge.
076	E-eat snow!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
077	Hmhm. It was also an apology.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
078	For...what?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
079	I'm partial to spicy foods, you see.
080	Oh. I get it.
081	I am sorry that I couldn't enjoy the sweets with you.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0036
082	I-it's fine. I don't think I can enjoy spicy things...with you, either. Bleugh!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
083	Hmhm.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
084	Perhaps it did sting a little, but...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
085	It did warm you up as well, yes?
086	Well, well, well. This was very thoughtful of you.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0034
087	I was hoping to shock you with these skewers of whole water lizards, but I got carried away!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
088	I am sorry to have disappointed you, my dear.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0035
089	Oh, it's fine! I had to run an errand for my grandma, and buy some presents, and...	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
090	There has been an urgent matter of business.
091	Oh, right! Lofy is out on some official Court Mage business, is she?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0004
092	Well...
093	So, when is she coming back?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
094	I promised her that we'd eat sweets together again, and that I'd tell her all about my homeland!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0008
095	Oh! And she said she'd teach me about how to be a gentlewoman like her!
096	It is likely that her return will take some time.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
097	Aww, no! What a shame!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
098	Oh, well! Anyway, you've got to try these water lizard skewers!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
099	May I?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
100	Don't let them go to waste! They're really yummy, I promise!
101	You've gotta tell Lofy how good they are, okay?!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0041
102	She makes this disgusted face whenever I so much as mention water lizard cuisine!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
103	If you recommend them, maybe she'll give one a try! They make you feel really great!
104	Heheh! So eat up! I'll make more for the next time we see each other!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0008
105	Hmm...
106	Yes. Lady Lofia has a good friend in you.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0033
107	Heheh... Heheheheheh! I guess so? I just love spending time with Lofy! It's so much fun!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0050
108	It is rather rude of her to have failed to greet you so many times.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
109	The next time I see her, I will tell Lady Lofia that she ought to visit you.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0038
110	You mean it?! Thanks! I'll be waiting!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0033
111	Ohohohohoh!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
112	I'm so excited!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0009
113	I'll be waiting! I'll wait as long as it takes!
114	Tell her she can come and see me anytime, okay?! Anytime!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
