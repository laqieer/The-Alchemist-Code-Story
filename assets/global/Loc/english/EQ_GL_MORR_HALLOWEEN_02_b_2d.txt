001	Grraargh!
002	The phantom dissipates in a flash of light, leaving nothing in its wake.
003	Huff...huff...
004	You did well, child.
005	I see great things in your future. You need only the strength to follow the path.
006	Eira...try.
007	No more...running.
008	Awoo!
009	That is heartening to hear.
010	I have no doubts you will soon leave that specter behind.
011	Now, this place...
012	Morrigan surveys the landscape, finding an open expanse of snowy fields.
013	Ah. Your guardians were to make for Lustberg, weren't they?
014	This pulse...
015	(The air is uncommonly heavy. Almost as if...)
016	...Something here.
017	Eira feel...at ease.
018	Hmm.
019	...I have seen enough. Let us wake.
020	Thank you, child, for sharing your heart.
021	Be well.
022	...
023	Eira's spirit takes hold of Morrigan's hand as the vision grows fainter.
024	Morrigan dispels her ritual, and returns to consciousness as her ravens greet her.
025	[Mistress.]
026	[Welcome back.]
027	[Was it as fruitful...]
028	[...As you hoped?]
029	There is something I would look into further.
030	Her "Big Bro". I speak of Soren.
031	[An old acquaintance...]
032	[He does not remember.]
033	[Or he does not wish to.]
034	It has been a while, yes.
035	The surface of the pool fades back into a clear reflection of the night sky at a wave of Morrigan's hand.
036	Now... We delve into the past, so that we may trace the future.
037	O Night, bring us a tale of the one who sought to replace bloodshed with scrap and steel.
038	Caw!
039	The pool grows murky, and faint figures pass over its foggy surface.
040	Shrouded in mystery. Are the memories not enough?
041	[Perhaps he resists scrying.]
042	[Impossible. Our Mistress sees all.]
043	Be that as it may, even the most discerning eye cannot pierce the mists of memory.
044	Or is there something more to this mystery?
045	A jolt of light runs across the murky surface, producing a shimmer in the fog.
046	...I see it. Be ready.
