001	Okay... So it's like they're Mega Taurus, and they're affecting all the other Taurus around Babel?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0045
002	Huh. Interesting. Sounds like you're definitely gonna need my Mecha Weapon on this campaign!
003	So? What're we waiting for? Let's get going already!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0008
004	O-Oh...	VO_budd.budd_sys_0011
005	What's wrong, Bud? I would've thought you'd be the first to agree with a proposal like that.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
006	I do agree, but...seeing someone even more charged up than I am zapped me of energy for some reason.
007	And why shouldn't I be worked up about this, huh? We can't let creatures like that run free! We've gotta do something about this before people get hurt! Right, Basheeny?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0016
008	The Giant Taurus have already wiped out the team most capable of combating them. This is going to be an incredibly dangerous mission, and it wouldn't be right for me to endanger a citizen like yourself.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
009	Basheeny!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0012
010	At least, that's what I should say—but honestly, I'm relieved to have you with us.
011	Your Mecha Weapon will help us save countless lives in our battle against the Taurus. If you are truly willing, I'd like to formally request your aid.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
012	Sure! I mean, I was planning on tagging along whether you agreed to it or not, but it's nice to be invited.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
013	Thank you, Judith.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0033
014	We believe that the cause of the Giant Taurus' rampage lies in their appetite for Alchemia.
015	If left unchecked, the Giant Taurus will eventually reach the Matter. We must act quickly, for this outcome must be avoided at all costs.
016	Huh? Matter?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
017	Matter is a substance powerful enough to rival the Sacred Stones.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
018	Wow... I didn't think that was possible.
019	In other words, if the Giant Taurus eats that stuff, we'll have an even bigger problem on our hands.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
020	As if the Giant Taurus weren't a big enough problem all on their own...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
021	The point is, we have to strike before that happens.
022	However, it's important to remember that the Giant Taurus we face this time are different from any we've fought before.
074	A single one of these creatures could likely corrupt the entire forest of Saga.
075	But Saga is not the only nation in peril. If they absorb enough power, these Taurus could threaten our world on an unprecedented scale.
023	It would seem that the Taurus we once fought have evolved into a new and more powerful species—at least, that's what I've gathered from the reports. It's also possible that they have reverted to some more primal form.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
024	If such things are indeed possible, I wouldn't be surprised if an even greater threat were to arise in Babel at some point...
076	Ugh... I sure hope not. This new kind is crazy powerful enough as it is.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
077	I think your father suspected this before any of us, Judith. He feared the advent of a threat that would eclipse the Taurus.
078	What?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
079	Your father... He sent a report on that subject to the Holy Order of Babel.
025	Oh... I didn't know about that report, but he wrote about a threat like that in his journals, too.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
026	What?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
027	These journals... You've read them, then?
028	Yeah. He mentioned some terrifyingly powerful creature that once roamed Babel...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
029	And that if it were to come back, humankind would face an unprecedented disaster...or something.
030	That's why my dad invented the Mecha Weapon: to give the world a means of fighting that creature!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0044
080	There's a bunch of other stuff in his journals, too, but most of it's kinda hard for me to follow.
081	Still, I can tell that my dad was doing everything he possibly could to protect this world that I live in—for me, and everyone else who lives in it.
031	I...see.
032	Thank you for sharing that with me, Judith. I appreciate it, but I don't think you should mention those journals to anyone else...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
033	For your own safety.
034	Y-yeah... You're probably right.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
035	...
036	Anyway, whatever ginormous monstrosity shows up next, we'll be here to deal with it and protect the people of Babel! Right?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
037	Right... Yes.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
038	The mere existence of immense Alchemic powers can throw the balance of this world into chaos.
039	Our role is to serve the world and its people by eliminating such threats in order to protect them from harm.
040	Eliminate...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
041	That reminds me of something you said before. "If something even has the slightest chance of endangering Babel, I will eliminate it, no matter how small the danger may seem."	VO_judith.judith_sys_0003
042	Then you said something like... "For the sake of our future, I need to be more careful."
043	I didn't know you paid so much attention to my words.
044	They probably stuck in my mind because I didn't like them. Even now, I can't say I fully agree...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0040
045	But now that I've seen more of the world, I kind of get where you were coming from. I get how easy it is for power to change peace into chaos.
046	That's why any big power is feared and mistrusted. I see that now.
047	(Even my new-and-improved Mecha Weapon is going to be seen as a threat by some people.)	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
048	(But even so, I...)
049	Judith...
050	I still can't forgive the Holy Guard for killing my father.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
051	But sometimes... I can kind of understand why it happened. I can see that you were driven by your own ideas of justice.
052	You shouldn't force yourself to understand, or forgive us. It's only right that you should hate the Holy Guard for what we did. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
053	You don't need to apologize. I know you're not the one who killed my dad.
054	True, but as Lord Commander, it is my duty to shoulder everything that the Holy Guard has done and will do: past, present, and future.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
055	For it is my mission to protect the peace of the continent and the world that has been left in my care. Both because that is my role as Lord Commander, and because it is my heart's desire.
056	Basheeny... I—
057	Hey! What do you mean "your care"? Don't act like this is all on you! The three of us swore that vow together! Didn't we, Bud?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
058	Exactly! Don't go thinking you're the only one protecting this world. That's why I became the captain of the Blue Flame Guard! To keep people safe, and...!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
059	And...
060	Bud?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
061	...
062	Basheeny is tackling his duty head-on, and fighting to protect everything that was entrusted to him.
063	But what about me? Isn't there more I should be doing as the captain of the Blue Flame Guard?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0016
064	Maybe I'm just...not cut out to be captain.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
065	Oh, come on! Quit berating yourself, will you? It's painful to listen to!
066	Huh?! D-don't tell me I said that part out loud!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0026
067	Afraid so.
068	Whew. Y'know, I had no idea you had so little confidence in yourself.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
069	Tch... Just forget you heard that, all right?!
071	H-hey! Bud! Wait up!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
072	What am I going to do with those two? Anyway... We'd better get a move on too, Judith.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
073	R-right!
