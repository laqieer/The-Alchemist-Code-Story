001	The party repels the monsters and escapes into a larger room, where they have more space to fight. Along the way, Minerva begins to puzzle aloud.
002	There's another thing I noticed about this facility.
003	Siegfried, you mentioned that you came across another such construct in a village in the Saga region...
004	For ease of reference, I am terming these creations "Alchemic Constructs". Or Constructs, for short.
005	Teach... are you really going to give a lecture right now?
006	Be glad I'm not having you take notes, although it would be nice to help jog my memory after...
007	I don't have any paper on me at the moment, but I'll pay extra attention.
008	You always do, dear.
009	Now... as we discovered prior, there were many other types and variations of what I believe are Alchemic Constructs.
010	Oh... that's what they were?
011	For such large scale production to be possible, there must have been instructions built, or fed into, their systems.
012	Given the level of technology we've seen in these ruins, manual input should not be necessary...
013	This means there has to be a main "Core" somewhere, giving directives to these other Constructs.
014	One far more sophisticated than the one currently chasing us.
015	GRRROOAARR!!!
016	If my hypothesis is correct, then we have much to be worried about.
017	What is the purpose of this "Core"? Was it awakened by someone? Why here? Why now?
018	And if there are other Constructs to be found as far as the Saga region, then we must consider the possibility that there may be more of these facilities across the world.
019	If, indeed there is someone behind all this... their directive appears to be a most destructive one.
020	Seeing as it's going to pulverize us now, that sounds about right!
