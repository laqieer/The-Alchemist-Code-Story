001	Huff...huff...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	I'm...so...done.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
003	So, Miss Tina... What do you want to do?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
004	I...still can't think. You went all out...didn't you, Lisbeth?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
005	Of course! I had to!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
006	Thank you...Lisbeth.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
007	You're welcome.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
008	I...want to go with Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
009	See? You tend to overthink things, Miss Tina. Well, I guess that is one of your good qualities, too.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
010	But sometimes you should just do as you feel.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
011	I'm somewhat responsible for Mocca's curse. Isn't it natural that I should accompany her?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
012	Then why don't you say so? Why do you need to suppress your feelings?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
013	I love Saga...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
014	So a part of me just doesn't want to leave. Not to mention...I'm scared of what may be out there.
015	But...above all else, I have my responsibilities. The Chief of the tribe should be there to help reconstruction efforts.
016	What right do I have to run off just because I want to? That wouldn't help anybody in Saga. I know that much, at least.
017	Miss Tina...
018	There is still the threat of the Jam to consider. I have the responsibility of defending the Toxotes tribe against them.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
019	Father entrusted the Toxotes to me, so... I have to...
020	But what you want is to go with Miss Mocca, right? Isn't that why you're so conflicted?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
021	But I...!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
022	Don't you want to go with her?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
023	I...
024	I do!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
025	Don't worry! I'll be here in Saga. Well, maybe not forever, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
026	What? What do you mean?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
027	Oh no! We're surrounded!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
028	Darn... I was too exhausted to notice! There are so many! This might be a problem.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
029	Well, there's only one thing we can do... Ngh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
030	Miss Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
031	Glurrrp!
032	H-huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
033	What are you doing?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
034	You don't mean to die here, do you? Get up, before you get in my way.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
035	Tehre! What are you doing here?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
036	Voda?! And Fuu?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
037	Looks like we made it just in time.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
038	Tamis sensed the increase in the number of the Jam. We rushed here after dropping off our Matter.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
039	We're here to fight with you!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0007
040	We can be away from our Matter for a short while. All we need is that short while to take care of this situation.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
041	Hmph, you can't even handle this situation, yet you claim you're the one who will defend Saga? Don't make me laugh.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
042	Why don't you just go wherever it is you want to go?
043	Were you eavesdropping on us?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
044	Heheh. Forgive his rough words. He can't help the way he speaks.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
045	He was the first one to notice that you weren't well, Tina.
046	You two are more alike than either of you are willing to admit. Maybe he understands how you feel better than any of us.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
047	That's enough talk. We have the Jam to get rid of.	VO_terre.terre_chara_1010
048	Tehre does have a point.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
049	Tina, there is no way you alone can shoulder the fate of all Saga. You should do as you please.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
050	B-but...	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
051	There are so many of them!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
052	Do not fret, Lisbeth. Now, Tina...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
053	We are the Sprite Trio of Saga. You haven't forgotten the extent of our powers, have you?
