001	Don't go looking for her.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
002	Oh? You've finally given up, have you?
003	She dumped me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
004	Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard (Memories)
005	Kaya is traveling.
006	She can handle herself—it's not her I'm worried about.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
007	What's that supposed to mean?!
008	I think you've made that quite self-evident.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
009	Don't play mind games with me! And quit looking at me like that!
010	With Captain Kaya gone, her second-in-command will have to fill her position. Which means the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard will be led by this reckless pair of living sideburns.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
011	Hey! Leave my sideburns out of this!
012	I predict that one day those sideburns are going to merge so fully with your beard that you'll become indistinguishable from a terrier.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0022
013	Stop making weird predictions! Actually, I might just try that!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
014	Kaya said that Monzein's passion makes him a pillar upon which the Holy Guard can depend. I trust her judgement.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0031
015	Hah! See?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0009
016	I'm afraid I have to disagree. Kaya ran a tight operation. I'm not convinced her deputy can manage things as effectively.
017	And yet Kaya is the one who appointed him vice-captain. Not only that, but I'm pretty sure she put you two together for a reason.
018	What?!
019	His axe cleaves the sky in two, while your arrows read the wind. He can cover your front, and you can cover his back. You'd make a good team.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
020	Hahaha! Come on, Seida! You know you can count on me!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0008
021	I could count your braincells, that's for sure.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
022	That's the spirit!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
023	Did you miss my sarcasm entirely?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
024	...
025	Hey.
026	Hm?
027	You look tense, Zain.
028	Is it that obvious?	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
029	Are you all right?
030	Sure.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
031	You don't want me to ask, do you?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
032	I think I understand how you feel.
033	...
034	It's hard to know what to do, isn't it?
035	When you're left all alone.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0020
036	Zzz...
037	...
038	Ack! M-morning!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
039	Man, it's dark in here.
040	Northern Pride: Archives (Memories)
041	It can't be that late already, can it?
042	Go home, Othima. Get some rest.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
043	Nope. Sorry. Can't do that.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
044	I can handle this alone. You need to rest. It's important—and mandated. Off with you.
045	Let me get this straight. The head of our order, the Most Reverend Bishop Waginau himself, is missing!
046	Not only that, but the former Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard disappeared without a trace after she handed in her resignation.
047	To make matters worse, Greed Dike—the big, powerful nation right next door—seems primed to attack us at any moment! You think I have time to rest?!
048	Everything's such a mess... You sure you don't know anything about all this?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
049	Sorry to disappoint... but no.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
050	Reaaally?
051	Really.
052	Hmm...
053	You think I'm a bit of a playboy, right?
054	Go home, Othima.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
055	But you know, more experience means more heartbreak, too.
056	Go. Home.
057	So I know what you're going through—I know what it's like to get dumped. You don't even know what you have till you lose it. It's even harder when it's someone special.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
058	...
059	This isn't like you at all.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0016
060	What would be more like me?
061	I don't know, but you know what I mean.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
062	It's what she always used to say.
063	That's the point.
064	I see.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
065	So please quit telling me to go home.
066	...
067	Sorry for dropping by so late!
068	Huh, Kanon? What's all that stuff you're carrying?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
069	Just some lights to brighten your night!
070	Sorry for the trouble, new kid. Guess I'm going to be pulling another all-nighter... Feel like joining me?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
071	No, thanks!
072	Darn. Rejected again.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0046
073	Lord Zain, you shouldn't work in the dark, either! You'll damage your eyes!
074	I... Right. Thanks, Kanon.
075	Here, take a light!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
076	An... oil lamp.
077	Are you going around handing out lamps to everyone?
078	Yup! I hate feeling useless—I figured this was the least I could do!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
079	How sweet.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
080	You can't get through all the paperwork and reading you have to do without light! So I rounded up a bunch of lamps to distribute to our hard-working captains!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
081	Well, you've got the right attitude, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
082	Yes? Did you have a complaint?
083	Just a little one. The oil lamp you placed there isn't just lighting up those books—it's burning them.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
084	Huh?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
085	N-no way! Fire! It's on fire!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
086	Ahh, this is nice. My fingers feel all toasty.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
087	Othima!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
088	Yeah, yeah. I'll head home already...
089	Don't go home now!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
090	But you just told me to.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0016
091	Oh no, oh no, oh no! What have I done?! What do we do?! Aaaahh!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0029
092	Fine, I'll handle this.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
093	You did it! Oh, thank goodness! A round of applause for Othima!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
094	Ice magic sure is handy. It can even prevent housefires.
095	L-Lord Zain, I am so sorry! I guess I really am useless...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
096	It's the thought that counts, right?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
097	So many documents went up in flame!
098	The more fiery the thought, the better.
099	Do people actually say that?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
100	Come on. I'll help you hand out the rest of these oil lamps, make sure they arrive safely.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
101	Are you sure? Won't that get in the way of your work?
102	It's fine. I'm going to be here all night, anyway.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
103	Othima.
104	Hey, you told me not to go home yet.
105	...
106	Your letter was among the documents that burned that day.
107	Ha... haha...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
108	It was startling how quickly those white sheets turned black and started crumbling.
109	Haha... Hahahaha!
110	It's all gone... All of you is... gone. Your words are mine to read no longer.
111	Hahaha... haha.. ha...
112	I recalled the smile you wore that day—the day you scoffed at the thought of me making you smile.
113	Hm...?
114	That's when I noticed something else among the ashes.
115	An... aster?
116	It was the bookmark I had given you.
117	You sent it back to me... You must have really...	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
118	I tried to read what was left of the only letter you ever sent me one more time.
119	Hm?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
120	Please don't try to get involved with me. Just forget about me instead.
121	I remember what it used to say, but the fire had burned away most of the words. Now it read:
122	Please don't —————————————— forget about me —————.
123	You...
124	That's where my talent for inspired understanding comes in handy. When something's missing, I fill in the gaps—but that's half the fun.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
125	I...!
126	I looked back on Kaya's resignation letters—the pile of them I had collected over the years.
127	You know... When you told me that you'd perfect the Holy Guard so that I could resign when it suited me... I was really touched.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
128	Kaya...
129	They never leave you, do they?
130	You entrusted them to me, didn't you?
131	Those words you wish you'd said.
132	I've finally received them.
133	The regret... It stays with you, doesn't it?
134	Yes...	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
135	Yet you cover it up with pretty words.
136	All we can do is our best, and continue to pass this task onto the next generation.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
137	There are things I want to pass on, and people I want to entrust them to.
138	People who I believe can find a way to carry that which I could not shoulder alone.
139	So I leave behind my words, in the hope that they will mean something.
140	This will be my will.
141	Even should my light disappear from this world, I believe that there are those who will shine on in my absence.
142	I shall leave this diary behind as my will and testament.
143	I do enjoy stories, you know.
144	Next time, I'll tell you a story that'll make you smile.
145	May this bookmark light the way, as a lantern illuminates the pages of a story read at twilight.
146	I shall entrust this half-read story to those who will succeed me.
147	It's time for the curtain to rise.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0012
148	Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard (Memories Close to the Present Day)
149	Greed Dike's First Invasion of Northern Pride
150	I am Zain, Lord Commander of the Holy Guard!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
151	Hear me, Greed Dike! Should any oppose this sacred sword...
152	Its radiance shall turn their shadow to light!
153	Our Lord Commander has been pushing himself.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
154	His unswerving stance against darkness is laudable. Truly, he ought to be made a saint.
155	But I'm afraid he shines too brightly for this world.
156	...
157	For his brilliance is such that it catches on places that do not wish it—like your Lost Blue. His light brings you nothing but misery.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
158	He threatens to rob you and your community of the only haven you have in this cruel world.
159	If you don't want to lose your place in this world, then take this dagger and put it through his heart.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
160	...
161	You have to kill to protect what's yours.
162	Kill him, or lose the only place you have—and your life.
163	...
164	Go. And do it properly.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
165	Zain... Your light is like a flurry of unwanted, unaddressed packages. Allow me to return them all to you.
166	At first, they will be your life raft—but sooner or later you shall drown, slowly, painfully, under their weight.
167	Know this: Even if your light did manage to reach every corner of this world...
168	It would not be received.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
169	Miracle Kanon Slash!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
170	Haa... haa... If all we do is defend, we're not going to last!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
171	How are they breaking through our ranks this fast?!
172	Kagutsuchi!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
173	Hey, airhead. Chin up.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
174	Kagura! I-I'm trying, but—!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
175	They've breached the gate. Some have already reached the castle!
176	Oh no! At this rate—!
177	This timing is just a bit too convenient, isn't it? We get invaded right after Saga, Lustburg, and Envylia all send us requests for aid at exactly the same time—something unprecedented in the history of the Holy Guard.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
178	Now our captains are scattered in different nations, leaving Northern Pride with only a meagre force to defend itself.
179	D-do you think they planned this?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
180	It definitely doesn't feel like a coincidence.
181	Don't look so bummed out. I'm here too.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
182	Captain Othima! I thought you'd already left for Lustburg?
183	Just thought I'd come say bye to my favorite commander first.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
184	Huh?
185	Well, that's surprisingly courteous of you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
186	That's how you like your paladins, right?
187	And yet you're as flippant as ever...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
188	About the mission... Will you leave it to me?
189	I will. I trust you.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
190	That's what I like to hear.
191	I believe in you, Othima.
192	Aye, aye. I won't let you down. Shall we get going, Captain of the 5th Regiment of the Holy Guard?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0037
193	Yup. Time to move out!
194	Are you going to make me worry out there?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
195	You'd better not bungle this one.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
196	You airhead!
197	The 4th Regiment will form the cornerstone of our defense. Your duty will be to protect the civilians!
198	Yes, sir!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
199	I'm counting on you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
200	L-Lord Zain!
201	Is something wrong?
202	I-I've always admired you! I mean, I will continue to admire you—forever!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
203	Wh-what's gotten into you all of a sudden?
204	You are our beacon of light.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
205	You brighten this world. Step by step, you are turning it into a place where everyone can smile and enjoy peace.
206	That's why I dream of becoming a shining beacon, just like you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
207	I want to shine my light, illuminating this world and everyone in it!
208	...
209	I'm going to become bright enough to rival you one day—you can count on that!
210	You're already a little too bright, I think.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
211	Well, the brighter the better—I have to be able to reach everywhere! I've got to be brilliant enough to illuminate the farthest corners of this world, and pierce right through the deepest darkness!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
212	I'm going to reach every single person who needs a light!
213	I-I see!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
214	Besides...
215	Hm?
216	I can just take a step back if I get a little too blinding!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
217	Oh!
218	Haha... Ahahaha! Good point.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
219	What's so funny?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0016
220	Haha. I'm not laughing at you. It's just... I can't believe it's so simple.
221	I thought I had to get close to people to help them—but sometimes the opposite is true, isn't it?
222	Well, closeness is important too.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
223	Come, let's do what we can to illuminate this world!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
224	You have to make it through this battle, okay? No matter what! We need you!
225	I'm glad to know I have an ally like you fighting on my side. Yes... I will make it through this. No matter what.
226	You'd better! I'm counting on you, too!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
227	...
228	To think that it was so simple...
229	I need only ensure that those who need my light, receive it...
230	And keep a little distance from those who find it too bright to bear.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
231	Now... Enough talk. It is time for me to fight.
232	I won't back down until the end.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
233	After all, I am prepared.
234	I have already passed on my will.
235	Both in writing, and in spirit.
236	...
237	Now I just need to start planning my retirement.
238	Is Greed Dike's target truly Northern Pride? Or could it be...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
239	Something else?
240	Tch...
241	You...!
242	Nice to meet you, Lord Commander.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
243	So I was the target.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
244	I didn't know it was you, Mister Blank.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
245	So you and Waginau joined forces with Greed Dike?
246	We're just business partners. That's all.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
247	I... see.
248	Wish I didn't have to do this.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
249	Me, too.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
250	I mean it.
251	Don't look so down. I'm used to this sort of thing, being a VIP and all.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
252	Haha...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
253	We each have to do what we must.
254	Right... Let's get this over with.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0007
255	You puffed up justice warriors are all the same.
256	I cannot afford to fall here!
257	You never managed to light up our cesspool of a city, did you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
258	I—!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
259	You're all talk, no action.
260	I'm sick and tired of hearing about your "absolute justice". What do you think justice is, anyway? Sweeping the undesirables out of sight and acting like you never did anything wrong?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0030
261	You were only too happy to let me go to save your own skin.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
262	...
263	Geez. You're one to talk.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
264	The pursuit of world peace does demand one's best efforts.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
265	Your country, your comrades, your precious notions of peace and justice...
266	Tell me—how does it feel...
267	To die without protecting a single one of them?
268	You couldn't even protect one girl.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
269	You're right, both of you. Everything you say is true.
270	Of course it is.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
271	But that doesn't mean it's over.
272	What're you talking about?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
273	In order to illuminate others' darkness, your light must be passed from hand to hand.
274	Naturally, lighting up an entire world will take a considerable length of time.
275	You don't have that kind of time, I'm afraid. Your light will be snuffed out like a candle flame long before you have the chance to realize your fantastical dreams.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
276	Be that as it may, my dreams won't die with me. I can pass on my words to the next generation, and my successors can keep my will alive through generations of—
277	What good does that do for the people who are suffering in the cesspool right now?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
278	"Let's imagine that you want to get fish to live on land. For argument's sake, let's say you can understand fishspeak."
279	Tch!
280	"In fact, let's say that you even know everything there is to know about the ocean. Do you think you could save them all?"
281	I admit... it sounds impossible.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
282	So you gave up? How spineless of you.
283	However, if fish ever decided that they wanted to live on land, and bathe in the sunlight...	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
284	Then at least they would know that I was protecting the world in which they could do just that.
285	That's—!
286	Watch me, Waginau. I shall protect the peace of this world.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
287	I am tired of hearing about your inflated sense of justice.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
288	Too bad, because I'm not going to stop talking about it!
289	Why? Because you're the Lord Commander?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0012
290	No.
291	Because that's who I am!
292	Pfft... Hahaha!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
293	And what are you laughing about?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
294	He's right.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
295	Oh?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
296	Just now, he reminded me... that I'm really not being myself at all.
297	Are you planning to betray me?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0012
298	I dunno, is it still considered a betrayal if I hated your guts from the very start?
299	Don't be foolish!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
300	That's all I am, isn't it? Just a dumb beggar you scooped up off the streets of Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
301	Now you're starting to sound more like yourself.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
302	How about we take this one on together, pen pal? For old time's sake?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
303	After all, we can't have you walking around without a bodyguard in a crowded area like this, Mister VIP.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
304	Do you mean it?
305	Just doing my job. I can always kill you later.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
306	That doesn't make any sense.
307	The point is, you're not allowed to die yet.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
308	Right.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
309	I still haven't replied to your last letter.
310	Killing me will not change the world!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
311	But it will save lives!
312	You cannot stop the tide of history!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0040
313	Perhaps I cannot.
