001	Whoa! You're flying, lady! What's with that wand? I wanna see it! Can I touch it?!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0046
002	Huh...? No, look...Rega...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
003	Hey, could I fly with this as well?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0001
004	It's moving with magic so it might be a little difficult. Are you interested in these kinds of things?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
005	Yeah! Apparently, my grandpa was a merchant who dealt with weapons...so I like weapons too!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
006	Hey, can I look at it more closely?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0001
007	U-um... Right now might not be the best time. How about next time, okay?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
008	Yay! That's a promise, lady!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0024
009	Seriously. He's just a kid. Why did Tehre choose a kid as his envoy?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
010	Knowing that boy, I'm sure there's some reason behind it. He's a clever little brat.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
011	Rega...we are all from the same land of Saga. We can work things out without fighting.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
012	I think so too, but...Tehre...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0030
013	Grrr...	VO_kiki_adel.kiki_adel_sys_0006
014	Kiki...Adel...haha, stop...it feels ticklish!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
015	Both Kiki and Adel feel the same way. You understand that, right?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
016	Yeah! But...I wonder what I should do.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
017	What exactly is Tehre trying to do?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
018	I'm not sure. But he says that, if he can't get the Sacred Stone, he'll take out both Voda and Fuu.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0031
019	He said that it's for the good of Saga, so I...
020	We won't let him do that. Just leave it to us. Right, Mocca?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
021	Yeah. We're going to protect Saga. Will you help us too, Rega?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
022	... ...
023	Tell Tehre that we'll go to him. Tell him that we can talk things over without resorting to such measures.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
024	I guess I can tell him that, but, I'm part of Tehre's people, so I can't betray him that easily.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0030
025	That being said, how are we going to get out of this situation? Before we consider talking things over...let's try to survive our current predicament.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
026	What is that kid doing? Where's the signal?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0016
027	That's why I didn't want to leave it in the hands of a blasted child!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
028	Forget the signal! Sooner or later, we'll be invading anyway! Attack!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
029	What...they didn't wait for the signal?! Is that even allowed...?!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0026
030	No! We must protect the settlements!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
031	Ack! Everyone, brace yourselves!	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
032	That being said, as long as they keep up this pincer attack, we're spread fairly thin!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
033	Ack! But we've gotta try! Keep damage to the minimum!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
034	For Kiki and Adel's sake as well...I can't let Gluttony invade us like this...	VO_rega.rega_battle_0019
035	Rega...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
036	You guys should focus on the troops coming from the Forest of Rukifojio! I'll ambush the army coming from Port Nahema!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0041
037	What?! What're you gonna do on your own? Don't let your life go to waste!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
038	Don't worry! I'm good at these kinds of things! Let's go, Kiki, Adel!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0038
039	Rega!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
040	Let's believe in him, Tina! Right now, we need to focus on the enemy in front of us!
