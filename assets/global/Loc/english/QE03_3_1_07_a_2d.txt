001	You...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0012
002	I want to make this world a place where everyone can love each other.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
003	If one side were to be killed off, that wouldn't be possible!
004	No one should be sacrificed. If someone were to protect someone, then that person should protect someone else...and on and on—
005	We could all live together like that. That's the kind of world I want!
006	That's why I want to do something about Asmodeus!
007	I want you to listen to each other and stop this fighting! It's only leading to casualties!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
008	Hah...hahahah! That's quite the dream, Lisbeth.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0023
009	Your dream is warm and fuzzy...and empty.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0013
010	!!!
011	For the last 200 years that I have been queen, not once has this country been under threat.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0003
012	That's how impenetrable the love for my people is.
013	I love all the men and women in my country for the different purposes they serve.
014	That's why I can protect all of you whole heartedly! The way I love my people is different from other rulers!
015	Isn't that a little twisted?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0016
016	You make it sound like all your subjects are possessions!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0045
017	Of course, they are. I am the queen, so I own and love all my people.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0014
018	It's been historically proven that rulers who loved their people too much are eventually destroyed.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
019	Hm...destroyed? That's reserved for the destroyer herself to say.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
020	The destroyer, huh?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
021	However, this country will not be destroyed! Like the spirits gathered here, it will continue to live on.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0015
022	You should let them sleep now.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
023	Your subjects were born in this land, ate from this land, and will sleep in this land before being reborn.
024	Dust for dust. Your distorted ways should be remedied. In fact, you are the distortion and you should be remedied.
025	You are the Corpse that refuses to die. How dare you speak of such things to me!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0013
