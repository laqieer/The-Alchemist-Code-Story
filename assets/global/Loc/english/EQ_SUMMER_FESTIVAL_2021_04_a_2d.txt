001	Uwaaah!
002	Hey! You sobering up?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0010
003	S-Sorry! S-So sorry!
004	Geez... Are you all right?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
005	Y-Yes...
006	I was just walking around the festival, and then those guys... Thank you so much for getting me out of that mess.
007	You're involved with the festival, right?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
008	Indeed, I am. I hope that through the festival I can make people properly aware of Wadatsumi culture.
009	Wadatsumi culture?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
010	Yes, in fact, I am from the family of a Wadatsumi priestess.
011	I see...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0020
012	(No wonder this festival feels so nostalgic... Someone with Wadatsumi priestess ancestry is involved.)
013	My ancestors were targeted for their lineage, so they were forced to flee for their lives.
014	When Wadatsumi was invaded, the world was told of its ill repute as justification, and that reputation wasn't easy to fix.
015	The people of Wadatsumi weren't allowed to explain themselves. They could only run. So my ancestors fled to the depths of the world.
016	But they were discovered because the Wadatsumi priestess's voice could be heard.
017	...
018	Of course, what had been done was unforgiveable. Plotting to conquer the world, that is.
019	But because she fought for us, the evils of the Wadatsumi invasion were brought to light.
020	If she'd not done what she did, I'm sure we'd still be suffering because the truth wouldn't be known.
021	Now that so much time has passed, I no longer have to hide my lineage or flee like my ancestors did.
022	We are still often misunderstood, but more and more people are willing to learn about Wadatsumi.
023	Now, I have the chance to share our culture... And it's all thanks to her efforts back then.
024	Interesting.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
025	Oh, excuse me! We'd only just met, and here I am telling my entire family's life story. Well, I'll go back to meandering.
026	...
027	She who bore the weight of hatred but was not crushed by it... Her determination has done so much for her people.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
028	Füry achieved what she set out to do.
029	Whether I fall or not, the damage we do to our oppressors is now a part of history. If it sheds even a little light on Lost Blue...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0002
030	That dream I entrust to you.
031	So... Button did not succumb to hatred.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
032	(You knew what you had to do and you faced it head on. You were amazing, Button.)
033	(I couldn't do what you did.)
034	You don't need a knight. You became strong enough on your own.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
035	I realize now that I'm even less worthy to take her hand than I thought.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
036	...
037	The question of worth...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
038	It sounds more like an excuse to avoid trying.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
039	...
040	What's that? There's some kind of ruckus.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
041	What's the matter?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0002
042	Ah, it's you from before!
043	The thing is, the implements we use for our rituals have been stolen. They aren't very valuable, so they weren't guarded.
044	But they've been in my family for generations, and they strengthen a priestess's power. I need them to bring solace to my ancestors' spirits.
045	They empower a priestess?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
046	Maybe we need more power. If we had...
047	I remember now...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
048	(Those idiots must be planning to bolster their own ritual with the ancient implements.)
049	(They're going to ruin everything after Button fought through everything, as hatred threatened to consume her...)
050	...I can't stand idly by.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0019
051	Huh?
052	Um, Miss... Why don't you let me worry about the ritual artifact stuff?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
053	They were stolen, so I'll get them back.
