001	- The Greasy Barrel -
002	I'll have your best whiskey.
003	Here's your Dark Label.
004	...Much obliged.
005	If I may trouble you some more, where is the best place for one to track down a person around these parts?
006	Heh, what's this? We finally have someone with manners.
007	You might be outta luck though. You must not know of this place much then, stranger.
008	People who lurk in this place mainly fall into two groups. Those who don't want to be found and those who you don't want to run into.
009	I'm pretty certain you know more than what you are letting on though.
010	Well, this place sees the most traffic... If you hang around long enough... you might have some luck.
011	I heard that there was a rather reputable "broker" for these sorts of things in the underworld.
012	Hush! You might not want to... *sigh*... Too late.
013	What are you, a softie? Like your friend the "broker" eh?
014	You must be hard of hearing. I'm looking for leads to track him down.
015	You outsiders coming in here looking for "leads" can only mean you are out to ruin our haven here.
016	That fella has only caused trouble for me and the boys!
017	You got it coming if you think we are just going to sit by and let you take us down!
018	Here we go again... *grabs as many glasses as he can*
