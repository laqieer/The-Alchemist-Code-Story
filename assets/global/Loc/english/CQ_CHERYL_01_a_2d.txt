001	Now then... The investigation is done. All that's left is finishing the report.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
002	Hey! Cheryl!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
003	It's been a while! What a surprise running into you here. Are you also working on something now? 	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
004	Yes, and by you saying "also," I assume you're here with mercenary work?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
005	Yup. Just finishing up guard duties. It seems you're travelling to many places because of all the requests.
006	That's right. It also means they're recognizing my talents.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
007	Well, there are a lot of things going on for me as well.
008	A lot of things?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
009	Really! Listen, Cheryl! Reagan did it again with...	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
010	...um, this'll be a long story. Actually, you and I have been so busy recently and we haven't been able to talk much.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
011	Since we're together now, why don't we have lunch together? I know of a good place with spicy food which I know you love.
012	Sounds good! Oh... but I'm sorry. I still have to finish writing my report.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0036
013	I'm planning to take a break after work is done... And the report is part of that so...
014	You're a workaholic... Don't be so hard on yourself and be a little flexible, won't you?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0029
015	Flexible...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
016	Oh... Sorry. Maybe it's too sudden and work is important.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0036
017	An inquisitor's work must be difficult, and you probably don't have much free time.
018	No, it's not like that. Some people write up their reports after returning to headquarters.
019	Although there are regulations stating that reports should be written after an investigation is complete, so I'm trying to follow the rules...
020	So, it's okay then. Then, what's the problem?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
021	...
022	Actually...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
023	I cannot agree to this! Why are they allowed to do things their way?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
024	Even if we are discussing the extermination of heretics, it was against protocol to raid the laboratory without an inquisitor!
025	Well, technically it was against protocol. But because of that, the heretics were caught. We have to be a little flexibile with the rules.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
026	That may be so... But there should be consequences!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
027	Inquisitors must follow the rules. If they don't, then what is the purpose of having rules? It is their role to make people follow protocol.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
028	Cheryl... What you say makes sense and of course it's important to follow protocol.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
029	But if we follow every rule and regulation, we're bound to miss important details along the way.
030	But...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0029
031	Cheryl. Do not forget where we place our stance on rule violations.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0045
032	I see. So that's what happened.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0044
033	I know there's a point in what you and my superiors are saying. But I just can't accept it.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0030
034	As I see it, if we follow the rules, we won't end up like them.
035	(Like those who become so obsessed in their research that they forget about their own daughter...)
036	Cheryl...
037	…If you break the rules, the offender as well as the people around will suffer the consequences... So it's my duty to follow the rules.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
038	Sadness from losing someone important can't be repeated.
039	Plus, as an inquisitor, I should be tough on myself as well. I have to take the lead on bringing down the heretics.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
040	I really admire how strict you are, Cheryl.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
041	But you sometimes have to just take a break.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
042	And so... Let's eat some... Aaahh!
043	Nnngh...
044	Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry about that... What's all this? Your clothes all torn up.	VO_courage.courage_battle_0019
045	And that pale complexion. It's like something scared the soul out of you...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
046	Ah, there you are!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
047	!
048	You're wasting our time. Hurry, let's go!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
049	N...No!
050	Hey, what do you think you're doing?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
051	This little girl is injured... Let go!
052	Hm? Who the heck are you two? Get out of the way.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
