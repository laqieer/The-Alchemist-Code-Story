001	Agh! Uggghh! I-it's still not over yet!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0022
002	Just give up! You can't beat me. Don't make me wield my sword anymore!
003	No! I won't...ever...give up!!!
004	I'm not gonna lose to some guy who draws his sword against his own family!
005	What?
006	Why did you draw your sword against dad again? Are you going to discard our bond as a family?!
007	You should save those words for that man.
008	That man? Are you talking about dad? Agh!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0024
009	We were being deceived! That man...he only saw Agatha as a tool!
010	Dias, what are you saying?!
011	He's nothing more than a traitor who seeks to overthrow the king! Besides...the father I long for is dead!
012	Y-you're wrong!
013	Shut up! If you're going to defend that man, then you're just as guilty as he is.
014	Agh! Ughh...!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0022
015	I'll save Agatha! I'll not give her up to that traitor!
016	Di...Dias...!
