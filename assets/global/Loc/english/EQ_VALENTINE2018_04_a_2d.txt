001	It's unbelievable that so many monsters could enter the school grounds...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
002	The effects of the Rainbow Cacao are much greater than I imagined. According to my data from this experiment, we should have a fairly wide margin of error for the ceremony.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
003	Ceremony?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
004	Oh, it's nothing for you to be concerned with.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
005	In any case, I am grateful that you were able to keep the students from getting into too much trouble.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0033
006	O-oh, well... You're welcome?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
007	Here is some Rainbow Cacao for your trouble. If you would like to make chocolate with it, I can give you special permission to make use of the home economies facilities.
008	That's very generous of you. Thank you.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0009
009	Well, then. I shall take my leave and allow you to return your attention to the school's defenses.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0041
010	Wow! I didn't think they would let us use the home ec room! How nice!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0009
011	Isn't it just the school’s students who are strictly prohibited from using it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
012	Oh, I see...	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0045
013	...
014	...
015	Uh oh... Seems like we can take down monsters, but not this stony wall of silence.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
016	It's getting painful to watch...	VO_porin.porin_sys_0020
017	Hey, are we done with these monsters yet?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
018	Um... For now, I guess.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
019	Then I'm going to take a quick break. I'll be right back! Call me if you need me.
020	W-wait! Emma! Ah... She's already gone.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0025
021	That's Emma for you...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
022	Noah?! What? Where are you going?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
023	She's not hearing me at all. I guess she's preoccupied by the whole Emma situation.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
024	It's really sad to see the two of them at odds like this. Usually they get along so well.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0016
025	There must be something that we can do. I just can't seem to think of anything good.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0020
026	Hmm...	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0031
027	Oh, I know! Let's put this Rainbow Cacao we got to good use! Why don't we suggest making chocolate to Noah? Hopefully it'll melt the ice!
028	I like that idea!	VO_eve.eve_chara_1012
029	But it's against the rules to have sweets and such on the Academy grounds.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
030	The Court Mage from earlier said it was fine to make some using the home economics room. My bigger concern is whether or not Noah will be willing to let it slide...	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
031	Ah... That might be the bigger problem.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0011
032	It's time for our second annual Valentine's Day event! Woah, hey. Do you see that? Is that...Noah?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0023
033	Where did you find all these books, Noah?! What are...? These... These are books about how to make handmade chocolate...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
034	"100 Chocolate Recipes for Conveying Your True Feelings"? There's a subtitle... "Perfect for those who have difficulty expressing themselves!" And this is "The Beginner's Guide to Chocolate: Chocolate in Social Culture".	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0031
035	Noah... Don't tell me...?	VO_porin.porin_chara_1009
036	I borrowed these from the library. I want to make some chocolate, but I don't really know anything about it, so...	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
037	I know that Emma loves chocolate, so I thought it might be nice to make her some. Hopefully it's not too late for our friendship.
038	I know I went too far. It's important that I acknowledge that and apologize to her. Plus, I thought I might be able to understand her perspective a little better if I tried doing something she likes to do.
039	Part of me doesn't like the idea of breaking the rules, but...it's more important to me that I do what I can to make it up to Emma.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
040	Here... Take this.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
041	Huh? This is...the green cacao of courage!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
042	The green cacao has given me strength when I needed it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
043	I'm sure that it will give you the courage you need to repair your relationship with Emma.
044	...
045	Just don't forget that it's not just about the chocolate, but also about what you want to convey to the person in question.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
046	Albea... Thank you.
047	But before all that... I guess we'll need the last of that Cacao after all!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0022
