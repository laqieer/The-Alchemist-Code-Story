001	Hey, Kagura, what did you want to say?
002	Ohh, that's right! I finally found him!
003	Thank you for helping me. My name is Mizuchi.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0034
004	I see! So you're the boy who ran away with Chihaya.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0045
005	Yes. I helped Chihaya escape from that menacing Alchemist.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
006	So what about Chihaya? Where is she?
007	She was with me until a while ago, but our pursuer found us.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0029
008	You two got separated?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
009	I hid her at a specific place while I drew the pursuer away, but when I returned she wasn't there.
010	Oh dear! We need to find her quickly before they do!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
011	How about we go back to where you hid Chihaya?
012	I was thinking the same thing! It's over here!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
013	Hmm. So those are the famous Paladins that I've heard so much about.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0004
014	They seem rather trivial, but I can't afford to brush them aside.
015	Besides, I hadn't expected that girl to be alive. Heheh...hahahah!
016	How amusing! The more that stands between me and my domination, the more I feel it's worth it!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
017	That said, after I find that shrine maiden, I'll carefully observe just how much strength they have.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0031
