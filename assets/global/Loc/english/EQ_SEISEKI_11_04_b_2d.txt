001	Waginau... Have we received what we need from him yet?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
002	Unfortunately, no. I apologize. It seems the task may have been beyond his capabilities.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
003	Heh. No matter. What I really want from him is the disruption of the battles he inflicts upon the Holy Guard to buy us more time, which he is doing splendidly at.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
004	That is true. It allows us to focus our attentions on the Tower of Babel.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
005	Exactly. At last, Waginau, the time is ripe for us to collect our just rewards.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
006	Indeed. Now...shall we proceed?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
007	Yes.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
008	The complete annihilation of Northern Pride is about to begin!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_1015
009	Our priority must be to claim the heads of the Emperor of Northern Pride and the Lord Commander Kanon!
010	If we take out those two, the country will collapse under its own weight. Now, let us proceed!
011	Nimul. Come forth!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
012	Greed Dike's main force has started speeding up. Ready yourselves, Paladins!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
013	We just got word that the left and right flanks are moving as well! The front line is...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
014	Basheeny and his people are moving to intercept. It's not the time to panic yet. Battles are not won with sheer numbers. We must stand strong!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
015	Understood! We of the Holy Guard are the last bastion of "absolute justice" in Babel! We must not fall!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
016	We must not let them gain any ground!
017	We have received word that there are immortal soldiers in all of the enemy platoons!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
018	Send reinforcements to support the advance guard! Hurry!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
019	They're already here? They were much faster than I expected...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
020	I spent all that time prepping Excalibur for a big battle, and now I wonder...what was the point?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
021	...! What...?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
022	What is this incredible power of darkness?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0021
023	Hm... I'd better get over there. Seems like something pretty big is happening!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
