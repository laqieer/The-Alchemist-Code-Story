001	Gather round!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
002	We are about to begin the training session. But before we begin, be noted that there have been a number of incidents involving bandits in the area.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
003	The knights will handle the situations. But for you cadets, it is your duty to obsereve and report any suspicious activities.
004	Yes, sir!
005	Right. Now let us begin. For today's session, this will be a joint session with the knights, so do you best!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
006	A training session with actual knights? I'm nervous…
007	Hm? Why so nervous?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
008	Well, because they're the real deal. And I've never even seen one up close.
009	And to be able to spar with real knights? This is a rare opportunity.
010	…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0044
011	Oh, I guess for someone like you with a brother that's a knight… It's not a big deal for you.
012	…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
013	I heard that Fraise was so great that he even received an award during training. Isn't that right?
014	That's amazing. Gino, I'm sure you'll be just as great. I mean, you are his younger brother after all.
015	Again with that…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0016
016	Hm?
017	Nothing… Nevermind.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0019
018	(Everyone everywhere always saying "Fraise is great!" Ugh, I can't deal with it.)
019	(I want to lash out and release my frustrations, but I know if I do that, it would make things worse...)
020	(He's only just become a captain. What does that have to do with me?)
021	(Ugh… So frustrating.)	VO_gino.gino_sys_0030
022	Hey, look! The knights!
023	Hmm…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0044
024	(Perfect. I can let out some frustration through some sparring.)
025	(The other cadets are a bit too weak. I'll be able to let out more strength against an actual knight.)	VO_gino.gino_sys_0007
026	…and that concludes the rules for today. But before we start, here is a word from the commander.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
027	The knights that will take part in today's training session are the latest Royal Knights.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
028	Simply stated, they are newcomers. They are close to you cadets in age and they should also be close in skills.
029	For you boarding school cadets that will protect Envylia in the future as knights, take this as a grand opportunity.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
030	And now, let us begin training!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
031	Um, You are my partner…? I mean, are you my partner?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0002
032	Yeah…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0037
033	I'm Victor! Nice to meet you.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
034	…
035	W-what's wrong?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
036	For a knight, you don't seem like much. How can I put it…? Like, weak looking.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
037	Huh?
038	These other cadets are no match for me, so I was looking forward to sparring with a real knight. But a newbie? What a disappointment…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0044
039	H-hey, what's wrong with you?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
040	I…I mean, hey! You really shouldn't talk to a senior like that…	VO_victor.victor_sys_0011
041	Stop that silly act… It's disgraceful.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
042	Wha…?
043	If you want respect from me, don't blabber. Show me with your sword!
044	I want a fight that I can put my power into. So show me what you got. Don't let your guard down or you'll get hurt!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0010
045	…!
046	With all my might then?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
047	You're a brat with some confidence. Alright then.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
048	If that's what you want, let's have some fun.
