001	Huuuzzzzzzaaaaaahhhhh!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0008
002	Gah. They have nothing but numbers.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
003	Even so, if this continues, it will not end well. Our stamina will run out, sooner or later.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
004	So what? You want to die here? You want to just forget about your duty? Is your conviction really that weak?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0004
005	My...conviction...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
006	We'll just have to figure out which of us is worthy of ruling this world! I'll show you my conviction!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
007	(My conviction...is...)	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
008	(I want to protect. It's not an obligation, or something determined for me. I simply...)
009	(Before I noticed it, I was shackled by mental chains that I placed on myself.)
010	(Protect Yomi. My duty, my wish...my conviction!)
011	(For that, I will break these chains!)
012	I won't die here! Purple Poison - Triple Torment!!!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0007
013	What the...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
014	Hyaaaaah!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
015	Tch! Curses... Everyone, retreat!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
016	Gahahahaha! Nice job! You finally showed me a little of what you can really do when you get serious.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0008
017	I am always serious. However, this time...it seems you taught me a valuable lesson.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
018	It's time to continue what we started. It seems it will finally be a proper battle. Brace yourself, Zangetsu.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
019	Ha!
020	Gahahahaha! Now that you mention it, you were hungry weren't you? Here.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0023
021	A...rice ball.	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
022	In thanks for getting serious. Someday, let's settle what we started. Doing it now would be tasteless.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0005
023	Instead, let me ask you something, Jin. What is your conviction, anyway?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0002
024	To protect. To...protect the things...I want to protect.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
025	To protect, huh? Ahahaha! This is fun! That's an answer I definitely couldn't give!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0045
026	To think that kind of need could be responsible for the power you unleashed just now... Hm... Protecting things is a mission statement I threw away long ago.
027	I think it's an idea I'll have to keep close. This is good-bye, Demonic Killer Jin. Let's cross paths again someday.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
028	Zangetsu, what will you do now?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
029	I'm going to stay on my path of conquest, of course. Along the way, I'll just show off my strength for anyone I run into!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0037
030	(Zangetsu... To think there's a man like that in Wadatsumi...)	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
031	(But he was worth meeting. Perhaps we will meet again someday.)	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
032	(Yomi... Where are you? What are you doing? I will protect without fail, until my end.)
033	I'll show you the proof of my conviction.
