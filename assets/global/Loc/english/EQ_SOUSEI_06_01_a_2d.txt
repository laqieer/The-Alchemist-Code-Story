001	—The footsteps of disaster have arrived on our doorstep.
002	The beast stirs. Soon we'll be able to feel its breath on our necks.
003	This is why we need hope. The choice to accept the end...
004	That ending which was predetermined... To erase the sins of the past and start afresh—
005	So this is where you've been.
006	Oh? Now this is a rare sight.
007	What inspired a people-hating shut-in such as yourself to leave the room in the middle of the day?
008	Huh? It's not like I hate people, or even particularly dislike them.
009	Bold words from someone who can't even make eye contact with anyone besides me or the master.
010	I'm not that bad. Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else?
011	I'm just teasing you, grumpy. Don't get into too many fights once I'm gone, will you?
012	I'm afraid I can't hold it off much longer.
013	So... You're really going?
014	Yeah... There's not much time left.
015	If we humans wish to survive this calamity, then I'll have to venture into the outside world.
016	But...
017	There must be something we haven't tried yet. We only just started our observation and research, so if you could wait a little longer—
018	...I leave that in your hands, Ambrosia.
019	...!
020	While you search for a solution within these borders, I will search outside of them.
021	Then, even if one of us is to fail, the other will be able to pick up the slack.
022	...Snf.
023	C'mon now, no crying... You know I'm terrible with this kind of thing.
024	Don't worry. I'll definitely be back.
025	No matter how far I go or how long it'll take. I'll definitely be back.
026	That was the last time we spoke.
027	It may be some silly long forgotten promise by this point, but—
028	—it was a promise I made to someone I saw as a little sister. I can't go breaking it now.
029	So I'll definitely come back. No matter what I must sacrifice to make it happen.
030	This I swear in the name of the Infinite Serpent.
031	—The continent shudders with what is to come.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0016
032	Wrath... Rage and loathing that burns with endless flame.
033	They wriggle and writhe in that sea of crimson in their attempt to change the very core of humankind.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
034	Will Satna's wrath be able to cleanse the Ira Belt?
035	I wonder what lies ahead...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
036	You are determined to go, then?
037	Yes. This is the only way to gather more information and stop whatever the Infinite Serpent is planning.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
038	That's why we must infiltrate the heart of the Ira Belt, where their castle lies.
039	I'll be there to guide them, of course.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
040	Honestly, I fear I wasn't too much help in subjugating the Leviathan back there.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
041	So all I can really do is beg and plead for you to save my country anyway.
042	No need to be humble. You were quite helpful in that last battle.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
043	And your guidance through these foreign lands will be more than enough aid.
044	Unfortunately, I fear we won't be able to approach the Ira Belt by airship.
045	What?! My baby is capable of withstanding any weather or terrain!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
046	We can handle it! Didn't I carry you through that blizzard in the Luxuria Belt?
047	I seem to remember you crashing...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
048	Yeah, you crashed.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
049	That was for unrelated reasons! If it wasn't for Asmodeus we would've been fine!
050	He's not wrong. That airship of his can take a beating.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
051	So even I'm a bit confused about why you wouldn't want to take it...
052	Remember the words of the Fallen King Arius for a moment.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
053	Haha, fools! You don't even understand that much? Your techniques rely too much on concentrating the magil into a single blow.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0008
054	But my magil is the type that burns down everything it touches! It will not bend to such a weak will!
055	He may have been a Fallen gripped by madness, but his sword was steady and his tactics were executed with purpose.
056	But he did not use any magic or other such techniques... No, rather...
057	It would be more accurate to say that our—Mira's—powers had little effect on him.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0025
058	Exactly. That's what I'm thinking.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	It's possible that magil isn't a readily available resource in the Ira Belt.
060	A...resource?
061	For example, if Ambrosia's magic is something that adds color to magil...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
062	Then the Ira Belt is a place that makes magil burn and deteriorate.
063	It's possible that our techniques were less effective on the mad king for that very reason.
064	I see... Space-Time Manipulation is especially dependent on manipulating the magil in the air.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
065	If something meddles with the magil in any certain location, the effects of Space-Time Manipulation would be considerably reduced.
066	Wait! Doesn't that mean we're just deadweight?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
067	Oh... I see. And the airship needs to absorb a lot of magil from the atmosphere to fly, so—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
068	There's a chance it won't have the power to keep moving when we get there.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
069	Indeed. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just some minor malfunctioning machinery, but we can't risk a crash.
070	This ship is our primary mode of transportation. We can't afford to lose it.
071	Perhaps it is overly cautious, but that is why I'd rather not use the airship this time.
072	Aw, man. I mean, that makes sense. Still...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
073	What're we gonna do instead?
074	We could take the airship to the border and then continue on foot.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
075	But I fear there won't be any place to hide the ship when we get there. We'd have to risk leaving it out in the open.
076	Ngh...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
077	Actually, I have a proposal.
078	If you're departing for the Ira Belt, please allow us to lend you our aid.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0002
079	You would?
080	You've helped our kingdom survive to see another day. Please allow us to return the favor.
081	We will deploy the Purple Flame Knight's fleet. Additionally, we will construct a garrison near the border and prepare for a quick evacuation if necessary.
082	We appreciate the offer, but do you know what you're offering here?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
083	If you do this for us, the Ira Belt will likely consider it an act of aggression.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
084	It will be seen as an attempt to launch an invasion by your side.
085	We understand the consequences.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
086	Rest assured, we do not act solely for your sakes. We have our own concerns as well.
087	Your own concerns?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
088	The "night of fire rain"... Andechs, you spoke of this calamity before. Did you not come to seek our aid in order to prevent this disaster?
089	I did.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
090	In other words, this calamity threatens the existence of the Ira Belt, not unlike the way Leviathan threatened ours.
091	It would be easy to save our own hides. All we'd have to do is shut you out.
092	We could avoid tragedy by pretending there isn't one playing out before our very eyes.
093	But I could never do such a thing. It goes against everything Invidia Belt stands for.
094	As those who were saved by another, so do we have the duty to save others.
095	We must lend a hand to those in the Ira Belt, for they are humans just like the rest of us.
096	Your Highness, will you...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
097	Yes. I've made up my mind.
098	From here on, we will do everything within our power to save the citizens of the Ira Belt.
099	We will strike down the Cursed Beast that's causing this calamity, as well as the mastermind who orchestrated this conflict.
100	Furthermore, if the Ira Belt is to reject its people, we will receive them with open arms.
101	So you'll take in Ira Belt refugees? So that's why you said you'd set up camp at the border.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
102	But the Invidia Belt is limited in space...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
103	If you undertake such an operation, your own folk may be forced to compete for resources.
104	There's no need to worry about such a thing. Right, Imnus?
105	Yes, my liege!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0001
106	The ocean has started to recede with the defeat of Leviathan.
107	The ocean is receding?
108	Indeed. It's been centuries since we've last observed such a phenomenon.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
109	But at this rate, the Invidia Belt's territory is set to double by the time it abides.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0007
110	We will be able to cultivate these new lands and we hope that doing so will allow us to enter a new era. One where we can allow even more people to live freely within our borders.
111	You're the one that brought about this blessing for us, Nimul.
112	This was our doing?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
113	That's why I tell you not to worry. Instead, focus on your own goals, and choose the path that will save even more people.
114	...
115	Nimul? What are you looking at?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
116	Oh, Emmel...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
117	I was looking at the ocean. It's slowly pulling back, just like the king said. They're going to have the move the harbor at this rate.
118	Isn't it great, though? Your actions managed to reduce the causalities in this region, even if it was just a little bit.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
119	True...
120	What's wrong? Tell me.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
121	I thought you'd be happier about all of this.
122	I am. There's just something gnawing at my chest.
123	I know that the Invidia Belt expanding its territory is a good thing.
124	But I feel...displeased with the idea of saving people just by accident.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
125	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
126	I still don't understand the truth of this world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
127	I barely understand what my own actions entail.
128	Isn't okay not to understand it in its entirety? You still saved all these people. That fact doesn't change.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
129	It's fine to take it one step at a time. Or to make mistakes, or get confused sometimes. As long as you just don't give up and keep going.
130	We'll just keep on moving. I'm sure the sky at the end of the road will be the most wonderful color.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
131	...Yeah. I hope it will be...
132	Make haste, make haste! Be ready to sail at dawn!
133	Our lead ship will carry the airship! Careful now! Don't scratch it! All our hopes ride on it!
134	Are all the supplies on board? Excellent, get ready to set sail!
135	Dang, look at that spirit and dedication! Wish I had someone like that to work for me.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
136	You've got to be popular for that to work. Take a look over there. King Patricius just oozes charisma.
137	Think you could act like that?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
138	No... No, I could not.
139	Mira's going to scold you guys if she sees the two of you playing around like that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
140	You can depend on them when it matters, but it really is like watching kids sometimes.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
141	Heh. Someone sounds like a cranky old man.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
142	...
143	Do I...?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
144	Nimul, preparations for departure have been completed.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
145	Yes, thank you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
146	There's one more thing. I'd like to accompany you.
147	It'd be a great help, but are you sure?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
148	Yes. This was also the king's wish. As the Shield Maiden it is my duty to protect the peace of these lands.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
149	Well, your help would be very welcome then. By the way—
150	Do you know what she's doing here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
151	L-Lady Nicaea?! Why are you on this ship?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
152	Phew, I made it! I just figured I should come and lend a helping hand.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
153	You have to do no such thing! Why are you here?!
154	Well, when it comes to the ocean, no one is faster than Selsieg here.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0005
155	That's why we'll be doing patrols! At least until we hit land.
156	Bwrii bwriizp!
157	I didn't hear a thing about this! Don't tell me you snuck onboard without permission?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
158	I-I swear I told someone! I even asked Imnus for permission!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0029
159	...Fine. But don't be too reckless.
160	Of course! I'll be good!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0037
161	Bwirruru, bwri!
162	Oh, Selsieg? Did you spot something?
163	Not good! Stand back, my lady!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
164	Gyuuuugyuuugyuuuaaa!
165	The monsters of the ocean critters must be bewildered by the change in their habitat.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0044
166	I'm sorry, little ones. But this is our ocean now!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0035
167	Return from whence you came!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0002
168	Briiiwp!
