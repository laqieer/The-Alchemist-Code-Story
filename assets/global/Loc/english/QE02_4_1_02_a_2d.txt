001	Seriously. Their assaults are growing more ruthless even within the city. Don't let your guard down, young lady.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
002	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
003	Now that we know about the underground facility, the Beckrams only option is to eradicate us.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
004	There's no turning back now. We've burned our bridges. You need to understand that.
005	O-okay!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
006	So...how long are you gonna maintain that bizarre expression on your face? If you want to make me laugh, I told you to try something else.
007	And if you, you bizarre creature, are gonna bother my thinking process then go somewhere else.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
008	You...if you're thinking about the pedestal, I told you there's no point unless you're at the clock tower.	VO_taras.taras_sys_00
009	I'm not thinking about the pedestal. I was remembering the old man's words.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
010	Unlike you, I was thinking about multiple things at the same time, idiot.
011	The old man's words?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
012	He told me that the Sacred Stone Belphegor is the anchor to quelling this chaotic land, that, if it were stolen, it would lead to the destruction of this world.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	I was thinking about what he meant by that.
014	The anchor, huh? Do you think he was talking about using the power of the Sacred Stone to quell something chaotic?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
015	Probably...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
016	Why ‘land'?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
017	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
018	The Elester family used the power of the Sacred Stone to quell the greedy humans who came in search of Philosopher's Stones. That's what the legend says.
019	Looking back at history, it's always been humans who have been chaotic.
020	Thinking of it that way...shouldn't it be ‘chaotic humans' instead of ‘chaotic land'?
021	...!
022	Squeak! Squ-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
023	Yikes! Here come the Alkaroids!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
024	Tsk. Now isn't the time for idle contemplations. Let's go, comb head!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
025	... ...
