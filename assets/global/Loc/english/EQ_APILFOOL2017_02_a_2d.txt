001	Phew...I'm so hungry! Today's shift is...oh, I lucked out! It's the Apple Garden! I'm gonna eat lots of apples!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
002	Forests that have apples have a high concentration of Alchemia. That's why special apples grow.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
003	In order to protect these special apples from being over-picked...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
004	Hey, Metal Ratty!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0021
005	Numa!!!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
006	Huh?	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
007	Numa, numa!
008	I didn't know that's how you spell a Ratty's cry.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
009	Numa, numa!!!
010	That's what the sound director says, so it must be correct. Hmm. I see...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
011	Numa.	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_c
012	Oh, sorry. Went off on a bit of a tangent.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
013	The Ratty clans are the ones who protect this forest. If you really get careless here, people are gonna abuse it.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_b
014	Numa, numa.
015	I mean, it's humans that are gonna suffer if they abuse the forest and they can no longer get apples, right?	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
016	Numa, numa!
017	You're so cute and even hats look good on you guys, but you're always being hated on and called annoying.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
018	Numa, numa, numa!!!
019	For starters, you guys are supposed to be cute mascots that've been around since the beginning of the Ratty clans. I can't believe they haven't made a single piece of merchandise after you guys.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
020	Yeah, totally...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
021	If you're going to say that, the Rattys at least stand a chance because they're cute...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
022	We look this way, right? Merchandise is just a dream that'll never happen for us...sigh...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
023	Numa...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0020
024	Are you trying to cheer me up? Thanks...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
025	Numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
026	Whew. They've already come before we could eat. All right, let's start work.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
