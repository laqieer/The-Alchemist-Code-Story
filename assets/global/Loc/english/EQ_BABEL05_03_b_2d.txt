001	I'm sorry for getting you involved in this.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0036
002	Oh, there's no need for that. This sort of thing is a part of the humdrum of my everyday life.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
003	R-really?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
004	I'm happy to have another person who I can talk to without fear of keeping my ears covered.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
005	It must be uncomfortable.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
006	Besides...
007	Yes?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
008	Isn't there someone who you look forward to talking to, regardless of what should happen?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
009	Y-yes! There is!
010	As there is for me.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
011	Sophia...
012	I also feel that I should like us to have such a bond.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
013	I'm...not great at talking.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
014	That's fine.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
015	This is the first time I've been out and about in ages.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
016	Albea.
017	Y-yes?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
018	It's been a while since I left my own village and went into the city, as well.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
019	Taking awfully long naps each day and ending up lazing around at home all day afterward...
020	I-I don't exactly oversleep, I just...!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
021	We each have our own preferred pace.
022	I say that we two proceed at a leisurely pace, as fellow homebodies!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0008
023	Homebodies...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
024	Did I misspeak? I am sorry if I offended you.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
025	Oh, no. Not at all.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
026	I'm probably a lot more of a shut-in than you.
027	I assumed so.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
028	Neither you, nor I, have a thing to worry about.
029	Please feel free to come and see me any time you like.
030	Thank you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0033
031	Heheh.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0008
032	Wh-what?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
033	The snow has melted, hasn't it?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
034	As for the path to your brother, well...	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0016
035	Hey.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0002
036	Albea, if your brother will do as he sees fit...
037	You just don't learn, do you?	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
038	Much like how you will do as you see fit...
039	You got a new set of cards? Nice.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
040	Then perhaps...
041	You know I never lose.	VO_magnus.magnus_event_1007
