001	Hah!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
002	So that is the end of that... For now, I suppose.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
003	Seems like it. Hmph. I even left the city to try and stop their pursuit, but...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
004	I didn't expect them to keep up this onslaught. Time and place don't seem to mean much to them.
005	Corpse... The dark side of the Holy Guard. Looks like they've got expendable fodder aplenty, too.
006	Corpse has their fingers in every pie, from important seats in the offices of every country in Babel, to places among the ranks of the knight orders.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
007	Only a select few are privy to the big picture, however.
008	And you are one of them.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0045
009	...
010	Now you've turned your back on them. Why the hell would you do something like that?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0001
011	That is irrelevant.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
012	I have my own objective. We had a disagreement, nothing more.
013	I expect you'll pay for that one of these days.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
014	Hmph. You think I would lose to those fools?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0040
015	They're an enormous organization, on par with nations—that's like going toe-to-toe against a colossal beast with a will of its own.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
016	Nothing they do, whether it be good or bad, can be stopped by just one person.
017	It's good to be proud of your strength, to be able to rely on it. However, it is foolish to underestimate one's enemy as a result of that confidence. It won't end prettily.
018	Tch. I don't want a lecture from you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
019	I am doing what I think is right. No more, and no less. Should that take me down a path that is difficult to traverse, then so be it.
020	Hmmm... So no one who can contest that strong will of yours has appeared before you yet.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0045
021	You are an unfortunate fellow in some ways, young man.
022	What do you mean by that?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
023	We have finished making room for the wounded, sir. Sorry for troubling the two of you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0035
024	Don't worry about it. You've been good to my cousin.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
025	Hmph. I thought she was still a child, but then she went and crossed the desert all by herself.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
026	Seems like she's finally got some sense of self-preservation.
027	Heh, look at you! Who knew you had a soft side?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0044
028	Hmph.
029	Anyway, why haven't they come back yet? Kamui and the others should be here by now...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
030	There isn't much to gain by hanging back. If we're meeting up, it's better to do it sooner rather than later.
031	According to the scouts' report, Gluttony's army has crossed the border.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
032	If we go back to the city, we could at least provide a diversion so that—
033	No, not yet. Now isn't the time.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
034	What do you mean? Are you just going to sit back and watch them slaughter the people of the desert?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
035	Why do you think they are invading the Desert Zone in the first place? What do they have to gain?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
036	That's... Well, now that you mention it... Not much, I guess. They've still got the civil war going on in Gluttony Foss, don't they? Why are they sending soldiers all the way out here?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
037	Corpse.
038	What?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
039	They have the same objective as Corpse does... Is that what you're trying to say?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
040	Hmph. Clever.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
041	Corpse rarely makes their moves obvious. Yet this time, they have done just that. It was almost as if they knew that Gluttony Foss would invade.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
042	They aren't the only ones. You appeared, too, as if you had foreseen it all.
043	Both Corpse and Gluttony Foss are seeking the same thing—and what is that?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
044	They want to get their hands on a druidic priestess.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
045	Then there's the group that Marie called the Collectors of Wisdom... Don't tell me this Corpse or whatever wants Marie, too?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
046	All of this has come from the lingering vestiges of the vision of one man. It amounts to nothing more than nonsense spouted by a deluded fool.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
047	As the survivors of an ancient race that is now all but lost, it is up to us to cleanse this filth from their minds.
048	Now, as for what happens next...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
049	I expect Gluttony's forces will prepare for their second invasion.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0004
050	They certainly faced some losses, but it will only take a week for reinforcements to arrive from the royal capital. We should expect that that will be all they will need to regroup.
051	They may—no, because they have suffered such a large and brilliant defeat here today, they will—dig in their heels all the more. Not to mention that even now we're at a huge disadvantage in terms of numbers.
052	We may have won the day, but that day will soon end. This is merely my opinion, however.
053	I agree with you. There are no fortresses or citadels in the desert that require resources on a large scale.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
054	The climate is in our favor, but that alone won't help us push back their army.
055	Then what're we gonna do? Even if we keep poking, we'll just end up getting ourselves killed.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
056	Right. That's why we have no option but to go on the offensive.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
057	The Gluttony army may have the numbers, but those numbers will also serve to slow them down. We need to decide the battlefield for ourselves and get there first, so that we can get the jump on them.
058	You wanna set up some kind of guerrilla warfare? There's nowhere to hide in the desert, though. I guess we could just keep hitting them at night...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
059	You're right about catching them unaware, but our target won't be the Gluttony army.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
060	We're going to attack the jewel in Gluttony Foss' crown, the royal capital itself... Eos.
