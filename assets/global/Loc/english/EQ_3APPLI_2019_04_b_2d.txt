001	Nin! Nin! Nin!
002	Love! Love! Love!
003	Urgh! I can't take this anymore!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
004	Get away from me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0028
005	Love!
006	Get away!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
007	Love!
008	Stop that! Shoo! I'm sick of hearing that word! You've said it so many times that it sounds alien to me now!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
009	It doesn't matter how many we defeat. They just keep coming!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
010	It's only natural. They're the embodiment of your longing, after all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
011	Oh, dear! In other words, so long as Almace, Mira, and Hiiragi are here...!	VO_titania.titania_sys_0020
012	The Lovesickness will keep coming, for as long as they have longings. Heh.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
013	If we go back to our world, we'll have to fight till the end of our days!
014	Tch!
015	There'll be no love, no collecting pretty stones! We'll just keep fighting, fighting, fighting! Just endless gray days of fighting!
016	I-is this...how I...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0018
017	Don't wanna go home! Never, ever, ever! Wanna be a normal girl, forever!
018	How can we possibly deal with this mania?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0042
019	Don't worry, Ragi-Boo. I'll fix everything for you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
020	Oooraaahhh!
021	You don't ever have to go back. Let's just love one another; it'll be perfectly nice and normal. There'll be no need for you to fight anymore.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
022	Oooooraaahhh!
023	Heheheh. Now my Hiiragi Harem is complete!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
024	Oh, my! The Hiiragi clones are all crowding around Nyx!	VO_titania.titania_sys_0025
025	At this rate, the Hiiragi Harem really will be completed!
026	Can't we stop it?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0027
027	We have to! If he completes his harem, then...! Um, what will happen, exactly?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
028	I will be indirectly, but fatally, humiliated!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
029	Oi! Nyx! I can't handle having this many little sisters! Their eyes are super unnerving, too!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0028
030	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!
031	Huh?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
032	Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooraaaaaahh!
033	Wh-what's...?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
034	N-no way! The clones are...trying to devour Nyx with their corruption!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0021
035	Oops. This looks pretty bad, huh? It's just as I thought.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
036	N-Nyx?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
037	I'm sorry, Mira.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0036
038	I can't go home.
053	Nyx! Now...!
054	Mira. Maintain time correctly.
055	N-Nyx...!
056	D-do you have a plan?
039	Nyx... Don't tell me you...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0027
040	Nyx! No freaking way! You're not going to die by being swallowed up by these freaky girls! Don't let that be your fate!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
041	Unghh!
042	I'm... I'm sorry.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0035
043	All of this was brought about by my indecision.
044	So if I go back...everything will be resolved.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
045	Leave Hiiragi be! Her life cannot be exchanged for that of another kunoichi!
046	Come to me! I'm right here!
047	I'm so sorry, everyone...
048	I had a lot of fun with you all.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0018
049	This is just like that time... Th-that time when... When I died!
050	H-Hiiragi...?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
051	Nyx!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_battle_0022
052	Can you hear me?! It's me! Hiiragi!
