001	Whoa, are those... ALL Constructs?!
002	An incredible number of Constructs in all shapes and sizes populate the room, each working on its assigned task.
003	The Constructs seem to run autononously and largely ignore the presence of Siegfried and the others.
004	The laboratory appears only partially restored, but the sheer number of functional Constructs indicates it is more or less operable!
005	Simply incredible! This particular site must have been meticulously maintained.
006	Minerva notices the Constructs from before extracting glowing glass containers onto tables.
007	...Hmm? What are they doing?
008	*Whirr...* *Clink*
009	The Construct carefully tips the contents of the chipped vial into another vial.
010	Those must be the Constructs from before. And that vial...
011	Yes. That was what attracted the monsters just now.
012	Given how sterile this environment is, leakage of the substances into the surrounding forests should not be possible.
013	Over there, Teach. I think that's our answer.
014	*Sniff sniff* *gobble*
015	Ugh, I was right. They ARE getting their Alchemia fix.
016	Hmm. So it's just like in the Lustburg ruins...
017	They're artificially enhancing these creatures with Alchemia-laced substances, but why?
018	And did the creatures escape into the forest, or were they intentionally released?
019	So much to think about...
020	Hey! Who's there?!
021	Intruder alert, code yellow! All security, move to engage!
022	Grrrooowwwll!!!
023	Alchemia-enhanced... security monsters? You have got to be kidding me.
024	Quite a sticky situation we're in... We're trapped.
025	Teach, can you and Soren watch our backs?
026	Absolutely.
