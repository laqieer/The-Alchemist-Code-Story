001	It was just a promise made between children.
002	It isn't right!
003	I know it isn't! Sacrifice?! Emmel, why?!
004	There are so many other people here in the village! Tons of people way better at Spiritbonding than we are!
005	But...this is just the way things are here in the village, Nimul.
006	Only certain people have what it takes to become the Vessel of Purification.
007	And this time, it's me. It was decided before I was even born. This is my destiny.
008	That's not true! I heard it was supposed to be Eulalia, but she can hear the voices of the spirit... You know, of the dragon.
009	So the chief said that because that makes her too valuable to sacrifice, it would be you instead!
010	So, you'd rather...
011	No, I... I don't want Eulalia to be sacrificed either.
012	But I really don't want you to be sacrificed!
013	Okay. But so what?
014	What do you mean, so what?!
015	We fought in circles like this for ages. But in the end...
016	Fine, then...
017	Then I'll change it! You say this is just the way things are? That this is how things have to be? Well, maybe so, but that just means they need to be changed, so I'm gonna change 'em!
018	Really, now?
019	I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!
020	That's my dream, okay?!
021	And just like that—just like always—our fight ended with the echoing sound of my brother stomping out of the room.
022	Off to change the world...
023	I swear! He's so childish. Was he trying to comfort me, or annoy me?!
024	That's what I thought at the time, but thinking back on it now, that sentiment of his...
025	It was an impossible promise. Yet, knowing he meant it from the bottom of his heart really saved me.
026	...!!!
027	Where...? Ngh?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
028	Ow!
029	Emmel?! So good to see you awake! Don't move yet, though, or you'll hurt yourself.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
030	Eu...lalia? Where...am I?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
031	We're a ways out from...Hierosolyma? I think that's what the city was called. It's the capital of Superbia Belt.
032	How much do you remember? We were brought here through Quence's Space-Time Manipulation.
033	Quence's... What?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
034	Aaaaaaaargh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
035	Oh, no, Nimul! Is he—? Nffffffffgh!
036	I told you not to move!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0012
037	Good to see those eyes open, boss! How are you feeling?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
038	Awful, if I'm being honest. You're the one who brought us here?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
039	Yeah. We made it out by a hair's breadth.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
040	What's the status of the Cursed Beast cores?
041	Ah! I... What?! No! The power of the Cursed Beasts I took into myself... It's all gone?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
042	Ah, crap. Good thing I got us outta there when I did, then. That thing musta been the complete package after all.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0022
043	Wh-what exactly does that mean?
044	It means that everything is going just as my father planned. The preparations for the Ceremony of Creation are complete.
045	Helene! I'm glad to see you're okay as well.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
046	Yes, I'm fine, though my brother isn't quite so lucky.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
047	...
048	Ignacio...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
049	He's alive. That's the best I can say for him right now. But he sure won't be regaining consciousness anytime soon.
050	What should we do with him? Should we just kill him now and get it over with?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
051	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
052	Hey, now, don't give me that look! Didn't he betray you?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
053	That's a pretty standard punishment for traitors.
054	...
055	Eulalia, could you heal him, please? My brother's Alchemy has likely left him with considerable injuries.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
056	Emmel...
057	Please.
058	...All right. If you insist.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
059	Are you...certain? I am... I'm grateful for your mercy, but...he did try to kill you.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
060	Right now, I think we have more important things to worry about than individual grudges. Wouldn't you agree?
061	That's not how people usually react, though.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
062	Even if they understand the circumstances, they persist in their hate. Even when they know there's nothing to be gained by holding a grudge, they refuse to forgive. Isn't that how this usually goes?
063	...But it wasn't my brother he aimed to kill.
064	It was me. If it were Nimul he'd attacked, maybe I'd... But, no, it wasn't. So I have no problems looking the other way, for now.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
065	What...are you saying?
066	Besides which, Nimul only hurt him in the heat of passion. I'm sure he regrets it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
067	He wants to save everyone, after all. Hurting people is against his nature.
068	So all this pain and grief that was caused here today...I can forgive, and forget.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
069	And I can extend that grace to anyone who will stand at my brother's side, even if they happen to be my enemy.
070	...
071	I remember I once said you were arrogant, just like Father.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
072	Yes, you did, didn't you?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
073	I humbly retract those words. In actuality, I don't really know what you are. I can't even entirely understand you. You're just very...peculiar.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
074	P-peculiar?
075	Perhaps I just don't know enough about the world to know any better. But I really do think you're a peculiar person.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
076	...I don't know what to say to that. I'm not trying to be different. This is just who I am.
077	Hey, Quence?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
078	What is it? I don't particularly want to talk to you any more than I have to, you know.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
079	You really dislike me that much?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0025
080	I'm someone who always follows his heart, no matter what, and you're kinda the exact opposite. Just one look into your eyes and it's plain as day.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
081	Nothing worse than talking about real issues with somebody when they've got their head in the clouds.
082	Well, somebody's certainly grown up to be a sourpuss. Not to worry, though. Your flaws don't bother me at all. I can rise above them.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
083	...
084	All right. So, what do you want?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
085	I've been wondering. Everything up till now has come to pass through the machinations of the Infinite Serpent.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
086	But it's unclear what exactly the Serpent's plans are for Nimul. What do you all even want from him?
087	No idea.
088	Wh-what?
089	I might've said something about this before, but I really just jumped on this bandwagon after someone else had gotten it going.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0004
090	I'm in it for the journey, and frankly don't really care about the destination.
091	So...you're useless, then.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0010
092	How rude! There are countless other ways you could have put that, you know. I saved your lives!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
093	I can answer your question.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
094	Here in the land of Pride, our greatest desire is one that we believe Nimul can help fulfill through the Ceremony of Creation: to shatter the Shell of the World.
095	Shatter the Shell of the World...? You mean...
096	Yes. The sky that we see from here is not the true sky. It is a mere veil created by the one who controls this world: Ouroboros.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
097	So long as it exists, no matter how we thrive, this world will never truly be ours.
098	Ouroboros...
099	But Ouroboros is the one who maintains this world. All of the Belt Regions are her domain.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
100	Yes. She does oversee this world, as it is.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
101	But that doesn't mean she cares about it, or wants to help it out in any way.
102	Ouroboros has only one goal: to keep the world from changing any more than it already has.
103	That's...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
104	Not so different from what you want, is it, Emmel?
105	...
106	The dragons who came before us devised the Ceremony of Creation to return this broken world to its original star form. It is a ceremony of revolution and rebirth.
107	Its purpose is to provoke change, which is something Ouroboros simply cannot abide.	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
108	It goes against her nature—her very being.
109	But the immutable nature of the world no longer serves any purpose. We need more than stasis now. Unfortunately, the sheer scale of the problem makes it a complicated one to address.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0017
110	Yeah. It's kind of like we're all trapped in an enormous egg.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
111	And in order for us to be born, that egg's gotta hatch. Only, the shell is too hard for us to crack it without using some really special tools.
112	So that's where Nimul comes in, I guess. He's like the pointy beak that we've been sharpening for this exact purpose.
113	But all of that just begs the question: What now?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
114	I say, in for a penny, in for a pound. I'm ready to see this thing through to the end, no matter what you've got in mind.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
115	Well...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
116	...Huh?
117	The world's gone...all white. I... Why...?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
118	——! ...——!!! ——!
119	Waginau? Ugh. What are you even—?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
120	Zafeiris is—! Use—!
121	Wait... Wagi—
122	——...! ——!
123	Wake up, Adaleigh!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
124	Gnaaaaaaaaaaah?! Get away from me, you old—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
125	Huh? Wait, what's...?
126	...
127	Waginau saved us.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
128	Uh. What?
129	He and his live-in dragon phantom protected us from the Light of Judgment. That's the only reason we're both still alive.
130	What?! But... Aaah...
131	Waginau? Waginau saved us?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
132	...
133	We should not waste his sacrifice. Let's find Nimul, and quickly.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0015
134	Sacri...? Haha. You're... You're kidding, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
135	You have to be!
136	There's...no one else here. Not even enemy soldiers.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
137	...
138	Don't tell me... That light, it... Did it...? Everything?!
139	Here we are. This is the deepest point.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
140	Wh-what the... What's happening here?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
141	Adaleigh. Look.
142	Huh?
143	Nimul! Thank goodness you're oka—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0003
144	Stay back!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
145	Nimul? Come on, what're you saying?
146	No. This... This isn't what...I wanted...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
147	Nimul?!
148	Adaleigh!
149	This magil... The Cursed Beasts...? Nimul... You didn't!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
150	Yna... Stay away... Stay away!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
151	Argh?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
152	Urgh!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0022
153	Nimul!
154	I can't...control the cores... Nrgh!
155	I hadn't expected this. The cores...of seven...Cursed Beasts... They're all interfering with one another...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
156	Wait, Nimul! If that's the power of the Cursed Beasts, then—!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
157	Ngh! This pressure... This power!
158	Old dog...!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
159	Could you...please not right now?!
160	Taurus' Anti-Curse... It's having no effect?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0020
161	No... Yna, this magil, it's...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
162	It's not...of the Cursed Beasts... They were never anything more...than vessels...
163	Ngh... Go!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0001
164	...
165	What?!
166	He converted physical matter into magil and...consumed it?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
167	No. The Truth of this world cannot allow for us to approach this stone...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
168	Alchemy is the same. This stone... It understands. It is aware that this world is made of magil. Or rather...
169	Urgh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
170	You...created it? That is what grants you the right to change this world? I...see...
171	What are you talking about?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0003
172	Just...get rid of the stone! If you keep this up, it's not going to end well!
173	I can't... This stone, it's... It's like it's stuck to me now. The ceremony... It's starting!
174	...!
175	Adaleigh, can you reach him?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
176	Of course! And we're going to stop him!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
177	Stop...me...?
