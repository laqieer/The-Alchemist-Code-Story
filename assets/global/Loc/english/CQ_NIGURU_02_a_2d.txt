001	Hm, just as I thought. The Wratharis Research Laboratory is under the Holy Guard's control. I doubt they would let us simply walk in.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
002	(Soon after the laboratory was assaulted, we searched through the secret room, but the tome was already missing.)
003	(There is only one who could have taken it. But was there really a chance to do so in the chaos of the fire and director's death?)
004	(Perhaps there was some assistance, or even prior knowledge of the attack.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
005	...
006	(Good grief.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
007	(Still, telling Ila now to not follow me would fall on deaf ears.)
008	(I'd much rather avoid getting her riled up and drawing attention. I suppose it is best to let her do as she wills for now.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
009	(That being said...)
010	(Hold your breath and wait for the right moment. Watch your target's habits and anticipate their next move.)
011	(Though I know she has a distaste for sneaking around, she's putting what I taught her to good use.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
012	Now then.
013	According to what I heard, those who worked at that laboratory were all persecuted.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
014	Was there anyone who evaded the persecution?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
015	Well... I haven't heard anything about that.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
016	I see.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
017	...
018	Hm... Not a single lead. This is turning out to be more difficult than expected. So whispers the darkness within me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
019	(With so little information, there's really nothing to support the possibility that anyone managed to get away.)
020	(Still...)
021	(It looked to me like that informant was hiding something.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
022	Then wait for the cover of darkness I shall.
023	...
024	...
025	!!!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0026
026	Heh...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0008
027	You seem to be having fun.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
028	Hmph... What do you want?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
029	There was something I forgot to tell you earlier. It's about the researcher you're looking for.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
030	Since you've been a loyal patron of mine for quite some time, I figured I could tell you. For a price, that is. Just a simple favor.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
031	A favor? I'm almost afraid to ask.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
032	Nothing too difficult for someone like you. I just need someone dead. You can make that happen, right?
033	I'm sorry, but I've retired from assassination.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
034	Oh, come on now. All I have to do is yell and this place will be swarming with Paladins. We wouldn't want that, now do we?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
035	...
036	(Hm... If I were alone, I could easily avoid a battle, but...)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
037	(With Ila here, escape may prove to be a bit difficult. I should try to avoid trouble.)
038	...
039	(So I still cannot cut my ties with that family. This filthy, cursed blood of assassins...)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
040	(Though that is all that we share, this blood is the curse that binds me to that family.)
041	(It appears that those born in the darkness cannot escape this curse and are fated to become shadows.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
042	—n't stand this!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
043	Huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
044	Ahh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
045	Ila?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0026
046	I just can't stand this! I can't even stand listening to this for another second!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
047	I can't stand how you'd try to force someone else's hand to get what you want! If you want somebody dead, kill them yourself!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
048	Hey! What's going on here!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
049	Oh snap!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
050	Hey! Wait! Get back here, coward!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
051	So you're the cause of all this ruckus! Come. We've got some questions for you.
052	Aah! Move! Out of my way!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0010
053	Dammit! He got away! I can't stand you Paladins! I just can't stand you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
054	S-stop! Calm down! Hold it!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
055	As if I'm going to listen to you Paladins!
056	You little brat! Settle down!
057	I'm not a little brat! I'm a Shadow Messiah!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0039
058	What?! The Shadow Messiah?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
059	Ila... Honestly.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
