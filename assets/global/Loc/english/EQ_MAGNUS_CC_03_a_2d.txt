001	The 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard... This is my home now.
002	I don't have any complaints. Living here couldn't be more different from my life in Real Heaven.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
003	Of course, even though I made it out of that desolate place, I still have to work hard.
004	After all, this is my chance to work my way up the career ladder, until I reach the very top! There's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it!
005	Or so I thought...	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
006	Why is this happening?!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
007	Don't ask me.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
008	I don't need to! This is all your fault!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0012
009	If you hadn't decided to host that enormous gambling tournament in the barracks, I wouldn't be in this situation!
010	Hey, you don't have to tell me it was a bad idea. I thought we should keep it on the down-low, so I only invited my usual circle.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0011
011	But then people started showing up and asking if they could join, and who was I to turn them away? Eventually we ended up with a crowd, and they got a bit noisy, as crowds tend to.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
012	How was I s'posed to know someone would come check on us? Besides, it's not my fault you were the last one left in the room. Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
013	You think that's funny?! I'm on the verge of getting dismissed because of you!
014	Sorry, sorry. But, hey, at least we got the captain to arrange a deal for you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0035
015	Right, Kaya?
016	Remind me why I put up with you two, again? Paladins are supposed to embody morals and good conduct, and while we normally overlook your little gambling exploits, an event on that scale risks our reputation as an organization.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
017	Thankfully, we managed to keep the incident contained within the 2nd Regiment, but someone needs to be punished for this, to make it clear that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
018	Unfortunately, that person is going to have to be you, Ryui. I am sorry. I feel personally responsible, since I was the one who made these scoundrels your mentors in the first place.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0035
019	Captain Kaya...
020	As for this "deal"... If you can demonstrate your skills in a mock battle and prove that you are someone we need in the Holy Guard, this incident will not be held against you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
021	The rules of the mock battle are simple: If you can strike the target held by the opposition, you win.
022	See? You'll be fine. Just win this little gambit, and you'll have nothing to worry about.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
023	Right. I have to win, no matter what. I can't afford to lose my place here. Becoming a paladin was meant to be my chance to make a life for myself.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0006
024	So I have to win! I have to prove my worth in the mock battle! But...
025	Why does Magnus have to be my opponent?!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
026	Sorry, but I'm in the same boat as you. They want me to prove my worth in the mock battle as well. Said I should've kept a closer eye on you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
027	And since I'm not a fan of having my salary revised, I'm afraid I won't be going easy on you.
028	Unlike our little game of blackjack, you won't be getting any openings from me.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
029	But also unlike last time, you'll have me as your teammate. So let's work together to show up your cruddy mentor!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
030	You're supposed to be my mentor, too, you know... But, okay. Understood! Let's do this. I'm going to win, no matter what it takes!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
031	I'm going to push myself to the brink, and train until I pass out from exhaustion! I know I can do this if I just work hard enou— Whoa!
