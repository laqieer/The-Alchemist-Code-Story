001	Aghh...!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
002	N-nice!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0046
003	No way... Is that really Captain Yauras?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0022
004	I can't believe it! Are you all really here? Truly?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
005	Kanon... This isn't the end. The outcome of this battle hasn't been preordained. Time spent looking to the divine for answers is time that you can spend trying to come up with your own solutions.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
006	Right, right...but there's no need to be so harsh, Seida. I mean, if she hadn't taken that moment to call for Excalibur, we wouldn't have our chance for payback now.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
007	Wh-what's going on?! I can't understand... I thought... I thought all of you had lost your lives!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
008	Oh, we're definitely dead. Just to be clear.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
009	What?
010	I see... Phantoms, then.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
011	Phantoms?! But...they look...so alive. I mean, they look like they used to when they were alive.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
012	Hm... I will concede that my memories are unexpectedly intact for a Phantom. Perhaps that is thanks to Excalibur.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
013	That would explain it. If Excalibur was used as a catalyst for our summoning, it may have allowed us to be summoned forth as we were at the end of our lives.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
014	I mean, that's my analysis of the situation, but there's really no telling.
015	I see! So that's what Captain Cadanova meant when he said to believe in Excalibur!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
016	Then...it was Kanon who summoned you here?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
017	Not quite.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
018	Huh?
019	The moment you called to Excalibur was the catalyst which allowed us to be summoned, but...I believe it was someone else who summoned us forth.
020	What...? Who could it be?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
021	Ha...hahaha... You people just don't give up, do you? How fun!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
022	What can the dead, even freshly risen, do in the face of utter destruction? Nothing!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
023	Oh, right. This is no time to be chatting like this. We have to do something about that ball of dark energy.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
024	R-right! I just...don't know what we can do.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
025	Yeah... That guy's making use of powers from another dimension. Not gonna lie. It's not to be underestimated.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
026	Still, give it a moment's thought. He specifically said he would transform Northern Pride into scorched earth. "Transform."
027	Okay, and...?
028	Come on! "Transform"? Like...a chemical reaction? No? Nothing? I mean, it's obvious that Cursed Sun is just an attack based on thermodynamics and has a physical mass of its own.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
029	In other words, it is possible to deal with it using science.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
030	Hey! Hey, I was on a roll! The one time I get to display my astonishing knowledge and experience as a researcher...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
031	Fine, whatever... Seida, can I ask you to cover me?
032	I've been waiting on you. This conversation has dragged on for too long.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
033	Seriously? I don't get any respect around here. Whatever. Focus... Final Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
034	What?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
035	The ball of dark energy stopped moving?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
036	Final Atmosphere?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
037	Ahem, it's actually, um, just a normal Ill Atmosphere. I mean, come on, doesn't "Final Atmosphere" sound way better?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
038	My Cursed Sun was frozen?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
039	Yeah. Pop quiz! What happens when something that has been frozen solid is dealt a physical blow with enough strength?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
040	What...? No!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
041	Twin Fang God Wolf!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
042	Everyone, get down!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
043	Wh-whoa...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
044	It shattered into tiny pieces! Yes!!!
045	Nnrk...!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
046	He's taken damage from that as well! Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0024
047	Wait! It's too early to let our guard down! Stay back!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
048	Nngh... Sol, are you all right?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
049	...
050	Sol...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
051	Hm? Yes, I'm fine, of course. Something at this level isn't worth your concern.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
052	Understood.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
053	Now, then... Shall we? Oh, hey! Captain Kudan! You're looking good! I thought you were dead!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
054	I mean, not that I can talk, having actually been dead.
055	I am grateful for your assistance in this battle. I do not feel deserving of standing on the same side of the battlefield with you any longer.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
056	What's with that? Of course we'll help you. I mean, now that we all know that we're on the side trying to save the world.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
057	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
058	We have always been on the same side. Our methods and justice may have been different, but there was never any time that our goals were counter to yours—to save the future of Babel.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
059	...!
060	Captain Vettel... I cannot fully express my gratitude to you and the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
061	If it was just the Holy Guard in this fight, we would have fallen a long time ago. There are not enough thanks in the world for what you have done.
062	So you all have become Phantoms... I see.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
063	I apologize that this is how we are meeting again. Um... Ahem. Ahem! Could you not look at me like that? You're gonna make me blush.
064	Captain Vettel... Phantoms are basically like...ghosts or something, right?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
065	Kid, could you show a little more sensitivity over here? Words can hurt, you know.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
066	Everyone... I'm so sorry... If only I...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_1028
067	You have nothing to apologize for, Kagura. You've done well.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
068	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
069	You've borne the weight of the hopes we passed on to you better than we could have imagined. Be proud.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
070	After all, you were the one who neutralized the Matter.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
071	If you hadn't done that, there's no way any of us could have made it this far. You've done an incredible job.
072	Th-thank you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
073	Kanon, all of us have personally fought with that man. Our experience should be helpful to you now.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
074	Understood!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
075	If all of the Captains of the Holy Guard stand together, there is nothing that can stand in our way. Right, Captain Kudan?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
076	Hmph.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
077	Heheh. In other words, you reanimated cadavers have shown up to get your revenge? Psh, then all we have to do is kill you again. Right, boss?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
078	Huh? Ah, right...
079	Hey, what's with you? It's not like you to get distracted when we've got business to take care of.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
080	Right, of course. It's nearly time.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
081	Annihilate them.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
082	Here they come!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
083	They're really coming at us with the intent to kill this time! Get ready!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
084	G-get ready, you say...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
085	It's pointless. There will be no mercy now that we have received our kill orders.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
086	My offensive is all-encompassing... There is no way for any of you to escape death!
087	Wh-whoa!
088	No! There's no way to come away from an attack like that without significant damage! Everyone, watch out!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
089	Fools. I already know how you fight. I know how to predict your movements.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0010
090	Oh no! I should have been more careful!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
091	Kagura!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
092	I've caught you. This is the end for you. Goodbye.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0014
093	Ah, crap... Is this seriously how it ends? All of us done in by this one person?	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
094	How unrefined.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
095	Huh?
096	My attack was deflected?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0021
097	I am sure I told you before... Speaking like that is crude and improper.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
098	Yauras!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0009
099	Long time no see, Miuna. Perhaps not since I crossed swords with Cadanova.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0010
100	Focus. If you do so, no matter what she claims, this attack can be dodged. Don't give up so quickly.
101	I'm sorry, Captain Yauras...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
102	Kagura, be more confident. It is only natural that you have been intimidated after having witnessed the depths of their savage strength.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
103	However, you cannot allow that to affect your ability to read the battlefield. You cannot forget that you are one of the most dangerous people for them here.
104	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
105	Remember. Of all the people here, you have seen the most of what they are capable of. That means that you are the person most likely to be able to read their movements on the battlefield.
106	Oh! I see!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
107	We can win this, my friends! The Holy Guard cannot lose!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
108	We carry the burden of ensuring peace with our absolute justice! We cannot let it fall here!
109	You there. Can you keep going?
110	Yes!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
111	My sympathies. You may have arrived in time to save them this time, but nothing has changed. Their fate has already been sealed!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
112	Here she comes!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
113	I will hold her off! You all must take the opportunity to analyze how she attacks!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0037
114	You plan to take me on by yourself? Hmph. Impossible! This is the end for you!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
115	Captain Yauras!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
116	Calm down. No matter what kind of attack this is, the fact remains that I am the target. In other words...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
117	Whatever attack it is, wherever it comes from, however many there are, it is mine to deal with! I will deflect it!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0001
118	Wha—?!
119	Whoa! She really deflected the whole barrage?!
120	Not yet! Captain Yauras, behind you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
121	What the—?!
122	Hm?!
123	That was close! I didn't expect her to have such speed!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
124	Ha! I got it! She distracts with a showy flurry of attacks, and then, while her opponent is still reeling, goes for the back! An old, but reliable trick!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
125	Tch!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
126	You don't scare me!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
127	No, it's fine.
128	Huh?
129	I don't know what you think you have figured out, but you haven't won just because you were able to deflect my attack once!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
130	I have to be honest. When I first saw you fight, I saw someone who had managed to turn every part of her body into a weapon. I couldn't find a single opening...at first.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
131	At first?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
132	I realized something when I watched you shoot out your false left eye. You have a single blind spot.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
133	A blind spot...?
134	What?
135	It's located somewhere that your good right eye could never be able to see...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
136	The area that your left peripheral vision would cover. Your right eye could never make up for that particular blind spot.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
137	You—?!
138	Exactly, and now...there's no reason to chase her, because someone is already standing in that spot.
139	Thank you, Kagura. Without your insight, I would have never been able to get this close.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0034
140	N-no!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
141	Single-mindedly following after the person you idolize more than anyone else... I can understand why you would do that.
142	However, there is no way that I can allow you to eliminate the people who are here with me. I think that you can understand that feeling too.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
143	No!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
144	Acht!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
145	Where do you think you're going?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
146	Huh?
147	Do you really have the time to be worrying about someone else? It's time for our second round.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
148	Persistent, aren't you? I don't have time to play right now, but rest assured I will be right back to grind your face into the ground.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
149	We won't just let you go! You're too dangerous! The three of us will take you down right here, right now!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
150	Three...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
151	Binding Arrow!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
152	What—?! Nnrgh!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
153	Wh-what is this?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
154	We're done letting you confound us with your supernatural agility. We won't let you move freely anymore!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
155	What?!
156	I don't have time to waste on this fight either. I won't underestimate you and let you get away again!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
157	You...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
158	Tch! What do these guys think they're doing?	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
159	Don't think we'll just let you do whatever you want!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
160	Excuse me? Who do you think you are? I'll destroy you, you little upstart!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
161	Wh-whoa!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
162	You are a powerful enemy. You have proved that to us, abundantly. We won't underestimate you!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
163	Really, it's actually kind of inconvenient how strong you are. Ready, Basheeny?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
164	You think you can stop me?	VO_neun.neun_battle_0017
165	Huh?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
166	Raaaarrrgh!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
167	Grk...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0026
168	Urgh!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
169	Captain Vettel! Basheeny!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
170	Ugh, I can't believe I have to waste my time on you. Hurry up and let me smash you all to pieces! Huh?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0017
171	Nngh... Just...as planned.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
172	O-of course we never thought...that we would be able to stop you...on our own.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
173	Wh-what is this?! Ice is forming on my arm?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
174	Sorry, you two... I didn't want you to have to suffer like this, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
175	Thanks to your help, seems like I get the chance at a round two with this guy.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
176	You again!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
177	Neun!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
178	Hmph. Seems like the tide has turned for you, hasn't it?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
179	Tch... While you're here distracting me, Orion is attempting to summon Nimul down unto this world! I don't have time for this!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
180	That is the reason you destroyed the tribes of Saga? You will pay for what you have done to them today!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
181	Huzzzaaaaahh!!!
182	I-I...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
183	Die!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_1014
184	I...am not so easy to kill, you realize.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
185	Grk...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
186	Ngh!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
187	Urgh...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
188	I will explain this to you again, slowly this time. There is only one person who stands a chance of stopping me. That person is Orion, who carries the Alchemy of Power.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
189	No matter how many little friends you have, you will never defeat me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
190	Not only has he broken free, but to do so much damage in the process...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
191	Is there no limit to his power?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
192	S-something's not...right.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
193	Huh?
194	I'm almost certain that I was able to land a strike on him using that opening that Reimei created for me...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
195	Yet, he fights as if that never happened at all.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
196	No, I'm sure I felt it pierce through his flesh. No matter what dimension his powers come from, his body should be flesh and blood like the rest of us.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
197	Hey, you! What kind of trickery are you using?
198	...
199	Hey! Are you even listening to me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
200	What...? How many times are you going to make me say this? Just give up. No matter how many of you there are, you'll never defeat me!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
201	What are you going on about? That wasn't my question!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
202	Blood...
203	Huh?
204	I can smell blood on that man!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
205	Blood?
206	Haaa... Haaa... Nngrk...	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
207	At his feet... There's a pool of blood at his feet!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
208	What? He's...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
209	He was hiding his injuries?! Even while fighting?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
210	Haaa... Haaa... What? This is...the end...for you. You'd better start praying...and hope someone answers.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
