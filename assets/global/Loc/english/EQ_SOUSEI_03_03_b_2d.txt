001	Tch! Bullets don't seem very effective...!
002	Get back, Minario! We'll take it from here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
003	What are you talking about? It's you all that should—
004	I beseech the supreme...!
005	Are you okay, Minario?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
006	Th-this is...!
007	Cool, right? They're Spiritbonders... People of Sephira that can defeat corruption.
008	They're not just a fairy tale, huh? They really exist...
009	Are you all right, Minario?
010	Yeah, thanks to you! It's an honor to meet a living legend.
011	...Legend?
012	That reminds me of something Adaleigh said when he first arrived in the Gula Belt Region.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
013	Finally... Finally! I'm finally here!
014	Remember when I told you what can be mined from the land here?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
015	Yes.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
016	There are always some ruins close to a deposit of them.
017	They have existed since before anything in our history books, maybe by eons.
018	Within them, there are some written accounts.
019	Somewhere in this world is a promised land without sin.
020	Those who reside there possess the power of purification.
021	So you crossed the barrier on the hope of something so uncertain...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
022	I won't apologize for doing what I had to do!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
023	No, I'm actually quite impressed. There aren't many people who would put their own safety on the line with only that information available to them.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
024	It was reckless, without a doubt. But it was also quite brave.
025	Oh, uh...
026	What an unexpected kindred spirit for Adaleigh.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
027	They get on surprisingly well, those two.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
028	(Legends of the Sephira were told here...?)
029	(Did it really speak of us? Or some other people, with passing similarities?)
030	Ascend from the depths of the sea, oh shapeless one!
031	What's wrong, Nimul?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
032	It's nothing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
033	We must focus on the task at hand. Do Fallen often come out of the mines like this?
034	Now that I think of it, there has been a significant jump in the number of people falling victim to the Fallen recently.
035	Do you think this might be some kind of omen?
036	I don't know, but it would be best to be cautious.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
037	(Adaleigh's senior Icona is nowhere to be found, just as the number of Fallen suddenly increases...)
038	(Worst-case scenario, she may already be...)
039	I have a bad feeling about all this... I hope I'm not right.
040	Hellooooo?
041	Hello? Anybody home?
042	Are you listening? Just how long are you going to have me locked up here?
043	...
044	Pursuer of Sloth! Your choice cannot be permitted!
045	Humans must accept sin. That is why the Cursed Beasts were born.
046	You're wrong. I don't believe that.
047	Sin is just one part of the human condition. It is each individual's choice to accept, or reject, that fact.
048	And if that means the destruction of the world?
049	I won't let it come to that.
050	This conversation is going nowhere.
051	The time between each earthquake keeps shrinking... It's waking...
052	Oh no, no, no, this is not good... Our preparations aren't finished yet...
053	This is so not looking good.
