001	Wh-where...? What have I...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
002	Glad to see you awake, Seeker.
003	Zafeiris? Right... We were enveloped in that bright light, and...
004	Wait... Adaleigh! Yna! Where are they?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
005	Do you not remember? As the light approached, you used all the power you had to save them both.
006	I did? I have no memory of this. And on that note, where are we?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
007	So your actions were done unconsciously? I did not expect the assimilation to have already progressed so far.
008	I-I must return to Nimul and the others!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
009	That is not possible at this moment.
010	What? Why not?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
011	Waginau, you have crossed into a realm that your physical form should not have intrinsically been able to reach.
012	This is the Shell of the World—the place where the Pursuer, Nimul's, eyes were opened to the Truth of Alchemy. This is where it all began.
013	Here?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
014	This is an opportunity that should not have been. It is something we never had a chance to even dream of before.
015	I don't care what sort of opportunity it is! How do I get back to where I was?! I must protect Nimul, or else—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
016	Is that your sense of responsibility as a warrior of Sephira, and his duty-bound attendant, talking? Or do you speak these words as his friend?
017	Zafeiris?
018	Regardless of which it may be, it is simply not possible for you to return. There is something you must do first.
019	What do you mean? What do I have to do?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
020	The Pursuer, Nimul, has reached heights comparable to our god.
021	The Stairs of Creation...
022	He's taken the first step into the beginnings of a new world. He's begun the Ceremony of Creation.
023	Wait, the Ceremony of...? Nimul had rejected that ceremony, saying that another path must be taken.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
024	The Infinite Serpent must have wrapped themselves around his throat, influencing his mind.
025	You can still stop him. There is still time. That is, of course, if you are willing to make the appropriate sacrifice.
026	Is it...truly possible?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
027	Are you not going to ask what the appropriate sacrifice is?
028	It's rather obvious what's being asked of me.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
029	The ceremony requires my life, does it not?
030	To stop Nimul, you must earn the right to stand shoulder to shoulder, upon the same stage as he.
031	This place gives you that opportunity.
032	All right. So what must I do, exactly?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
033	You must consume my memories.
034	If there is something you lack, then all you need to do is take it from another.
035	If you cannot reach a certain height through diligent training, you must simply evolve yourself into a being who can.
036	That is the nature of Nimul's creation: Alchemy.
037	Change through usurpation... Rebirth through plundering... A forceful impelling of the world, in defiant rejection of stagnation.
038	If you are willing to act in accordance with these doctrines, there is yet a path left for you to take.
039	You mean...I am to wield Alchemy?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
040	With that sword in your hand, I entreat you to run me through.
041	You wish to be pierced by this blade, which holds the capacity to slay dragons? I do recall Yna mentioning the blade being engraved with Alchemy...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
042	But... What would become of you if I did?
043	Do not worry about me. I am merely a vestige, of sorts, destined to vanish without a trace.
044	Th-This is the Cursed Beasts'...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
045	This is my true nature—the mark of our sin.
046	Now... Do it.
047	All right. Show me everything... Your powers and memories alike!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
