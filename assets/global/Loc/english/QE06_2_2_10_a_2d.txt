001	…I should get going. Sorry to drop by so suddenly.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
002	Hey, I thought you still had some business to take care of…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
003	My business here is done. You really are an honest man…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
004	…Er…Well…
005	As for me, I'm still conflicted. If you can prevent more fighting, then I welcome your strategy.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
006	But…given my position, I cannot openly support you. I wanted you to understand that... No, perhaps that's not the right word…
007	... I just wanted you to hear it. That's all.
008	…Mitsuha.	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0005
009	I, too, am human, after all.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
010	…!
011	If you're serious about your goal, show me evidence that will convince the people. As the head of Wadatsumi…that is my hope.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
012	And when your ideals are realized...I hope to enjoy your cooking.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
013	I say this, not as the leader of Wadatsumi, but as a human being.
014	…
015	...Koga.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0003
016	…Now, don't go thinking you shouldn't come here anymore, okay?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
017	But…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
018	I told you I won't rest until I hear you say that word--"Delicious!"	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
019	Don't tell me you want to stop now?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0002
020	But…
021	…You've got to promise to do one thing, Kaede…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
022	What's that?
023	…If it ever looks like I'm about to die, will you devour me?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
024	..!? Why are you saying this all of a sudden?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
025	I know you can't devour people, so this might be a difficult request. I know that, in theory… But…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
026	I...I had a moment when I thought, "I might die without ever achieving my dream."
027	… !!
028	The act of eating connects lives. If I die without achieving anything ...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
029	I want to be connected to you.
030	…Koga.
031	Of course, I don't intend to die so easily...but...I realize how monumental the task at hand is.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
032	…So, can I ask this of you, Kaede?
033	…
034	…Alright. I promise.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
035	Thank you.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0034
036	…Just don't go dying on me. You…changed my life for the better.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
037	So, you've got to…live.
038	…Alright.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
039	You've got to show me exactly what a crazy person like you can achieve!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
040	…Alright. That was kind of a depressing what-if scenario... Anyway--
041	I want to make a land where humans and demons living in Wadatsumi never starve--A land where food is plentiful and everyone lives together in harmony.
042	Now, here's an uplifting what-if story about the future...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
043	A long, long time ago…
044	It's so crazy you may not believe me, but I'm serious... Listen with an open mind, Kaede.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
045	Humans and demons fought one another, and both were desperate to survive.
046	I will. I believe you when you say you're serious. So I'll listen in earnest.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
047	Demons devoured humans in order to live, and humans killed them so that they would not be devoured.
048	Alright. But, uh…now I feel like I've been put on the spot… How shall I start--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
049	In the end, sadness and hatred enveloped Wadatsumi like a shroud.
050	Cat got your tongue? You can tell me anything, Koga.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
051	Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman overcame their differences and fell in love.
052	…I swear to you my cooking will bring peace to Wadatsumi. When that day comes…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0050
053	…Will you marry me?	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0004
054	…Ah--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
055	Whaaaaat!?
056	Whaaaaat!?
057	Don't act so surprised. I told you the fairytale was real.
058	…Er, true. But there's a big difference between listening and seeing...! I can't believe it... Is this really--	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
059	…Actual events.
060	So, the moral of the story…is that food is a bridge, transcending race? Celis always says there is great power in food.
061	But how did they persuade each other's races? They faced too many obstacles!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
062	That's what you're about see with your own eyes. The coalescence, the unravelling, and...
063	The bond that lasted across time.
064	…!
065	… Now, let's dive deeper. To catch a glimpse of the memories that slumber in this land.
