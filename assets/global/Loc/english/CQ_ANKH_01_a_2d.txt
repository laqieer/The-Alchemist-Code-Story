001	No... They followed me all the way out here?	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
002	Get him.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
003	Nrk...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
004	You're on my turf now. Prepare yourself.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
005	Y-you! These guys are after me! Please run!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0026
006	Run? Me?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
007	I do what I need to, and that's all. If I don't have to, I don't bother.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
008	Oh, well. I'll take care of both of you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
009	The white sands of this desert are my domain. I won't let anyone kill someone who has come here seeking shelter.
010	You want me to be your Vice-Captain?
011	Got a problem with that?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
012	A problem, you ask... I'm just a stray taking refuge here. I don't think I'm fit to become your Vice-Captain...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
013	I can't think of anyone else who would work. That's why I'm naming you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
014	Out of all of the members of the Desert Wings, you're the most knowledgeable and efficient in your work. On top of that, you're very well-mannered.
015	I think you're a good fit.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
016	That's...
017	(That's just how I was raised living in that house, taught by that person...)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
018	...
019	I'm extremely sorry, but could I ask for some time to consider this matter?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0035
020	Of course. Do as you'd like. Just know that I'm hoping for the answer I want to hear. You becoming Vice-Captain would make my work much easier...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
021	Allow me to take my leave.
022	That which allows you to stand a head above others is not your fortune, but your commitment to the precepts of nobility and dignity.
023	If you say so... I really dunno... I mean, I do not know exactly what you are trying to say.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
024	It isn't what I am saying, Master Ankh. It is what is inside of you.
025	What? I don't get what you mean.	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
026	You mustn't forget. Even if you lose your standing as nobility, you can still live a dignified life as long as you do not forget it.
027	Very soon the assassin your younger brother hired will be arriving to do away with you. Please leave this house and escape. Please...live on.
028	...
029	(We haven't seen each other since that day. I've only heard rumors that my brother seized power and eliminated that house.)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
030	(And after Master Ryle saved me, he took me in without asking about my circumstances. He protected me as a member of his guild.)
031	(So of course I want to support him. However—)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
032	...
033	Of course! We'll take your search request here. But, um...
034	What? Is there some kind of problem?
035	No, there's no problem, but... Aren't you Ankh of the Desert Wings? I was wondering why you would come here for such a request.
036	It wouldn't do for me to ask the others to get involved in my personal affairs... You understand, right?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0001
037	O-oh, my apologies!
038	(The number of assassins has decreased recently, but my brother is likely still after me. If I make any mistakes, it would cause a big commotion. But even so...)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
039	Even so, if I could only meet him one more time, maybe I could find some answers.
040	Ah, excuse me! You're the person who just submitted a request, right? Did the receptionist accept it right away?
041	There's a very long queue now, so... Seems like it'll take a long time...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
042	Ah... I wonder.
043	I heard this guild was good for finding people, but I'm still on the fence about it. So I'm asking around for more information...
044	Just between you and me, the guildmaster here doesn't have the best reputation. Do you know what kind of person he is, Mister?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
045	...
046	Mister?
047	No. I'm not very familiar with this. But now, I'll be going—
048	...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
049	"We have an update about your request. Please report to the location written here. We await your arrival." I see...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
050	They work fast...is what I'd like to think, but...
051	(...And this is quite a remote location, too...)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
052	Thanks for coming! Sorry to make you come all the way out here. I have an update regarding your request.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0001
053	Straight from the mouth of the guildmaster. I'm very grateful.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0044
054	Not at all. This case was very much one that I had to confirm myself.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
055	...!
056	You must be Ankh... It's time to die.
