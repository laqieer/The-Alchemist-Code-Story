001	After the events of Winter Wanderer...
002	Oh, I almost forgot!
003	Blair, Roxanne asked me to bring you to Slothstein, it sounded pretty important.
004	Something about becoming a state Artificer?
005	!!!
006	Soren, that's been my lifelong goal!
007	Ever since I was young, I've always dreamed of this moment!
008	W-whoa, okay there...
009	A-ahem, that's great! Shall we get going then?
010	Ah, I would love to, but the village...
011	Don't... worry.
012	Eira... protect home!
013	Heheh, that's right, don't you worry about us.
014	With everyone's efforts, this village will stay safe!
015	Thanks everyone!
016	Alright, the guard automatas are set. Eira, I'm counting on you.
017	Yes!
018	Farewell Tröstendorf!
019	Take care everyone!
020	...Bye bye!
021	Goodbye Blair! See you soon!
