001	Engineer Elect Adaleigh's airship has been housed in Dock 6. The entire crew is being detained within the port. 
002	I appreciate your efforts. Please continue to monitor them. And no needless provocations, okay? 
003	Understood.
004	...This is for the best, I suppose, Icona.
005	Ah yes, this is more than enough, Mr. Mayor. It's not the case that they want to perpetrate violence in this region, anyway.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
006	It's just that they want to kill the Cursed Beast here.
007	Though that would put us in trouble. 
008	Belphegor is one of the precious resources left to this region. 
009	The lode of the Gods is certainly a vast resource, but we can't be confident that it is enough for every researcher to achieve their goals... 
010	For our prosperity... For the continuation of all research, no resource could be sufficient, no matter how vast. 
011	For precisely this reason, losing a Cursed Beast capable of infinitely producing magil would be much too regrettable. 
012	So that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue their own research?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
013	It is my duty as mayor to continue to provide such an environment. 
014	...And how is the plan going?
015	All is going smoothly. Though an unexpected nuisance did arise partway through...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
016	A nuisance?
017	Umm, a minor internal conflict, I guess? We of the Infinite Serpent are not a monolith, by any means. 	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
018	...If there is no hindrance to the plan, then let's not delve into the matter. 
019	No need to worry about that! The tower repairs and the Cursed Beast's awakening are complete. What's left, as planned—
020	—is just to capture the Cursed Beast alive. 	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
021	Gah, this has become quite bothersome...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0022
022	I have to help Adaleigh and the others before it's too late...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0030
023	Damn it, open this door! We didn't awaken the Cursed Beast!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
024	It seems that we're somewhere in the vicinity of the port... Nyx, how goes it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
025	...It's no good. I can't communicate with Mira. There might be something in place that inhibits magil here. 	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
026	...Spiritbonding doesn't work either. The voice of Sephiron is very faint here... This must be how it feels to have magil inhibited.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
027	We should assume that our hand is being read.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
028	In that case, the fact that they separated us by gender for imprisonment was likely not simply out of consideration.
029	I don't understand that part, but one thing has become clear.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
030	We should likely assume that the city mayor is in league with Icona.  
031	If that's true, then what about Minario...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
032	.........
033	...Break me out of here? What do you mean?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0025
034	The recommendation that came from the mayor just a bit ago was consistently directed at us—in other words, Adaleigh and his group.  
035	Based on the phrasing of it, it seems likely that they haven't realized that you're here with us.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
036	Now I get it.
037	Be that as it may...having come this far, shouldn't we be sticking together?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0014
038	That's exactly why I want to ask this of you.
039	I want you to somehow escape from here and get in contact with the mayor to inform him.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
040	Inform my father...?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0006
041	Let him know that we have no hostile intentions, and that our objective is simply to rescue the people of this region from the threat of the Cursed Beast.
042	In which case, even if you're able to reach the mayor without a hitch, our vindication isn't necessarily...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
043	He won't get it. And Minario might get arrested on the spot. At best, it would just buy us a little time.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
044	Buy us time...? What do you mean.
045	They're preparing a technique for controlling the Cursed Beast, or perhaps—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
046	So that's it... Now that you mention it, that woman was saying so.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0045
047	That she wanted to study Emmel—no, the Vessel of Purification...
048	...!
049	This was my mistake...
050	I had thought that a Cursed Beast couldn't be anything other than a threat to the people of a region, a calamity to be feared and, if possible, exterminated.  
051	I never considered for a single instant that there might be people like Icona who would think to use a Cursed Beast for their benefit.
052	...The very idea of harnessing the power of nature has been the norm throughout human history. 	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
053	From river management and land reclamation to agriculture and metallurgy, we have repurposed the blessings of nature as we desired and improved our lives.
054	And so we should do the same with Cursed Beasts?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
055	At the very least, that must be how Icona sees it. She intimated as much.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
056	It's a prideful thought, to me anyway. Well actually I'm not sure we have any right to say so, given that we're trying to take down the Cursed Beast.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
057	If they fail to control it, then everything will lapse into sin.
058	Just how confident could they be, living together with a bomb like that? 
059	...We have to stop them.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
060	Adaleigh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
061	No matter how skilled Icona is, there's no way anyone could control a Cursed Beast without paying a price for it. 
062	...Icona is not the type of engineer to hesitate making a sacrifice she deems necessary.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
063	She's even discarded her own body without batting an eyelid when she thought it was necessary. And I respected her nonetheless...
064	But if that sacrifice—if it threatens the lives of the people of this region, then I... I cannot abandon them. 
065	That's why we need to stop Icona. We have to before this region—our homeland—is beyond saving. 
066	Besides, we have to help Emmel! We have to!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
067	Ah, Adaleigh is right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
068	Um, while we're at it, Mira too...right?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
069	If we continue to stand by doing nothing, then Emmel might be put in danger.
070	Also, I'm concerned about the movements of Belphegor since being awakened by Icona.
071	We can't sit around anymore. We have to escape from here somehow.
072	But practically speaking, what will we do? We've been divided up and our weapons were confiscated.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
073	On top of that, Nyx's magic and our Spiritbonding is being blocked, and moreover—
074	...That's right, let's try it out—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
075	"Gate within me, please answer this call—"
076	huh...?!
077	Gahh?! Could you hang on a sec?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
078	ahhh—
079	(Did I just fail to control a new technique...? I don't want to think so, but this feeling is exactly like...)
080	WARNING. WARNING. AN IMPACT EXCEEDING THE CONTROL VALUE HAS BEEN DETECTED WITHIN THE FACILITY. POSSIBLY AN ACT OF TERRORISM. I REPEAT—
081	This is bad, it sounds like the guards are onto us...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
082	Nimul! How much longer are you going to pull stuff like this?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_chara_1006
083	ahhhh I'm sorry!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
084	At this point it can't be helped—let's go retrieve our equipment and rescue Emmel and the others!
085	RETURN TO YOUR CELLS. LEAVING THE PREMISES IS PROHIBITED. RETURN TO YOUR CELLS. LEAVING THE PREMISES IS PROHIBITED. RETUR—
086	Tch... And we're unable to use weapons or Spiritbonding—what is this!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
087	I'm sorry! I'll provide as much cover as possible from my side! Try to make it through!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
088	Nyx, are you still unable to communicate with Mira?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
089	Let me try... Nope, nothing. I can't get through, but I've found signs of Mira's magil. They're to the north-west...in the building on the other side!  	VO_nix.nix_sys_0040
090	If the facility is designed like this then... This way! I think it's this way! C'mon everyone!
