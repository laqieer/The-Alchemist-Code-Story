001	Nnghh...!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0022
002	What is this?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0025
003	This is the resurrection ceremony.	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
004	The druidic priestess drains and absorbs Sephiron's corruption to enhance its purifying qualities. This is the technique passed down through generations of Sephira to ensure the great tree's longevity.
005	Longevity?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0012
006	Kamui, Sephiron is dying.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
007	After continuously absorbing the gluttonous powers corrupting this land for a long time, the great tree has long since lost its vitality.
008	Yet, to avoid the destruction of this continent, Sephiron must continue to seal Beelzebub's curse.
009	Continue to...? Have the Sephira always done this?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
010	Yes. This is the ritual that has been passed down through generations of Sephira chieftains. In other words, I was born to be sacrificed.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
011	Th-this is insane! You mean to tell me, you knew? This whole time?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
012	All these years, you knew this day would come...and still put on a happy face every day?
013	I was happy. As long as I had you by my side, I was happy.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
014	But this—
015	I cannot accept this!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0026
016	Kamui?
017	None of this is reason enough for you to lose your life!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0029
018	You were meant to be happy in this peaceful village with Hisham and Isidore, and...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
019	The reason I became Protector is to ensure that you—and the people of this land—could live in peace!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0011
020	K-Kamui, no!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0022
