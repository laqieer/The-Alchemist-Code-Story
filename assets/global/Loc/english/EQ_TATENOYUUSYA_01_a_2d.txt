001	Zzz...zzz...
002	...
003	Can't sleep, Melty?	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0003
004	Raphtalia...
005	You must be exhausted after all that. You should rest while you can.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0001
006	I'm fine, Raphtalia. Besides, you should look to yourself! It was you who...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0039
007	I had no idea such horrible things were even possible in Melromarc!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
008	I knew father despised demi-humans, but what he's doing is unforgivable!
009	...
010	I-I apologize for being so inconsiderate! I shouldn't have said anything...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0035
011	There's no need to apologize at all. I'm glad you care about what's been going on, Melty.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0039
012	Since you've seen firsthand how demi-humans are discriminated against, I'm sure you'll be able to change this kingdom when you become the queen one day.
013	I have no doubts about it.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0007
014	Raphtalia...
015	It seems that Lord Naofumi is still speaking with Fitoria... We should head to bed first.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0001
016	Come on, Melty.
017	Zzz...zzz...
018	...
019	Reichnott said that the same thing is happening all over the kingdom.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
020	I was clueless to the discrimination towards the demi-humans. Do I know anything about this kingdom at all? How can I call myself its princess?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
021	I was thrilled when Mother told me to hurry back to the kingdom and admonish the king for encouraging such unjust hatred to flourish. It felt like she was entrusting me with a great responsibility.
022	However, right now...
023	Ngh... Mel? You're still up? Go to sleep already.	VO_filo.filo_sys_0031
024	Oh, Filo... Please don't worry about me. Good night.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
025	Hm...
026	It feels oddly cold... It should feel a lot warmer since I'm surrounded by filolial fur...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
027	Huh? Where am I? The filolials disappeared, too...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
028	Filo? Raphtalia? Hey, Naofumi! Where is everyone?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0021
029	I'm all alone... What's going on? What on earth happened?
030	Ah!
031	O-oh... It's just a Balloon. Even I can handle this.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
032	Chomp, chomp, chomp...	VO_balloon.balloon_battle_0001
033	H-how are there so many?! Hold on...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0026
034	Chomp, chomp, chomp!	VO_balloon.balloon_battle_0002
