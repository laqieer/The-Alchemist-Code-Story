001	Please...wait!
002	Don't you dare stop me!
003	The enemy forces have been defeated! We've already won!
004	Are you blind, Lamia?! There! Enemy soldiers! They still live!
005	But they're broken and running away!
006	Nnngh!
007	Set your arrows on fire! Don't let them catch up to us!
008	Gahh?!
009	Lamia!
010	Ngh! I-I'm fine. The arrow barely scratched me.
011	I need a medic here, now!
012	Ah... Aaah...
013	What's wrong...?
014	I... I can't...
015	The crimson glow of the evening sky... The blood... Fire...!
016	Wait! Please, you have to get a hold of yourself!
017	If they get away, the fighting continues! If we kill them, it all ends here!
018	I have to end it! Even if I bring myself to ruin, I have to make this happen!
019	...
020	Rrraaaahh!
021	(Her smoldering sense of loss and pain... They won't be dispelled until the fighting ends.)
022	Be gone! All of you! Die! Die!!!
023	(But... Who knows when we will accomplish such a thing? If it takes too long, you will...)
024	Please...! Somebody!
025	Put out those flames!!!
026	I'm here for you! Trust me!
027	Hidden troops?!
028	The retreat was a distraction! Our flanks are exposed! Was this their plan the whole time?!
029	Finish them off before the Ruinmaker returns!
030	...!
031	When I turned back, the wasteland was overgrown with arrows and swords of the fallen...
032	An abhorrent sight unfolded before me.
033	Fighting harder than my opponent is the only way I know to end the fighting.
034	I understand now that means I haven't changed at all.
035	...!
036	Thank you for... For being alive...!
037	You saved me. You kept me alive.
038	I didn't do anything!
039	I learned from you how to fight when surrounded. Had I not watched the way you fight on the front lines, I would've...
040	All I can show you is how to fight.
041	But that's what saved me.
042	If I am honest... What I regret most is not taking more time to talk with my father, mother, and my little sister.
043	About dinner, the weather, friends... Anything at all.
044	I wanted to share that happiness...
045	But the title Ruinmaker weighed heavily on my soul.
046	...
047	Nnngh! Aaahh...! I should... I should've been the one to...
048	No! I wouldn't want to see you gone!
049	There is no one who hopes more for the possibility of happiness once the fighting is done. That's why...
050	That's why I chose you to be my mentor!
051	?!
052	You will never fade from my life.
053	You are my symbol for happiness.
054	A jasmine blossom...?
055	It was trampled on and nearly burned, but in the end it was left standing in the battlefield.
056	In the language of flowers, Jasmine stands for "I am very happy."
057	Heheh... Hahahaha!
058	Master?
059	Aren't I supposed to be the one bringing you gifts?
060	Well, your idea of a gift tends to be something like a whetstone or a tactical manual...
061	I thought they'd be useful.
062	Th-they are, but...
063	All right, all right! I'll bring you flowers next time! Lamia, do you have a favorite flower?
064	...I like shirley poppies.
065	A shur-ly...? What? Poppy? Shirley poppies? Got it!
066	Do you really?
067	You don't embellish your words, do you? I got it, I promise! I'll take you to a flower garden full of them!
068	Hehehehe, I apologize for my rudeness.
069	Whenever you need to escape the horrifying flames that are burning your heart away, you should take a moment to stop and smell the flowers.
070	Yeah... I'll do that. Even if that's the only time the war will fade from my mind.
071	It will be like a good luck charm that you can find comfort in.
072	Lamia... I hope you know that speaking with you also helps me forget the battlefield.
073	I know. It's the same for me.
074	I see...
075	In a way, I guess that makes you my Ruinmaker.
