001	Oof. They're...stronger than...before!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
002	I told you, they can learn and evolve! Even at this moment, they are internalizing the pain you caused them, and learning how best to avoid it in the future.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
003	How can you hope to defeat a weapon that remembers everything you've ever done to it, and adapts accordingly?
004	May be time to try a different tactic, then. You know what they say: cut off the head and the body stops moving. If you're dead, then these monsters will have no one left to follow.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
005	So how about we test that theory?
006	The Black Star specialize in the Assassin's Blade, so it's true that I mustn't drop my guard around you.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
007	But even if you somehow were to kill me, the Dismortants wouldn't cease functioning.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
008	You have no way to win.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
009	Tch!
010	No matter how many of them there are, or how strong they are, they're still demons.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
011	There has to be an opening somewhere! Lady Celis, we must persevere!
012	Still demons... That's true!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
013	Lady Celis?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0006
014	Jubei, may I ask something of you?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
015	Anything you wish!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
016	Leave this fight to me. You need to rendezvous with the rest of Blade Fox right now.
017	But, Lady Celis! You'll be on your own!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0012
018	The information we've learned here today won't mean anything if we both perish in battle. One of us needs to relay it to the rest of the Corps while we still can.
019	Did you come up with a plan, then?
020	I didn't want to get my son involved, but...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
021	Master Logi? But, Master Logi is—
022	Judius fears only variables. The fact that he can't firmly proclaim Logi's demise suggests there's a high probability he's still alive.
023	But...!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
024	I'll give you an opening. Take it, and get out of here!
025	......
026	We've served together in both the Scarlet Flame Guard and the Blade Fox. I have every confidence in you. So please, do this for me!
027	I swear on my honor that I will not let you down!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
028	Thank you, Jubei.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
029	What are you two prattling on about over there? Haven't I made it clear how futile your struggles are? Why won't you accept your fate?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
030	There's no use planning anything. The only result I'm looking for is the inevitability that you both die here!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
031	I'm sorry to say, that's not going to happen.
032	You're wasting your ti—	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
033	I don't know where the secret art of Kagutsuchi is, but I know what form it takes.
034	Gaze now upon the wings of the Phoenix!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0032
035	What?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0026
036	It may not be your precious Kagutsuchi, but if the Dismortants truly do learn every technique thrown at them...
037	Then I suppose I'll just have to throw something new their way!
038	!!!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0027
039	Take this! Phoenix Wing Strike!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0001
040	Now! Go!
041	As you say!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
042	I believe in you, Jubei...
043	So, you still have a few tricks of your own up your sleeves. How irritating.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0012
044	What do you hope to accomplish by saving her, though? The end result will be the same either way.
045	You hate variables, and she definitely is one. I have every confidence that she can change your end result.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
046	Your actions defy all logic.
047	Faced with such an overwhelming power, how have you not yet fallen to despair? Your death is assured! There is no escape!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0006
048	I will never cower in despair. I'll keep going till my dying breath. I'll do whatever it takes to protect those who are dear to me.
049	That is my iron will. Since the day I swore to defend the setting Scarlet, and into my tenure with the Blade Fox, it has never once wavered.
050	Your will is irrelevant, and your vows are meaningless. All that matters is the end result!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
051	And that would be your will. It's on you to carry that out.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
052	Then I shall do just that!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0037
053	What?!
054	To see my research through, I needed time. Time beyond that of a meager human lifespan.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
055	I wish it didn't have to come to this.
056	What's happening?! The air is...changing!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
057	You think your will is strong? I have no qualms about throwing away my humanity to see everything I've struggled for come to fruition. That is the true strength of my will!
058	It can't be! You turned yourself into a Dismortant?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
059	For my research. The closest test subject I had was myself, after all.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
060	You're not the only one with cards yet to be shown. To lead the Dismortants, one must be strong! So to that end...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
061	I created a medicine.
062	But now that I've shown you this form, it's over. Any infinitesimal chance you may have had is well and truly quashed. You will die here.
063	Transforming yourself into a demon?! You truly have gone mad!
064	You could never hope to understand. And you'll never have the chance. Fall into despair!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
065	You're right. I won't ever understand. But I don't need to. The only thing that matters right now is who has the stronger will.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
066	Talk is cheap, though.
067	My words won't defeat demons, so I'll let my blade do the talking from here.
068	What we protect is the good of the people—their livelihoods, their happiness. That is what we stake on our blades.
069	I am the First Squad Captain and Commander of the demon slayers known as the Blade Fox Corps. I am Celis. And with fangs and claws borne, I enter the fray!
070	Hmph. Meaningless drivel! Prepare to die!!!	VO_judius.judius_battle_0014
071	Hyaaaaaahhhhh!!!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0032
