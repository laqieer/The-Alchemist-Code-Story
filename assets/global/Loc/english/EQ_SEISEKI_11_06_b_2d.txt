001	I won't let you get away with any of this! Suzuka, get going!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
002	G-got it! Mistress... Good luck!
003	Hmph... Such a determined little face.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0045
004	It will come to nothing against me.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0017
005	Urgh! Watch yourself, girl... Behind you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
006	Ack! Why you...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
007	Ah?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
008	She not only met my sword, but...even managed to turn the strike against me! No... Was she just lucky?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0021
009	Kanon... Just now, that was...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
010	U-um, this is hard to say, but that was pure luck. He just happened to be where my instincts wanted to swing my sword.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
011	Your instincts...?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
012	My body just did what felt right, but...it's really incredible that even at such close range, I can't follow his movements at all!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
013	I remember Captain Othima saying something about how the Templars seemed to just pop in and out of thin air. I'd better be careful.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
014	Apparently that man's movements cannot be seen with the eye alone. Something about...navigating between different spaces...? Am I correct?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
015	Nngh... Yeah... Something like that... They're using a space that's similar to the world beyond the Door of Truth...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
016	A different space...? That cannot be seen with the eyes alone?
017	Kanon, focus on what is before you. This isn't a puzzle you have time to think through right now.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
018	But...perhaps if I can understand the root of his ability to move like that...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
019	Leave that to me, Kanon. You need only spend your energy fighting with all that you've got.
020	Understood.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
021	Good. Now!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
022	What could you be planning? How amusing.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
023	He's gone?! Captain Cadanova!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
024	Stay calm!
025	No... I don't believe this is the correct time for calm.
026	Agh?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
027	Captain Cadanova!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
028	D-don't worry about me...! Besides... I think I'm starting to catch on to what he's doing.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0042
029	What...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
030	Nngh... K-Kanon...prepare yourself! The next time he appears...!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0018
031	What?! B-but I still don't understand his movements.
032	You're bluffing. None of you can sense my presence while I'm in the other dimension, which means you cannot guess where I will appear next.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
033	I wonder...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
034	So you're committed to your bluff? Well... All I need do is prove that you have no idea what you're talking about!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
035	He disappeared!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
036	Captain Cadanova!
037	Unfortunately, he is right... I cannot sense his presence while he's in the other dimension.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
038	Are you serious?! Th-then what the heck are you planning?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
039	Calm down. Last time, I noticed that while I couldn't sense him while he was in the other dimension, I could pinpoint where he would appear. You need only aim for that spot.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
040	Where he will appear...? How?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
041	Kanon, earlier you said it was just pure luck that you managed to land a hit on him. I think it was more than just chance. Do you understand me? Just listen to the voice of your sword.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
042	Voice of the sword...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
043	This is something only you can do, Kanon. You have one chance to make this work. This is the time to take advantage of the leverage you have!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
044	What?! W-wait, I'm telling you, I need more of an explanation!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
045	Once he learns the trick, you'll lose the element of surprise! There's no way for me to explain more without giving it away completely!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
046	B-but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
047	The voice of the sword...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
048	You'll be fine. I believe that you'll be able to catch him this time.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
049	Wishful thinking will get you nowhere. How quaint that the man known as the Flame Dragon King would fall to it.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
050	?! Hm?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
051	Impressive! You were able to defend against my strike...but I certainly wouldn't say you have been able to effectively read my moves.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
052	I knew it... This sword... It was created by Yogi Ku, wasn't it?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0042
053	...!
054	Heh... The one who can read your moves, who will be your downfall...is not me. It is someone who I have entrusted my legacy to.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
055	As you say... Leave this to me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
056	Huh...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
057	I heard it this time... Excalibur's voice! Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
058	Grk...!!!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0043
