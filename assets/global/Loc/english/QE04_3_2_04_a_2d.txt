001	That day you promised to protect me...I was happy. So happy.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0007
002	Of course. Tamis, you're my dear sister. I've never once forgotten that promise I made to you. Trust me. I'll return safely.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
003	But...it's just the two of you. Who knows what'll happen?! At times like this, I always think to myself...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0020
004	Mocca, you are always protecting me... Why do I lack the power to protect you?
005	I've accepted my mission...but...the truth is I wanted the power to protect you, Mocca.
006	Thank you. It's the thought that counts, Tamis.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0033
007	The thought alone means nothing. You're headed into the danger and there's nothing I can do about it!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
008	Mocca...?!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
009	I promise you that I'll come home alive, so stay here and wait for me.	VO_moca.moca_battle_1028
010	Mocca...are you trembling?	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
011	...I'm going to become stronger. That way, you won't have to worry about me, Tamis.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
012	For now, have faith in me and wait here. Who would protect you if I'm gone? I've no choice but to return to you safely.
013	...Isn't there something I can do to help?	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
014	Pray...Tamis. Pray that we will be able to overcome this trial. That will lend me strength.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
015	......Okay.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
016	...It's starting to get cold. Let's head back.
017	Together...in order to help Mocca... Yes, that's what we should do. After all, we are two who share one soul.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0031
018	...What's the matter, Tamis?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
019	No...it's nothing. Let's go back, Mocca.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
