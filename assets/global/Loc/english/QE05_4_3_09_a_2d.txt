001	I'm almost out of arrows, Kamui! How do you want to proceed?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
002	This... I... There's no way for me to defeat this monster on my own. No matter how many I purify, he will simply replicate more to take their place.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
003	The only chance we have is if we can find the real Ceclidis and defeat him!
004	That sounds like a plan. We have to get ourselves out of this situation! There's no reason to waste our energy on an enemy that won't die if our true target is somewhere else!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
005	You say that, but how are we going to make that happen? We're surrounded by the Jam!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
006	I will clear a path with my Spiritbonding. Once I've done that, you two should go on ahead!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
007	Find Adelbert and the others, and make your way to the stronghold!
008	The stronghold...? Not the altar?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
009	That they drew us here at all means that they figured out what our plan was.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
010	Logi! Tina! Go! I will hold them here!
011	What? Kamui!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
012	I thought you said that you were going to protect her? Go, Logi!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
013	I'm sorry, Kamui!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
014	You'd better be alive when I see you next, Kamui.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
015	Protector, you are braver than I had thought... Or is it foolishness that makes you believe that you are enough to face us on your own?
016	I guess we'll find out.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0016
