001	Oh! Tina! How was it?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
002	Argh! So annoying!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	I guess I don't need an answer.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
004	As soon as they find out I'm from the Voda faction, they won't even speak to me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
005	Is that really the same Fuu tribe as the one Mocca belongs to?!
006	I also didn't have much luck. People would listen a bit more when I told them I'm from Lustburg, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
007	No one mentioned any sighting of Gluttony soldiers.
008	I couldn't get anything either.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
009	Mocca...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
010	I was able to get information from a lot of people, but none mentioned any sightings of Gluttony troops... I've got nothing.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
011	But...that merchant didn't seem to be lying.
012	Yes. I wonder if it was just a coincidence.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
013	It's still too early to make that assumption. Let's talk to some more people...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
014	Please! Someone! Help me!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0018
015	What the...?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
016	That person is crying! I wonder what's wrong!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
017	Please! Help my son! He left the village a while ago and still hasn't returned!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0042
018	Huh...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
019	Outside the village? Aren't the Jam out there?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
020	That's what I heard! I tried to ask my fellow merchants to help, but they were also frightened of the Jam!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0020
021	On the road, I asked someone from the Fuu faction, but they wouldn't listen!
022	...!
023	That's unbelievable! A child's life is in danger!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
024	Please! Help him! My son should be in the forest behind the village!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0019
025	Abominations...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
026	The Jam...Where?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
027	I'm talking about the people who gathered in this marketplace. I can feel the evil corruption that comes from their hearts!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
028	Faction?! Tribe?! There is nothing more important than protecting the life of a child!
029	Ti-Tina...! Everyone is watching?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
030	Not just animals, but trees and flowers...and small organisms as well!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
031	Those who live in this world devote everything to leaving descendants behind!
032	Protecting our children and their future is an instinct given to all born into this world...even if the child isn't our own!!!
033	...! Tina...
034	You who have forgotten the principals of being alive...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
035	You are inferior beings whose very existence is vile! I despise even having to address you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0017
036	You idiots!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0001
037	Tina...!
038	We're wasting time here...let's go, Tina.
039	Ack...aah!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
