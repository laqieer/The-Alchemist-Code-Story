001	Yeah, you're looking good. Nutrition levels are also fine.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
002	You're free to walk around outside now.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
003	Yes! Thank you, Miss Malta!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0008
004	Oh, but don't go overboard, okay? It hasn't been long since you came to our village, and injuries are bound to happen in an unfamiliar place, Hisham.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
005	Aw, but I'm not stupid! I can take care of myself!
006	I'm sure you can, but you just recovered. Don't ruin it and rest up, okay?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0014
007	Okaaaay.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
008	Very good.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
009	Kamui and Isidore should be back from their Spiritbonding training soon. Let's get ready for lunch.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0002
010	What about you, Miss Malta? You don't need to go train?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
011	Hm?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
012	I was just wondering. I mean, I thought it was like a big deal or something.
013	That Spirit-something whatever? Isn't it the duty of the people of this village to train?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
014	Well, well, you know quite a lot, don't you? Did Kamui tell you?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0044
015	Don't you worry! No matter how much they train, I'm still the best Spiritbonder in the village!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
016	What? No way!
017	No joke. When it comes to Spiritbonding, not even Kamui is a match for me!
018	Really? Are you exaggerating?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
019	What's with that suspicious look? You don't believe me?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
020	Well, I've seen what Kamui can do.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0012
021	You know he can blow up a bunch of beasts in a flash? Like boom! Kablam!
022	There can't be that many people who can do what he can.
023	I'm just saying, Miss Malta, you don't really look that strong. Weren't you the one just telling me not to overdo it?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
024	...
025	(I'm kind of offended that this is how Hisham sees me!)
026	(Even though I'm the oldest and smartest, and therefore the most deserving of respect! Hm... I know!)	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
027	Fine, fine. Then I'll prove it to you!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0038
028	Huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
029	Hey! Hisham, we're back! I hope you've been behaving yourself—	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0005
030	Both of you, get ready right now! I'm going on patrol with the two of you today!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
031	...
032	...What?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
033	C'mon, let's go!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0002
034	Don't worry, Hisham. There's nothing to fear when you're with me!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
035	Ah, uh... Okay...
036	Hisham, what's going on here?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
037	Uh... I don't really know. She just got really fired up for some reason.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
038	Something about being best Spiritbonder in the village?
039	Ah...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0011
040	Malta is pretty competitive...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
041	I'm sure she hates anyone thinking she's not the best in her own field of expertise.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
042	I mean... I appreciate the help, but to waste her talents on beast patrol? That seems like a little much...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0031
043	Wait, what? Is Malta actually really strong?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
044	Well, you'll see.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0005
045	You can run...but you can't hide, not from me!
046	Gyarr?!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_c
047	Wh-where is it?
048	She sensed the Alchemia of the beast, most likely.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
049	Even you didn't sense it, Kamui? We're really outclassed here... We'd better train more...
050	Seriously?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0026
051	The time of daylight is our blessing; time quickens, allows us the provision of this time and place—	VO_malta.malta_battle_0007
