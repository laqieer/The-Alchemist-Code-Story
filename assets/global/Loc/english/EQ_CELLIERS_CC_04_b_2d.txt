001	HAAAAAAH!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0007
002	Augh... What crazy power!
003	Still, you're only one guy. We'll take you in alive, and get our hands on those crystals!
004	Unfortunately for you, he isn't exactly alone.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0010
005	What?!
006	GWAAAH!
007	Thanks for helping me, Flamel.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0033
008	Goodness, me... To think you'd act as bait to draw them out. I suppose you've got a reckless streak to you as well.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0030
009	Sorry to put you in that position. I just knew they must be lying in wait around the laboratory...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0036
010	With things as they were, Mielikki couldn't return to the village safely.
011	Indeed... Still, it's a good thing we put those soldiers in place. We got through it without too much trouble.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
012	I certainly hope that's all of them...
013	So, um... What are you going to do with the ones you captured?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
014	Interrogate them, first and foremost. Still, I don't imagine we'll get much useful intel out of them.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0031
015	They're probably some grunt soldiers acting of their own accord. Gluttony hardly has any reason to worsen relations with our kingdom over such trifles.
016	To be honest, we barely have enough grounds to even detain them.
017	I can't say for sure. Political matters are outside of my wheelhouse, after all. Let's just leave the rest of this to Michael.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
018	Through his efforts, things will settle down after a spell. I imagine you should be safe for now.
019	Oh yeah? Then Mielikki can go back to the village safely. What a relief...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0005
020	(...That's enough. If Mielikki can live happily in that village...then that's more than enough for me.)
