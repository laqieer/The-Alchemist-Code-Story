001	Did Lofia forget something?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
002	These were given to me to pass on to her, but I am afraid that the chance to do so slipped me by.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
003	I'll take them to her!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
004	You need your rest, my dear.
005	But...!
006	We must remain hidden. I have explained this.
007	So then... D-does that mean I'll... I'll never g-get to see Lofia ever again?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
008	Now, now. Lady Lofia is a capable young woman. Not only that, but you and I healed her together, did we not?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
009	Have no fear. She will come back.
010	...
011	So let us wait. We can pass these on to her when she returns.
012	A-all right.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
013	Yet I am hopeful that it will not take her too long to arrive. These old bones need their rest, and my magic has yet to replenish.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
014	Oh! Maybe the cookies Lofia gave me will...
015	Huh?
016	Visitors?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
017	This is unusual.
018	No way...
019	Ch-Cheryl? Cheryl?!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
020	Mira's Alchemia took them to a different time, but... Why? Why did this happen?
021	I've never seen this place in such a state.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
022	Huh?
023	This isn't like you, Courage.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1008
024	And you are...?
025	Kaya!
026	I'm terribly busy. I've been reading through all of the ancient texts that I've collected.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_2003
