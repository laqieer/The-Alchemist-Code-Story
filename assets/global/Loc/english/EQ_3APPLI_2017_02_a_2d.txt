001	Lisbeth and the others defeat the monster and head to the deck of the ship where Amaterasu is being cornered.
002	Ack...huff...huff...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0019
003	Oh, there's someone over there!	VO_revatein.revatein_battle_0019
004	I've got this. Lisbeth, please continue forward!
005	Okay!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
006	My power...I can't use it to its full extent...ack!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0020
007	Ugggrraaaahh!
008	Eeek!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0043
009	Hyaah!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
010	Uggrraaah!
011	We somehow made it! Um, Amaterasu, right? Are you okay?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
012	Y-yes! Thank you for coming all the way here!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
013	Let me introduce myself again. I'm Amaterasu. Everyone, thank you for coming!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0018
014	I am Laevateinn. I told the other three, but I'm a Killer Princess and...	VO_revatein.revatein_battle_0001
015	Wait, do you understand what I mean when I say that?
016	Actually...not really. But I'm assuming princess means you're an aristocrat of some kind?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
017	No...actually, maybe the "killer" part describes me better.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
018	Umm. Are you an assassin?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
019	It's a bit of a hassle to explain it all so we'll go with that for now...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
020	Heheh...I'm Yuri.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
021	I'm a kunoichi who is training in a village in Zipangu that is outside of this world.
022	In the battle just now I realized that your physical capabilities were far beyond that of a regular person.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0044
023	If you're still in training then...I'm highly impressed by these kunoichis.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0045
024	Um...I'm Lisbeth! I'm a witch who attends Venus School of Magic...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
025	Hey, Amaterasu, do you know what it is that I'm good at?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
026	Yes! You're a witch...so you're good at magic, right?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
027	Haha. You're right! Although at school I get pretty bad grades.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0008
028	I don't know if that means you're good at it...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0025
029	It's very encouraging that such reliable people showed up. And who are you?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
030	I'm <p_name>... I'm a regular person.
031	I couldn't do anything in that battle just now. To be honest, I don't really know why I'm here.
032	Oh, then how about you take on the role of "thinker" to make up for me not being one?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
033	Huh? I'd assumed that being a witch makes you smart.
034	My best friend usually always does the thinking for me. Ack. Even amongst witches, there are a lot of different types of individuals!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
035	Ahahaha. Okay, got it. I'll do my best to come up with ways to be useful to you all.
036	All right. Thanks! Um...I guess that's it for introductions?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
037	Yes. I think I understand all of you very well now. Thank you.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
038	All right then, I'd like to ask for help from all of you again.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_1047
039	Please, help me regain the Sun Keys!
040	Of course! That's the plan! There's no way I can stand by and watch the sunlight disappear!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
041	Amaterasu, you explained a lot before we met face to face, but...
042	Is there anything else you'd like to inform us about?
043	In that case, I'd like to explain my role properly again.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
044	My role is managing the sun.
045	All living things need the sun to survive. It is the source of life that exists in all words.
046	But the light of the sun is too strong...so it needs to be managed.
047	If it is not firmly managed it will burn everything in the world...that's how much power it has.
048	It can't be too much or too little...I manage it so that all living beings can get by comfortably.
049	My home country of Lustburg is a bit cold...do you think you can strengthen the light a little?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
050	I-I'm sorry...but if I did that then the people in the rural areas will have problems getting by.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0035
051	Each world has one sun, so if you change its strength, it'll affect the entire world as a whole...I guess?
052	Do you know exactly how the sun can lose its light?
053	Yes. If you use the moon to hide sunlight...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
054	Additionally, if you stop the moon and completely hide the sun, then the sun's light won't fall on the world anymore.
055	Huh? Can the Sun Keys also control the moon?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
056	When it comes to managing the sun...the position of the sun, moon, and the world in relation to each other is important.
057	To be specific, I move the sun and moon using the power of the Sun Keys.
058	In each world I adjust how much light shines...
059	Oh, that's a lot of talk about physics and science!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
060	Well...I'm pretty stupid...so I don't really understand it...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
061	Huh?! Um...to explain it in simple terms...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0031
062	For example, Lisbeth, let's say I was standing between you and Yuri.
063	By doing so you wouldn't be able to see Yuri's face well, right?
064	Yes, but I'll be able to see your face well, Amaterasu.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
065	Yes. That's why if I move to the side...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
066	Hi, Lisbeth♪	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
067	Aha! I can see you, Yuri! Hi!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0008
068	In this way, by adjusting the visible range, you can adjust the intensity of the light.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
069	I see!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
070	Hey...why are you guys playing around? The world is in danger and you guys are acting completely carefree.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
071	Right...Amaterasu, you said that all the keys were taken, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
072	Then what is this key that I have?
073	That's...well, right after the keys were stolen I tried desperately to regain them.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
074	When controlling the sun and the moon, there is a place called the Twilight Zone which is where all the doors to each world exist.
075	At that moment, I was in the Twilight Zone focused on operating the sun and moon...
076	It was around the witching hour where I had to make the switch between noon and night.
077	That's why I couldn't respond immediately when the intruder appeared.
078	The intruder also put a curse on me and weakened my power significantly.
079	I was only able to take out four keys...and the intruder tried to pursue and regain those as well.
080	You sent the keys you brought out and called for our help, huh?
081	Amaterasu, you can control the sun. You must have an incredible amount of power, right?
082	What kind of intruder has the power to take advantage of you and cast a curse on you?
083	I guess you could call her the Fallen.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
084	Someone who discarded everything she needed to survive as a human: her good judgment, morality, and pride...
085	In trade for that, she received a terrifying amount of negative energy.
086	Not only is she powerful, but she's sharp...a tough opponent.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0044
087	This key...is the final key that's left to us now.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
088	Yes, it's the Sun Key for this world.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
089	That means that if you use that key we can restore the sunlight above now, right?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0045
090	Oh...the sun is supposed to be operated from the Twilight Zone, right?
091	That means that we'll need to drive out the Fallen who is there and regain control of it.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
092	Well, that person has the keys as well so it's perfect, isn't it?
093	...But how would we get to the Twilight Zone?	VO_yuri.yuri_chara_1006
094	Amaterasu can go there, so wouldn't it be easy?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
095	No. The Fallen did something...and I can no longer get back there.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
096	Then there's no other way to go?!
097	Well, that's why I prepared this ship.
098	This is a legendary ship that can go anywhere.
099	Also...this.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
100	Amaterasu pulls out a radiating Golden Compass.
101	No matter what world we're in, this Compass will show the location of the Twilight Zone.
102	So if we follow this Compass and use this mysterious ship, we'll definitely be able to arrive at the Twilight Zone...
103	Hmm...I see.
104	Without this Compass, I would get lost, so I've been carrying it around with me, but...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
105	Let me see...you hold onto this.
106	Wh-why me...?
107	I'll explain the reasoning later. Let me tell you just one thing...
108	Only "one who is worthy" can hold that.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
109	... ...
110	Amaterasu presents the Compass with a grave expression on her face. <p_name> hesitantly takes it.
111	<p_name>, where is the Compass pointing to?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
112	Um...
113	Wait.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
114	Sorry. Before we leave, there's one more thing I'd like to confirm. Is that all right?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0035
115	...?
116	I know I'm the one that asked for your help, but...the Fallen is a dangerous opponent. Who knows what danger we may face?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
117	Are you certain...you'd like to help me?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_1047
118	Of course! After all, if the sun disappears...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
119	I told you earlier, but I come from a snow country.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
120	It's already cold enough as it is. If it gets any colder...that's gonna be a big problem!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
121	If the sunlight disappears then it'll ruin my home country's sunflower fields...I'll never be able to see them again.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
122	I won't be able to take naps under the warm sun...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
123	Besides...if the sun disappears...everyone will start thinking negatively and our worlds will become darker places. That's terrible!
124	Yes. I can't imagine a world without the sun.
125	Thank you...everyone.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
126	Somehow, I feel like a ray of sunlight has reached my heart.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
127	Amaterasu's eyes glistened as if basking in the sunlight.
128	All right then...let's head to the Twilight Zone!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
129	Let's hurry up and beat the Fallen...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
130	Yes! Let's get back the Sun Keys!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
131	Let me see where the Compass needle is pointed. Oh, this way.
132	A ship, a key, and a compass...I feel like we're in some kind of pirate tale.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0045
133	Tr-true...
134	That's quite spot on actually. This ship...it used to belong to a legendary pirate.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
135	In other words, this is a pirate ship?
136	Yes! Oh, that's right...<p_name>, here...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0004
137	Huh? What's this hat...?
138	What says pirate captain more than this hat? I prepared this for you along with the Compass, <p_name>.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
139	St-stop, it's embarrassing!
140	Oh, my bad. I meant to say Captain <p_name>!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
141	Like I said...!
142	Heheh. Take command of this ship...Captain.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
143	Captain, hurry!	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
144	Aye aye, Captain!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
145	The four of them look at <p_name> with carefree smiles.
146	Jeez...fine. After all, unlike all of you, I can't fight.
147	I can just look at the Compass to see where we need to go, so...okay...I'll take on the role of captain.
148	All right then...
149	Avast, ye scurvy dogs!
150	...Looks like someone's overplaying it.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
151	Set sail!
152	With an "Aye aye, Captain!" the four of them shout as they raise their hands up high.
153	To restore the sun to all the worlds...to regain the Sun Keys...
154	Thus, their voyage begins towards the Twilight Zone where the Fallen awaits them.
