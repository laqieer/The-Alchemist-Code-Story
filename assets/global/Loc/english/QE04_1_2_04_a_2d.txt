001	Why did you act so cold to her? She came here in search of the chief of the Voda faction.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
002	I did it to avoid unnecessary conflict.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
003	Conflict...?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
004	Did you see her outfit? Whatever tribe that outfit belongs to...it's most definitely not the Voda faction.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
005	Someone from another faction approached me wanting to know about the Voda faction.
006	Her outfit...? Actually, I think she's probably...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
007	In order to avoid senseless conflict, it's best not to get involved.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
008	Pushing her away was what was best for my tribe. As chief, that's my judgment to make.
009	You don't have to be so high-strung all the time, you know?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
010	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
011	Just the fact that you care about your tribe is enough, I think.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
012	You've come on this journey with me because you care about the future of Saga.
013	I truly think that alone makes you a worthy chief.
014	Wh-what are you talking about all of a sudden?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0050
015	But...putting out the sparks between the tribes and eliminating all interaction with them are two different things.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
016	That kind of thinking increases the divide between the villages even further and causes the conflict to intensify.
017	However, that is the way of the Toxotes tribe.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
018	We avoid conflict at all costs and will confront an enemy who comes at us with full force.
019	That way of thinking isn't wrong, but...it's important to also make an effort to understand each other first.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
020	I really think we should remove the walls that separate our tribes and work together hand-in-hand.
021	Hand-in-hand? With the other tribes? Such a thing isn't possible...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
022	It is. Look at us, walking side-by-side. We're living proof that it's possible.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
023	... ...
024	Glurp...! Glurrpppp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0004
025	What...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
026	The Jam?! When did they show up?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
027	You...!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0009
028	Glurrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0024
029	Huh...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
030	It worked! There's still more jellies! Run!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
031	Ack!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
