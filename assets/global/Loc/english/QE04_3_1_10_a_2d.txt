001	Using Alchemy...? Unexpected.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
002	I will protect Saga! That is the purpose of this power!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
003	Hmph... Yet, you are still lacking.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
004	...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	Tina!!!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
006	You, whose existence has long been awaited! Know that a straight arrow does not always fly true!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
007	Tehre...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
008	...All you can see is Saga in its current state. You must cast your eyes beyond the past and present...and to the future.	VO_terre.terre_battle_0013
009	And what is the future of Saga that you see?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
010	...When the time comes, you will see.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
011	Will you not tell us? We need to know, so we can work together. Please, Tehre.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0016
012	You've grown old, Fuu. Look at you, bowing down to me. It seems this is another way the future takes form.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
013	Please, tell us what you are thinking, Tehre. If your priority is the future of Saga, I am certain we can work together!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
014	Just look at Voda and Fuu... Who would've thought they'd be able to work together?! I'm sure it's possible!
015	Saga has grown to rely too much on nature. In order to protect the land, it is essential that Asena is released.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
016	We must first begin with that...with releasing Asena who even now suppresses the power of Beelzebub.
017	What...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
018	Asena...has Beelzebub?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
019	Oh? So, you lacked this basic information even as you engaged in your diatribes?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
020	Fuu...is this true?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
021	Indeed. I didn't want to reveal all. However, now that it has come to this, it cannot be helped. Asena currently possesses Beelzebub.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
022	Yet, you lacked this essential knowledge. I stand by my assessment that the future of Saga is too heavy a burden for any of you...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
023	Power is required to change the future. I suppose I can further teach you what I mean by this.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
