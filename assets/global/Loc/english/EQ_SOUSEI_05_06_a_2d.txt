001	The vanguard has made it ashore! We'll create a foothold for the troops that follow us! Go, go, go!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
002	It's just like they said, no one noticed us! Look, not a single guard got dispatched to hinder us—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
003	...Hold on, there's...not a single... That's weird, this city is supposed to be highly populated, where the heck is anybody—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
004	Wha—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
005	"The fish have taken the bait!" I repeat: "the fish have taken the bait!"
006	Understood.
007	I think you've got it all wrong. It's fine to be scared of the Cursed Beasts. All of us are!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
008	It's just—we have to fight. We must fight. It's the only choice we've got.
009	So please don't worry. If you wish for it to, I'm sure the shield will respond to your call.
010	You really think so?
011	Of course I do. I'm proud of you, my knight.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0037
012	You should do things your own way. The right answer isn't going to fall down from the sky if you just wait for it.
013	You've gotta pick your own ideals, accept yourself, and figure out the right answer yourself.
014	An answer that you can be proud of. One that you can fight for without regrets.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
015	(My own reason to fight...)
016	You're not just protecting cargo! Think of the smiles and happiness of the citizens all over our country. I know you can do it if you just think of it that way.
017	When you put it that way... Yes, I love this place and its people. I want everyone who lives here to be able to laugh their days away.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
018	I will protect them! Their peaceful daily lives, their happiness...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0010
019	That is why I was picked by this shield! And that's something I can be proud of!
020	Everyone prepare for combat! Purple Flame Knights Shield Regimen, it is time we protect this city!
021	Everyone, follow me!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0015
022	We'll bring up the rear!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
023	Th-that technique is—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0021
024	All the magil in this atmosphere is now ours to control. I'm sorry, but we're not planning to let you go.	VO_nix.nix_sys_1017
025	Emmel, please look after the wounded behind us! Oh, and if you could throw a bit of Spiritbonding our way—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
026	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
027	Hurray! What wonderful visitors!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0033
028	Good, we're in control of this battle—	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
029	—Incoming! A bombardment from the ocean!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
030	Those slippery snakes! They're opening fire while they're still concealed! Don't think I'm going to let such a low trick slide!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
031	Don't get any closer! Our Time-Space Manipulation won't reach that far... We'll have to leave it to Nimul and the rest!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
032	I know that, but—!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
033	Fire! Keeping firing! Those bastards can't even see what's hitting them! Remain in the open waters and keep firing!
034	Huh...? There's a shadow on the deck—
035	Wh-what is that?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
036	We've arrived above the enemy fleet! Hehe, thought you could let your guard down, didn'tcha? Look at those flabbergasted faces, haha!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
037	This must be a vessel made with the latest magil research. It's pretty impressive.
038	We were planning to fight the enemy at sea... I never thought we'd be doing it from the skies...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
039	I'm glad they didn't notice us earlier.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
040	They were prepared to fight the Invidia Belt, and them alone.
041	They never even thought about paying attention to the sky.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
042	We'll be able to land on the deck soon. Imnus, are your troops ready?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
043	We're in formation. The Purple Flame Knights Sword Regimen is ready to go any time!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0045
044	I fear I'm still not that good at the wind technique we're using as a buffer though...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
045	I'll help out with alchemy this time, so it shouldn't be a problem. You can jump without a worry!
046	Yup, don't worry about a thing! I'll be helping too!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0008
047	Well then, guess we're all good to go!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
048	What?! Invidia Belt soldiers are falling from the sky?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
049	We still have the numerical advantage! We just got to cut 'em down as they drop—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
050	Sorry to disappoint, but the sky ambush was just the beginning! The real thing starts here!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0010
051	I've arrived at the ship! Time for the diversion! Knights of Invidia, attend to my location!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0015
052	That's the captain's signal! All Purple Flame Knights and commercial vessels, charge!
053	Their ships are headed straight for us?!  W-we have to strike back!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
054	Wait.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0039
055	B-but! At this rate they're going to charge right into our flank!
056	Then...perhaps... Those people... Let us make sacrifices of the people who they care so much about...	VO_arius.arius_sys_0003
057	B-but that...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
058	Splendid... They jabbed through what we in our pride relied too much upon and turned the battle around in an instant...	VO_arius.arius_sys_0007
059	Tell the troops to make land. We will make our battlefield with their land under our feet.
060	Y-yes, sir! But what about the enemy attacking our ships?
061	I will crush them... Me and the most splendid of my soldiers.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
062	Wh-wha—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
063	Show them our wrath. Bellow your ire! This is the time to make the world witness our vice!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0030
064		VO_arius.arius_sys_0032
065	Excellent, if we just keep pushing—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
066	Wait! Something doesn't feel right.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
067	This air... Is that corruption?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
068	Be careful, everyone! Something's coming!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
069	Waaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
070	Found you, general—!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
071	A Fallen?! Is it controlling those armored knights?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
072	Nrk... Here he comes!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
073	Give in to sin!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0012
