001	Huuuzzzzzzaaaaaahhhhh!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0032
002	Ngh!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
003	Huuuzzzzaaaaahhhhhh! Ngh... Argh!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0043
004	Carla! Are you all right?	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
005	Now!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0001
006	Neun! We will retreat for now.	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
007	What're you saying?! I can't just do nothing after they made a fool out of me like this!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0012
008	To continue fighting them at this time would be pointless! We have other responsibilities. It's time to go.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0014
009	I don't like admitting this, but that woman is simply too powerful!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0018
010	It must be that mark of hers. If we can confirm it, it will mean the completion of our mission.
011	Tch... I guess we're going back empty-handed for now, but the next time we meet, I'll crush you! You hear me?! Don't you forget it!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
012	We've chased them off for now. Carla, are you all right?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
013	Balt. I'm...fine. Please...take me to Hawk!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
014	Right!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
015	Hawk!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
016	Hawk!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
017	Thank goodness you're safe, Carla. Are you...hurt? Are you all right?
018	Don't worry about me, Hawk! You need to stop talking!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
019	Carla. You must...live...no matter what...all right?
020	O-okay!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
021	Where are the reinforcements?! Why didn't they come?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0021
022	Please don't...blame them. It's the same as...growing crops. It takes time for them to sprout...for you to be able...to see them.
023	The seeds have already been planted. The will to protect the desert...is already in everyone's hearts. I'm sure of it.
024	Everyone is just...dried up. If they get enough water...I'm sure that one day the people of the desert will be united!
025	Balt, I'm...counting on you. Protect...Carla. Protect...the desert, and...protect those seeds...until the day...they start to grow.
026	All right. Leave it to me.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
027	The stars are so beautiful. This isn't such...a bad way to go. Ah, that's...right... Carla?
028	What?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
029	Will you...water those...seeds...for me? I know that...someday...they will...grow.
030	H-Hawk!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
031	You idiot! You can push me around as much as you want! Just don't...leave me...	VO_karla.karla_sys_0019
032	Gosh darnit... Gosh darnit! Why does it have to...be like...this?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
033	I know... I know.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
034	......
035	Master Ryle!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0029
036	Why the surprise? You think I wouldn't notice a guild member running around like that at this time of night?	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
037	Forgive me.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0035
038	......
039	It seems like there was some kind of fight here. Hmph. So you came, too?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0044
040	Huh...?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0027
041	I...did, yes.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
042	So this is where you were. Are you...all right?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
043	Balt... These crops just won't grow. Even though I water them every day and everything...	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
044	Sounds about right.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
045	We have to protect the desert until they've grown, like we promised Hawk.	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
046	Hey, Balt? What do you think about creating a mercenary guild—a band of vigilantes? To protect the desert, you know?
047	Carla...
048	I can't afford to be sad forever. That would just be...negligent, you know? I feel like I should, you know...actually start doing something.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
049	Hawk tried to protect the desert. I want to carry on his will!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
050	That's not a bad idea. I'll help you. I did promise Hawk, after all.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0004
051	Thanks, Balt. Well, it looks like we're gonna start getting really busy soon!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0033
052	Have you thought about a name? For the guild, I mean.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
053	I have! I've been thinking about Hawk's will, and my hope that it will someday be realized.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0023
054	Oh...?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0044
055	So...I have decided that the guild will be called the Sand Hawks! Let's protect the desert together, Balt!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
056	That's a good name! All right! I'll help you out with everything I've got!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
