001	But, if we're just going to pick a Stub Rule, we don't really have to overthink it, do we?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
002	In your case, you usually act before you think anyway, Liz.
003	Well...I was thinking about something else. I was wondering why my dad was willing to become an insect in order to give life to me.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
004	Now that you mention that, it's true...isn't sacrificing your humanity going a bit far? Well, thanks to that I was born, so I'm not complaining.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
005	Yeah...that's why I was thinking if I find the Stub Rule, maybe I'll be able to understand my father's feelings a little better.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
006	I heard that in the Helkovara family, in order to leave the best descendants, we used to buy men from other countries.
007	There aren't many marriages that were based on love in my family. Most of them were strategic marriages.
008	I'd also like to know what it feels like to be so passionately in love that you're willing to throw your life away.
009	Rebecca...
010	Huh? Look at that...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
011	Is it a billboard?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
012	"Please protect the forest by refraining from using magic in the vicinity."
013	They're making it sound like this place is some spectacular tourist spot. It's just an unpaved forest.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
014	Well, I'm sure it's mostly men that come here and they can't use magic.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
015	If we can't use magic...how can we get across this cliff?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
016	I think we can climb it.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
017	Really?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
018	In that case, can you climb it first? I've brought a rope just in case. You can tie it to the top of the tree.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
019	Wow. You're well prepared! It's hard to imagine you were against this trip in the first place.	VO_alma.alma_event_1010
020	Well...um...you know, better safe than sorry!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_event_1005
021	Thanks, Rebecca! You really saved me there! I thought we were gonna have to give up already...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
022	...! Ju-just this once...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
023	Heheh. All right, I'll drop the rope down from the top so climb it carefully!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
