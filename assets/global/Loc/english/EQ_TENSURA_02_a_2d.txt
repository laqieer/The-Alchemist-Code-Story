001	Hey, Albea. What's this Alchemia thing?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
002	That girl from before, Ouroboros, I think? She mentioned that the orcs absorbed too much of it.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
003	Alchemia is the source of power that lies within each and every living creature in Babel.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
004	Magic is performed by manipulating the Alchemia found in nature. Weapons like this which can manipulate Alchemia are called magitek.
005	Those are some of the ways you can use Alchemia in this world.
006	Oooh, I see.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
007	And finally, there's Alchemy.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
008	You can summon beings called Phantom Soldiers who once lived in other eras through the use of Alchemy. Beings like us.
009	H-huh?! You two are dead?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0026
010	Pretty much. But Alchemy is considered a forbidden art, so we cannot tell you any more than that.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
011	...My apologies. You're right.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0036
012	(Seems like it'd be better not to dig too hard into that last topic...)
013	I gotcha! It sounds like your Alchemia is pretty similar to what we called magicules back in my world.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0045
014	Which means....	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
015	!
016	Ooh! I'm back to brimming with power! I think I can shapeshift like this!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0046
017	He...really turned into a human...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
018	Incredible. Even though he was such a little round mochi looking thing a second ago.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0044
019	Yup, it's just as I thought. This world doesn't have magicules, so I just gotta fuel myself with whatever equivalent this world has.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
020	Just as you thought? How did you know?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
021	It was really just a hypothesis. I'm just lucky it worked out.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0005
022	...
023	They are beings possessed by a ferocious appetite. They are currently ravaging and devouring their way through the forests of Saga, and accumulating tremendous amounts of Alchemia in their bellies by doing so.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
024	They will inflict serious damage to Saga if nothing is done to stop them. Not to mention, our worlds will grow more and more tangled in a way that could spell disaster for both of us.
025	(...Ouroboros might've been referring to the orcs.)	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
026	(If it's really them, they will continue to eat to satisfy their never-ending hunger. In which case, they'll also continue to absorb Alchemia.)
027	...
028	Is something wrong?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
029	Hm? Oh, it's nothing.
030	It looks like I recovered the use of some of my skills by absorbing some Alchemia just now.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
031	I'm not in peak condition or anything yet, but it should be enough to fight.
032	Oh, which skills?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
033	A couple of my specialties!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
034	Could you give us some examples?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
035	Hm, there's Sticky Thread, Paralysis Breath, Poison Breath, and so on...
036	Really? Those sound kind of...gross.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
037	Hm, well... That's cause I absorbed them from snakes and centipedes, haha... Oh, I also got Magic Sense!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
038	It lets me take note of the things in my surroundings, so I can use it to figure out where monsters are hiding. It's super useful!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0007
039	Oh, really?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0006
040	(Looks like I recovered another skill just now.)
041	(Hey, Great Sage! It looks like I can use my high-level skills now too, right?)
042	Answer: You are indeed capable of using Alchemia instead of magicules to perform those skills.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0015
043	However, it will take a significant amount of Alchemia to perform any of your high-level skills.
044	(I see. In that case...)
045	Huh? You turned back into a slime already?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
046	Yeah. Turns out maintaining a human form consumes a bunch of Alchemia.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0003
047	I figured it is better not to waste too much Alchemia just in case. I'll turn human again if we run into anyone.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
048	I don't really get it, but if that's what you want, that's fine by me.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
049	So, what's the plan? Are we going to vanquish that calamity of yours?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
050	No... I fear I haven't recovered my strength yet. For now, we should find my friends.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
051	Ouroboros said she brought some people here with me.
052	And lucky for me, I've already found one using my Magic Sense. He shouldn't be too far away, so let's head there first.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
053	...I've got to admit, it's little embarrassing to meet him so soon after they all gave me that grand send-off, though...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
054	Oh?
055	I see. So you went on a journey to fulfill a promise to a dead friend of yours.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
056	But aren't you the country's ruler? Is it really okay for you to go wandering off somewhere by yourself?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
057	Eh, it's a pretty peaceful place these days. They'll be able to handle things without me for a bit.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
058	Perhaps, but aren't you worried about the comrades you left behind?
059	Hm. Well, of course I'm going to worry a little bit, but I know that those guys are capable enough. They'll be fine. Totally fine.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
060	I see. You really trust them, huh?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
061	...
062	Albea?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
063	Trust... Sure. That sounds nice in theory.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
064	But do you have any idea how it feels to be left behind by the person you cherish most? I didn't think so.
065	Matters of the heart aren't so easy.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
066	Huh?
067	...It's nothing.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0035
068	H-hey! What did you mean by tha—?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
069	Oomph! Why did you stop all of the sudden?!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
070	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0020
071	...There's something wrong with those beasts.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0025
072	Agreed. It looks like something scared them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
073	They're coming!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0042
074	Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
