001	Itsuki, don't tell me you...?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
002	That's right. I am descended from the demons you humans have hated and feared for so long.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
003	Demons, huh? I've never heard of anything like that, so I'm not exactly sure what to think of it.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0045
004	It's news to me as well... Do you know anything about this, Noah?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
005	Not really. Wadatsumi never really came up in my studies.
006	Suzuka, you're from Wadatsumi, aren't you? What can you tell us about demons?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
007	I've only ever heard stories of them from my grandmother.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
008	The place where I grew up never really had many dealings with demons, so I've never actually met one.
009	Besides, my training has kept me away from Wadatsumi for a long time.
010	Hmph. While you've all been living your carefree lives, my people have been suffering.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0030
011	You humans have always discriminated against us demons, and we've had to live in fear of the hateful gazes you turn upon us.
012	That's why I can't bring myself to like humans. And I certainly don't want to be here, helping humans out.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0010
013	It is true that I have never spared much thought for the circumstances of demons.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
014	Nonetheless, you have no right to judge us!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0013
015	Is it just me, or is the mood getting a bit hostile here? What should we do?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
016	I... I have no idea.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
017	Maybe it's time for the Rainbow Cacao to save the day!	VO_porin.porin_chara_1009
018	Ohh!
019	That's a great idea!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0045
020	Come to think of it, it was thanks to the Rainbow Cacao that I found the courage to apologize to you, Emma.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
021	Then come on! There's still some over there that we haven't—	VO_eve.eve_chara_1012
022	Thieves! Cacao thieves! Oh, dear. Why did it have to be now?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
