001	Not a soul in sight... I was certain Hawk would be here…
002	What's this? Traces of water... So, he was here after all.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
003	*Sigh* Still wasting precious water on this seed. Who knows if it will grow…
004	It would probably get trampled if fighting ever broke out here.
005	I always said he should focus on guild work instead.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
006	But then he'd just tell me the desert has made me heartless or something.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0011
007	Live in the desert long enough and you become impatient--your heart starts to dry up…
008	For me, watering this seed is like praying to return some life to the desert.
009	He's an oddball, that's for sure, but I have a soft spot for his way of thinking.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
010	Still, this seed won't live to see tomorrow if it gets trampled.
011	…
012	*Pant* Almost…to town… Just a little farther!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
013	Hey you! Stop! Don't move!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0025
014	Huh? W-What the--?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
015	Not one more step! You're about to step on a very precious seed!
016	A seed? Oh no! Uh… I--I'm going to fall over!	VO_alba.alba_battle_0025
017	Ahhhhh!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0025
018	Sorry about that. You're not hurt, are you?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0035
019	I'm fine! The sand broke my fall!	VO_alba.alba_chara_1004
020	At least I didn't step on the seed. Phew. I had no idea!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0035
021	Yeah…a friend of mine has been trying to grow it.
022	Not sure a desert is the best place for it, though.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0011
023	Never know unless you try!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
024	Well, according to him, there's hope …	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
025	Seems like he's investing in a brighter future for this place.
026	Imagine the desert full of greenery. It'd be like paradise!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
027	Yeah…paradise. I bet it would be.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
028	(Too bad it's nothing more than a pipe dream)	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
029	(Those of us living here know. This is our reality. We don't have time for fantasies.)
030	(The kid can praise Hawk if he wants, I guess.)	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
031	By the way, what's your name, kid?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
032	Oh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Aruba!
033	Aruba! Nice meeting you. I'm Carla.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
034	So, tell me--what are you doing alone in a place like this?
035	Well, I'm a merchant so I came to sell my goods.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
036	Ah, that explains the bulky luggage. You're pretty strong for a pipsqueak.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0045
037	I may look small, but actually I'm…	VO_alba.alba_chara_2001
038	Say, how about I accompany you to town?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
039	These parts are no place for a scrawny kid like you.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0039
040	Besides, talking about my friend put me in a good mood. Shall we?
