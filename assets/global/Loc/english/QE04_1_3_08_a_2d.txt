001	This is not good! If it keeps expanding like this, it'll swallow the whole forest.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
002	And all the animals that live here as well!
003	The market too...! And all the people who gather there!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
004	Let's split up! I'll chase the Gluttony soldiers! You keep crushing the Jam that appears with all your might!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
005	You're going to handle the scattered Gluttony soldiers on your own?! Are you sure...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
006	Ultimately, it's the same thing! If we were to focus on defeating the Gluttony troops, the Jam would keep expanding!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
007	If we focus just on the Gluttony troops, we would be abandoning the growing gigantic Jam!
008	Is it even possible to destroy the emerging Jam and prevent it from expanding?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
009	No...to be honest...I doubt we can get rid of all of it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
010	After all, there's no way of anticipating their movements. That being said...there's one thing I'm certain about...
011	I know. We can't let them lay a finger on the Paza village.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
012	Yes. We must defend it at all costs.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
013	We'll try to hold them back somehow. There's no time to waste. Let's go.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
014	Yeah. I'm not ready to deal with Liz if there are any injuries. Stay safe...Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
015	You too...Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
