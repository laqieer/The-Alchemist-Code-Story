006	I-Is it over?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
007	Yes. I believe so.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
008	I see... So the regrets and anguish of those who attempted to protect Hisham that day were partially absorbed into his Alchemia, which resulted in Sephiron calling him here.
009	Then the Jam just now were the result of Beelzebub's curse?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
010	Yes. However, the altar has returned to its usual purified state.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
011	Um... I'm sorry, I...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
012	You were not at fault. To feel pain is normal. The burden you now carry... I am sorry that it is so heavy.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
013	Kamui, I... I...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
014	Hisham?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
015	He's fine. He just needs some rest.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
016	That's...good to hear.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
017	You did well, Kamui.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
018	Chief?! I-I must apologize for such a ruckus near our sacred altar.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
019	There is no need. I have seen for myself what happened here.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
020	Malta, take Hisham back to his home. Kamui and I still have some things to discuss.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
021	Understood. Hisham?
022	Uhm, mmhm...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1002
023	I see. So it was Hisham's grief that affected Sephiron so greatly.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
024	Affected...? What happened, Chief? I have never heard of such a thing happening before.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
025	You wouldn't have. That is the secret darkness that Sephiron holds.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
026	Only those trusted to be the head of the tribe are trusted with this information.
027	Kamui, you are aware that Sephiron has powers of purification, correct?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
028	Yes, and that its power suppresses the curse of Beelzebub.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
029	Therefore, we of the Sephira tribe have hidden ourselves and protected Sephiron for generations.
030	Yes. That is correct. However, there is also a dark side to this story.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
031	Sephiron wields the power of purification, which means she has the ability to identify and purify evil and corruption.
032	However, there are some things that Sephiron cannot purify.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
033	Such as...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
034	No matter how pure or just, there are none who do not hold the potential for darkness within their hearts.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
035	That deep sadness carved into his heart, the lingering regret... This combination threw Hisham's Alchemia into a frenzy.
036	Then, when he touched Sephiron, the purification powers of the great tree were corrupted into emitting misfortune instead.
037	This is a result of Hisham's distorted Alchemia reacting to the curse of Beelzebub buried deep within Sephiron.
038	So that is what caused this upheaval?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
039	Yes. Any great quantity of Alchemia is enough to transform this world.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
040	We, the Sephira, are able to control this phenomenon with our Spiritbonding, to a certain extent.
041	However, Hisham has not been trained the way we have. He does not yet know what he can do.
042	The despair within him must have awakened the darkness sleeping within Sephiron.
043	Something that has been the source of blessings for our village has perhaps become...a liability.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
044	However, our duty includes returning Sephiron to her original state in times like these.
045	That is what it means to be the Protector of Sephiron.
046	Ah... I believe I remember Isidore's father Judah saying something like that about his role as Protector.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
047	Yes, but he did not finish training a successor before he died saving my beloved Malta.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0037
048	And unfortunately, Isidore was not suited for such a role, so I had thought that perhaps this would be the end of the Protectors...
049	...
050	However, considering his instruction of you, it seems he saw that you would be able to take on the burden of Protector in his stead.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
051	Well...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
052	You impressed me with how you dealt with the curse just now. I did not see only Kamui, I saw the Protector.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
053	You have proven yourself to me.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
054	There is only one who is capable of connecting to the decimum sephirah and making use of the full potential of the sephirah.
055	They bear the mark of one who has been chosen by Sephiron, their proof of having been chosen as Emmel's successor. Judah had the same mark.
056	I...? The successor of Emmel...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0021
057	For one such as you, born to a distant relative of ours, to be saved by Judah that day...	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0005
058	I still remember the look in Judah's eyes when he informed me we would be taking you in.
059	Perhaps it was Sephiron herself that led him to you.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
060	That is why I have entrusted so many tasks to you that led you to the outside world.
061	All so that you would be prepared to take on the role of protecting this village, and so protect the stability of this place which safeguards Sephiron.
062	Yes, but...I am yet inexperienced and unprepared in many ways.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
063	You understand, do you not, Kamui?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
064	Hisham witnessed the darkness of Sephiron. This makes it clear that Sephiron is currently unstable.
065	If his heart wavers again, it is possible that Sephiron may respond the same way she did today.
066	When that happens, if Sephiron cannot be purified, Beelzebub's curse will overwhelm the great tree and this land will begin to die.
067	If we are to take that boy into our village, we must have someone to subdue the curse.
068	You have only one of two choices. Either succeed the role of Protector, or be prepared for Hisham to be expelled from the village.
069	Those are my only choices?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
070	Which will you choose? I will allow you to take some time to consider this, Kamui.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
