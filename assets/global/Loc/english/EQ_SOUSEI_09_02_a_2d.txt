001	Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
002	Nimul!
003	Hrk!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
004	How dare you.
005	How could you... To Emmel...!
006	How? Why? Well...Nimul, let me just ask you a simple question. Maybe that'll make things a bit clearer.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0001
007	When you say you're going to save "everything and everyone"...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
008	Am I included in that list?
009	I'll kill you.
010	(...No.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
011	I'll kill you!
012	(That's...not right.)
013	Anyone who lays a hand on Emmel will die by my hand!
014	(It was...supposed to be different...)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
015	This...isn't what I wanted, is it?
016	Fine, then...
017	Then I'll change it! You say this is just the way things are? That this is how things have to be? Well, maybe so, but that just means they need to be changed, so I'm gonna change 'em!
018	Really, now?
019	I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!
020	That's my dream, okay?!
021	Change the world? Nimul, sometimes I can't believe the stuff that comes out of your mouth...
022	But...thank you for saying that, Nimul.
023	That's what my little sister said to me, with a smile on her face.
024	Seeing that, I learned for the first time what she looked like when she was genuinely happy...
025	That the thing she needed to be happy from the bottom of her heart was this great undertaking.
026	I had to make that overly ambitious childlike dream of mine come true. Otherwise, she would never truly be saved.
027	And so, there was only one thing to do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
028	I had to change the world. That would quickly become my reason for living.
029	...! Gggh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
030	Hmm? Finally, it's calmed down...a bit.
031	Nnnf...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
032	No... I can't... This can't go on...
033	This power was never meant for humans. Humans lack any means of controlling it. It's a forbidden power, intended strictly for gods to wield...
034	Nngh, gnrk... If this continues, then all the regions...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
035	No. That cannot be allowed.
036	What have I been fighting for all my life? To save everyone! Right?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
037	Then that's what I must do now! Save the world, save all the regions, save all the people who live within them... And...
038	(Fulfill that selfish, childish, blustery promise I once made.)
039	(That's what I've been working so hard for all this time, after all. Right?)
040	Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
041	Nimul!
042	Hrk!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
043	No...
044	Emmel...is fine. With Eulalia on her side, she must be.
045	So... I should still...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
046	(I mustn't allow this world to be destroyed.)
047	(But then what do I do? With the cores combined, it's not like I can control this light...)
048	(At best, I can suppress it, but even then, this stone converts its surroundings into magil and consumes them, no matter how hard I try to hold it at bay.)
049	Nrk... Haaa... Hnng...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
050	This is the power...of the Cursed Beasts...
051	(Though the only thing that's different from what I'm used to is the nature of the magil being controlled...which means...)
052	I might be able to seal it, if I'm lucky!
053	There's an altar here that looks just like the one in Sephiron. So let's give it a shot. Fingers crossed...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
054	Ha...aaa...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
055	Ngh... Even walking is...incredibly painful. I don't think I've ever felt pain like this before.
056	But...I can't...give up.
057	(It hurts, but I can withstand it. I just have to get out of the city, and then—)
058	Ah... It's been a long time since my heart hurt this much. Not since I learned I wouldn't be able to become the Vessel of Purification myself.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	(If I could have, I would have happily taken her place.)
060	I wish I could have been a better brother to her.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
061	...
062	What?! You're... What are you all doing here? You should get away...quickly...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
063	What...? What are you...?
064	(What am I saying? It's obvious they've come out to defend themselves and all the things—and people—they hold most dear. Just as I would.)
065	Please! Don't come any closer! If you do... Mrng, just get away, please!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
066	...
067	Heh...
068	Hahahahahahahahahahahah!
069	Wh—? Why are you laughing?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
070	Finally! Our time has come!
071	It's our turn at last! Welcome, Nimul, Child of God! Welcome, savior!
072	Deliver us!
073	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
