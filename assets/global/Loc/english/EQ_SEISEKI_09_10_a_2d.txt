001	You finally came! I finally get to meet you.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
002	......
003	Well then! Let's decide once and for all who the best twin sword fighter is!
004	...Almira.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
005	Huh? ...Oh! Yes!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
006	I'm sorry. Do you think you can look after Kagura? She has a few deep wounds.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0035
007	Yauras...
008	Heheh. Are you trying to act tough? I'm sure you want to defeat me as well and gain the title of the best in the world, right?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
009	There's no sign that Greed Dike showed up in Slothstein.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
010	Most likely, they're headed towards Wratharis. Did you receive any word from Othima?
011	No, not yet...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
012	Hey...are you listening?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
013	Um...are you sure you don't need to address her?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
014	...? Address who?
015	Who? Um, she's been talking to you all this time...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
016	Heh. You're afraid to face me, aren't you?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
017	Who is that person?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
018	Huh...?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
019	I'm not sure what you mean by address her since I don't even know who she is. Oh...were you talking to me?
020	...!!! You scum...!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
021	See? I don't have any acquaintances who use abusive words like "scum."
022	Aghhh! Get off your high horse! I'm taking you down, you little...!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0022
023	How pathetic.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
024	...!
025	Y-you dodged it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
026	If you're going to speak of beauty, then you should start by working on your vocabulary.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
027	Captain Yauras...you can see her movements?!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
028	Very impressive, Yauras. How noble of you to give advice to your enemy.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0011
029	...?! Ugff...!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0019
030	Yauras...?!
031	Ack! Wh-what the...?! I'm sure that I dodged it!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
032	Oh? Your complexion isn't looking very good. Now where did that look of confidence disappear to?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
033	So...you're not all talk, huh?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
034	Fine...come at me then. I'll take you on.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0010
035	Heheh. You're still just as arrogant as ever.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
036	Try to ask nicely next time, you rude little tramp!!!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0015
037	Ack...?! She's fast?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
038	You don't learn, do you? Did you think you dodged it?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
039	Agh?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0019
040	Yauras!!!
041	Heheh! Hyahaha! What a wonderful moment!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0009
042	The famous Yauras being carved by my blade...and kneeling pathetically!
043	It's almost like a dream!!!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0023
044	Ugh...! Wh-why do you see me as your enemy?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
045	Of course...you wouldn't remember me, would you?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
046	Have we met before?
047	In a small village in Wratharis. You...saved me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
048	Saved you?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
049	You once saved a little band of thieves from the Wratharis soldiers.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
050	The Wratharis soldiers were not necessarily in the wrong.
051	They found a small group of ruffians and, according to their law, were going to execute them. We were the ones that were obviously in the wrong.
052	"We"? You were one of the thieves then?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
053	My father was a bandit. When I say bandit, he was weak, unresourceful, and a terrible father, but...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
054	At that time, he tried to run away and abandon me. He was caught by the Wratharis soldiers.
055	Was he executed?
056	Yes. All the other bandits were restrained along with myself.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0018
057	The Wratharis soldiers, following their law, began the execution. I was ready to die.
058	And Yauras showed up there?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
059	Yes. Going against the tough soldiers, you said to them...
060	"What can they do to defend themselves? Put away your weapons."
061	Do you remember?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
062	No...
063	...I didn't think you would.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
064	But...I still remember you clearly in that moment like it was yesterday.
065	Before the army troops, your strength never faltered. And you were breathtakingly beautiful...
066	My father had just been killed...and yet I found myself completely smitten by you!
067	......
068	If I had your strength I'm sure I would've been able to save my father...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
069	I continued to hold a grudge against you for not having come to save us sooner.
070	Meanwhile, on the other hand...I was filled with deep jealousy and envy for your beautiful figure. You continued to haunt me...
071	Wait. What even is that?! Yauras didn't do anything wrong!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
072	Huh? What are you saying?! Being so beautiful and strong is sufficient enough of a sin.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
073	...! You're twisted. You're so in love with Captain Yauras that it's warped your mind.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
074	In love?! Please, you must be joking! Why would I be...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
075	...I'm sorry.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0035
076	...?!
077	If I had rushed there a little sooner...I could've saved you from your suffering.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
078	...I'm sorry.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0035
079	Huh?! Stop it!!! Don't say that!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
080	You...are the object of my hatred! You have to remain that way!
081	I don't intend to flee from that responsibility, but...
082	That doesn't mean I can let you and the others do what you're doing.
083	I cannot overlook what you people are doing...as a knight who lives in the name of absolute justice.
084	Heheh...! That's right! You've gotta be yourself!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
085	Come on...this is the moment I dreamed of! Yauras...I'm going to carve you up with my swords!!!
086	Yauras...!
087	I can't afford to lose! I must avenge my lost friends as well!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0030
