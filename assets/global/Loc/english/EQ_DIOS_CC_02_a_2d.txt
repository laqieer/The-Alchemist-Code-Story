001	Don't get any closer! I'll cut this kid's head off!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
002	Ack... You vile scum! Let the hostage go and surrender yourself!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
003	Why would I listen to the likes of you, you suzerain dogs!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
004	Mommy...help...
005	Oh, Sir Paladins! Please, help my child...	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0019
006	What should we do? We can't afford to let the bandit escape, but, if we move now, the girl will be killed.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
007	Argh... It's between capturing the bandit or saving the hostage's life...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
008	Heheh. Yes. You better not move. You have no choice but to let us escape!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
009	Move!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0007
010	Agyaahhh...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0027
011	He killed the bandit without a moment's hesitation!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
012	Mommy!
013	Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0042
014	Well, that was quite the dangerous stunt to pull off. I guess we should give it up for our "hero" Dias. He couldn't care less about the hostage.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
015	How can you call yourselves Paladins when you don't even know how to save a hostage from a bandit?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
016	Huh...
017	You're useless.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
018	(There's no point in bringing them along with me. They'll just get in the way.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
019	I'll take down the bandits on my own.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
020	(Useless...huh? Who would've thought a day would come when I would be throwing that term at someone...)
021	You useless brat! Stop lazing around and work!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
022	Your parents died in the war and you're being fed and clothed by the kindness of the neighboring village! Work harder and pay back your debt!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
023	Ah...
024	Yuffie! You again? Stop dropping our special cargo, you useless brat!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
025	Stop! Don't hit Yuffie!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
026	What's that? Dias, are you gonna defy your elders again?
027	Yuffie's body is weak! I'll work enough for both of us! That's fine, right?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0041
028	Dias...
029	Well, well, what a reliable older brother. Still, you better not let it get to your head!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
030	That's enough for now. Let him be. He says that he'll work enough for both of them.
031	Understood...Mayor...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
032	Thank you, Mayor! I'll work as hard as I can.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0033
033	We'll be relying on you. Let Yuffie get some rest.
034	They made you work so hard. This is all we have to eat... So much for being fed...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
035	Dias...eat this...
036	Yuffie? Sorry for making you worry. I'm fine so you eat it all yourself.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
037	No. I'm full already...
038	(Of course, she isn't... As her older brother, I need to do better by her.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
039	Hyahhh! This work is nothing!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
040	Well, you're in high spirits, aren't you, Dias? If you're gonna work for your sister's portion as well then lend me a hand over here.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
041	Got it! I'll do anything!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
042	(Ack... This isn't two people's portion. They're making me work at least three times as hard. I've gotta keep a calm face in front of Yuffie.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
043	Dias, look!
044	Hm? It's a small but really beautiful flower. Where did you find it?	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
045	There were many of them blossoming near the village. I thought if I let them grow in the vase, they'll make this house look gorgeous.
046	Thank you, Yuffie. I'll do my best too.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0008
047	Hey, Dias...do you know the language of the flowers?
048	Mom taught it to me before!
049	I don't...for starters, what's the name of this flower?
050	It's a begonia. Tomorrow I'll tell you what it represents in the language of the flowers. Try to give it some thought, Dias!
051	Fine. Let's go to bed now.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
052	Hey, Dias! Help over here today!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
053	Fine, I'll do it! Whether it be two or three people's share of work!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
054	That guy made me slave away until dark... I wonder if Yuffie ate properly.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
055	(That's right. I didn't have time to think about the language of the flowers.)
056	I'm home...Yuffie! Are you still awake?
057	... ...
058	Yuffie, what's the matter! Yuffie! Hey! Your throat...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
059	Mayor! I need your help! Yuffie's throat...her throat...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
060	Ah, Dias. I need to talk about it with you as well. We've found a buyer for Yuffie.
061	A buyer...?	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
062	Rejoice! A noble took a liking to Yuffie and decided to purchase her. He seems to share some kind of...well...benevolent hobby.
063	Just as a precaution, since he didn't want to hear her crying or shouting while playing, he asked if I could crush her throat beforehand.
064	So I just gave her some medicine to drink that would crush her throat. That's all it does, so don't worry.
065	...That's all it does? Are you serious, you vile piece of scum?!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
066	What's that? An aristocrat is gonna buy your useless brat of a sister! How about you have a little more gratitude?!
067	Shut up! Shut up! Yuffie... Give back Yuffie her voice! Give it back!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
068	The kid is acting like he's possessed!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0024
069	Hey, you! Go beat this brat outside!
070	I can make more money from selling Yuffie than if you worked all your life!
071	Just because a worthless, incompetent piece of trash like you works twice as hard...it doesn't give you any bragging rights!
072	Argh! Yuffie...! How dare you treat Yuffie that way!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0025
073	... ...!
074	Yuffie, you're a valuable commodity so come this way! Forget about Dias.
075	... ...!!!
076	Yuffie! Yuffie...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
077	Shut up, you brat! Do you want me to kill you out of spite?
078	What are all of you doing there?!
079	Back then, I was powerless. I couldn't protect Yuffie. Ultimately, the mayor and the villagers ended up beating me to an inch of my life.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
080	That was when he saved me.
081	Hey, Paladin. Did you come all the way here alone?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
082	Hehehe. A risk-taker, huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
083	I see. It looks like that's the bandits' hideout. An odd twist of fate...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
