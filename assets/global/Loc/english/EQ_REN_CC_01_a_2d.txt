001	Hello. It's been a while.
002	Hey sis... I did it. Just like you said in your letter... I exorcised the demons.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
003	Sis.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
004	I mean...the writing was all shaky, so I couldn't really read most of what you wrote—like, at all...
005	You have nothing to apologize for. It's just...one of those things. You know. Codes of conduct. Laws of nature.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
006	...
007	So, I wasn't really taking it super seriously in the beginning, you know?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
008	My bad. When I got there, the corruption in Wadatsumi was worse than ever before, so I figured I'd better get on with it like a proper, dutiful sibling...
009	Exorcising demons is the duty of the Black Star Clan, after all.
010	I didn't get it, though. It was easy enough, so I did what you asked of me, but...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
011	But now I think I can understand it a little bit. That's thanks to you, sis.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
012	I've always liked bubbles. I liked watching them dance in the air and fly high into the sky. Who knew where they might end up?
013	I'd watch them, transfixed, while my sister would watch me with a smile on her face.
014	That's all. She didn't need to say anything. That was how we spent our days then.
015	The Black Star, the Demon Hunting Clan.
016	A clan with an ancient mission. They wield the sacred blade Sumeragi in times of crisis.
017	The fate of our clan was to be the blade that slays the demons.
018	That's how my sister and I were raised. The code of our family was absolute. There was no going against it.
019	It didn't matter how we felt. We had to follow the code that we were indoctrinated into from the moment we were born.
020	At least, that's how it was supposed to be.
021	There's no reason for you to take on something you don't understand. I will uphold the legacy and code of our family. Be free, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
022	Why?
023	My sister smiled when I asked her that.
024	A gentle and ephemeral smile, as soft and fleeting as bubbles floating away on the wind.
025	Then the day came when I started to hate the bubbles I once loved so much.
026	One hot summer day, I was playing with bubbles like usual.
027	Ren.
028	When I turned to look at her, expecting her usual smile, I saw a frown instead.
029	...
030	...What?
031	Three years at most. That's how long they said I had left.
032	This...can't be true.
033	It is.
034	I know it is hard to accept, but that's just how it goes sometimes.
035	Life, I mean.
036	The bubbles my sister blew popped as she spoke.
037	What? I don't get it...
038	That's what the doctor told me, and I doubt they're wrong. The only thing I can do now...
039	...is continue to uphold our family's code with the time I have left.
040	...
041	Come on, it's not like I'm going to die tomorrow. I've decided to think of it as...a gift of time to help me prepare.
042	Prepare...to uphold the code?
043	That's right.
044	But I—
045	I couldn't say anything. I didn't know how to express what I was feeling. I still didn't know anything back then.
046	I felt like I shouldn't say what I was thinking.
047	You don't have to worry though, Ren. I'll take care of everything.
048	It's better to burn out than fade away. I'm going to give everything for the code.
049	Is the code really that important? Enough to devote the rest of your life to it? Don't you want to live longer?
050	Nope.
051	How are you so strong?
052	How? It's thanks to the code that I can be strong.
053	The popping bubbles began to seem just like my sister's life. Fragile and impermanent. Short-lived.
054	That's when I began to hate them.
055	Seeing them float high on the breeze, I was almost jealous that they could escape this unfathomable situation.
056	Even after I stopped blowing bubbles completely, I thought about that moment.
057	Anything to distract me from the idea that my sister was going to die.
058	That's what I thought.
059	――――!!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
060	This is no joke... At this rate, I'll be killed!
061	Ngh!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0025
062	Done already?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
063	What happened to three years left?! You're in perfect health! This doesn't make any sense!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0012
064	Well, do you have a problem with that? You'd rather me die like the doctor said?
065	No one could kill you even if they tried.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
066	Oh? If you truly think I can't be killed... Maybe you need some more training to give yourself a fighting chance!	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0045
067	...!
068	Are you prepared, Ren?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
069	W-wait!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
070	I'll forgive you if I make it past three years.	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0030
071	And so my sister trained like hell every day and dragged me to hell with her.
072	Burning with a desire to protect the code with the time she had left, she became monstrously strong.
073	Even after the three years she'd been given, she was doing well.
074	...
075	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
076	Let's call it a day.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
077	Call it a day?! You almost killed me!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
078	You're not dead. No harm, no foul.
079	I thought you said you'd go easy on me if you lived past three years?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0002
080	Hmph. Poor little brother. I'll think about it. Maybe.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
081	How cruel!
082	It is cruel. This was a good day of training.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
083	You're still training... Why do you need to get so strong?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
084	To protect the code. Though I'm also trying to make you stronger too.
085	But you're already the strongest person I know.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
086	Wadatsumi still isn't at peace. It's true that not many have seen demons since we've been taking care of them in secret, but...
087	There are humans who would take advantage of the peace they see and try to profit off of it themselves.
088	But...that doesn't have anything to do with the code, does it?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
089	The teachings of the Black Stars are concerned not only with demons, but with evil too. You know this.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
090	Well, sure, but...
091	Haven't you ever thought about living as you like, without worrying about the code? Don't you have a dream?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
092	Of course I have dreams. Just last night I had quite the exciting one. Though it would take a while to describe...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
093	That's not what I meant...
094	Thank you, Ren. Your jokes always cheer me up.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0033
095	I was being serious!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
096	If you weren't joking, then... You were lying to me? No, that's not it. Hmm, how interesting.
097	Natsume.
098	There's no dream more important than my cute little Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
099	...Did you eat something weird or something?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
100	Nothing that you haven't eaten.
101	Haaa...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
102	...?!
103	A demon?!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
104	More of them have been showing up than before. They must be gathering somewhere, scheming to bring corruption to our land.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0029
105	Which means we were right in training somewhere away from people.
106	We should slay it now, before it reveals itself. We can't let any corruption spread.
107	It also makes the perfect cooldown exercise after training.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
108	Natsume, wait!
