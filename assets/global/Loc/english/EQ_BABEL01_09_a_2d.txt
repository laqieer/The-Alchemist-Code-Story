001	It's my fault that he... No! Sir Gerald!!!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
002	There's no need to be so noisy. Hyaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
003	I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!!! Because of me, you...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0043
004	It wasn't... My body just moved on its own. It's nothing you need to apologize for.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
005	Sir Gerald... You... How could you risk your life like that for a therian like me?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
006	Tch... How dare you...question my honor. Therian...human... It doesn't matter!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0014
007	The vow I took...isn't as half-hearted as all that! I will protect the...happiness of everyone...in this world! Young, old, man, woman...human...or therian!
008	Sir Gerald!!!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
009	The person I respected more than anyone else in this world... That is the justice he taught me!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
010	Ah...
011	He put his life on the line for the therians! Even as he stood on the brink of death, he celebrated the fact that he was able to protect all of them! Even though he lost his life in the process!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0018
012	A proud man...he never gave up on his code...of honor. My father...never gave up...anything except...his own life...in order to protect...someone else!
013	...!
014	I won't forget that. His legacy has always been mine to inherit!
015	I may have held a grudge against the therians once...for being the reason he was gone...but...	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
016	...I let go of it the day I heard you say...the same words Vettel once said...to me. That is why I tell you now... I respect you...and recognize you for all that you can...and will do!
017	Sir Gerald!!!
018	You hold...within you the...call to...justice...that I am drawn...to support. That...is why I had to put my...life...on the line...to protect you!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
019	No... I wanted to. I wanted...to put my life on the line to...protect the iron will...that you hold within you. I will not let you die!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
020	Sir Gerald!!!
021	You... You will become the bridge...to a future in which therians...and humans...can live happily together...right? So...live! And...nngh...	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
022	Don't speak! Save your breath!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
023	What the—?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
024	Um, so... Hypothetically, it might be possible that I missed one of the assassins, and uh... They may have lit the forest on fire.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0035
025	Why would they do that?!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
026	I mean, just throwing out some ideas, but maybe as a last resort to kill Gerald? I mean, we could sit around debating that all day, but uh... We should probably leave.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
027	Oh no... You're leaving already? You won't even stay for tea?	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
028	You! You're the presence...I've been sensing all this time!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
029	Oh dear. You sensed me? My, my, my... As expected of Ironheart Gerald of the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
030	...It seems like you have me at a disadvantage. I suppose you're here to take my head.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0044
031	Urgh. Who the heck are you? You're kind of grossing me out.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
032	Hm... It doesn't really matter. I mean, you're going to die here, and dead men can tell no tales.	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
033	Still, I must commend you. That you were able to get all the way here is quite a feat. What I have seen so far exceeds even the most impressive of rumors about your abilities.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
034	I've heard especially good things about Sunbright Vettel and...you, Ironheart Gerald.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
035	Hmph... I don't know what you're...after, but...I'm not simply going to roll over and die for you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
036	Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
037	So you are the summoner of these immortal soldiers. Nina, at the ready! If we defeat her, we could completely change the tide of this battle!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
038	Roger! Gerald...did you see that light just now?	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
039	Yeah... Every time she summons something, that ring flashes with light. It looks like it could be what she uses to channel her summoning powers. Aim for that ring.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
040	What are the two of you whispering about? Weren't you going to attack me? Or have you simply given up?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
041	I suppose I could make that work. I could watch you burn instead. Oh, yes... I think I could enjoy that.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
042	After all, it isn't as if I can just let you go.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
043	Here she comes!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
