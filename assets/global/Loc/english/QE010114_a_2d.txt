001	Did you just say that you want to fulfill your promise to my father?
002	Huh? Did I?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
003	Thank you, Sabareta. Those words alone make me feel we are coming closer to realizing peace between Wratharis and Envylia.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0033
004	Then, little by little, if we can build trust...
005	I'm sure we'll be able to walk hand in hand one day.
006	Honestly. Look how blissful you are.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
007	Besides, tell that to him instead of me.
008	Huh...?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025

010	Dias!
011	I've finally found you, Agatha! Hold on. I'm going to rescue you!
012	Tsk! No questions asked, huh? It's going to be difficult to reconcile with this one!
013	Reconcile...? You've got to be joking! You kidnapped my sister! You can atone for your sin in hell!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
014	W-wait, Dias! Stop!!!
