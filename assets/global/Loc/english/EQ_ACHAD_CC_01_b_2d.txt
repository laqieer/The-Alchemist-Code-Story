001	Hi there.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
002	Huh?!
003	Come on, smile for the audience. The spotlight's on you!	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0011
004	...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
005	Unbelievable! Just as our beloved Amu seals her fifth victory in a row, a mysterious interloper jumps into the ring!
006	...?
007	Hello! Good evening! Welcome, one and all!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
008	Is that another one of your toys?
009	No! I've never seen that man in my life! What is the meaning of this?!
010	Do you believe in God?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
011	It appears even the master does not know the identity of this mysterious challenger! Who is this guy?!
012	My name is Jester.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0001
013	"Jester"? Is he some sort of clown?
014	Dear audience, are you still not satisfied?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
015	I've come because I thought wreaking havoc in this unsightly place might brighten it up a little.
016	After all, this silly stage serves only to provide brainless amusement. It has no other purpose whatsoever!
017	So, what do you say?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
018	...!
019	Shall we start your sixth match of the day?	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0019
020	Oho! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new challenger! How will the master take this sudden declaration? Will he approve?!
021	Wh-what?
022	An unknown challenger? Things are finally getting interesting.
023	Heh... Heheh! Hahaha!
024	Very well then! Whatever it takes to liven up the place!
025	It sounds like we've got the master's approval! The interloper is to be Amu's sixth challenger of the day! Will our poor, exhausted Amu be able to handle six matches in a row?!
026	?!
027	Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!
028	What a generous welcome! Thank you, one and all, for your lovely ovation!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0033
029	Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!
030	Amu! Quick, get back inside! This wasn't the deal! You don't have to do this!
031	Y-yes!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
032	The show must go on, dear.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
033	Aahh!
034	ARE YOU READY?!
035	Amu!
036	START!
037	Have you ever seen God before?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
038	N-no!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
039	Oho? What's this?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0025
040	...
041	Your eyes...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0003
042	Huh?!
043	They're just like mama's.
044	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
045	A sharp jab out of nowhere! Did that man just pull her eye out?! This isn't looking good for the artificial maiden!
046	Haha... Hahahaha! Incredible! Absolutely incredible!
047	He took her left eye?
048	Don't look at me like that, Mama.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
049	Hngh! Aah...aarghh...nnrgh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
050	I'm not a bad boy, you know? I do my best every day. So don't glare at me like that. Don't look down on me. Don't turn your eyes away from me. Just look upon me kindly. Me and only me.
051	Wh-what is that man talking about?!
052	Aaaaaaaargh!
053	You won't die, will you? Please don't die, Mama!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0018
054	Jester! Jester! Jester!
055	Ahaha... Hahahaha! Kyahahahahaha! Hee hee hee hee!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0023
056	Go Jester! Kill her! Kill Amu!
057	No!
058	We've been dying to see her fall! Come on! Do it!
059	This is it! This is what we've been waiting for!
060	Show us what the artificial maiden looks like on the inside! We want blood and guts! BLOOD AND GUTS!
061	A standing ovation, just for me? At last, things are as they should be.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
062	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghhh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
063	Listen how they cheer for you! For your blood to be splattered across these walls! You've kept them waiting for ever so long!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
064	Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
065	I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted! Did you like prancing around in that ridiculous dress of yours? Did it feel good to fight while the crowd cheered you on?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
066	Amu!
067	!
068	Oh?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0003
069	Run, Amu! This isn't right!
070	Y-yes!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
071	Have you come to spoil our fun?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0022
072	Am! Quick! Grab my hand!
073	This won't do. You weren't invited.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0012
074	No!
075	A-Amu...
076	This isn't your stage.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0015
077	...
078	Ugh! What a pain. Corpses always miss their stage cue.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
079	N-No... B-Bian...ca...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
080	Yes, go on. Get a good look at her. That will be you, soon enough.
081	Now... Pray quickly, or be damned!
082	N-no! Yes... No, no, no!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
083	Is that all you can say? Don't you have any other words in your vocabulary? Well, this is no good! How are you going to plead for your life? How are you going to tell me how much you hate me?
084	Jester! Jester! Jester!
085	Oh well. I suppose that's fine. You might look like Mama, but that doesn't mean you're the same person.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0044
086	?!
087	Watch me, God! Witness, as I murder this pure and innocent girl for your amusement!	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0019
088	Watch me trample her human dignity in the most dreadful way imaginable!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
089	I'll slice, cut, carve, and smash her to pieces! If the audience has any requests for her demise, I'll gladly hear them! Cheer for me! Cheer only for me!
090	Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
091	Aha! Will you listen to that?! The audience is just as wicked as I am! They do not fear to revel in sin or heresy!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
092	Aaaaaaaaaaarghhh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
093	Try and save her, God! I dare you!	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0014
094	No! No! No, no, no! Aaaaaaghhh! Nooo!
095	Are you more foolish than the jester himself?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
096	...
097	Ngh... Aaaaaaaghh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
098	Pray. Fight back. Do something.
099	You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
100	You shall not raise your head.
101	You shall not resist your superiors. You shall not beg for help or handouts.
102	You shall have no will of your own.
103	You shall be a slave. You may hold no hope in your heart, no whisper of independent thought in your soul. You shall be powerless against your betters.
104	Amidst these unassailable rules of my life, all I had were my hands. I was allowed ownership of nothing else.
105	Hey, squirt.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
106	That day, I escaped, and fell into the world's garbage can.
107	Nice eye you got there.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
108	You looked at me.
109	Bet you'd look even cooler with an eyepatch.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
110	When I think back on that time, all I can remember is how terribly empty my stomach felt.
111	N-n-n... N-n...
112	Huh? What're you trying to say?
113	No.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
114	Come on, squirt. Let's get some food together.
115	The guy I was supposed to meet for dinner didn't make it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
116	Why did you seem so lonely that day?
117	Why were you carrying such a fancy eyepatch in your pocket?
118	I couldn't begin to guess. All I knew was that even in the dark, deep underground, in that place untouched by sunlight, you looked like you were shining.
119	Th-th... Th-th-tha...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
120	But I was still so terribly, terribly hungry.
121	Huh? What is it now? Spit it out!
122	Th-tha...nk you...for the meal.
123	You haven't even eaten anything yet, squirt.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
124	Your gloomy smile was radiant to me.
125	Come on.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0006
126	You held out your hand.
127	You wanna eat, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
128	...
129	You held out your hand. And I seized it with both of mine.
130	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
131	I didn't let go then, and I won't let go now.
