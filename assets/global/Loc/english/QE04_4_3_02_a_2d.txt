001	Glad to see you're safe and sound! Hm? What's the matter? Were you unable to destroy the core?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0024
002	The dragon's ceased its fire and water attacks, and it's slower as well. They must have prevailed...right?	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
003	...
004	Speak up! We're not going to understand unless you say something!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
005	Hic... Hic...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
006	Where is Tehre?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
007	...
008	Tehre has perished?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0021
009	The fool! He's the one that brought on this whole dang situation! Now he's gone and left us the mess to clean up!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
010	We do not have time to wallow in grief. Tehre has shown us how to destroy the cores.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
011	We need to steel ourselves.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0018
012	No way... Voda!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
013	The dragon's started moving again...and this time...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
014	Its flames are stronger than before! What the heck is going on?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
015	The forest! The village, too! They're all aflame! Dang it!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
016	Lisbeth, look at me. Come. Join me.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
017	Understood! Icicle...Edge!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
018	Hyaaaaaahhhh!!!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0032
019	Huff... Huff... What power!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
020	Ngh! It's clearly heading toward us! We must withdraw for now!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0042
021	Blast it... Destroying one of its cores has only made it stronger!	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
022	It's just getting started. Look, the back's glowing red...which means it's about to use fire again.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
023	Are you certain?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
024	Aye, but even so, we can't just give up.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0042
025	Let me deal with it next, before Saga is burned to a crisp!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
