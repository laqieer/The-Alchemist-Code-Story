001	Okay then, Amane. About your trial.
002	You passed.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
003	Oh...? Whooooooooa?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
004	Welcome to the Blade Fox Corps, the demon slayers!
005	Seriously?! But why?!
006	I passed, didn't I?! Why have I been thrown in the brigs?!
007	Yep. It's because you passed that you're in here. Keep it down, though. You're disturbing the other residents.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
008	What is going on?! D-did you... Did you bait me with promises of passing the trial just to do unspeakable things to me here?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
009	Uh, no.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
010	Tch! Don't think for a second that you can break me with torture! What do you even plan to accomplish through this?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
011	Can you please let me finish? You broke a Corps regulation. So now that you're officially accountable as a member, here you are.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0012
012	A-am I supposed to be proud right now?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
013	To be honest, I have no idea. I'm sure a life without joining the Corps could have been a happier one.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
014	But there is something about you. I do want to see if you really are the one who will bring peace to Wadatsumi.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
015	You'll be assigned with me in the Third Squad. I'm sure working with you will be a delight, Amane.
016	With you?!
017	I'm sure you have a lot to think about, so spend your time in the cell wisely. Later.
018	Where are you going?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
019	There's a debriefing after every mission. Then, usually a party to show respect for those who were involved.
020	A party?! Is Celis going to be cooking?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
021	Yeah, and I am gonna partake to my heart's content. You, on the other hand, get to stay here and think over what you've done.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
022	Wh-what?!	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
023	Don't worry, I can bring you some scraps later.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
024	Wait! No! This is cruel! How dare you enjoy a party after leaving me in here!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
025	I'm going to hold a grudge over this!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
026	You the only one here, Celis?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
027	I am. I heard Amane made it through the trial.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
028	Her naivete is pretty cute.
029	I think so too. I just hope that doesn't get in her way on the battlefield.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
030	I'll be watching over her.
031	Oh, really? That's not like you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
032	Is it not?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
033	You seem quite infatuated with her.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
034	Oh please. She's not my type.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
035	I thought I said we didn't need any new recruits?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
036	I won't let any trouble make it to the Second Squad.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
037	Having weaklings dilute the Corps is trouble enough.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
038	Ooh, so scary. Guess I'm no good for the Corps either, huh?
039	You...! Must you always be so—	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
040	Ugachi!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0012
041	Just to make things clear... I hate you.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
042	Well, that's not nice. I like you a lot, Ugachi.
043	Why won't you just show your true nature already? Those like you who do not fight wholeheartedly have no right to stand among the Blade Fox.
044	Oh, you think too highly of me. When am I not doing my best?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
045	I will force you to fight with all your might if I must.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
046	You shouldn't. There will be blood, you know.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
047	...What?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0016
048	Mine, probably.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
049	Dammit, Tanosuke!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
050	Whoa!
051	Enough! Stop fighting!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0013
052	If you're losing your cool, I don't mind making sure you two find it.
053	Tch...
054	Why did I have to get hit too?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
055	In a quarrel, both parties are to blame.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
056	Aw, really?
057	We do have our debriefing to get to. Can we please get on with it?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
058	...
059	All right then. I'll need a damage report. How many casualties per squad?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
060	None for my squad. Oh! Except for one potential recruit.
061	I see. That's regrettable.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0021
173	It couldn't be helped. Fear got the best of them, and they turned their back on a demon.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
062	Understood. And the Second Squad?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0022
063	Only a few light injures. About that. There's something I want to ask you, Celis.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
064	Yes?
065	The injured all reported the same thing; that it was Commander Celis that did them in.
066	What?!
067	...
068	Have you anything to say about this, Celis?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
069	No, I don't. Do you really think I would do such a thing?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
070	There's even precedent for plotting the murder of comrades, thanks to Jubei.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
071	Jubei was once your right-hand man. I wouldn't be surprised if you really were planning something behind our backs.
072	Ugachi! You can't be serious!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0018
073	Conflict or killing within the Corps, regardless of reason, is strictly prohibited.
074	...
075	Being found guilty of breaking such a regulation is reason enough to be purged, and you are not exempt from that, Celis.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
076	Ugachi, you can't honestly be suspicious of Commander Celis.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
077	It's fine, Tanosuke. I didn't do it.
078	Are there any that can corroborate that statement? We must be sure to investigate all suspects to do our due diligence.
079	...No.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
080	All in the Corps are unsettled. They are jumping at their own shadows. Something must be done.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
081	What if someone is trying to sow uncertainty among our ranks on purpose?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
082	What?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
174	We've received reports of Hidden Ogre sightings from the castle town. You know what this means, don't you?
083	A Hidden Ogre, one of the pure bloods... If this is true, we have ourselves a problem.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
084	You aren't simply trying to divert the blame and evade liability for Jubei and yourself, are you?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
085	Not at all. I genuinely believe a demon is enacting a nefarious plan to sabotage our operations.
086	Besides, Jubei has nothing to do with this. Why do you keep bringing him up? Concerned for your fellow student?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
087	That is irrelevant.
175	If the Hidden Ogre is in the castle town now, quarreling among ourselves is exactly what the demons want.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
088	If you can find evidence of my treason, then I will gladly turn myself in.
089	Hmph.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
176	I'm glad you understand the situation now.
177	I suppose that if you were the traitor, those injured wouldn't be alive now and there would be no evidence of any kind.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
178	I'll trust you for now. But know that I will have your head if you show any sign of betrayal.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
179	That's only fair.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
090	Anyway, can't we get some reinforcements from Greed Dike?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
091	Right now we're just eliminating demons as they pop up. At this rate, we'll just be aimlessly exhausting our troops. We need a decisive strike at the root of the issue.
092	The continent's in a rather precarious state, so they don't seem to be able to send any.
093	I've heard the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia was purged. Could that have something to do with the current state of affairs?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
094	...
095	It was only briefly mentioned during the scheduled meeting, so I didn't get to find out many details about that.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
096	Celis...
097	The demons have consistently targeted us here at the Castle Aquila Rubrum, where we keep our base of operations. We have no idea why, though.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
098	If there is some logic behind the actions of these demons, we should be able to read their next move. Unfortunately...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
099	We have no idea what it is they want.
100	Not a clue, huh...
101	You mean that?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
102	Absolutely.
106	...
180	We'll leave it at that for now. Let me know as soon as you verify the validity of those Hidden Ogre sightings.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
107	Quite the temper, huh?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0027
108	It just shows how much he earnestly cares for Wadatsumi. I find it to be reassuring.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
109	And what shall we do about the Hidden Ogre?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
110	Let's wait on what the scouts have to report. Though we still don't have the truth of what happened, we can at least comfort and reward the troops!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
111	...
112	Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.celis_story0601_1011
113	Everyone, repeat!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.celis_story0601_2011
114	Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!
115	Meals and blades are made to what?!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.celis_story0601_0012
116	To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!
117	To bring about blissful days of joy!
118	Now, all together...
119	...
120	We give thanks for this meal!
121	We give thanks for this meal!
122	All right! Today I made meatballs! Enjoy!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
123	Oh no... Celis...
124	Are you okay?
125	Never again will I enjoy another meatball... These are the best meatballs I've ever had and ever will have!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
126	You said something like that last time.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
127	That's because you keep outdoing yourself!
128	Aw, that's so sweet of you to say! Here, you get an extra one!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0008
129	Huzzzaaaaahhh!!!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0023
130	Where is Ugachi, by the way?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
131	Mmmff-hhmmnn.
132	Please don't eat with your mouth full. You don't have to rush. Your food won't run away.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
133	Mn... Gulp. Is it really necessary to hold a banquet like this every time we finish a mission?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
134	Not to mention that little call-and-reply routine...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
135	We never know when we might lose our lives on a mission. So it's important to eat, laugh, and enjoy life as best as we can, when we can!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
136	We really don't know how long any of us have left in this world.
137	...
138	What is it?
139	It's the Second Squad.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
140	Oh...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0021
181	Don't worry about them. I've shared your information about the Hidden Ogre sightings with them, just in case. However, some are still finding it difficult to trust you.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
182	Thank you...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
141	Oh no! The pot's already empty! I'll be right back with more!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
142	Hmph. She's an odd one.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
143	She's just got a lot on her plate.
144	Hmph.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
145	We all do, actually.
146	Well, that's how she makes herself seem so suspicious.
147	Do you honestly doubt her?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
148	No, but... She is keeping something from us.
149	I'm back! Hm? Hey, where's Azami, by the way?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0023
150	She piled a load of meatballs on her plate and left. More importantly, give me some seconds already.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
151	Huh, I see. And fine, fine! Here you are!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
152	Weren't you just accusing her of treason?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
153	That and this meal are two separate issues.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
154	I'm not entirely sure when it started.
155	Echoes of memories, not of my own, started to flow through me.
156	They were always imbued with the strong urge to eliminate demons, with a strong hate towards them.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
157	I saw hate.
158	Whomever these memories belonged to must have had someone important taken from them...much like Azami had.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
159	Then, in revenge, they take another important someone from somebody else.
160	I wonder if such a tragic cycle of events is still ongoing.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
161	Demons must be eradicated.
162	Still...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
163	"I still believe."
164	"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"
165	That warm voice... As though he loves and pities all...
166	Something I can't understand is happening within me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
167	There's no point dwelling on this, but...I just don't know what to do.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
168	If you can't even handle a demon like this one, you don't belong here. It's too late to regret anything once you're dead.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0030
169	You must live.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
170	...!!! That's right! I don't have time to be wallowing in deep thought!
171	I'm a member of the Blade Fox now. If there is anyone trapped in such a tragic cycle, then I will be the blade that cuts it down!
172	I must train, every day!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
