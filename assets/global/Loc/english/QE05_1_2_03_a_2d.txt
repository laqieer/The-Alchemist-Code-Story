001	I had no idea there was a hollow space like this within Sephiron.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
002	The arboreal altar is where the druidic priestess offers prayers to channel prophecies from Sephiron.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
003	Can we...go in?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
004	This space has always been open to us villagers. It's often used as a place to discuss important matters.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
005	However, are you certain this is where you heard the voice from?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
006	...
007	Kamui? Hisham? What are the two of you doing here at this time?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0025
008	Miss Malta?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
009	Oh, did I not tell you? I am the druidic priestess of this village. I have the honor of being the altar's caretaker.
010	No way, you didn't say anything about that!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
011	Malta, it is unusual for you to be here at this time as well. The hour for prayers is long over. Have you had some kind of prophecy?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
012	Yes, I was drawn here because I had an ominous sense that something was happening. Sephiron seems to be...crying out.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
013	You felt it as well? What could this mean?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
014	As well...?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
015	Yes. Hisham said he heard a voice coming from Sephiron, calling him here.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
016	I've never heard of such a thing, but the altar does seem to be emitting a strange aura tonight.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
017	Wh-What the—?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
018	Hisham?! What is it?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
019	What is this...voice...in my head?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
020	Father...? Mother?! No... Why is the village on fire?! I-I...!
021	What is this darkness?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
022	Sephiron's powers of purification are reacting to the darkness?!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0025
023	Kamui! You must remove Hisham from the darkness!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
024	The village... My home?! Th-that... That can't be!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
025	The Jam?! How could the Jam get inside Sephiron?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
026	I'll figure that out later—I must prioritize rescuing Hisham!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
027	Nngh... Disperse!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
028	Was that the last of it?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
029	Not yet! The darkness has yet to release Hisham!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
030	No, I won't make it!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
031	What...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
032	This is...?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0025
033	S-someone, please save—!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
034	Leave no survivors! Loot their homes and then set them on fire!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
035	Spare none associated with the rebel forces, even the women and children! Kill all who have laid witness, as mercy will only make more trouble for us later!
036	Are these...Hisham's memories? Was his village razed by the soldiers from Gluttony?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
037	Survivors! Let none escape alive!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
038	Urk...! The heat of the flames, the stench of blood...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
039	This is likely all just an illusion, but it feels so real. If I'm injured here, what will happen to my physical body?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
040	I have no idea what is happening here, but...I know I cannot afford to die in this place.
