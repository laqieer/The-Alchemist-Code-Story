001	Haa... It's over. Are you hurt, Luce?	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0030
002	Not at all.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0010
003	Luce... I know you must've heard about the gang of thieves who have been causing mayhem 'round here, even before I told you about them.	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0012
004	It's incredibly dangerous for someone in your position to go walking alone outside the castle. You really need to stop—
005	Huh? How did you...? Where did that rabbit come from?	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0025
006	A wild hare was hopping by, so I caught it. You have to be quick with these things.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
007	You must have frightened it off when you were fighting those monsters, because it came right up to me.
008	Perfect timing, wouldn't you say?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0007
009	Well, not so much for the rabbit.	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0029
010	Anyway, as I was saying... You can't keep going off on your own like that. Okay?
011	I will do my best to appease you.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
012	A-appease me...? Look, just let me come with you when you leave the castle grounds from now on. Pretty please?	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0025
013	All right, all right. I understand.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_event_1014
014	Come, then. I'm going to go and purchase the rest of what I need to make this dish. I expect you'll be wanting to accompany me.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0002
015	I'll need salt and spiced herbs for roasting... Perhaps some wine for the marinade? The chef was saying that beer makes a good sauce, as well.
016	All that matters is that I make sure Leoniaz enjoys this dish.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0007
017	Hey, Luce?
018	What is it?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0006
019	You can lay down your sword anytime, you know. There are countless people in this country who would gladly pick it up in your stead.	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0016
020	Don't you think that your bridal training would go more smoothly if you dedicated the time you spend on swordplay to other things?
021	Why are you so insistent that I relegate my sword to a display case? Why should I not pursue both sets of skills?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0030
022	Well, because I—
023	What's this?! A gang of thieves has invaded the city?!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0025
024	What?!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_battle_0020
025	Luce, get back to the castle!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0012
026	No. I will go with you.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_chara_1003
027	How many times have we been through this?! You can't!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0015
028	I believe I have also made myself clear on this matter. I will not lay down my sword!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0012
029	Please, Luce. Do you know how important you are to this country? If something were to happen to you, it would break the hearts of countless citizens...	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0020
030	Including mine.
031	Don't you see? That is all the more reason for me to fight.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
032	I am the queen of Envylia. It is only natural that I should be the one to protect it.
033	Luce, you...!
034	You don't need to fight! You have others to fight for you... You have me!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0021
035	Thieves, open your ears and heed my words! I, Queen Lucretia of Envylia, will henceforth personally punish you for your crimes against my people!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_battle_0010
036	Sh-she ignored me!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0026
