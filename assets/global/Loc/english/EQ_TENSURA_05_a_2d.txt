001	Milim!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
002	Hey, Rimuru! Did you explore a little? This Babel place is pretty fascinating. It has all kinds of things I've never seen before!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0003
003	Oh, of course I brought you souvenirs, too! Here you go!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0007
004	Oh, uhm. Thanks.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
005	Souvenirs?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0003
006	Just let it go...
007	Heheh. Nice to meet you! I'm the one and only Dragonoid known as the Destroyer!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0010
008	The Demon Lord Milim Nava!
009	Demon Lord?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
010	I've already had a lot of fun in this world, so I figured it was about time I join you!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0006
011	I can't believe you found us such a good place to mess around in! Just what I'd expect from my bestie!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0008
012	I didn't exactly go looking for one...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
013	I've basically just been snarfing down a bunch of food since I got here, so I was starting to crave some action! Let's get this show on the road!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0004
014	The energy in this world feels all weird. Not sure how that'll transfer to a battle, hmm...
015	It might be a lil' hard for me to hold back...but, eh, I'm sure it'll be fine!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0031
016	(That's not going to be fine at all!)	VO_riml.riml_sys_0012
017	(This is bad news... If Milim goes all-out, she's going to wipe this whole country off the map!)
058	Uhm, hey, Milim!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0002
018	I'm sorry, but I wanted to ask you to sit this one out. The fight with the Orc Disaster, I mean...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
019	Whaaaat?!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0011
020	Why?! Rude! That's so boring!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0016
021	Why are you the only one who gets to have fun?!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0012
022	U-uhm...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0029
023	Oh, right! I remember now! I ate this super delicious thing earlier!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
024	Huh?	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0025
025	I've never had something so good in my entire life! I bet you can't get it anywhere else...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0007
026	Wh-what? Really?	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0003
027	You ate something that good without me?! What is it? Come on!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0022
028	Oh man, it was soooo good! I think there's only one left, though...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
029	Not fair! Not fair! You meanie! You sly slime! I wanted to eat one, too!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0012
030	Hm? Oh man, what am I going to do now... I only just have this measly single one left... What to do, what to do...	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
031	Nnnnhhhhhhhh!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0016
032	F-fine! I'll listen to you this once! That'll be enough, right? Right? Right?!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0031
033	(Phew. That worked.)
034	Your Milim-handling skills are improving every day.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0008
035	That's because you guys keep putting that responsibility on me!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0012
036	Were you talking about the deep-fried water lizard? That was pretty good.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
037	Really? I thought it was a little hard to look at... Wait! This isn't the time for that.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
038	Oops, you're right.
039	Hunger...
040	...Rimuru already saved roughly 150,000 of these orcs once.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0030
041	He gave them a warm world and future. One where nobody has to has to starve...
042	And now all of these guys have to die without ever realizing there was a much better world waiting for them out there...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0028
043	Benimaru...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
044	...
045	Not really in the mood to fight them, huh, Benimaru?
046	Different timeline or not, these guys could have eventually become our comrades. It doesn't feel right to cut them down.
047	...Yeah. I know.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
048	But I won't hold back in a fight, nor will I forgive any orc that lays a hand on you. That's what I told Geld back then, and I'll stand by that.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0004
049	A Samurai General that can't even back up his words is a lousy excuse for a Samurai General.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0010
050	...I want to eat.	VO_orcdisaster.orcdisaster_battle_0001
051	Devour... Feed...
052	(Great Sage... How's it looking? Is it possible?)
053	Answer: Theoretically, consuming the Orc Disaster would make it possible.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0015
054	(Good enough.)	VO_riml.riml_sys_0032
055	I promised Demon Lord Geld that I'd devour all the orc's sins for them, so...let me do the same for you.
056	Let's finish this.
057	Graaaaaarrrgghhhhh!	VO_orcdisaster.orcdisaster_battle_0003
