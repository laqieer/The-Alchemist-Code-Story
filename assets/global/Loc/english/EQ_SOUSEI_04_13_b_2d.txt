001	Argh?!
002	I've got you, Zafeiris!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
003	Gah! This power... I see. You have also obtained the dragon!
004	This ends here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
005	Not too fast! "Shapeless shadows, thus become boundless!"
006	The same technique as Julia...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
007	Nimul, watch your back!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
008	I know!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
009	He's not here? Then where did he...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
010	I have come to understand that disciplining you will require a heavier hand than most.
011	Fine. Then I shall bring to bear the full extent of the power that I possess to do so.
012	That's... No! You have the power of both Asmodeus and Belphegor?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
013	Yes. And also...
014	What?! Zafeiris's body is being swallowed by Beelzebub's core?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
015	Now I will show you the true power of the pillar of the Cursed Beasts!
016	No! Nimul, we have to stop it!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0015
017	I know, but—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
018	"Those without form, come forth from the sea of the void!"
019	Ugh...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
020	No, he won't make it!
021	"I am shapeless, I am shadow."
022	"I am both sin and sinner."
023	This transformation of magil...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
024	"I proclaim!"
025	"I am the beast adorned with the crown of sin!"	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0019
026	He merged with the Cursed Beast?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
027	Now the destruction can begin. A new beginning with wholly new blessings...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0001
