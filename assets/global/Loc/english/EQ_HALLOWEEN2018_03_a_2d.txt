001	Numuu...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
002	Phew, this should keep it asleep for a while.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0022
003	So it really was all riled up by the candy... You've outdone yourself again this year, Neica.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0045
004	I'm not happy about it.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
005	Neica... You're so brilliant. How brightly your handmade candies sparkle!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0044
006	Sparkle? Do they?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0020
007	Of course they do! The Ratty wouldn't have been all over them if they didn't.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0004
008	Fujika said that last Halloween was bright and fun.
009	She said the whole city sparkled. I don't want to lose! I will definitely make this town sparkle even more than it did back then!
010	On that note, Mei Fang! Melda! You surely have other options for stunning candy and costumes with you, don't you?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
011	Demanding, aren't you? Fine. Feast your eyes on this.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
012	Ummmm... What are these?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
013	Sweet bean pancakes, sweet bean jelly, bracken-starch dumplings...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0045
014	Well? Moved to tears, are you not? These sweet treats are all masterpieces!	VO_meifan.meifan_battle_0010
015	When she went to Wadatsumi, Vivi hand-picked these for me. They are perfectly sweet and delicious. She has such exquisite taste.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
016	That's not the poi-...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0029
017	Well, they are really delicious. I'll give you that. I do like treats from Wadatsumi...
018	However! They have a fatal flaw! They are boring! They don't sparkle at all.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0022
019	Melda! How about the other costumes you prepared?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0019
020	Oh, uh, costumes... Right. Truthfully, um...	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
021	All of the costumes are made for my babies... Like the Ratty you just saw.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0031
022	They suit my babies so wonderfully, and certainly make them very happy, but, as human proportions go...
023	So, basically, all of the costumes you prepared are for animals.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
024	You... Well...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0022
025	I'm sorry.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0036
026	H-Hozuki! It's okay! Everything will work out! Leave the treats to me!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
027	But then it will be the same as last year. It's all pointless if it's the same.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0042
028	I don't want to lose. The real deal should be sparkly and so bright that it doesn't lose to anything or anyone.
029	I can't lose! Somehow, we'll just have to make the things that we have now sparkle!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0022
030	You want it that badly? To make everything sparkle?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0044
031	Yes. No matter what.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
032	I do not really understand it, but I suppose I have no choice except to get on board, in order to make this a most wonderful experience for everyone.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
033	I'm sorry that my misunderstanding made even more work for everyone. Please, let me help too.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0022
034	Thank you, you two!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0034
035	First, we need to somehow make sure these sweets sparkle properly.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0031
036	Ahhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
037	Wh-what was that? Screaming?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
038	It came from over there! Look!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0019
039	Numa, numu, numaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_a
040	The Ratty! He's back on his feet again already?!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
041	O-ow...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
042	What happened?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
043	What do you mean, what happened?! That stupid mouse came charging through here and ran into me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
044	Oh dear. It's all excited again.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
045	Uh oh. Things are getting dangerous. We need to catch it, or else...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0021
046	Hey, wait a second! Are you that mouse's owner?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
047	So what if I am?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
048	Ah! Ow, ow, ow! They're broken! They're definitely broken! All of the big bones in my body are broken!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
049	You better pay for the medical expenses! It's going to be sooooo expensive. Right, everyone?
050	An eye for an eye, or money to pay for damages! You pick!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
051	Wh-what? We'll apologize for the trouble, but can you stop with this dull trick-or-treat now?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0027
