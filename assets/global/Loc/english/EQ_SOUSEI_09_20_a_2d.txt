001	We finally did it.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
002	We made it through this time.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
003	We really did.
004	Hey, Adaleigh! Fix those clothes! You're looking sloppy!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
005	You've come so far already, you know. What lies ahead of you should be no big deal at this point.
006	But I won't be there to pull you out of trouble! You know that, right?
007	Icona? You're leaving?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
008	Well, I've got one last thing to take care of first.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
009	Oh, right. You should hurry to their side.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
010	Please, do anything you can to save Nimul and Emmel!
011	And I am ever indebted to you for your support, Lord Kubera.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0033
012	But of course! Being called to aid in such a situation was an offer I simply could not refuse.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
013	And being able to test my strength and have this place to hone my skills further, even in death? I could not be happier!
014	That sounds like the Lord Kubera I know, for sure!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
015	There's not much need for change when one is dead. Yet even now, I relish the day that Nimul bested me and took my life. I never felt more alive than I did when I was dying!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
016	That is why I answer his call as well. I am certain there is even more I can learn from him about this power.
017	We part ways again here, then.
018	It's hard to believe that I'll be continuing to fight even after my passing. Haha! What a tremendous turn!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
019	I can indulge to my heart's content here!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0008
020	And seeing your skill on the battlefield was a rare treat, as well. But, do not fret! We shall handle matters from here.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
021	So that was Alchemy. What incredible power...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
022	It really was amazing.
023	Hey, Yna? Can you stand?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
024	I'm afraid not. I've used every last bit of energy I had. You?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
025	Absolutely not.
026	Looks like we'll just have to leave the rest to Nimul and his phantom army, then.
027	So it would seem.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
028	What's this? There are magil abnormalities all over the region!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0022
029	This light... Is that what I think it is, Nimul?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0045
030	Yes. This is my own "Dragon Realm."	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
031	It is a sacred art which allows me to share all of the experiences and all of the knowledge I've gained with everyone.
032	It's the quintessence of Alchemy—the great treaty known as the Magna Code.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
033	This is the world we've been trying to create all along.
034	Don't make me laugh. This pallid imitation of the Dragon Realm cannot withstand the crushing force of my will. It is only a matter of time before—	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0012
035	...! You can also summon those who have died?!
036	Of course, they are but phantoms of humans, weak from the start! There is no way they could ever hope to—
037	"Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
038	What—?!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0025
039	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
040	"Death at Dawn; Wahrheit!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
041	Those are your companions' techniques!
042	I am an Alchemist.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
043	And Alchemy is naught but the power that spawns from one's resolve to change this world. It is accessible to anyone with the will to use it.
044	As such, it only stands to reason that I should be able to wield every technique that's heretofore borne the banner of Alchemy.
045	Using the Dragon Realm to alter the Truth of the world... Even with the tower for aid, the human body should not be able to tolerate such stress.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
046	Yet you've come to wield your companions' techniques...and further claim that all of Alchemy is at your disposal?!
047	This strongly contradicts all previously accepted concepts of human power limitation!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
048	You've thus far only possessed the wisdom to become vessels.
049	What awaits you now is either your human souls being weathered down to nothing...
050	Or a complete inability for the people to handle such immense power, leading to the absolute destruction of the world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
051	As long as humanity exists, I am confident we will learn to wield this power for good and righteous ends.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
052	We—humans—must choose how to live on our own. I've always believed that to be the only proper path for us.
053	We do not need your guidance, Ouroboros. We will create our own tomorrow with our own free will.
054	An amusing prospect. Show me your resolve, then!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0046
055	Show me that you truly have the power to take the future into your own hands. Prove yourselves!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
056	Gladly!
