001	Ngh...
002	Where am I?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
003	Oh, you're awake.
004	Y-you're—!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
005	You shouldn't be moving around so much after being baptized by Lucifer.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
006	Bap...tized...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
007	Lucifer is different from the other regions' Cursed Beasts.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
008	It's an arbiter of those who should live and those who shouldn't.
009	And you, it deemed as one who should.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
010	It...did?
011	Why don't you join us?
012	What?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
013	You could work to help save the world...as part of the Infinite Serpent.
014	I refuse. I could never! I absolutely, positively disapprove of your organization's Ceremony of Creation. And nothing will change my mind about that.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0040
015	But you lost to Lucifer.
016	I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
017	After all your big talk, you lost. That's pretty definitive. It's honestly incredible to me that you still intend to stand against us.
018	Of... Of course I do! Why wouldn't I? How couldn't I?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
019	Who are you doing all of this for? That brother of yours?
020	That's right. I only live...for his sake.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
021	Would you change your mind if I promised we'd spare your brother should you join the Infinite Serpent?
022	That would be a meaningless gesture. My brother is the one who first proposed that it may be possible to save everyone and everything in the first place.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
023	I see.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
024	Then how about I help you?
025	...Pardon?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
026	I'll lend you my aid. I can help you achieve this fool's errand of yours to save the world.
027	But...why?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
028	It's only natural to want to save those who can be saved, right?
029	Um... Thank you, I guess?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
030	You're a good kid. You know how to say thank you to others, unlike that bratty brother of mine. He's got a cynical quip for everything these days—after he thinks about it for a minute, anyway!
031	You have...siblings?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
032	Just my one good-for-nothing little brother. Were you scared of him when you fought him?
033	That was your little brother?! But...he looked older than you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
034	...
035	I'm the older one! Me!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0039
036	Er... I'm sorry...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
037	Why does everyone think he's older than me?! Are you all blind to my womanly charms?! I've spent ever so long carefully cultivating and nurturing them! It's not fair!
038	Oh, I'm sorry! It was an honest mistake. Please, calm down.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
039	Stupid Ignacio, with his stern-looking face and cool demeanor!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
040	I'll have you know that I'm nearly a hundred years older than him!
041	Y-you are?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
042	I am!
043	I couldn't tell at all...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
044	Harrumph!
045	Oh, no, I don't mean it like that! I just mean because Ignacio has the...uhh...face of an old man?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0011
046	Exactly. Well said. It's about Ignacio, not me. You're...not suggesting I have a baby face at all, right? Are you? Are you?!
047	Of course not! No!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
048	Good.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
049	...
050	Hehe!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
051	What are you giggling about all of a sudden?
052	I was actually really nervous when I heard we were coming to the Infinite Serpent's stronghold.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
053	But even here, of all places, I can find people willing to lend me a hand, and chat casually with me about their family.
054	It just all seems so absurd to think about, I couldn't help but laugh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
055	I see...
056	Well, worry not, human child. Our duty as high elves is to guide those who are lost yet determined to find their way.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
057	As long as the light of your desire to save others does not fade, I will ever remain your ally.
058	Thank you so much!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
059	Now, it's time to let your actions speak as loudly as your words. Your wounds are all healed, yes?
060	Huh? Oh, they are!
061	Naturally. I'm quite specialized in magic. We are trained to be beyond proficient with it, being high elves and all. In any case, let's get out of here, shall we?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0007
062	Okay!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
063	Good day, Lady Helene.
064	And welcome, esteemed guest.
065	We accept all here, so please rest well and cast away the worries of war.
066	Why doesn't anyone disdain me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
067	Father has already announced you would be treated as a guest. The others don't dare question his judgment.
068	Oh... I'd almost forgotten that you're Shahel's daughter.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
069	The ears are a bit of a dead giveaway. We high elves were created by the dragons, and serve as the Gardeners who oversee this world.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
070	It's you humans who decided to start calling us "high elves."
071	Gardeners...?
072	It's a more apt term than you might think. Artificially cultured gardens require caretakers to tend to their upkeep, after all. And this world is exactly that: an artificially cultured garden—a fake.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
073	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
074	Don't go misconstruing things. I'm not saying you or anyone else who lives here is fake. Just the world itself, as it stands, is a carefully controlled construct.
075	Anyway, we're here! This is the place I wanted to show you.
076	What is it, exactly?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
077	Right now, it's just an empty room. Not a soul in sight.
078	My father, Shahel, is Superbia Belt's leader.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
079	Then, there's the corrupted dragon—or as I like to call him, the dragon corpse—Zafeiris. And then the Space-Time Manipulator, Quence.
080	And from Acedia Belt, there's Icona, who's a total genius. And finally—
081	I recognize the writing on that one. That's Yna's, isn't it?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
082	That's right! This is where those five gather to discuss the potentiality of this world.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
083	It's the heart of the Infinite Serpent. They call this room the "Serpent's Nest."
084	The Serpent's Nest...
085	Why did you bring me here?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
086	Well, you want to defeat Lucifer, don't you?
087	Yes, but there's no way I can do it with my strength alone...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
088	Of course not. Lucifer is an echo of the great dragon who serves as the physical manifestation of the Seven Miracles.
089	It's not a foe a mere human could ever hope to take on.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
090	That's why my father came up with a plan. If he can't kill Lucifer himself, he'd just have to create a weapon that could.
091	He made a Gear of Judgment?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
092	Quence came up with the concept, Icona designed it, Zafeiris collected all the materials, and Yna put it together.
093	And this gun is the prototype their combined efforts produced. It's called Zavijava.
094	A gun? Um, do you happen to know how to use it?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
095	It's a human weapon. A proper high elf such as myself would never bother with such things!
096	Then it's of little use to me, I'm afraid.
097	Wait, so you don't know how to use it, either?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0025
098	I've neither trained with nor even held such weapons as this before. But, hang on... Didn't Ignacio have something that looked like this?
099	Do you think we could ask him to—?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
100	Absolutely not. He'd report us to Father in an instant.
101	Did you forget you're in enemy territory? You'd be a fool to think anyone here would help you.
102	But, you're helping me...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
103	Well, that's only because...uhhh...
104	Because... Because I won't accept things as they stand!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
105	...
106	(There's that word again. "Accept.")
107	Though I do so wish the humans would simply accept the fact that everything must be sacrificed, and move on already...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
108	Do you mean to say you don't accept what Shahel said about the necessity of sacrifices?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
109	That's one way to put it.
110	Whenever I question it, everyone just tells me I don't understand because I'm still just a child.
111	But I really don't understand, and I'm not a child! Who even decided this sacrifice was necessary in the first place, anyway?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
112	I really want to know the answer. I just want something where I can hear it and say, yeah, that's the right thing to do. That's the way forward.
113	And I feel like if I help you, I'll be able to find that answer. You'll help me see it.
114	I don't think it's going to be quite that easy, though.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0039
115	Why not? You do believe that there's a right way forward, don't you?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
116	Does everything not all flow from the same source?
117	If so, then there must exist an irrefutable Truth no one can deny.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
118	And if there does, I have to find it. I can't bring myself to commit to anything until I do—until I know it's the right thing.
119	And that, Lady Helene, is why everyone still regards you as a child.
120	...! When did you come in?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
121	My apologies. I found it curious that I could hear voices coming from this room, even though it was not supposed to be in use at this time.
122	Do you...intend to report this to Father?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
123	Certainly not. Lord Shahel promised you freedom to do as you wish, and I shan't defy his orders. As you are not in the wrong, I have no reason to report you.
124	So you disagree with me fundamentally, but won't say anything because you were told not to? Do any of you ever think for yourselves?! Honestly!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
125	Our truth is in our leader. It is our will to follow him.
126	We believe Lord Shahel's judgments to be sound.
127	Therefore, we see no need to waver or doubt. As long as we continue to follow Lord Shahel, all roads will eventually converge upon the right path.
128	Would you take your own life, then, should Shahel instruct you to do so?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
129	If that be milord's will.
130	...
131	All that said, it would be troublesome if you caused too large a disturbance, so I'd ask that you please keep your gamboling to a minimum. If you'll excuse me, then...
132	Who was that man?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
133	He's the Serpent Priest.
134	He's the one who's actually in charge of this region's affairs.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
135	Father has no interest in politics or government, you see. So while Father has the final say, the Serpent Priest is the one who actually gets things done.
136	Hmm...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
137	Does something about him trouble you?
138	Not exactly. It's just that his way of thinking...his blind faith...seems a bit radical for a leader, don't you think?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
139	Everyone here is like that.
140	Once they start believing something, they devote themselves to it wholeheartedly.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
141	Nobody asks questions. Nobody raises concerns. If someone they believe in says something is so, then it's so.
142	Father respects that Pride of theirs, and holds it as a virtue worthy of admiration, but I don't agree. Blind faith just doesn't seem like the right path, to me.
143	I wouldn't even call it Pride, myself. Almost by definition, you can't truly be proud of your accomplishments if you're just following orders.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
144	In a way, though, you're just like them.
145	What? Really? Do I come across that way to you?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
146	You're willing to literally lay down your life to fulfill an uncertain goal. How is that any different?
147	Oh, well... I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
148	Anyway, we need to figure out how to use that gun. Let's see what we can learn.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
149	(Appreciative though I am, I really don't understand why Helene is willing to help me.)
150	(It doesn't even seem like she's looking at me when we talk. It's as if she's lost in her own head, searching for something else entirely...)
151	What's wrong, Emmel?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
152	Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that it really might be best to try asking Ignacio for help.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
153	...Yeah. It just might.
154	...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0020
155	Haven't you sulked long enough? You fought me, and you lost. You might as well just accept it.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0003
156	Shut up. I'm trying to formulate a counter-strike.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
157	If the Cursed Beast of Pride is here, that must mean he's using my magic technique, which also means there must be a control center somewhere...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
158	But even if we could do something about that, that still leaves the Cursed Beast itself. And since there's no Libra here, the only ace we've got up our sleeve is Emmel. But Emmel—	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0004
159	You never change, do you?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
160	Not that it matters. I'm going to restrain you. And I'll be confiscating that Space-Time Manipulation sphere of yours, too.
161	What's this, all of a sudden? Shahel doesn't consider me an enemy, you know. He wouldn't approve of this treatment.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0047
162	Well... I'm not acting on his behalf. I've personally determined that you're far too dangerous to be left to your own devices.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
163	Interesting. That's a peculiar thing to hear from you.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0013
164	Is it, now?
165	It is. Every single person in this Belt Region, regardless of age or gender, is an adherent to the oh-so-great Shahel.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
166	And every last one of them mindlessly believes in the salvation he's promised, even if it leads to their own martyrdom. His every whim is entertained without a second thought.
167	Yet here you are, acting in defiance of the mighty Shahel's judgment. What a rebel you are!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
168	...
169	You know, I've always found it peculiar that you were treated as Shahel's son when you're not even of high elf blood.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
170	Why does he trust you so much? Why does he hold you in such high regard?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
171	Well... H-he doesn't. He loves everyone here in equal measure.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0010
172	If he should show me slightly more favor, it is purely happenstance. A mere flight of fancy on his part, perhaps.
173	The Serpent Priest... That's what that man was called, right?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0020
174	What about him?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
175	He had a son, if I'm not mistaken—a boy whose birth was foretold by the priestess of Ouroboros, upon whom a destined name was bestowed.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
176	If I remember correctly, that name was Nimu—
177	Shut your mouth, you senile old fool!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
178	Hah. Finally revealing your true colors, I see. Definitely a marked improvement!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
179	I get it, though. I do. It's hard living up to expectations—especially ones that were placed on you from the moment you were born.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0023
180	I can't even imagine how disappointed your parents were when they realized you just weren't the man they'd been promised.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0007
181	What are you trying to accomplish by angering me?!
182	I'm just asking: don't you want to finally meet his expectations?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
183	What...?
184	"He Who Saved the Seven Regions and Brought Balance to the World"...
185	It's not too late to fulfill that role, you know.
186	I...question the sanity of those who still believe in the so-called prophecies of some random fortuneteller from hundreds of years ago.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0010
187	Hmph. So you do.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0021
188	(He isn't aware of Bianca? Isn't she supposed to be somewhere in this Belt Region, though?)	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
189	Have it your way, then.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0017
190	You would do well to consider your prospects, though. After all, the opportunity to change your destiny is sitting right in front of your face.
191	H-hey! I'm talking to you! Where do you think you're going?! You'll regret leaving me here like this, you joyless oaf!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0026
192	An opportunity to change my destiny?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
193	Pure hogwash!
194	Good Ignacio, you seem a bit on edge. What is the matter?
195	Oh, well... I-it's nothing. I just got a bit riled up by that Space-Time Manipulator.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0036
196	I wouldn't take his words to heart. As I see it, he is a desperate man. He'll say and do whatever it takes if he believes it will help him realize his ambitions.
197	And right now, the object of those ambitions seems to be that girl, Emmel. Her importance to him is quite baffling, really.
198	I agree. I just don't know what to make of him anymore. Perhaps I never did.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
199	And you don't need to.
200	His disposition is of no concern to us. Lord Shahel's prudence alone guides us in our daily lives.
201	Of course.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0045
202	Speaking of, it is nearly time for milord's dinner. I must see to its preparation post-haste.
203	Right. You can go. I need to find Emmel, anyway. She's probably with our other guest.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
204	I will leave that matter to you, then.
205	...
