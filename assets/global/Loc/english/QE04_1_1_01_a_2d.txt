001	...Mm...	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
002	Where am I...?
003	This is the Door of Truth—where souls are judged.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0008
004	Who...are you?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	I am Ouroboros...the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
006	I have heard the crying of your soul, wishing to change the future.
007	The future...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
008	Yes...I saw the earth burning before my eyes!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
009	I have found you worthy of power. Do you wish for it?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0002
010	Power...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
011	When you hear the lament of both earth and life being defiled, you will receive the power to see the future.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0038
012	The power to see the future...?! If that were possible...	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
013	Would I be able to change that future of doom?!
014	Your choices alone will determine whether or not the future will change.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0039
015	If that brightness that shines within your heart does not fade, you have more than a fighting chance.
016	...!
017	Mother Nature in all her beauty and kindness cannot be engulfed in flames!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
018	I'll do whatever I can to prevent a future where all the colors of this gentle world turn red!
019	So, your answer...	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
020	I want that power—that power to see into the future and protect the sacred nature of this world!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
021	Very well. Your contract of truth has been sealed!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
022	You have witnessed a terrible future, child. Let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0010
023	...Mm...	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
024	Where is Asena? Was that...a dream?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
025	No! It wasn't a dream! The place I found myself at, and the future I saw with my own eyes...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
026	I remember it all with every fiber of my body!
027	That young girl said it was the power to foresee the future...
028	It must be something that I...and I alone can do!
029	The wailing of the land and of life will soon subside! I will protect it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
030	The village of Lezario. Mansion of Chief Adone of the Toxotes tribe.
031	Adone, has Tina still not returned from the forest?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
032	Ehem. Not yet. I'm sure she'll return soon. Don't worry, Elder.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0029
033	That's not what I'm worried about. I'm worried about whether or not Asena will accept her as your successor.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
034	She has grown into a truly able warrior...
035	With few youth in our tribe, she has become an integral presence within our community.
036	Whether or not she has the qualities to be chief is a crucial matter to this village.
037	Do you doubt my daughter Tina's qualities as a shaman?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0012
038	I am just a little concerned. Despite her young age, she must carry the burden of our tribe...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
039	There is no doubt in my mind that Tina has the qualities to become a shaman. That's what I believe.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0002
040	She might be...more qualified than I.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0002_01
041	More than you...?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
042	But only if she can open her eyes. Don't worry. I exercise no favoritism as her father.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
043	I understand your nervousness, but let's wait for now and see...ehem.
044	We're under attack! We're under attack!
045	...!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
046	Chief, it's a raid!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
047	Ack! Is it the Bazura tribe?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0018
048	No! Their battle flag appears to be a symbol of spread wings...
049	Spread wings...?! What is Gluttony Foss doing all the way in our forest?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
050	Wasn't the Fuu faction supposed to be protecting the border?! Prepare my horse!
051	Wait, Adone! You mustn’t in your current shape...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
052	I am still the chief of this tribe! If not me then who will protect our tribe of Toxotes?!	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0003
053	I'll leave the woman and children to you!	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0003_01
054	Adone...!
055	Is that the power of foresight that the young girl gave to me?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
056	...? Kiki, Adel...what's the matter?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0006
057	...! Grrr...!
058	Grrrr!
059	Glur...glurppp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
060	Jam...?! Kiki, Adel, step back! Don't touch it! You'll get cursed!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
061	Oh spirits, residing within Mother Nature...hear my prayer.	VO_tina.tina_favorite_0001
062	I am the one who shall become the wind shaman...	VO_tina.tina_favorite_0001_01
063	Ouija...give me the power to purify the evil that disrupts our harmony!	VO_tina.tina_favorite_0001_02
064	...!
065	Gluuurp...!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0025
066	That was the wind... My Ouija is truly shrouded in the wind!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
067	Grrrrr...!
068	Is that smoke?! It can't be the village! Let's hurry, Kiki, Adel!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
