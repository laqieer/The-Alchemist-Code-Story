001	Huff...huff...huff...! Hyaaaaaa!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
002	You're inexperienced in Alchemy, but your brute strength is more than a man's.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
003	Ack. Even in training, I've never been able to do Alchemy really well.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
004	Whining won't fix anything. If you can't master Alchemy, the only other alternative is death.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
005	Ohh... That's harsh.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
006	Not your death...Chloe's.
007	...!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
008	Do you want to save your friend? Then you must master Alchemy as if her life depends on it—because right now it does.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
009	Um, Captain Cadanova! Please...teach me Alchemy!
010	Kanon, what do you think is the most important quality when it comes to Alchemy.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
011	W-well, I think that would be...the amount of Alchemia Particles you're born with.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
012	It's the state of your heart.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
013	My heart...?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
014	Right now your mind is trapped in the desperate need to master Alchemy to quickly save your friend.
015	Then...what should I do?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
016	Kanon, remember your honor and the path you believe in and must pursue. Why did you want to become a Paladin?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
017	W-well, you might laugh, seeing how incompetent I am, but...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
018	I want to become the captain of the Holy Guard and protect the peace in Babel!
019	I joined the Holy Guard because I wanted to create a world where everyone could be happy!
020	Then stop being swayed by your emotions. Everything you do must be to fulfill your greater mission.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
021	Understood, Captain! I'll...try my best!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
022	They should be arriving soon.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
023	Za-Zahar, why are you doing this?
024	As a hostage, you'd do best to remain silent.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
025	You were next in line to be captain, right?
026	Why did you turn against the Holy Guard?
027	You're still a Squire, correct? Here's my advice: Don't become a Paladin. You're better off that way.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0047
028	Huh? What do you mean?
029	I'll show you with this battle.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
030	What? Oh!
031	They're here.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
032	Captain Vettel!
033	You're Chloe, right?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
034	Y-yes, Captain! Agh!
035	Unbelievable! Has he extracted Alchemia Particles from your body?!
036	I-I'm so sorry! I allowed the enemy to steal my power!
037	No, I'm the one that should apologize for having put you through this.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0036
038	N-not at all! I...I'm sorry for being a burden to you, Captain Vettel! Sniff...waaaah!
039	... ...
040	It's been a while, Zahar.
041	Heh. I've missed you, Vettel.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
042	Zahar, your sin of having made one from Envylia weep is heavy...
043	Heheh. Even when I think of you now, it makes my right eye ache.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
044	This time, you won't get away with just losing an eye. I'm going to stop you here!
045	Hmph. When you can't even use Alchemy?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
046	Not can't—won't! I'll teach you that there's no peace in Alchemy!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0007
047	I'll teach you something as well. The only thing that can change this world is invincible power!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
048	Captain Vettel, be careful!
