001	Phew...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
002	Hi, Logi! Are you done with your duties for today?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0001
003	Yeah, I finished up just now. Have you gotten used to this place yet?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
004	Well, there's still a lot that perplexes me. I suppose that's because I still can't remember anything.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0030
005	But everybody's so nice to me! Tina in particular seems to really be concerned for me.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_favorite_0008
006	I see.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_1011
007	You look...tired.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0006
008	Not at all! Uh... Well, that's a lie. To tell you the truth, I am a bit worn out.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
009	I still haven't heard from the Blue Tongues, the friends I've traveled with for so long.
010	You mean since those blobs attacked?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
011	Yeah. Even with Kamui's network, we can't seem to find them.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
012	O-oh.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
013	Uhm... Logi?
014	Yeah?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
015	I'm sure they're fine! I mean, I don't have any basis for saying that, but you just have to believe, right?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_favorite_0007
016	Yeah... Yeah, you're right. Thanks, Agatha.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
017	They're doing all right somewhere, and we'll soon be seeing each other again. So for now, I just have to do what I—
018	Captain Logi! Where is Captain Logi?!
019	I'm here!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
020	What's the matter?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0006
021	The scouts from the east have reported signs of a group that very well may be the Blue Tongues!
022	Is that true?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
023	Yes, sir! It's just...we didn't get much out of the reporting scout before he passed out.
024	The scouts seemed to have been attacked, and he was the only survivor. His wounds are quite serious.
025	I have to go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
026	Captain Logi, wait!
027	Don't stop me! My friends could be in danger as we speak!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
028	I understand how you feel, but please, go see our boss first.
029	He's already making preparations for a rescue after hearing the report.
030	All right! Sorry, Agatha. I gotta go now.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
031	Please be careful.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0005
032	Kamui!
033	Logi. Good, you're here.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
034	The scouts were stationed in a ruin northeast of here.
035	They all know how and when to retreat. For them to be decimated like this—
036	Means such a threat could be facing the Blue Tongues!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
037	We should hurry. We desperately need their strength.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
038	Let's go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
039	Don't get in my way!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
