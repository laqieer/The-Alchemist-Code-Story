001	Nina, did you see where the scary people went after they grabbed the villagers?
002	Yes!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
003	There's no way they could've gotten very far. We're going after them!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
004	The Blue Flame Guard?! What are they doing here?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
005	We are looking for Vettel, Captain of the Scarlet Legion.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
006	I'm here. What have you come here for?
007	The Minister sent us here to support the Scarlet Legion. He is very concerned about the situation in this area.
008	He believes that whatever is happening here is not just a matter that concerns Envylia and Wratharis, but has the potential to change the future of the entire world.
009	In other words...he does not fully trust us yet.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
010	It is more likely that he is simply attempting to do whatever he can to prevent war between the countries.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
011	It is nothing personal. The Minister probably just remembered that as the only recognized knight order in Envylia, this business ought to have fallen under our purview from the beginning.
012	We would be much obliged if you would allow us to lend a hand.
013	Now then, we shall conduct a search of the area while you take the child back to the village. Soldiers, march!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
014	My, my... They are certainly a well-trained bunch, aren't they? Very impressive.
015	Yeah... I can't help but notice all the ways they are our superior in discipline and training. Could we really become a knight order on par with them?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
016	No, I can't think like that. We will prove our worth by completing our mission and showing that we have what it takes to become a fully-fledged knight order.
017	Our only priority must be to stay true to our iron will. We can work out the nitty gritty details later.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
018	Good, you've got your head on straight. Don't forget, there's still plenty for us to do here. Shall we go?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
019	Um... I-if it is possible, could I go with you...?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
020	No. Go home. You'll just get in the way.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
021	Heh. Nina, don't be fooled by his tough exterior. He's really just worried about you.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
022	You... How dare you!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
023	Um...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
024	What?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
025	Urk! Um... Th-thank you.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
026	...
027	A-and I'm really sorry about what happened to your father. I'm sorry that he died protecting our people...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
028	But, um... I-I think th-that it would be good for us to, um, work harder to understand the humans.	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
029	I... I totally understand how you feel. One of my dearest friends was killed by a human.
030	What are you saying? Are you trying to pick a fight or something?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
031	Gerald!
032	N-no, that's not why I said it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
033	I have come to think that hatred only breeds more hatred. I-I'm trying to break that cycle of mutual destruction.
034	M-maybe if the two of us can learn to forgive each other... Maybe the day when therians and humans can live and even laugh together is not too far off.
035	If I have the strength to forgive and break the cycle of hate, I think...I could become like the sun; one who can bring joy to the people of this world.
036	This kid... Her words are almost the same as what Vettel once said.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
037	...
038	Not all therians are as close-minded about the humans as the village chief. I mean...not everyone agrees with me, either...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
039	B-but...I was really relieved when you all came, a-and I really hope that I can be of use to you!
040	...
041	I know it must be strange coming from someone like me who can't really do anything, but...	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
042	Uh, hello? What are you all just standing around for? The kidnappers and the knights that just passed through here are already starting to go at each other.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
043	The Blue Flame Guard really works fast, huh?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0046
044	Let's go. If we wait around any longer, the battle will be over before we even get there. Nina, do not let yourself get separated from us.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
045	U-understood!	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
046	This is...much more intense than I expected.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0024
047	Yeah... We might actually be in over our heads.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0011
048	Hey, come on. Look closely... We are more needed here than you seem to think.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
049	Oh, Sir Gerald. Perceptive as always.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0044
050	It's not a trick that I will fall for more than once. Legion! Prepare yourselves for battle!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
051	What...? We've been surrounded?! No...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
052	Vettel, let's go! It's time for the Scarlet Legion to show the world what we are made of!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
053	Indeed. Scarlet Legion! Forward!
