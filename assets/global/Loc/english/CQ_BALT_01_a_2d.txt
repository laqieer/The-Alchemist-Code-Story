001	...Hey.
002	Hm?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
003	How long are you gonna sleep for? Hurry and get up.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0030
004	Mm...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0028
005	You finally got up?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
006	What do you want?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
007	Hey, you haven't forgotten the face of your business competitor, have you?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0029
008	That's not what I'm asking you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
009	I'm asking what the Vice-Captain of the Sand Hawks is doing here.
010	I'm here for work, of course. Who would come here out of their own volition?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
011	I see. Then hurry up, finish your work, and leave.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0020
012	Seriously. Just when I was dozing off comfortably...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
013	I still haven't finished talking to you yet.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
014	Huh? What are you talking about? Didn't you have work to do?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
015	Unfortunately...my work involves you.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
016	Huh?! What do you mean?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0025
017	Don't get so worked up. If I was after your life, I would've taken care of it while you were asleep.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
018	My job is to bring you back to the Guild.
019	Are you an idiot? Why would I believe such an outlandish tale?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
020	Here's the contract.
021	Is that the Guild's emblem?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0021
022	It's because you're coming in and out of a Special A-Class Danger Zone like this.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0030
023	It's up to me where I choose to rest.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
024	I got a request to bring you back because of your actions.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
025	What they did was unnecessary.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
026	Well, anyway, that's why I'm here. According to my contract, I'll bring you back by force if I have to.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
027	Hmph. Sorry, but I have no intention of following you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0039
028	I'm gonna stay and relax here.
029	I'm here for work. Sorry, but what you want isn't my priority.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0040
030	Tsk. Here comes a monster. This is on you for wasting my time.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
031	I'm the merchandise, right? In that case, you'd better be careful not to harm me.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
032	What are you talking about? According to my contract, it doesn't matter whether I bring you back dead or alive.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
033	If you want to get back alive, then you'd better protect yourself.
034	What...?!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0027
035	Well then, let's start.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
036	The worst rendezvous in history!
