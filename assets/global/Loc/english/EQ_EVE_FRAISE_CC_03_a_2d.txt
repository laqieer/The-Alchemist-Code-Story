001	You wish to see Lord Fraise? State your business.
002	Uh, y-yes! I have a letter for him!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
003	A letter, huh… If that's the case, I can deliver it for you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0006
004	No! It's very urgent! That's why I've got to deliver it to him personally.
005	It's super-duper important. I need to ensure the sender that it was properly delivered. So--	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0042
006	Hmmm…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
007	…I can tell you're skeptical. Maybe my face gives off a certain vibe…but I promise I'm not trying to trick you.
008	Alright. If that's all you want, then let me speak with Lord Fraise.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0037
009	That was quick! A-Are you sure?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
010	I was expecting more of a back-and-forth… Things would never go this smoothly in Lustburg--no way.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
011	Is that right? Well, if you do anything fishy, we'll lock you up on the spot…
012	But your face does give the impression that you really need to deliver that letter.
013	Th-Thanks for your understanding!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
014	I hope that frown turns upside down after you complete your task. Our job is to bring smiles to the people.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
015	I better get going then. Why don't you watch a training session while you wait?
016	…So, they bring smiles to the people, huh? That's so cool.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0044
017	They train this hard to protect their country and their people…and they fight with pride.
018	On the opposite side of the spectrum, the witches drive away outsiders and place limitations on their own people.
019	I know they're trying to protect Lustburg in their own way, but still…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0031
020	…These knights are waaay cooler.
021	Miss Rachel? Lord Fraise has completed his training. You may see him now. Please follow me.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
022	Ah, yes! …Wait, you're a woman?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
023	Is something wrong?	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0025
024	Oh, no. I just didn't know there were women in the knight's order. It's hard to tell…what with the helmets and all…
025	The desire to protect this country is the same for men and women.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
026	…Copy that.
027	The commander of the Scarlet Flame Imperial Guard that was created to supplement the Blue Flame Guard is a female knight, you know.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0004
028	It was Commander Chloe's idea to create the special unit in the first place.
029	Interesting…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0045
030	Well, well. Speak of the devil…
031	Keep up the good work. How's everybody today?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
032	Doing great! We always appreciate you looking out for us, so we're doing our best with today's training.	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0002
033	I'm happy to hear that! As long as we keep doing our best, we can protect our people--
034	Hm? Who're you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0001
035	Ah! Er…I'm from Lustburg. I came to deliver a letter…and, um…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
036	Wow, you traveled quite a ways, didn't you? Be careful on the roads, okay? Let us know if you ever need anything.
037	Well, I've got to get going. See ya.
038	She's so…COOL!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0024
039	Sir, your visitor has arrived.
040	Welcome. You must be Rachel. I've been told you have something you'd like to discuss with me…	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0001
041	N-Nice to meet you. I'm here to deliver a letter from Eve.
042	Eve?	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1007
043	…
044	…I see. If that's what she desires, then I…	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
045	…What's the matter?
046	…! My apologies. I was lost in thought.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
047	Thank you very much for taking the trouble to deliver this letter all the way from Lustburg. I'll arrange for someone to escort you on your way back.
048	Er…um…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
049	…What did it say? That should have been a love letter, but you don't look very happy!
050	…I'm sorry. It's a private matter.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
051	Yeah...b-but--It's my problem, too!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
052	Because…Moa is my friend!
053	You're a friend of Moa?
054	Moa has been really worried about Eve lately--saying she isn't her usual self. If things don't work out between you two, Moa will be devastated. So…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0042
055	…
056	Fraise!
057	…She said that was her final letter.	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0020
058	…Huh?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
059	W-Wait! Let me see!
060	My dearest Fraise,<br>Are you well? This may be sudden, but...this will be the last letter you receive from me.
061	I'm so glad I met you. You made me really happy! Thank you for all the great memories.
062	Please never change and always be the wonderful, honest man I love. Farewell.<br>Love,<br>Eve
063	On the back of the stationery teardrops seem to have blurred tiny letters reading:
064	"I love you."
065	No way…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0018
066	…
067	…Are you gonna let things end like this?
068	…If that is what she's decided, then I respect her decision.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
069	You've gotta be kidding me! First of all, you totally don't get how Eve really feels.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0014
070	She loves you enough to cry about it. You think she really wants to break up?!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
071	…
072	Secondly, rule #12 in the book of love states, " If a woman tells you goodbye, she wants you to chase her!"
073	R-Really?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
074	Of course! If you don't go now, who will bring a smile to Eve's face?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
075	…
076	Sir, it's almost time.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
077	…Forgive me. It's time for training. We'll have to leave it at that.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0035
078	Fraise!
079	…You're more than welcome to watch, if you'd like. You did travel all the way to Envylia, after all.
080	Today's training will include members of the Blue Flame Guard and the Scarlet Flame Guard. It should be a worthwhile spectacle.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
081	Whoa…When will I get a chance like this again?
082	…So, today I'm sparring with you, Vic? Wouldn't you prefer someone else?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0001
083	I told you not to call me that. Besides…I can tell you're…	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
084	…Hm? What's wrong?
085	…It's nothing. It's just…I have a feeling I won't lose to you today.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
