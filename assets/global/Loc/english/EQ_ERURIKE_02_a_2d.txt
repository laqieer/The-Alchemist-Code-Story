001	Crush them! If we waste any more time, their rear army will show up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
002	Tsk. With this many of them, it doesn't seem like I've brought enough men.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
003	U-um...excuse me...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
004	Sorry, but we'll talk later. Right now, we must focus on getting through this barrier and regrouping with the Guild Guard!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0035
005	Just look at it...!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
006	Look at what? What are you...huh?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
007	A sandstorm?!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
008	Tsk. We're out of time! You lot, fall back! Just take what we have now!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
009	Th-they're running away!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
010	They must've been planning on escaping under this sandstorm from the beginning! If we get separated from the others, it'll be no laughing matter!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0013
011	Oh, no! My hat...!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
012	He-hey! Young lady!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
013	Tsk! I'll go! You lot take the rest of them and rendezvous with the Guild Guard!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
014	Um. Where am I?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0029
015	You've awoken, young lady.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
016	Um...
017	Just know this; we're currently lost in the desert.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
018	I got caught up with chasing you and...
019	Oh, my hat! What a relief.
020	I was just explaining why you should be the exact opposite of relieved.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0030
021	For starters, what were you thinking? You risked your life for a hat.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
022	This means more to me than anything.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
023	Enough for you to risk your life on it, I guess.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0044
024	Save that kind of talk for when you're mature enough to look after yourself.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
025	Hmph. Are you trying to say that I'm not mature?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
026	Do you think someone who goes running off into a sandstorm for a hat is mature?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
027	!!!
028	Don't you understand that it's out of sheer luck that we're still alive?! Don't underestimate the desert!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0017
029	You're right. I'm sorry.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0027
030	Life is a gift. Try to value it more in the future.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
031	Um. I'm really sorry...for the trouble I caused.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0035
032	It would've left me with a bad aftertaste if someone I met ended up lying dead in the desert the next day.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
033	Thank you.
034	Hmph. Anyway, there's no point in hanging around here any longer. Let's move.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
035	What? But wouldn't there be a higher chance of us being rescued if we waited here?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
036	Under normal circumstances, yes.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
037	However, there are bandits in this desert. If we were to run into them now, it would be difficult to escape.
038	We should at least find a place to hide or else there will be no comfort in waiting to be rescued.
039	Right. Shall we go then, um...?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0022
040	I'm Balt, young lady. I'm the deputy captain of the Sand Hawks.
041	You can call me Elrike! I'm a merchant from Envylia.
042	Elrike...huh? All right then, follow me. We'll begin by walking straight across the desert.
043	All right.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
044	Well...I guess we're still walking.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0029
045	What are you muttering about? Don't waste your energy.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
046	Talking stops me from being tired and worried! By the way, Balt...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
047	What is it?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
048	How much longer do we have to walk for?
049	It may be a desert, but it doesn't mean that the sand continues on forever.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
050	This area used to be a fertile land. But Gluttony has long exploited this place, ultimately turning it into its current state.
051	Look at that.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
052	Huh? Oh...it's a plant.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
053	North of this desert, water still courses underground.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
054	That's why you can see deep-rooted plants like this still surviving.
055	If we pass here, we'll find a source of water—an oasis.
056	He-hey, wait! My notebook...ah, here it is. I need to write this down.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0046
057	Huh? What're you doing?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0047
058	Well, it's valuable information. Does everyone from the desert know about this?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0008
059	It's common knowledge that's essential to surviving here.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0004
060	I see. I didn't know about that. When you say survive, does that mean you've lived here all this time?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0044
061	Yes. As a band of vigilantes who protect this desert, our services have been extensively utilized.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
062	Is your outfit part of the caravan you belonged to or your sigil as a mercenary? That chain on your right leg really stands out.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
063	It's special—sort of a way to identify a fellow Sand Hawks member.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
064	Each of these is a memento of my fallen comrades.
065	They have a pretty important meaning in addition to that as well.
066	Are they mementos? Oh... I'm sorry.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0035
067	Don't apologize. Dying isn't the end. We carry on the will of the dead.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
068	The will...?
069	After our water was stolen by Gluttony, we have protected this desert in order to witness its rebirth.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
070	Even if we aim to regrow the trees and the plants...in a land as unsafe as ours, neither scholar nor workman and especially no merchant will come.
071	Our will is to bring back the trees and plants to this land...to build an oasis on our own without borrowing the help of Gluttony who robbed of us our water in the first place.	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
072	That's why you're getting rid of the bandits?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0044
073	Yes. We cannot allow evil to dominate our desert.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0004
074	Allowing that would be the same as disgracing the honor of our comrades who died in this desert.
075	... ...
076	Tsk. I'm speaking nonsense. Forget about what I said.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
077	No! It's not nonsense! It's beautiful. I can feel the bond that you have for your comrades, Balt.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
078	Stop. When you put it like that...	VO_balt.balt_sys_0048
079	People who are dedicated to their convictions are really amazing.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0045
080	I'd like to believe I have my own convictions, but there are times when I stumble.
081	Hey. Are you listening to what I'm saying?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
082	Hm? Are you blushing? I guess I should write a memo that the deputy captain of the Sand Hawks gets embarrassed quite easily.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0007
083	Hey! You...tsk. More importantly, we've finally arrived.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
084	Huh? Oh...an oasis!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
085	There should be a small resting lodge for caravans. It should be enough to cool down—
086	Wait, get down!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0020
087	Huh?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
088	Ah. So this is where you were hiding.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
089	Hey...is that the leader of the bandits who attacked our caravan?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
090	Yeah. It seems like we've stumbled upon quite the prize. Who would've thought that the oasis lodging was the entrance to their hideout?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
091	It'll be dangerous to get close, right? What should we do? It's almost night. At this rate, we'll freeze to death!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0029
092	No. Actually, it's perfect. If we can use their supplies then it'll make things a lot easier.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
093	Besides...it definitely won't be a waste of time to get information about their hideout.
094	What do you mean? If we steal their supplies, doesn't that make us the same as them?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
095	Far from it. All we're doing is taking back what was stolen, a little ahead of schedule.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
096	Their guard is down now. This is our chance!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0032
097	Oh, Balt?! Se-seriously!
098	Heheheh... That's quite a catch we had today as well! ...Huh? Y-you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
099	Sorry, but you'll have to sleep for a while.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0034
100	We're gonna take them all out before they realize it. Then we sneak into their hideout!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0010
