001	He's faster than I thought.
002	Hmm? Have I been here before?
003	Oh, I'm positive he will make a move by sundown tomorrow.
004	Not even his habit of fine wine and women will deter him from such a lucrative deal.
005	Really, Rox, I wonder how you even get these kinds of information...
006	Hmph! That's none of your business!
007	Just... Just be on time and in position, all right? Sheesh!
008	Heheh. Don't worry, I've got it all covered.
009	Ngh...
010	(What was that? Some sort of...memory?)
011	Schooling her features, Roxanne sighs and scouts out her surroundings.
012	(Never mind. There are more pressing matters at hand.)
013	(That looks like a good spot.)
014	Slinging her sniper rifle over a shoulder, Roxanne climbs into a high alcove and surveys the area.
015	(The archives, hmm?)
016	(Sneaking around, I suppose...)
017	(There you are.)
018	...Well then! A decoy.
019	I do enjoy a more...riveting contest.
020	Picking up the fizzling remains of a hologram device, Roxanne turns and smirks.
021	You're mistaken if you think you've succeeded in drawing me out into the open.
022	Or did you truly believe a sniper would be disadvantaged this close?
023	The rumors around Slothstein were true...
024	You look...just like her.
025	...What?
026	Were you with Goetia all this time?
027	Rox, is that... Is that really you?!
028	Well now. I see where the Doktor gets his ideas for his contrivances.
029	And to think I've just come off a training session and into the real deal.
030	Sorry to say, but standard protocol would be...
031	...Bullet between the eyes.
032	If this is your idea of a sick joke, I'm not laughing.
033	I've been looking for so long, and you-!
034	Should we be acquainted?
035	It's me. Siegfried.
036	I... We were...friends. More than that, even.
037	What happened to you? What did they do to you?
038	Rox...
039	Sieg...fried?
040	(Why does that name sound so familiar?)
041	Make another move and it'll be your last.
042	...
043	(Amnesia? Or something else?)
044	Huh? What was that?
045	It came from over there!
046	Damn.
047	Oh no you don't!
