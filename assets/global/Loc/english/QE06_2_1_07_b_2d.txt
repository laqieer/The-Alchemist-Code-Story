001	…!!!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
002	Accept your fate!! …Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0016
003	…!!!
004	Kaede!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
005	Don't…interfere!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0011
006	Tamba, wait!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
007	But…
008	…She's gone. Has she fallen off the cliff?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
009	…!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
010	Don't try to go after your royal partner. You can't save her from this height.
011	…She's not my partner. You have no right to speak of Kaede...	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
012	…It appears blood is rushing to your head.
013	…Urgh…ngh…!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
014	…!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
015	A demon protecting another… This "king" must be very important.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0044
016	…This doesn't concern you.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
017	Know your limits. You took a direct hit from Kagutsuchi. There's no way you're unscathed… Besides…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
018	You're missing a member of your party--the one called Kaede, who offset my abilities… That means your defense is weakened.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
019	And your other line of defense, has blood rushing to his head. I won't miss this chance--since I've already learned your "skill."
020	Now with Kagutsuchi staring you down… Let's see how long you can last.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0015
021	…!
022	So, do you accept defeat?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
023	..DAMMIT!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0032
024	…Agh!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0042
025	…Confound it… He's still too young.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
026	I'd expect no less from a chief. A wise decision… The alternative would have been your "king" burning in Kagutsuchi's fire.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
027	The time is yet to come for our "king." When that day comes, the demons will delight in eradicating the human race.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
028	Today was just a preview.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
029	Wait!
030	Don't. There's no use giving chase.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0014
031	…Our side has incurred heavy damages. Give priority to treating the injured and see that the fallen receive a proper burial.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0030
032	...Understood!
033	A demon that can offset my power, huh… I sensed they possessed a power similar to chakra… They can nullify the Phoenix Brigade's abilities, huh.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
034	We may possess the arcane art, Kagutsuchi…but we must remain vigilant.
035	…I don't want there to be any more threats to our people, however…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
036	I have no choice but to bear this burden…as a member of the Aquila Rubrum lineage.
