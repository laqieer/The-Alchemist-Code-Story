001	Ugh... What a waste of time! We can't afford to get pinned down here!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
002	Quit...running...away, you little brat!
003	Oh crap, I'm surrounded! How did I not notice the rest of them hiding in the bushes?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0020
004	Th-this is bad!
005	We've got you cornered, missy! So, how's about you hand over the goods? No funny business, now. You've nowhere left to run!
006	You think so, do you?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0039
007	Wh-what the...?!
008	Aaaaaahhh! I can't see a thing!
009	Ishuna, now's your chance!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
010	Right. Huzzzaaaah!
011	Well, all's well that ends well. We cleaned up the streets, and I got to test out my machine's new function. Two birds, one stone. Now that's what I call efficiency!	VO_icona.icona_battle_0001
012	Yeah... Whoopee.
013	What's that look for? Do I detect sarcasm?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
014	Come on, spit it out. I want to hear what's on your mind. Your thinking process is fascinating to me!
015	It's nothing, really. I just...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
016	I can't help but wonder how much longer it'll be before I'm able to take on scum like them alone and come out on top.
017	Ahh, now it all makes sense!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
018	But, hey, being down on yourself isn't constructive. Why not try thinking about why you failed, instead of just dwelling on the fact that you did?
019	Personally, I think your irrational behavior comes from your tendency to try way too hard.
020	Wait...what?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
021	But I don't think that eagerness is entirely rooted in your desire to help people.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
022	That's part of the reason, sure, but I suspect there might be a separate, underlying cause.
023	For instance...maybe you've got a problem you've been procrastinating dealing with.
024	I...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0027
025	I guess...
026	I guess that could be it.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0022
027	Thinking about having to face Glanz and Rochelle again has really been weighing on my mind. I guess that could be throwing me off.
028	Well, I could have guessed that much from how you reacted earlier. But what exactly is the problem?
029	I...I said some stuff I probably shouldn't have. Even though, deep down, I knew it wasn't their fault.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
030	But they didn't blame me, or get angry with me. Instead, they entrusted me with the future of the Unicorn Knights.
031	I don't care what you have to do. No matter how uncouth or beastly you have to be... I want you to live.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0041
032	You can hate me if you want. You can hate your chief if you want. Just promise me you won't rush through your life.
033	If the Unicorn Knights is where you belong, then you have to get back to them.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
034	But it feels like all I can do—all I've been able to do—to protect the people I care about is fight for them.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0043
035	Whereas Glanz and Rochelle... They helped me make tons of happy memories. They made me smile and laugh, time and time again.
036	I don't think I've done a single thing like that, for anyone here!
037	And I worry that I never will, that I'll never become the person I'm meant to be: someone who can restore smiles to the faces of those around me and keep them there.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0022
038	In other words, you don't think you're good enough to face those two as you are right now.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0045
039	If that's how you feel, then so be it...but it seems to me that this ideal you've set up for yourself is way too vague to be achievable.
040	Huh? But...
041	In order for a goal to be achievable, you need some way of measuring it; a standard that defines whether or not you've actually completed it.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
042	Humans are imperfect creatures by design, so there isn't really a "person you're meant to be." You are who you are, and you can only truly change or improve if you give yourself a concrete path to follow.
043	Pressuring yourself to try to fulfill this legacy you've been entrusted with isn't going to get you the results you want.
044	Instead...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
045	I would recommend simplifying your goal to something more achievable, like making sure people are able to spend time with their loved ones in safety and comfort.
046	Um...
047	I also think you should start having a little more confidence in yourself and your abilities. After all, those two wouldn't have entrusted you with something so important if they didn't have faith in you.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
048	You...really think so?
049	I'm kind of speaking from experience here. You see, I entrusted my research and the future it could bring to my little brother. Of course, I would have preferred to see the research through myself, but...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
050	The point is, I knew I could count on him.
051	Even though there was no way for me to know what his methods would be—or if they would really make this world a better place.
052	Of course, in hindsight, there's no doubt in my mind that I made the right decision in entrusting it all to my brother. The fact that this world hasn't ended yet is proof positive of that.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
053	Huh.
054	Results are what count in this world—and you've done pretty well in that respect.
055	I don't know about that...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
056	(I still don't understand why Glanz entrusted the Unicorn Knights to me.)	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
057	(But what Icona's saying makes sense. It had to have been because Glanz saw something in me that made her think I was worthy of that responsibility.)
058	(I still have no idea what it could've been, but...)
059	But on the whole, I think you're right. There's no point dwelling on questions that are impossible for me to answer.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
060	Instead, I should be focusing on the things I can do right here, right now.
061	That's what I like to see! A logical and efficient choice.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
062	Now that that's taken care of, we should aim to wrap up our business here as swiftly as possible.
063	Right. Let's get this done!
064	But...there's still no sign of that peddler. How are we meant to—	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
065	Don't move!
066	Huh? Whoa!
067	You see it now? A trap, right at your feet.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0029
068	Let me see... I thought so. This is a binding incantation gear.
069	Considering those lowlifes we bumped into earlier, I'm fairly certain this trap was also intended for the peddler.
070	Look! There are traces of people passing through here. These must have been left by whoever set the trap!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
071	Hmm... Judging by the size of the footprints, there were about four or five of them here, all of small to medium stature.
072	Maybe if we follow these footprints, they'll lead us straight to the ones responsible for setting up the trap! It's worth a shot, right? C'mon!
073	I thought my eyes were sharp, but you found and interpreted those footprints with incredible precision.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0003
074	I have to admit...I'm impressed.
075	Haha. I guess the one area I'm confident in is gathering information. It's a pretty valuable skill for a bandit to have, believe it or...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0023
076	Hold up! Someone's coming.
077	Shouldn't be long now... The second the peddler falls into our trap, we'll take their place—and then we'll see whose pockets are jingling with gold!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
078	I can't believe it—they're planning to impersonate the peddler!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
079	It certainly sounds that way, doesn't it? A simple plan, but an effective one.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
080	But won't the townspeople see through their disguise?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0043
081	I don't know. But it's hardly a time-efficient plan, I can say that much.
082	Well, I'm going to put a stop to it!
083	Huh? Who's there?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
084	How could you be so selfish?! I won't let you get away with this!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0013
