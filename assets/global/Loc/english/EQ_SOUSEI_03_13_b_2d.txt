001	Urk...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
002	It would seem your abilities only go so far.
003	That power of yours is strong enough that even I felt threatened. However...
004	The threat you pose is little more than a scratch compared to the abyss that dwells within me. This is where you meet your end, Pursuer of Gluttony!
005	Damn it!
006	(Is this...the end?)
007	(Now that we've finally found a means of felling a Cursed Beast and made so many allies along the way... Is this where it all ends?)
008	(It can't be... I can't accept it.)
009	No... No way! I won't give up now! I can't!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
010	What?!
011	Mayor Fedele...said something worth taking to heart...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
012	I've left a trail of sacrifices in the wake of my journey.
013	How can I let those sacrifices be in vain?! If my strength is not enough...
014	Then I will open up my eyes to the bloodshed I have wrought and grab ahold of a greater power!
015	Huzzaaaaaaaah!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
016	How can this be?! This light... My princess...
017	I need it! I need greater power! I must have it to save my sister from her miserable fate! I must have it to lead all of humankind to a golden era!
018	Thus, I shall shred my hopes and dreams and convert them into pure power, and I shall name it!
019	This is the secret golden elixir that will make equal the future for all people of every region! It is the hidden art that enlightens the mysteries of all creation!
020	I call it: alchemy!
021	No! Aaarrgghhhh!
022	Haaaa...haaa... Ha... Haha... Hahahaha!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
023	At last, it is within my grasp! With this...! With this power, surely I can...!
024	Grrrroooooohhh!!!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0001
025	This is no time to be celebrating! I have to hurry and find the others!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
