001	"Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of mercilessness!"	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_0005
002	That's not good enough.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
003	Alchemy and Spiritbonding share the same foundation.
004	Essentially, that is to enhance your own Alchemia and conduct transmutation through a catalyst.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
005	Alchemy tends to rely on Philosopher's Stones, a sort of concentrated Alchemia crystal, to be this catalyst.
006	However, with Spiritbonding, the sephirah upon your body acts as the catalyst.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
007	No matter how naturally talented one may be, each body is limited to only ten sephirah.
008	If opponents bear the same number of sephirah, it is the difference in experience and skill that decides the outcome of a battle. Like so.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
009	Agh...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
010	What's the matter? Out of breath already?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
011	Ngh! "Wisdom clears the path to clemency—"	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_0006
012	Smart move, but too slow.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
013	You are quite adept with the use of Spiritbonding, but that alone will not make you a sound Protector.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
014	Casting is only necessary when supplementing what you lack when Spiritbonding.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
015	Most Sephira only have one sephirah upon their bodies.
016	Casting allows them to beseech Sephiron for the absent sephirah needed to successfully use their desired spell.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
017	We Protectors, on the other hand, are connected to all ten sephirah.
018	Like this!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0004
019	Guh! Ah!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0025
020	You must open the door that bars you from the great Sephiron.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
021	You have the power to do so.
022	(The door? What does he...?)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
023	(Is that the door? That's right, I've seen it before. If I could just open it...)
024	Huaaahhhh!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0011
025	Haha! That's it! Remember that sensation, for that is what it means to be one with truth!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
026	H-haa... Haaa...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0028
027	Hm, that is enough for today.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
028	Th-thank you for your guidance.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
029	It has been a while since I have had a student so promising. I'm sorry if I pushed you too hard.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
030	I will be more careful next time.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
031	(I never expected that being the Protector would require such mental fortitude and power.)
032	It seems Lord Waginau has accepted you as his pupil.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
033	Chief! Even so, I am nowhere near his caliber.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0036
034	Haste makes waste, young one. Take comfort in knowing you are indeed making progress.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
035	Yes, I know you are right. It is just that the prophecy Malta received lingers in my mind.
036	It would be wise to just focus on your training as Protector for now.
037	Let me deal with the worldly obligations.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
038	We can always ask Lord Waginau for assistance if it becomes necessary.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0034
039	Of course.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
040	...
041	Kamui, why not take it easy a bit?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
042	Sorry, Hisham. Have I disturbed your studies?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
043	Not really, I just mean... You've been pacing ever since you got back home.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
044	(I cannot stop thinking about the abnormal movements of the Sacred Stone and Gluttony's armies. What is this uneasiness in my heart?)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
045	Kamui, are you home?	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0004
046	Malta? Are you well enough to be out?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
047	Um, I was just wondering, can borrow you for a second?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
048	I mean, with your training and everything, we hadn't had much time to talk lately.
049	So I was wondering if you and Hisham would like to join me for a picnic.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
050	Well, I...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
051	Oh, go on Kamui.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
052	Hisham?
053	I don't know what you're so worried about, but this could be good for you.
054	Go take in some outside air and refresh your mind!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0008
055	Yes, you might have a point...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
056	Hisham? Are you not coming?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0025
057	I'm busy reading. Besides, I don't want to get stampeded by a thirsty horse or something.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0011
058	Wh-what?! I'm not—	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
059	Hisham, did you not know that we have no horses in this village?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
060	...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
061	...
062	I'm sorry, but I've already decided to immerse myself in a book today! You two go have fun!
063	Gladly.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0011
