001	Yay! We made it! I'm so tired!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0023
002	We really had our work cut out for us with all of those monsters attacking us. Now that we've made it this far, the rest should be easy from here on out. We just need to get this to the Court Mage.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
003	Then we can divide the Brown Cacao among us so we can all make chocolates together! I'm so excited! Aren't you, Leafah?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
004	Uh, yes! Right! I can't wait to see how I fare when making chocolates!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
005	What's wrong, Leafah?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
006	Oh, um, nothing!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0011
007	Huh?
008	Hey, does something seem a bit...off to you?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
009	Yeah... People keep looking this way. Seems like they're waiting for the right moment or something.
010	Um... Is that Rainbow Cacao? Would you mind giving me some?
011	Hey! That's not fair! I wanted some first!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0013
012	I as well! I know a lot of people that want some!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0003
013	What is going on?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
014	Wait!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
015	Argh... Move!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
016	S-Suzuka? What happened!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
017	Thief! The cacao has been stolen!
018	What did you say! Quick, we have to go after...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
019	Aah! Stop! Don't push! I'm going to be crushed!
020	I can't believe a thief would choose the middle of the day, in the middle of the city nonetheless, to rob us.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
021	Argh! I can't believe I let it get stolen!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
022	No... With that many people surrounding us, it's only natural that we weren't able to react. I couldn't even draw my sword.
023	Itsuki is looking for the culprits now. All we can do is wait. The two of you should go let the Court Mage know what happened.
024	...
025	What is this commotion?	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0005
026	It's Valentine's Day, so the cacao...
027	Another big fuss over Valentine's Day... This makes how many times now?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
028	Rather than making cacao illegal, they should just ban Valentine's Day. I wouldn't mind that one bit.	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0030
029	What?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
030	Please wait one minute! It's true that there was a bit of confusion...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0027
031	But the blame should not be put on Valentine's Day itself...
032	But trouble like this always happens on Valentine's Day, doesn't it? Now we have to deal with muggings?	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0001
033	Just get rid of Valentine's Day altogether!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0029
034	Th-that's not...
035	...
036	(To be fair, if Valentine's Day was banned, a lot of these incidents would most likely decrease since it's the source of all this.)
037	(This isn't something to pin on Valentine's Day, but we also can't ignore that it is the catalyst of the incidents...)
038	(...But is that okay?)
039	You really lucked out, didn't you! Having people understand you through chocolate really is the best method out there!
040	After all, Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known!
041	I...rather enjoy Valentine's Day.
042	No... No. It's not okay.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
043	Leafah?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
044	Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known... I will not let anyone bring it down for everyone else!
045	Leafah!
046	Everyone, please listen!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
047	Just now an incident happened and I understand your worries and concerns. However, it occurred while we were transporting this cacao.
048	In other words, this happened on my watch. I am the one who should be held responsible. This is not because of Valentine's Day.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
049	Valentine's Day is an event where you share your feelings, your future...
050	A wonderful day where you take those feelings that you can't truly express and let them be known through chocolate...
051	I am the one who was unable to protect that! And for that I am truly sorry!
052	I am sorry for causing this! Please accept my apologies!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0035
053	L-Leafah, it isn't only your burden to bear.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
054	No! It is my job as the General to bear the unease and anger of my people!
055	But...
056	It's fine! Fear not, for I am used to apologizing!
057	Also, it'll take a lot more than something like this to destroy my pride as General!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
058	Leafah...
059	Well, when you put it like that... You know...
060	Yeah... It feels almost as if we're picking on a child...	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0004
061	I'm not a child! It's just my face!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1006
062	You're right, this incident has nothing to do with Valentine's and the person who caused it should be blamed.	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0004
063	I'm back!
064	Itsuki! What did you find out?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
065	I got pretty much everything we needed to know. These guys are a strong group of bandits that started up in this area recently.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
066	They usually just target merchant carts, but since the Rainbow Cacao is so valuable, they pulled out all stops to get their hands on it.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
067	Let's go, Leafah. The people won't have peace until these evil-doers are stopped.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
068	Let us restore Valentine's Day with our own hands.
069	All right! Let's go! I will show these bandits the valor of the General of Greed Dike!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
