001	Same time, different route headed to Wadatsumi
002	The Mikaboshi...It's a gigantic Spirit Stone that has the power to destroy this entire world.
003	Are you saying something that frightening is up ahead?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0028
004	Be quiet, Almira.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0014
005	However...nothing like that was told to us during the gathering.
006	You think that everyone will panic if you tell them, right?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
007	We're gonna go take out a rock that can take out the world. Or something like that.
008	Or something like that? Don't be so casual about it. Some of the other Paladins might hear!
009	Who cares. They'll find out soon enough anyway. After all, who wants to die without knowing anything?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0023
010	Well, that's true...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
011	Anyway, since this is the situation, it's quite a hassle that we have to hurry there.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
012	Hey, what are you spacing out for? You're wasting time.
013	What?! Who's fault do you think it is that we're this late!	VO_caida.caida_chara_0011
014	Huh, are you angry? Did I say something that got to you?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
015	Don't make fun of me. The reason why we're having to make up for so much lost time is because of you, right, Captain Othima?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0015
016	We were summoned, but for some reason, you disappeared.
017	Hear, hear! My teacher was looking for you all this time! How hard do you think that was?!
018	I don't know. Since you guys were the one's looking.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
019	That's not what I'm asking about!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
020	Seriously...you've even got my 3rd Regiment involved. Have you no shame?!
021	Seida...
022	Wh-what?
023	I've been around longer than you, so you gotta be more respectful.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
024	Ughh!
025	It's about efficiency. This exchange is the peak of inefficiency!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0017
026	There, there. Let's all calm down. Being upset isn't good for the skin, you know? You'll ruin your good looks.
027	Why are you so calm?! Please hurry up!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0016
028	We don't need to rush. After all, we're only about 30 minutes late, so we should be able to catch up soon enough.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
029	Besides, I've almost invented something amazing. Heheh.
030	What is that invention?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0022
031	It's something important that could sway the fate of this plan.
032	Afterall...I'm acting on direct orders from Captain Zain. It's a super-duper invention.
033	A super-duper invention?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
034	Seriously! Don't interrupt me!
035	Tell that to the monsters. I'll let you talk later, Right now, let's prepare for battle.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
