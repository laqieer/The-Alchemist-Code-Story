001	I see you’ve recovered. Well? The orchestra isn’t so bad, is it?
002	I have to agree!<br>And yet...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
003	Don’t worry about me. I only did what I had to do. And now I’ve come across this great job.
004	I have you to thank for this, too.
005	...
006	I’m sure you’ll also understand one day. The music will teach you, when that time comes.
007	...
008	Ah, such a beautiful sound... I wonder who’s playing?
009	Oh no! It’s almost time for me to meet with Patty and Alaia!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
010	And right about here... I want to set off some cannon fire right when the piece comes to its climax!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0002
011	An awesome melody, with a real signal gun. Doesn’t this song make you feel excited?!
012	I love it! So here I’ll change the type of cannon used to add some variety to the sound.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0009
013	Nice! I’ll be taking that!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0046
014	Hehehe. I’m glad you’re both having fun.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0007
015	What?! Aren’t you having fun, Alaia?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0016
016	I love seeing you two enjoy yourselves.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0010
017	The song ends up being more bright and fun when you two are enjoying yourselves. It seems like this will be another good song. I’m so happy.
018	Bertha will fire blank cartridges in time with the music as the Envylia orchestral band plays. It was just a passing idea...	VO_patty.patty_sys_0031
019	I really didn’t expect everyone to like it so much!
020	The royal knights enjoyed it, too! Patty’s going to compose a new song! I hope all of the citizens like it.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
021	What?! Oh no, look at the time! I gotta go!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
022	What’s wrong?	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0025
023	Today is the temporary assignment ceremony for the royal knighthood training school! I’ll be toast if I’m late!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0018
024	The temporary assignment ceremony... The students have finished their practical training and will set off on their own paths	VO_patty.patty_sys_0005
025	Is that the kind of traditional event the knights hold? Hang on, Bertie, you’re going to be an instructor?!
026	That’s right. This time I’ll make sure I do my best!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
027	This time?	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0005
028	Yeah. I’ve done it a few times before already, but I’m useless. The seniors are always scolding me even during the practical training.
029	Oh, Bertie. I know you don’t like hurting people. Even though they may only be military exercises, don’t you think it’d be difficult to instruct others on how to fight?
030	That’s not the only thing. I also wonder to myself, is there anything I can actually teach?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
031	Look, one day you guys will work and fight together side-by-side.
032	I feel odd “teaching” these comrades of mine...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
033	That’s why I can’t quite get my head around the whole concept of teaching.
034	Bertha, you’re just too nice. But I think that’s exactly why you have plenty you can teach the others!	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0010
035	Thanks for hearing me out. This time I won’t fail! Oh no, I’m gonna be late! Sorry to leave in the middle of things! We’ll pick up where we left off later!
036	Wow. She sure left in a rush. Is she gonna be okay?	VO_patty.patty_sys_0027
037	Hmm, well, a few people have chosen paths outside of the knighthood. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0031
038	Not hurting others, huh? That would be the most ideal option.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0030
039	While I do think the students who chose not to enter the knighthood are happy on their own paths, I think Bertie would be a good instructor.
040	I’m sure it’ll work out for her this time. Oh, but there are a lot of rumors going around about a new student with immense potential...
041	The therian kid from the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan who is said to be the next big talent since the former vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, Nina? They say she has the most potential this year.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0031
042	You’re pretty well informed, Patty.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0044
043	Maybe not of the same race, but similar in stance, at least according to the rumors.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0004
044	I hope Bertie doesn't end up in charge of that kid.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0030
045	Why do you say that?	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0005
046	I heard that she’s a little hard to handle. But I guess that can’t be helped.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0031
047	Same Long-Tail Rabbit Clan as Nina, very capable... I’m sure there’s a lot of pressure behind the expectation that she’ll join the Scarlet Flame Guard.
048	I see. The student seems to have a lot in common with Bertha. There were a lot of expectations for her and her incredible gunnery skills.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0045
049	There are a lot of reasons this kid is drawing attention. I’m a little curious myself. If I remember correctly, her name is...	VO_patty.patty_sys_0004
050	Sorry! I’m late!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0002
051	...
052	You’re late, Bertha! What were you doing?!
053	Sorry! We’re going to play another piece with cannon fire, so I was in a meeting with the orchestral band...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0002
054	Hang on, I’m in charge of this kid?
055	Yes, the new student with talents not seen for years. Teach her well. I won’t accept any of your past failures again.
056	The others have already left the castle. You should hurry up yourself!
057	Eheh, scolded again. I’m Bertha of the Envylia Royal Knighthood artillery regiment!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0011
058	And you are?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
059	...I’m Sharon, a trainee.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
060	Little Sharon! Nice to meet you! You can call me Bertie.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
061	I’d prefer not to. You’re an instructor, aren’t you? I can’t bring myself to refer to you in such a casual manner.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
062	Oh, don’t worry about that. Don’t you think it’s more important that we get to know each other by keeping it casual?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
063	Are you saying that as an instructor? That we should be friendly and not abide by strict hierarchical rules?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
064	Well, not exactly...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0029
065	Good, then. I’m not very good at being friendly.	VO_sharon.sharon_chara_1001
066	I know of a magnificent person who did all that she could to change how people think about battles... All I want to do is follow and even surpass this person.
067	Well, uhm, uhh...I see! So, little Sharon, you...	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
068	Don’t call me “little.” Just “Sharon” is fine.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_1039
069	I don’t believe such nicknames are necessary for training.
070	What?! You don’t even like nicknames?
071	My goal is to finish my training and join the Scarlet Flame Guard. I don’t have time for distractions. Let us please get on with this. Time is of the essence.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
072	The Scarlet Flame Guard? Oh! That tail of yours! Are you part of the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
073	Oh, I see now. Just like Nina! So that’s why you want to join the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0045
074	You’re said to be the most talented student in years. So I’m sure you’ll become a great knight, too!
075	No need to chit-chat. The noise around here is grating on my ears. Let’s go already.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_1039
076	Aww! Tell me more about yourself! We’ve only just met!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
077	...
078	Whaa?! What’s wrong?! And what’s with that huge sword?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
079	You’re my instructor, aren’t you? Then please instruct me. That’s all I need from you.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
080	You come late, and you talk unnecessarily... If this keeps up, I won’t be able to accept you as my instructor.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0040
081	Please fight with me. In doing so, please show me that you have things to teach me.
082	Huh? Wait! That’s so sudden!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
083	I don’t need a response. I need to get stronger!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0032
084	...!
