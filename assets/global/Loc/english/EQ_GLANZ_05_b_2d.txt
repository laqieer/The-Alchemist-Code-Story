001	Gah!	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0023
002	Glizzy!
003	(Urgh! My vision's blurring...!)	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0019
004	You're Glanz, ain'tcha? Take out a big-name like you, and I'll be famous!
005	So you know who I am. I never liked such attention.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
006	But I suppose it was inevitable when I chose to have someone as noisy as you to be my partner.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
007	The hell you talkin' about?
008	Outta the way!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0032
009	Aaaagh!
010	Grraaaargh! Look at me! If you want a fight, fight me!	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0007
011	Agh!
012	Rochelle...! No, stop!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0015
013	Good. That's it! All of you, look at me!
014	Just like that. Target me. Just me!
015	Urrgh...	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0025
016	R-Rochelle... That's enough.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
017	That's enough! Please, get out of here! I can't run anymore.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0014
018	So run away. If you keep this up...
019	Run? Why? I won't run or hide. All I can do is fight.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
020	That's not true. That's not true!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0018
021	It's fine, Glanz... It's all okay. I knew.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
022	I was able to fight the way I wanted because you were with me, Glanz.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0011
023	Helza accepted this black and white bear for how I am. So I was supposed to protect her by keeping the attention to myself.
024	But I failed. I became alone. But then...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0018
025	Glizzy came along. Pillows are important.
026	I had fun being with Glizzy. So I don't mind if this is how it ends.	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0028
027	R-Rochelle...
028	Rochelle... You've gotten yourself so dirty again... You're so messy...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0011
029	You're always causing me such trouble... Aren't you, Rochelle...?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0021
030	...
031	(She's still such a young child... Others her age would still be playing with friends, and yet...I never said anything.)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0018
032	(All I could do for you was be there with you... That was all I could do.)
033	(You had fun? That's my line...)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
034	You're stained red... Oh, Rochelle... Let's clean you up. What bath item do you want to—	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0021
035	You know, Rochelle? I wanted to cleanse this world. I wanted to rid this world of the filth that clings to it.
036	But I found something in this world more important than that wish to cleanse. I've become one of the stains on this world.
037	Then let's make a mess together. It'll be fun with Glizzy.
038	Ha. Yes, perhaps it will be.
039	If you and I are just more of this world's filth, then I don't see why we can't mess it up as we please.
040	No matter how dirty you get, a bath will wash you clean.
041	Glizzy, is this another one of your bath items? How do you use it?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
042	Oh that? You make it float like this and... See? Flower petals.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
043	Oooohh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0024
044	So pretty!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0024
045	Glizzy! Glizzy, this one! What does this one do?!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
046	H-hey! Don't splash around so much! Look, you take this, and...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
