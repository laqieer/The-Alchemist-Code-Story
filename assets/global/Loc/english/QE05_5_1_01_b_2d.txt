001	Ugh!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
002	This seems to be the end for you, Protector.
003	The great tree's blessing has given you vigor rivaling that of phantoms.
004	But...! The price of such a blessing is your dependence on the earth's Alchemia to maintain your physical form!
005	The royal capital is now within my gut! Your precious source of life cannot be found here!
006	I see. So you've taken measures against my powers.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
007	All of this was a trap.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
008	Hahaha! It is too late for you now!
009	Now die! This barren royal capital will be your grave!
010	I beseech the supreme...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0032
011	Ha! You're wasting your—
012	Provide me a path in the valley between space and time.
013	Hm? What is this light?
014	He's...gone? How?! This land is within me! There's nowhere for him to go!
015	Arrggh! Where are you, Protector?!
016	It pays to plan for contingencies.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
017	Ngh! Gah!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
018	I figured I could replicate the dimensional transportation I once saw a hundred years ago, but... It seems to disagree with me.
019	Such nauseating recoil for such a short distance traveled.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
020	I won't be able to use it again, but this should buy me some time.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
021	The once majestic royal capital, Eos, is now a Jam nest...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0022
022	Well, there's no time to be feeling sentimental. I must escape and find my way back to everybody.
023	Logi, Tina... I hope they made it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
