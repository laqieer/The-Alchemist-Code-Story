001	Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
002	Argh! Ow!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0043
003	Hrgh!	VO_annika.annika_battle_0007
004	Gurrggghhhh...
005	Margaret! Are you all right? I warned you about being reckless.
006	What was I supposed to do?! My mushroom—	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
007	Graarrrrgggghhhh!
008	Tch! There's more of them.	VO_annika.annika_battle_0019
009	Annika! You're bleeding!
010	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
011	Graaarrrrrrr...
012	They are calling their brethren for help.
013	Nngh... This is bad.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0020
014	I'm so sorry, Annika. I got you into this mess. Don't worry about me! You should run!
015	I will not! I am staying right here.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0014
016	If you don't, then we're both just gonna end up being dinner for these beasts!
017	Be that as it may, I am not going anywhere. I will not abandon you here!
018	Wh-why? We only just met, Annika... How can you even think of putting your life on the line for me?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
019	You are the first person to tell me that I am fine the way I am! I appreciate that more than you know.
020	That is why... I will protect you!	VO_annika.annika_sys_0032
021	Creatures of bad energy, I command you! Scatter! Let us be!	VO_annika.annika_battle_0014
022	Grurrgghhh!
023	They're all...gone.
024	We should be fine now. Nngh... I am a tad sore.	VO_annika.annika_battle_0025
025	Annika! Are you okay?! I'm... I'm so sorry!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
026	Remember what I told you? You must take care. If not for yourself, then for her. Lizzy... She is important to you, is she not?
027	She is. She really is. I... I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble. Unnghh...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0035
028	No more tears. You understand, and that is good enough. Now, let me have a look at your wounds. I will heal you.
029	There we go. You should be fine. All that's left is to retrieve the mushrooms, and then we can head back.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0037
030	Yay!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
031	I sense that fair weather will follow you on your journey home. Take care, and you ought to arrive safely in Envylia.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0003
032	I'll be careful. Thank you, Annika. You've helped me so much!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0037
033	It was my pleasure.	VO_annika.annika_battle_1030
034	You say that, but I can't stand being in someone's debt. No good merchant is, you know? I need to do something for you!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
035	I want no recompense. I ask only that, should you ever find yourself in Saga again, you come and visit me.
036	Does that mean...you want us to be friends?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
037	Friends...? What does this mean?	VO_annika.annika_sys_0031
038	Friends are people who, well... They do things like talk and drink tea together, and sometimes go for walks in each other's company.
039	That sounds wonderful! When next you visit, let's go on a nighttime stroll together!	VO_annika.annika_sys_0024
040	Hee hee. Roger that! Well, I'd better get going. See you!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0024
041	Goodbye for now! I know that we will see each other again someday. I look forward to it!	VO_annika.annika_sys_0008
