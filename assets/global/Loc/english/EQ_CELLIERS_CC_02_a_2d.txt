001	It's about time for Mielikki to come over. The tea and cookies are all set...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
002	Oh, she's here!
003	Hello there. You're Celliers, yes?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0034
004	Huh? Wh-who are you?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
005	Oh, my apologies. I forgot to introduce myself. I am Flamel, a Court Mage.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
006	A Court Mage...
007	Oh, Celliers, my adorable little laboratory rat.
008	...!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
009	...What does a Court Mage want with me? I have no business with you lot.
010	What? Um, do calm down. I'm simply—	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
011	Howdy-do, Celliers! ...Oh, who is this?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0003
012	Mielikki...
013	Come on, man, you can't leave a guest waiting in the entryway!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
014	Oh!
015	Yes... Yes, you're right. I should at least hear him out... Sorry, Mielikki.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
016	Eh heh heh. As long as you get it, it's cool!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
017	So you are... Mielikki, is it?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0003
018	You know me, do you?
019	Why yes. Your uncle, your elder sister, both Court Mages, yes? I've made their acquaintance on multiple occasions...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
020	Oh, you have a sister, Mielikki? I had no idea. And he said "uncle," but you say "father"...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
021	That's right, you haven't met either of them, have you, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
022	Pops and Sis are both Court Mages. That keeps them too busy to come see me, though.
023	Sis is amazing! And I call him Pops, but he's actually my mom's little brother.
024	Still, he raised me like his own daughter, and that's a fact!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
025	I see...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0045
026	If you're friends with Pops and Sis, you must be a good guy!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0045
027	Come on, you should join the two of us. I brought some tasty sweets Mom made for me.
028	Hey Celliers, help me set everything out, will you?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
029	S-sure, will do.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
030	(Celliers' progressed crystallization has been undone. Could it be...?)
031	...And thus, I've come to check on your condition, on Michael's behest.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0031
032	Is that right! That old fart's nicer than he looks!
033	Still, why so sudden, don't you think? He said he wouldn't help too much, since I want to be self-sufficient.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
034	Indeed, he did say as much. Even so, something seems to be amiss.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
035	Something's amiss?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
036	Have you observed any...suspicious characters about?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0001
037	Suspicious characters...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
038	(No, that was just a customer. Wouldn't be right to cast suspicion on him outright...)
039	...Sorry, can't really say. Customers come from all over these days, so a lot more boots cross my threshold these days.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0003
040	Oh yeah, Celliers' crystals are a huge hit!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
041	I see. A huge hit, you say...
042	...Is something strange about that?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
043	The truth is...rumors have been circulating as of late: that Celliers' crystals have the power to remove curses.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
044	What?!
045	Were the tales to end there. But it seems some dubious dealings are afoot, in search of your crystals.
046	That's why Michael asked me to check in on you. If this is but a false alarm, then fine by me.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
047	Still, to plug away at your trade in a new place, only to have undue trouble hinder your efforts, well. Dreadful, if you ask me.
048	Wow, you came all this way, just for me? Th-thank you very much...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0045
049	Ahaha, don't mention it. This is a welcome respite, one I'm more than happy to indulge.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
050	The sun is shining, the weather is warm. Unheard of back home—it snows constantly, you see.
051	You don't say? We barely get any sort of snowfall here, perfect for growing flowers—
052	...AHHH!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0028
053	What?! Wha-what is it, Mielikki?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0026
054	Flowers! Growing! I forgot to water my flower bed!
055	Flower bed? You mean that sizeable patch outside?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
056	Yeah, I'd better hurry on over! Poor babies, this gorgeous weather's wasted on them!
057	W-wait, Mielikki, I'll come help! We'll pick this up later, Flamel.
058	Whew... Oh thank goodness, all my darlings got the water they needed. Thanks for the assist, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0030
059	Sure, I'm just glad we made it in time, and—oh?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
060	Are you Celliers?
061	Um, yes I am. And you are...?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0005
062	!!
063	Come with us. Your crystals are required to protect us from curses.
