001	This medicine will heal those in this country suffering from Demon's Blood. I place this in your hands!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0041
002	All right then.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
003	Well then, I will go now. You be careful out there!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0033
004	Ah!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
005	... ...
006	Wadatsumi is a country with a lot greenery, flowing rivers, and scenic views!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
007	By the way, are you planning on walking all night? That being said, I don't really like the prospect of sleeping out here.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
008	Well, I'm something of a night owl. I'm used to walking at night.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
009	...Hey.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
010	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
011	Don't 'what's the matter?' me!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0016
012	Earlier, I asked you to spread the medicine I gave you to cure Demon's Blood!
013	Yeah, I know. Leave it to me! I'll spread it well!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
014	Then why are you following me?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
015	Well, all things considered...this is my first time in Wadatsumi.	VO_aqil.aqil_event_1004
016	I don't know where anything is.
017	Besides, you know, didn't you just warn me about getting attacked again?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
018	You're strong and, if we're together, it just feels more reassuring.
019	That may be the case, but...for starters, why are you alone?	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
020	Well, I like being a merchant traveling wherever I please.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
021	Sigh... Anyway, do as you please.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
022	Really?! Ah, thanks! That's right. I still haven’t asked for your name yet. My name is Arkil!	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
023	...I'm Jin.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
024	Mr. Jin, huh? Nice to meet you! By the way, Mr. Jin, I wanna ask you one thing...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
025	Just call me Jin, Arkil.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
026	All right, Jin. That Demon's Blood you were talking about...what kind of sickness is it?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
027	Would you know of it by its other name: Ogre Fever?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
028	Ogre Fever...you mean the one where you get an abnormally high fever for an extensive period of time?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
029	That's the one. With the aforementioned invasion, it was brought into this country.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
030	Right now it is referred to as Demon's Blood and it is spreading!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
031	But Ogre Fever isn't that dangerous of a sickness, you know? I had it too when I was little.	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
032	There should be a specific medicine you can take.
033	In other countries they have it...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
034	Then you could just import it?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
035	It's not that easy. Wadatsumi has been destroyed.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
036	There's no way of any engaging in any reasonable trade with other counties when we are now under the jurisdiction of Greed Dike.
037	Besides...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
038	It's a sickness that we never had in this country. Its existence wasn't even known. Right now they call it the "incurable disease."
039	Having gone abroad, within my travels I learned that Demon's Blood was not an incurable disease.
040	That's why I studied it and received some of this invaluable medicine.
041	And, not wanting to rely on outside resources, I tried to make it using ingredients found here in Wadatsumi.
042	That's a noble endeavor. Much respect to you.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
043	There's nothing noble about it.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0050
044	No, I think it's noble. Oh, there's one thing I'm curious about...	VO_aqil.aqil_event_1004
045	You said just now, "Having gone abroad and in my travels," didn't you?
046	It didn't sound like you went to study medicine, so why did you leave the country?
047	I had my reasons... Why do you ask?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1003
048	No, just curious.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
049	For someone who makes medicine, you struck a skillful pose while fighting out there earlier.
050	To be accurate, making medicine isn't my profession...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
051	Yeah? Then...	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
052	For a merchant, you're also very accustomed to fighting.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
053	Yeah. Well, when you're a traveling merchant you encounter a lot of dangers on the road.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_1014
054	You learn to fight.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0010
055	I see. Well, we both seem to have our own agendas.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
056	It appears so...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0006
057	Hey, wait. Can you sense something...?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
058	Hm? Is it coming from over there...?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
059	Let's go!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
060	Agyaahhhh!!!	VO_Mmandragora.Mmandragora_battle_0028_a
061	What is that?!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0026
062	Is it one of this country's monsters?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
063	Huff...huff...huff...! Uck...	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0022
064	Yo...mi...?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
065	...?! Yomi...?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_1049
066	Oh...nothing! That's my sister's name. It just sounded similar.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0047
067	More importantly, she's hurt. Aren't we gonna help her?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0003
068	Of course, we are!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
