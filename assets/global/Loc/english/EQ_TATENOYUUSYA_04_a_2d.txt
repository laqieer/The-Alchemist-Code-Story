001	Nothing to harvest here, huh? Guess it's time to move on...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
002	Naofumi!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
003	Melty!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0025
004	Excuse me, Naofumi! Why did you call me a "pompous girl"?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0012
005	I appreciate you trying to look for me, but don't describe me in such strange ways!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
006	Geez... That's how you're greeting me after not seeing me for so long? I've been worried and looking all over for you...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0030
007	Oh...
008	Th-thank you... I'm glad that you're okay...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0033
009	Anyway, more importantly...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
010	Are you the Phantom Soldiers that the kid who was speaking strangely was talking about?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
011	Huh?! You know about them, Naofumi?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
012	Yeah...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
013	...So, what do I need to do?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
014	An entanglement has formed between this world and yours, and one of the Waves that causes calamities in your world has made their way into ours.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0004
015	We ask for your help in suppressing it. The Wave is an unprecedented disaster to our world. It will cause exponential damage if left unchecked.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
016	We won't be able to get rid of the Wave without the help of the Heroes. That is why I called you here. You are one of the heroes who fights against the Waves, correct?
017	Well, yes...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
018	I have also called your companions here to fight at your side. You have all been summoned to different locations... I ask that you reconvene with them and get rid of the Wave.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
019	I vow to safely return you all home once the Wave has been suppressed.
020	(Why does everyone summon me to places without realizing how much of an inconvenience it is for me...)	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0027
021	If you need a Hero, you could've summoned any of the other three instead. Why did you pick me?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
022	I don't know why you had to summon the most hated hero... Makes me feel like you're up to something.
023	I was completely unaware of the circumstances of your world... I merely observed your world to see who was successful in their fights with the Waves and called them here.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0002
024	They just happened to be you and your companions.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0016
025	...
026	However, you must feel somewhat bereft without your companions. I shall have a Phantom Soldier accompany you as reinforcement.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
027	There's no need for that.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
028	What?
029	All I have to do is get rid of the Wave, right? Just let me take care of it the way I want to.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
030	I can't trust you or those Phantom Soldiers... There's no way I'll be able to team up with people I can't fully depend on.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0010
031	Hmph... As you wish.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
032	What is it now?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
033	Hm? Are those the monsters from the other world? They're all grouping together in an unusual manner... Hm.
034	So that's why we were sent to fight that huge mob of Balloons... Talk about working us to the bone...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
035	That means we'll be able to return to our world if we suppress the Wave!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
036	Yeah, if we believe what that woman was saying.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
037	Thank goodness!
038	In that case, we should look for Raphtalia and Filo right away so that we can prepare for our battle against the Wave!
039	Let's work together to overcome this world's Wave! How about it, everyone?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0007
040	Yes, I'm ready.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
041	I'll have to pass...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
042	What? Why?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
043	I don't mind dealing with the Wave, since it's supposed to be my job as a Hero, no matter how much people despise me.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
044	But I'm not about to start fighting together with people I barely even know. Who knows when they'll stab me in the back?
045	These people won't betray us! I truly believe that they just want to protect their home...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0012
046	They even saved me from the Balloons. They've been nothing but kind to me... I know that they're not bad people!
047	I wonder...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
048	Those who only pretend to befriend others in order to get close to them are worse than trash. Just like how that sister of yours flung those false accusations on me.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0010
049	M-my sister has nothing to do with our current situation! Why are you always so hardheaded?! Do you not believe me?!
050	That's not what I... Ah!
051	Eeek...	VO_melty.melty_battle_0019
052	There's more of these things?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
053	Tch... Here they come!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0027
