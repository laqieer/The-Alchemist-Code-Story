001	Whoaaa! Huff...huff... That dream again.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0026
002	Sir Dias, Lord Gabirond has summoned you. Please come to the Holy Chamber.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
003	Yea. I'll go right now.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
004	There you are, Dias. It's about time you've grown accustomed to being a Paladin, is it not?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
005	Enough of your hollow greetings. Tell me what you want.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
006	Hmm. Very well. It's regarding the Sacred Stones...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
007	Excuse me! Lord Gabirond, we've received a request for reinforcements from the troops you sent to Wratharis.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
008	Such trivial events again. I told you to ignore them, didn't I?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0030
009	However...at this rate, the peace will continue to deteriorate!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
010	Did you not hear my voice?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
011	M-my apologies...
012	Wait. Regarding reinforcements, I will go.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
013	What are you saying, Dias? Don't tell me you've already grown homesick for your country.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0016
014	Say what you want. I will act on my own will.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
015	Very well then. However, try to clean things up within four or five days.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
016	Three days is plenty.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
017	Well, he seems surprisingly enthusiastic. I guess the necessary shackles must be found for the difficult tools...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
018	I never expected to return here in this way.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
019	Huh...Dias? What's he doing here...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
020	Apparently, he's the "hero" that struck down traitor Zeke. Ultimately, he's nothing more than an ungrateful kin-slayer. He's not worthy of bearing the name of a Paladin...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
021	Are you the Peacekeepers? Where are the bandits?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
022	Who knows? We're having a hard time finding them ourselves. After all, they're quite skilled at hiding.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
023	The people of Wratharis like to attack when their opponent is turned the other way. I guess they excel at cowardice.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
024	... ...
025	What? Did I upset you? But you're from Envylia, aren't you? What do you have to be upset about?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
026	(I see. It seems like word has spread that I was born in Wratharis.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
027	I'll search for the bandits myself. You spend your time doing as you please. I have no intention of giving you orders.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0038
028	What's with his attitude? After all, he's originally nothing more than a lowlife.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
029	Help! The bandits have appeared in the neighboring village! Hurry, please!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
030	Argh... Those Wratharis rats!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
031	The Peacekeepers...it appears the bandits are on the move.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
