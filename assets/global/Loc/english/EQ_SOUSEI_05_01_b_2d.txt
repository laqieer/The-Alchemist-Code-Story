001	Phew...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
002	Daphne, you did it! We—	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0008
003	No! Lady Nicaea!
004	Huh? Eeeek!
005	Ack!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
006	Huh?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
007	Hmph! Seriously, what did I do to get dealt such bad luck.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
008	Lady Nicaea! Are you alright?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
009	Y-yes, I am. Excuse me, sir? You saved my life, but I can't express my proper gratitude without knowing your name.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0018
010	(Darn, I jumped out without thinking! It's way too soon for me to get discovered!)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
011	My name? Who cares? What about those things?
012	You were calling them "leftovers" before. So whose leftovers are we dealing with here, exactly?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
013	Oh no! The ship is shaking!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
014	Brzzii! Brziiiiii!
015	Lady Nicaea, behind us! The real deal has arrived!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
016	...Ngh!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0027
017	GRRRRRRR
018	GROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0001
019	Eek!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0028
020	Lady Nicaea! Hold onto Selsieg!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
021	Bwriip!
022	Th-thank you, Selsieg.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0033
023	I can't believe a Cursed Beast showed up this close to the ship...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0021
024	(And just while we were transporting the princess too!)
025	(It's so close... At this rate the ship won't be fast enough to escape! We won't be able to—)	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0031
026	Daphne!
027	Lady Nicaea?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
028	Here, you can ride Selsieg. This is the time to show us what you can do with the Silver Shield!
029	B-but...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
030	You can do it, I know you can. You have all the skills to match that shield of yours.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
031	I...!
032	(I can't do this, I really can't! But if I don't do something then the princess and all of the shield regimen will... I-I must do this!)	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0012
033	Understood. Let's go, Selsieg!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
034	Bwrii!
035	Deep breaths... I just need to calm down...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
036	I-it'll be fine... I've just got to believe... It'll be just like in practice!
037	(The only way to change our fates is by borrowing the power of the Silver Shield... So I can't fail here!)
038	"People of Invidia, lend me your strength!" P-please!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0040
039	Grooooooooooaagh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
040	...Ngh!
041	(No... It's no good... Why can't I draw the magil from the shield?!)	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0020
042	Is this...the end?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0027
043	Grrrooooooaarrhh?!
044	...Huh?
045	In the nick of time! Valley of Siddim, all outputs stable! Oi, you guys down there! Move back or you'll be caught in the blast zone!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
046	"I embrace the supreme..."
047	"This world is covered in sin and sinners, yet we embrace virtue and temporarily release the pain."	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
048	...Wow.
049	This light, I've never seen anything like it.
050	A brilliant beam of light that appeared to cut through the raging winds, surging waves, and even a Cursed Beast.
051	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhh?!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0020
052	The Leviathan is...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0021
053	It withdrew?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0025
054	Lady Nicaea! Are you alright?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
055	Ah, I am fine. More importantly, are all the knights okay?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0037
056	Yes, Your Highness! We were jostled by the waves, but there's no major injuries!
057	Good, then we must make haste! Attend to Daphne and Selsieg, and get us out of here!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0002
058	Understood! Anybody with light wounds or idle hands is to help Vice-Captain Daphne! Move, move!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
059	But whatever was that strange light that so suddenly came from the skies above? And moreover—	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
060	What happened to that stranger who rescued me before? I cannot spot him anywhere.
061	Phew... That was quite the fright. Out of all the ships in the world, a Cursed Beast just had to attack the ship I was stowed away on.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0022
062	But that reminds me of that one rumor... That must be the air ship with the power to defeat Cursed Beasts.
063	If that thing works as well as I hope it does, it could be rather useful... I guess I'll just have to see what happens next.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
