001	Your Highness!	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
002	Marie! You're all right! Thank goodness!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0007
003	Ahem. Um... Should we give you two some privacy?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0024
004	Aha...haha...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
005	Uh...	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
006	Oh! I do apologize. I did not mean to let my emotions get the better of me.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0035
007	I bid you all welcome. You are guests here. I am only sorry that we cannot offer you better accommodations.
008	No, no, this is just what we needed. I had no idea that a fortress like this was up here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
009	Ah, yes. Even I was surprised to find out about this place. It was built over a hundred years ago, but it still stands strong. It will make a good stronghold.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0037
010	The general who built this place was very shrewd indeed. I seem to have forgotten his name, however...
011	In any case, allow me to give you a tour. Please do feel free to stay here as long as you like, to recover from your journey.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0007
012	Thank you very much.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0034
013	Huh? What was that just now?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
014	Mocca? What is it?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
015	I'm not sure... I guess I'm just imagining things.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
016	We're entering the city! The main road is open!
017	Onward! There is no time! We must reach the main force heading into the Desert Zone before their orders arrive!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_battle_0010
018	This is...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
019	What is it, Kamui?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
020	It's midday, during peak market season. I would have expected there to be more people here.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
021	Is it not a result of His Highness' name being used to aggressively conscript soldiers?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
022	Even so, it is strange that there are so few people here... Perhaps they were evacuated beforehand, or—?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
023	Ah!
024	Look out!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
025	Hmph.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0001
026	Aaarrghhh!
027	An ambush?! It seems they've figured out you're here, Kamui. All troops, beware of hidden enemy soldiers!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0042
028	They may be hiding around corners, or in the buildings, lying ready beneath the windows!
029	...
030	I feel uneasy about this.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
