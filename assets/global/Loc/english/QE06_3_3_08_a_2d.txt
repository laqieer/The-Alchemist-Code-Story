001	So, you were sealed as well.
002	And quite the nuisance it was. Are your memories beginning to come back to you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
003	No, they remain shrouded. But that's not a problem.
004	I will destroy the humans. They are the ones who took from me what I sought to protect.
005	That is, assuming what you say is true.
006	I have spoken no lie. Everything I've said to you makes sense, no? You needn't doubt me. I would never deign to put you in harm's way.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
007	Unlike the humans...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
008	...
009	With the obstacle that was the Blade Fox now undone, no one remains to stand in our way. We have the luxury of time.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
010	So you needn't push yourself to remember everything now. Once the humans have been completely annihilated, Wadatsumi will be ours.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
011	Right.
012	Heh...haha...hahahaha! How absolutely wonderful! My dream draws ever closer!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
013	But I must examine that body of Tamba's a bit more closely. It may hold the power I seek.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
014	If so, I shall take it for my own. Now that there is no one left who can use that bothersome Kagutsuchi technique, the road ahead is clear of all opposition.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
015	Even the whims of Judius and Greed Dike need no longer be tolerated.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
016	The last laugh...will be mine!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
017	Ah...nnh...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
018	Ngh... Ow!<br>Huh?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
019	Oh, right... We were...
020	Could I be the...only survivor?
021	...
022	Amane?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
023	Azami?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
024	Oh, thank goodness! I'm so happy to see you!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0009
025	Wh-wh-whoa, stop! That hurts! Mind the wounds, please!
026	S-sorry...	VO_azami.azami_sys_0036
027	I'm quite relieved to see you too, Azami. I'd begun to suspect the worst. What...of the others?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
028	Only a handful of soldiers survived the onslaught. And Captain Ugachi still hasn't regained consciousness.
029	So...
030	We failed. We lost.
031	...
032	Which is why I entrust this resolve of mine, woven throughout time immemorial, to you.
033	No. It's not over yet.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
034	Huh?
035	I've been entrusted with something important, and I'm not about to let that trust be dashed.
036	But—
037	If we say we've lost, then we've given up. We've given up on Wadatsumi, on the Blade Fox, and on the bonds we've built together all this time.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
038	...!
039	If we give up now, we'll never be able to enjoy a meal together like before. We'll never be able to laugh and poke fun like before. Are you really prepared to accept that?
040	I...
041	Because I'm not.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
042	...
043	Didn't we take an oath? We said that with our blades, we'd clear the way for Wadatsumi's future.
044	So I won't give up!
045	What do you intend to do, then?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
046	I'm going to track them down.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
047	What?! That'll just get you killed! Why would you even consider something so foolish?!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
048	I see nothing foolish about this. It is a reasonable course of action, given the circumstances. Let us consider each matter in turn:	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
049	One, I don't believe Captain Tanosuke's consciousness has been completely overtaken. We must somehow bring him back.
050	Two, Celis' death remains unconfirmed, so it is in our best interests—on multiple levels—to locate her whereabouts.
051	And three, I believe it is imperative we re-establish the Blade Fox Corps. These are the points we need to address, and the first two are why I must follow the Discarnate Power's trail.
052	Amane...
053	Will you try to stop me? I'll do it by myself, if need be. But I'm going to do it, either way.
054	...You promised me. You promised me you wouldn't do anything stupid.
055	And I'm not! If we just stand around, we're going to lose literally everything!
056	So I, for one, won't just stand around. I'm going, and that's that!
057	And that's exactly what I mean! You're not going anywhere by yourself! That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0003
058	What...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
059	I'm going too.
068	What self-respecting big sister would just sit back and watch her little sister go off to fight a hopeless battle on her own?! Honestly!
060	Yeah. I suppose you do have a point.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
061	If either one of us were to give up now, we'd be putting the people of Wadatsumi in imminent, catastrophic danger. And on top of that...
062	We'd never be able to laugh, poke fun, and eat dinner together again. Like you said.
063	Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.
064	There we go! That's the spirit! And on that note, I think the first order of business...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
065	...is to get some food in us.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
066	At least. And get cleaned up, while we're at it. You are looking a bit worse for wear, after all.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0030
067	Look who's talking.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0008
