001	Blair, it's coming from over there!
002	Got it!
003	With the erratically beeping device in hand, Blair frantically searches for the source of the disturbance.
004	(Not subterranean...but where else could it have come from? Unless...)
005	(Aha.)
006	Despite its careful camouflage, a small object catches her eye.
007	(This...is a signalling device. Its main purpose is to mimic frequencies...like the ones we could be searching for!)
008	Soren, we've been set u-
009	...!
010	Blair turns, and finds herself face to face with the barrel of a silenced pistol.
011	Not bad, but too little and too late.
012	Blair!
013	Make another move and she's a goner.
014	...
015	Your little diversion on the ground wasn't unexpected, but at least you tried.
016	Now, you're coming with me.
017	No.
018	*SNARL*
019	Wh-
020	Agh!
021	Ugh!
022	That's quite enough, Astaroth.
023	At least the boy's unmangled.
024	Thought I'd fed you already...
025	GRRSSNRRRK.
026	Grimm kneels by the incapacitated bodies of his targets, and begins hauling them deeper into the depths of the cavern.
027	Meanwhile, at Minerva's residence...
028	(They're certainly taking a while. I can understand Siegfried and Emrys having to take the scenic route, but as for the other two...)
029	...
030	Is something the matter, little one?
031	Big Bro and Smart Sis...
032	Eira think...something happened.
033	(So it isn't just me. Intuition, I suppose.)
034	(Were we too naive in making our moves, or have we underestimated Goetia...?)
