001	Voda, what was that power just now?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
002	That was my Ouija. We poured all the power remaining in our Matter into Tamis and left the physical manifestations in our temples.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
003	We are no longer bound to our Matter, which leaves us free to use every ounce of our true power.
004	Where's Tamis?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
005	Worry not. She is safe, even after receiving the full brunt of the power from each of our Matter.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
006	Tamis is at the Wind Temple, offering prayer. She is in the midst of the Ritual of Perpetual Time. Soon, the Wind Matter will be restored.
007	It's all flowing into me—such power and knowledge! I can see it—the entire history of Saga!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0009
008	I must protect Saga at all costs. We cannot be the ones to let this age-old tradition of passing down the history of Saga end. Isn't that right, Mocca?!
009	Water nourishes...fire heats...earth creates...and wind carries all that is created from the other elements.
010	I finally understand! You're telling me this is the hidden meaning behind the history of Saga, aren't you?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0022
011	Wind Matter, now is the time of your revival. Alia, please grant me strength!
012	I see. That's a relief!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
013	Yet, why would a dragon breathe water?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
014	Wait, maybe that's it!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
015	Not only did we fail to destroy its core, but now it has changed elements... What's going on? Tehre, have you any idea?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
016	No. This is beyond my reasoning. However, I may have figured out a way to destroy it...but we will need to do it ourselves.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
017	What do you mean by that?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
018	It is the same as when I had to face my own shadow in the Trial to acquire one of Asena's Tears. The dragon exhibits qualities of fire, water, earth, and wind.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
019	We need to wield the same element it is attuned with to destroy its core, as is often the case during the Trials.
020	Could it be that Asena foresaw this, and thus included such requirements in granting her tears to those of us capable of ascending to the rank of Sprite?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
021	Where is Georgios?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
022	...
023	I see. Is he no longer of this world?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
024	He died shielding me from the dragon. We swore to him that we would retrieve Beelzebub!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
025	Glurrrppp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_b
026	Now its chest is glowing? What's going on?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0026
027	They...look like humans!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0021
028	How irritating! Things continue to spiral outside of my calculations!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
029	Georgios... I will accomplish your life's mission for you, just as I promised you I would!
