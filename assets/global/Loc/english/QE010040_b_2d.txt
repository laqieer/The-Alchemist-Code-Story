001	Aghhh! Wh-what's with this guy's strength?!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0027
002	He's been transmuted by the power of darkness! You're no match for him!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0027
003	No! My power is stronger! My will is so much stronger!
004	I won't let something like that happen again!
005	I won't let that tragedy be in vain. With my own two hands, I must protect Agatha!
006	Tragedy...?
007	Wait! He's coming!
008	Ssshhh... Hohhh...!	VO_Kurokishi.Kurokishi_battle_0028_a
009	I won't be beaten! I can't afford to die here!
010	I need to find that man! Until then...! Huzzah!!!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
011	What?! What strength...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0025
012	This emotion that Dias supports himself with...!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0027
013	Huff...huff... Die. You cannot stop me.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
014	Lizard Brigade! Stop! Surrender! You lack the strength to fight us.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0015
015	What are you saying?! There's no place for sympathy!
016	...!
017	Their growing resentment will inevitably give birth to a more formidable enemy!
018	If we let them escape, it will only allow tragedy to repeat itself!
019	Discard sympathy! Massacre them all!
020	Please wait, Lord Gabirond!
021	Most likely, it's Dias's desire for revenge that motivates him. If you allow this to escalate...	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0002
022	No.. His fury motivates and provides him with a raging power. There's no problem with that.
023	Wait... Are you trying to tell me that you're taking advantage of his underlying impulses?	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0027
024	This cycle of hatred must be severed completely!
025	Innocent people will be the ones that'll pay the price! Do you think it's possible to change the world while the seeds of hatred still exist?!
026	...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
027	Do it, Dias! The chain of hatred must be severed completely!
028	Do you plan to belittle the sacrifice of innocent people?! Right now is the time to pluck the buds of rebellion! Do it!!!
029	I will not allow the same tragedy to repeat itself!
030	With my own hands, I'm going to change this world filled with sorrow, even if I have to turn my back on the gods!
031	Huzzah!!!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
032	!!!
033	I... I...!
