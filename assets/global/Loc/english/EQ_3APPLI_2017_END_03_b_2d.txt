001	Uzushiomaru...lost?
002	What a relief. We got back the Sun Keys she took as well!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
003	Impossible!
004	My plan...my perfect plan to engulf every world in darkness...how can it fail here?!
005	Kayako...you've lost. I'll commend you on your determination...you even went so far as to revive yourself from the underworld, but...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
006	Justice will always win...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
007	And, as soon as Amaterasu wasn't on her own, you didn't stand a chance!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
008	Arghh! Don't underestimate me! I'm still not finished yet! I still have my negative energy...
009	We'll eliminate it with the power of these keys!
010	A dazzling light emits from the Sun Keys brought here from the future. They engulf Kayako completely.
011	Ahhhh?! It's so bright...my body is disappearing!!!
012	You're a spirit of negative energy resurrected from the underworld... Of course, this is the effect it'll have on you.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
013	Impossible! I'm...fading?! My will...everything! It's disappearing into the light...
014	Whether it be in darkness or in light...I pray that you will no longer suffer anymore.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
015	Noooo...ahhhh...!!!
016	It's over, I think. Finally...everyone is still safe.
017	Ohhhh...Amaterasu!!! You're alive! I'm so happy!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
018	U-uh...um...thank you...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
019	I'm sure that pirate sent you all here to help me when my own strength wasn't enough to protect the sun.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
020	Yes, this Golden Compass is what led us here.
021	With these words, the Compass is held up so that Amaterasu can see it.
022	Amaterasu also removes her own Compass and grasps it tightly.
023	Thank you. I guess that means that I have to continue working hard from now on.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0018
024	No, I doubt that's the only reason why the pirate gave that Compass to you.
025	After all, that Compass leads to the Twilight Zone.
026	If you were to always remain here, it wouldn't be necessary, right?
027	...!!!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
028	Do you mean that...he gave it to me for when I want to leave the Twilight Zone?
029	If you're always alone, Amaterasu...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0037
030	Then it might be difficult to leave here, but what if you had friends that you could rely on?
031	I can...go on adventures?!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
032	The pirate must have given the Compass to you for when that time came. What a romantic.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
033	Well, let's talk all about that later.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
034	For now, I want to get some rest.
035	Yes...now that everything is okay, I suddenly feel really tired.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
036	Tr-true...I'm exhausted...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
037	Sorry, Amaterasu...
038	I don't think the Twilight Zone is supposed to be used for this...but can we rest here a little?
039	Hmm. Well, I don't see why not.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0031
040	In exchange, can you tell me all about yourselves?
041	I'm not completely sure yet if you're friends that I can sincerely trust...
042	In order to help facilitate that, I want to know more about you.
043	Yuri, wasn't it? You said that it starts from choosing to believe...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_1047
044	Yes! I did!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0038
045	All right, how about we start with introductions then?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
046	Okay, I'll go first!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
047	Let me introduce myself again. I'm Amaterasu. Thank you all for coming here!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
048	Amaterasu says this with a slightly shy smile.
049	Thus, the sun goddess became a pirate and set out to explore the outside world.
050	They actually pulled it off.
051	According to my calculations, there was a much higher chance of failure...
052	Well, that's understandable. It just means they managed to work their way around it.
053	We should celebrate their accomplishment. It really is quite impressive.
054	A few days later...
055	Cheers!!!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0009
056	The five of them clink their glasses together.
057	Gulp, gulp, gulp...ahhh! The best! Summer is the best!!!
058	Seeing her like this...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
059	It makes you realize that, even if the world is different, Amaterasu's nature remains the same.
060	Amaterasu...I'm surprised you like alcohol so much.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0044
061	Yes, it's hard to imagine that you worked so hard at the cost of making friends.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
062	Whoo! My wish has finally come true! I wanted to drink with my friends like this...underneath the blazing sun!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
063	Just like she says, the sun is high in the clear sky.
064	All the black clouds covering each world disappear, and a warm and dazzling glow fills the land.
065	The long eclipse is finally over.
066	So all of you voyaged on a pirate ship together? So jealous! Is alcohol the most appropriate thing when it comes to pirates?	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
067	Of course!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
068	Hey, you're underage...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
069	...Ack!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
070	Speaking of pirates...you're not going to wear that hat anymore?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_1047
071	Huh?
072	<p_name> turns to look at the pirate hat hanging from his waist.
073	This hat saved me time and time again.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
074	When we were fighting against the darkness within our hearts, it was that hat that saved us as well.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
075	Because we had that hat, we were able to sail across three worlds and save you, Amaterasu.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0004
076	I'm not the one who gave you that hat, but...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
077	I'll take this opportunity to tell you this.
078	Amaterasu stands in front of <p_name>.
079	The reason I am here like this now...is all thanks to you, <p_name>.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
080	Without you...
081	And Lisbeth, Laevateinn, Yuri, of course...
082	Without all of you, I would have been consumed by the darkness.
083	No matter how many times I say this, it's not enough. From the bottom of my heart...
084	Thank you.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0018
085	...Amaterasu.
086	... ...
087	Hey, Captain!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
088	Huh? Captain?
089	Put on that hat!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0007
090	And take me...
091	No...take us on a big adventure!
092	Heheh. Please do so.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0007
093	Let's go, Cap!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
094	Captain, hurry!	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
095	Yuri, Laevateinn, Lisbeth, and Amaterasu gaze towards <p_name> with expectation in their eyes.
096	... ...
097	This hat...was where it all started.
098	<p_name>, who had been silently gazing at the hat, slowly puts it on.
099	Yep. It looks perfect on you.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0008
100	Yeah, Cap! Give us your order!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
101	Give us a heart-pounding adventure, captain!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0041
102	All right then, all of you! Let's head towards the sun on our next adventure!
103	We set sail!
104	Aye aye, Captain!!!
105	This time...let's enjoy our midsummer adventure together.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0008
106	Her smile is like the sun—radiant and dazzling.
107	Thus we close the curtain on our adventure of a summer.
