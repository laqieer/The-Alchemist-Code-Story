001	What is this confusion?! Give me an update on the situation!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
002	Lord Gabirond! We've managed to detain the Blue Flame Guard, but Zeke and his daughter have made their way to the throne room. We are currently in pursuit!
003	You useless imbeciles! Dias, we must hurry!
004	I'm well aware of that. More importantly, continue with your story.
005	What...?
006	You told me that the Sacred Stone Satna, which was passed down the royal family of Wratharis, now dwells within Agatha's body.
007	What exactly does that mean?
008	I am sure you know how, long ago, there was a brother and a sister here in the continent of Babel who attempted to become gods.
009	Nimul and Emmel, the founders of Alchemy and the brother and sister who built the Tower of Babel.
010	Everyone living on this continent knows about them.
011	Indeed. Well, the sister Emmel is said to reincarnate once every few hundred years and return to this world.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
012	Reincarnate?
013	Such is the lore that is written in the Holy Order of Babel's historical texts.
014	Coinciding with Emmel's reincarnation, it is said that the Tower of Babel would ascend up to the heavens...causing this world to be destroyed.
015	So? What of that old tale?
016	According to this legend, those who harbor Sacred Stones within them are said to be vessels for the return of Emmel.
017	No...you can't mean...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
018	Thus, they are referred to as Vessels of Reincarnation and are feared for their potential to bring about destruction.
019	Your sister Agatha is one of these legendary Vessels of Reincarnation.
020	No... That's not possible!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
021	If you don't believe me, then you should ask Zeke yourself. Ah, here he is now.
022	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
