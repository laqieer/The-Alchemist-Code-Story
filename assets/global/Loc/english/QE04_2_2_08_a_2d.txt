001	Listen to you little brats...spouting your mouths off!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
002	I'm well aware that I'm speaking out of turn!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	However, please understand that we haven't come to you with some half-baked resolve!
004	It's only recently that I've learned to consider all of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
005	Until then, I was too busy worrying about my own tribe.
006	However, meeting Mocca here has changed me.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
007	I believe that we can work together regardless of tribe or faction.
008	Tina...!
009	I would be lying if I said I didn't understand how you felt. This is how you must have felt when you stood before Alia.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
010	I don't intend to question your choice or Alia's. However...two Wind Shamans have now appeared before us.
011	I feel Asena's will in this. Something big is going on here.
012	Can we not work together once again?
013	... ...
014	I won't coerce you into anything. For me, it's enough that I know now what Alia's resolve was and what yours is now.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
015	Um... Is there something I can do to help?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0039
016	Can the power of the wind inside me...be put to some use?
017	I think what you're already doing to help is amazing!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
018	She's right. Ever since you were born, Tamis, you've shouldered a significant burden. It could've easily been me instead of you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
019	But...I'm just a vessel. I want to do something like you, Mocca. I want to help Saga in some way.
020	Is there any way to borrow Tamis' power and restore the Wind Matter? Voda...would you know something about this?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
021	Hmm. Well, its power has already been depleted once. However, we have two Wind Shamans here. There may be some way to make it work.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
022	Fuu, do you know of some way?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
023	... ...
024	I doubt he has any answers either. After all, he's had both the vessel of the Wind Matter and a Wind Shaman by his side.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
025	For the sake of Saga, I'm sure he tried various tactics to restore the Wind Matter.
026	However, his attempts were unsuccessful...isn't that right?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
027	It is as you say. I've made various attempts, but nothing happened. That's why I sought Tina's power.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
028	...I see.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
029	Ah. If my power alone isn't enough then perhaps the two of us together may be able to succeed.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
030	Mocca...what do you want me to do? I'll do anything to help!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
031	Tamis...can you stand here? Tina, follow my lead.
032	Okay.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0037
033	Understood.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
034	....?! Is this still not enough?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
035	I can feel the pulsation a little stronger than when it was just you, Mocca, but still...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0031
036	I guess we lack the strength.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
037	It's not just your problem. Right now, the tribes of fire, water, wind, and earth are all turned inward.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0016
038	When they can unite together and work hand-in-hand...perhaps only then can the power of the wind truly be revived.
039	And Saga can be restored to its former glory.
040	Right! I just remembered that, other than her Ouija, Tina also has the power of Alchemy. Perhaps that would be of some use!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
041	No, unfortunately...although Ouija and Alchemy appear similar, they are two separate entities. It won’t change the results.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
042	Right now, the most important thing is to unite all of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
043	Bad news! The Gluttony army is at our gates!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
044	...What?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
045	A general, who goes by the name Georgios, is leading the army! Fuu, what should we do?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
046	Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
047	Hold on, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
