001	I've finished analyzing the magic innate to the shield. It's like the king said, this shield could be our saving grace.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
002	It could be, but I fear it won't be so easy.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
003	Not even with your skill?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
004	We're not just dealing with the innate magic that resides within this shield. We'll also have to add the Anti-Curse magic to deal with Leviathan...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
005	It's going to hard to get both of those to work harmoniously within one shield.
006	I see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
007	What do you think? Should we forget about the upgrades? Just restore it to its original function?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
008	No, I fear that won't be enough... But there's one thing we haven't tried yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
009	Do you think it'll work if we make it a pair? Two weapons?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
010	So splitting one function across two different objects? Essentially the opposite of Libra, then...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
011	That's still rather difficult, you know.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
012	But you can do it, right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
013	Well, I'll try to live up to your expectations.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
014	Is it alright to use 'that' to make up for the materials we're lacking?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
015	Well, we did bring it along for this kind of situation. In case the Gears of Judgement got damaged.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
016	Then I'll get started. Nimul, what wi—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
017	Excuse me!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
018	...It's no problem that you're here, but please don't shout like that...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
019	I nearly spilled all of this boiling water...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
020	M-my sincerest apologies! But this is an emergency!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0035
021	What's going on?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
022	The airship is being chased by Leviathan?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
023	Is it true, Your Highness?
024	It is. My own knights have reported that Adaleigh took Andechs along to retrieve the Ira Belt warship.
025	...And on the way, they ran into Leviathan.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
026	It appears that they have distanced themselves from the capital and are instead headed for the border. Isn't that right, Daphne?
027	...
028	Daphne?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0006
029	Oh, um, it's nothing! It's just like you said.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
030	We wanted to go and rescue them, but...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0029
031	...We've nearly finished repairing the shield, but we still need a bit more time. Not to mention, we're still lacking a method to handle Leviathan.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
032	If we follow them without an effective plan, we might all perish.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
033	You can't be saying... Are you telling us to abandon them?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0021
034	Not in the slightest. We'll head there the second the shield is ready.
035	Will we make it in time? The border is still quite a distance away.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
036	We might be able to make it if it's just us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
037	Oh! You want to use Space-Time Manipulation? I think I could manage a one way trip to the Libra, but...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
038	I only have enough magil to take along four, maaaybe five people at best!
039	And I'm going to guess and say that me and Nyx are going to be pretty darn useless for a whole day afterwards... You still want to go for it?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
040	These are dire straits. The ends will justify the means. As for who else will come along—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
041	...You want me to go?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
042	It seems your magil is deeply intertwined with that of the shield.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
043	In other words, you're the only one who can draw out its true power.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
044	You're the only one who can strip the Cursed Beast of its sin.
045	...
046	My chest feels so tight, I can't breathe. It's like I'm suffocating. They want me to fulfill such an important role? Me...? But...
047	Understood! I'll come!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
048	It seems you've settled on a plan.
049	Then let us move to make it a reality. Nimul, I'm counting on you to fix that shield as fast as you can.
050	The Purple Flame Knights will prepare the fleet.
051	Yes, sir!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0001
052	Finally, we can seize the opportunity to sever the bond between Leviathan and our people. We can not falter here.
053	It's a race against the clock. We've got to get this shield repaired in time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
054	Mira, you help Daphne prepare for the jump. Eulalia will assist too.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
055	Gotcha!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
056	Leave it to us!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
057	What?! That sound came from Nicaea's room!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
058	Is Emmel okay—?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
059	Lady Emmel?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0001
060	What is it? Does it hurt somewhere?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
061	No, I'm all right. I was just wondering if you could use your power to help me up.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0039
062	That'll be difficult. You see, your body doesn't have enough magil to survive at the moment.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
063	It's not the same as healing your wounds. This can only be healed with time and rest.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
064	Ah, I see...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0017
065	This won't do... I thought I'd be able to help Daphne and Imnus.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0030
066	I think you have already helped us a lot.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
067	Not just Daphne and Imnus, you saved my brother's life too.
068	That's why you should take the time to rest now. You can leave the rest to us.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
069	Heh, you're really too kind, Lady Emmel...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
070	Not at all—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
071	Huh?! What's happening!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0025
072	An intruder climbed through the window! Lady Nicaea, get behind me!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
073	—Aah, I've found you. The shield has shattered, and the beast has broken its chains.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0005
074	So the sacred beast is the only thing left in our way...	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
075	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
076	Ah, the shrine maiden from the other world... You will not interfere!!!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0013
077	This is the guy who was leading the Ira Belt forces?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
078	Lady Emmel! Run! It's me that he's after!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0019
079	I refuse.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0040
080	Lady Emmel?
081	Countless of people would mourn your death. I'm sure Imnus would be devastated too...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
082	I've had enough of that kind of sadness.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
083	I've seen enough people who lose sight of everything after a loss...
084	So I want you to live, to be happy. That's what all of us want from you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
085	So I will definitely protect you!
086	Fools!
087	Tch!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
088	Wishes without the strength to back them up, ideals without resolve, in the end they are no more than pipe dreams!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0031
089	Oh my, you blocked my attack? Impressive, but this is where the story ends.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
090	Ack!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0025
091	I will not be hindered! Stand in my way and you shall be the first one I cut down!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0040
092	I didn't expect to see this to be the first thing I saw after finishing up in the forge.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
093	Yna!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
094	I will take care of this! Take the princess and run!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
095	Thanks!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
096	You will not stand in my— You. You, are you one of the serpents?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0013
097	The scent of distorted magil is unmistakable. Did you meet that woman?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0001
098	...
099	Well, I suppose it doesn't matter. Regardless of who you are, you'll burn all the same.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0031
100	...Anger is often likened to flames. I can see that that's your power to wield as a Fallen.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
101	But a blacksmith is forged in the flames! When it comes to handling fire, I know all the tricks—!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
