001	So you and Ais are members of different Familia?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0045
002	You two seem so close, I would've sworn you were comrades.
003	What? No, no. It's nothing like that. It's more like, Ais is always saving my butt when I'm in trouble.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
004	Is that all? For someone who's not on your team, per se, you sure do talk her up a lot... Oh, wait, I get it!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
005	She's that person you said you look up to more than anyone else in the world, isn't she?
006	She's still leagues ahead of me, though.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0006
007	But you always inspire me to do my best, Bell.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0039
008	Only because you always find me when I'm in a desperate situation, so you have to or I'm toast!
009	I could only make out so much from that distance, but in the battle earlier, your moves seemed very similar to hers.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
010	That's because Ais taught me how to fight.
011	Trained by the person you admire? Gotta say, I'm kinda jealous!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0008
012	Just meeting someone you really look up to can change the entire course of your life...
013	But then getting close enough to that person to receive training? You really are blessed!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0024
014	Oh, I know. The people I keep company with are like a rock for me. I count my blessings every day.
015	But meeting Ais isn't why you became an adventurer, right?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
016	Th-that's right! I mentioned it a little before, but I owe becoming an adventurer to my goddess.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
017	She took me in as one when I was on my own and had nothing else.
018	Saved by one, and trained by another, huh?	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
019	Like Lord Zahar and Corvus.
020	So you have some special people in your life too, then, Ila?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0045
021	After my parents were killed, all adults were tainted for me. I couldn't bring myself to trust them anymore.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
022	But Lord Zahar, he was different from the rest. And Corvus... Well, I couldn't stand him, but I can't deny he taught me a lot.
023	Having people I could trust was important to me.
024	That's right. Meeting someone who means something to you is always worthwhile, no matter how things turn out in the end.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
025	Think of a parent and child, for example. If the child was unwanted, you often hear of the parent acting distant toward them.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
026	Maybe down the line, things will change and one of them will want to get closer to the other...but by then, it's probably too late. You can't let opportunities like that pass you by.
027	Sounds like you've been through a lot too, Kevin.
028	Ahahah. It hasn't always been a bed of roses, that's for sure.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
029	But I was given hope, a future...even happiness itself, all by a person whose name I don't even know.
030	...
031	Here. Something to celebrate the four of us coming together like this.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
032	What nonsense are you up to now?
033	A little surprise, using my telekinesis. Out from the smoke, flowers appear...
034	Okay, but why?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
035	Heh.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0007
036	Was that a laugh? Did you smile?! What a shame I wasn't looking. I'd have liked to have seen that!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0042
037	Aaaaaah, somebody! Save meeeeee!
038	What the—?!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0016
039	I know that voice!
040	Look, a pack of Rattys is headed this way!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
041	S-somebody, please! Bell, where aaare yooouuu?!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0027
042	Numaaa! Numaaa!
043	It's as if they're playing tag!	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0031
044	You're right. They're just toying with her!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
045	I don't care if they're playing or attacking...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
046	I won't let anyone mess with my goddess!
047	That's your goddess? The one you called Hestia?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0025
048	Bell! There you are!
049	Heads up! There's a demon behind the Rattys!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
050	Another one, huh? Looks like trouble, Bell. Let's do this!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
051	Right!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
052	Sit tight, Goddess!	VO_bell.bell_battle_0011
053	Oh, Bell! My Bell!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0018
