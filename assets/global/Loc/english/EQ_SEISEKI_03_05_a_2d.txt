001	Are you sure you're all right with this, Vice-Captain Monzein?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
002	...With what?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
003	Seida of course!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
004	She no longer belongs to the 2nd Regiment. Forget about here. No more talk. We advance.
005	Did you really have to speak to her like that?! Have you forgotten how you two worked together on the bridge?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0016
006	Silence.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
007	I understand your perspective, Vice-Captain. If the lives of everyone in this world is in danger, then it's our duty to remove that threat.
008	But you didn't have to speak to her like that!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
009	You told Seida to stand by and let the people of Alize...her people, get slaughtered!
010	I said silence!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
011	!!!
012	Under these circumstances, their sacrifice was unavoidable. However you say it, it won't change the truth.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
013	Was it really unavoidable?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
014	What?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
015	My teacher Seida said that the Sacred Stone wasn't in Gluttony. What if that's really true?
016	Nonsense! That theory has no basis!
017	What're you saying is just speculation as well! You have no proof that it wasn't a trap set by the enemy, yet you've already decided that it is.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0010
018	What're you gonna do if the Sacred Stone isn't in Gluttony and knights are at the temple?!
019	Silence! Don't meddle in things you know nothing about!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
020	It doesn't matter what the truth is or not. I am the vice-captain. I am your commander! You just need to silently follow my orders.
021	Fine. I get it now.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
022	I knew you were stubborn, but I didn't think you were such a blockhead, Vice-Captain Idiot.
023	V-Vice-Captain Idiot?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
024	I'll go help Seida, even if I have to do it alone!
025	What?!
026	That's the spirit! You're not alone. I'm coming with you!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0047
027	He-hey! Wait...
028	Tsk! At a time like this...!
