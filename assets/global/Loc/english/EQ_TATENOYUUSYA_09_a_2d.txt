001	...
002	Why so glum, Melty?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
003	Anastasia... Have you finished evacuating all of the villagers yet?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
004	Yes, they should be safe. Now all we have to do is focus on suppressing the Wave.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
005	I see...
006	Is something troubling you?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0002
007	N-no, I'm fine!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0039
008	You sure?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
009	Do I not look fine?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
010	I'm sorry, I must've been mistaken.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0035
011	No, you weren't...
012	...
013	I must protect everyone as the next in line to the throne...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
014	But I'm still so incompetent... Everyone is always saving me instead...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0022
015	Melty...
016	I thought that I'd be able to finally prove myself as a future leader of my kingdom...
017	But I can't do anything on my own in this world... I'm just constantly being reminded of my powerlessness...
018	I can't believe I spoke to Naofumi like that... I'm not ready to be queen yet if I can't keep my composure when times get tough.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
019	I'm worried that I won't be able to carry out my duties as princess when I return home at this rate...
020	I'd be able to seek retribution for the knight who was attacked if I could just fight on the frontlines...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
021	And I probably could've done something if only I'd known about the hatred against demi-humans sooner...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
022	That may be true.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
023	But as someone whose job it was to protect the royal family, let me say this...
024	I don't think I'd be able to focus on my own fighting if the princess of my kingdom was fighting alongside me.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
025	The best way to help your knights on the battlefield is to stay safe and sound away from battle.
026	As royalty—as someone of higher standing, you mustn't give your frontline soldiers more to worry about. That's your responsibility.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
027	Oh...
028	That is only my personal perspective, however. I'm sure royalty isn't the same everywhere.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
029	It's up to you to decide what kind of ruler you will become.
030	...
031	Melty... Don't forget that it's important to face adversity head-on.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
032	As helpless as you may feel, you need to take a hard look at reality and figure out a way to use your own unique skills and position to fight your battles.
033	...
034	And even if nothing goes according to plan, everything will turn out for the better in the end so long as you keep on living.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
035	Yes... So long as you just survive...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
036	Anastasia? Is something the matter?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
037	I'm sorry, I was just thinking of something else.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0035
038	Don't worry, Melty. All you have to do is figure out what someone in your position is able to do.
039	A way to use my own unique skills and position to fight my battles...
040	(I think Naofumi told me something like that before, too...)	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
041	...
042	...
043	Are you worried about her?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
044	Sort of. She tends to overthink things on her own.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
045	The monsters from our world are terrorizing the people of yours...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0039
046	They shouldn't be here, yet I can't even do anything to stop them... And I'm a princess... I'm pathetic.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
047	As Melty Melromarc, the successor to the throne of Melromarc and its second princess, please accept my sincerest apologies.
048	It sure seems that way...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
049	I find it to be rather admirable. Despite being so young, she's still doing her best to fulfill her duties as part of the royal family.
050	I guess that's true...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0006
051	As one of the Heroes, I should be helping her accomplish that...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
052	(But in order to do that, I need to reconcile with the three Heroes that tricked me, looked down on me, and even scorned me...)
053	Ugh... She keeps telling me to reconcile even though they couldn't care less...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0030
054	Is that not your duty as a Hero?
055	...
056	I can sympathize with you, though. It must be difficult to gain the trust of those in an unfamiliar world.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
057	But you should take into consideration the fact that the friends watching you go through this are also having a difficult time.
058	Melty looked devastated when you were talking about that earlier. I sort of understand how she must have felt.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
059	The person who I hold most dear to me also had to struggle alone, just like you. It's because they always behaved recklessly.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
060	...
061	It was so terribly painful watching the person I held closest to me suffer so much... I didn't want them to think that they were dealing with it all alone.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
062	I didn't intend to leave them all alone... I'm sure your friends feel the same.
063	...
064	You may indeed have been alone in the beginning, but now you have companions who believe in you.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
065	So if you are truly being falsely accused of this crime as you've said, you should clear up this misunderstanding immediately.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
066	You need to settle this for the sake of those closest to you, as well.
067	...
068	For those closest to me...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
069	N-Naofumi!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
070	U-um... I just want to, um... I wanted to say that I'm sorry for how I acted earlier!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0035
071	...
072	Naofumi?
073	...No, it's nothing.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
074	You didn't do anything wrong. I should've explained my reasoning better.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
075	Yeah, I need to do a better job of explaining things... For their sake, too.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0006
076	Huh?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
077	Naofumi, the time limit you told us about is going to run—	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
078	Ah!
079	The monsters keep pouring out of the rift... So this is what a Wave looks like... It's truly frightful.	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0019
080	We'll probably be able to suppress the Wave if we take down the boss. We just have to figure out where it is first...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
081	Yeah... But just standing here won't do us any good. It's hiding behind the other monsters!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
082	Argh!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0019
083	Naofumi, watch out!
084	Haaaaaah!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_battle_0007
085	Lord Naofumi, are you all right?!
086	Raphtalia!
087	Master! I'm here, too!	VO_filo.filo_sys_0001
088	Oh, hey, Filo... Glad to see you're okay.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
089	Is that...?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
090	It's coming for us, Lord Naofumi!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_battle_0019
