001	Are you here? The Moon Star Armor you just transmuted right now actually still has room for improvement.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0002
002	Well, imagine that it's like a baby chick.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
003	This time, our goal is to enhance the Moon Star Armor.
004	You might be thinking, "Why do I need to enhance it?" Don't be an idiot! In its current state, it's no better than a piece of paper!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0012
005	Listen. Just like units, each gear has a different Lv too.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
006	By enhancing your gear, you raise the Lv and make it stronger. Do you understand so far?
007	About this "Enhancing," in order to accomplish it, you need Ore.
008	There are different types of Ore, but...well, this time we'll start with about 15 pieces of Adamantine Ore.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
009	Come on. Stop complaining and follow me.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
