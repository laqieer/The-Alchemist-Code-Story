001	Lord Gabirond! We've managed to grasp the movements of the Blue Flame Guard under Zeke!
002	They are currently near Old Fort Agilev, advancing across the wastelands called the "Ruins of Death."
003	Fort Agilev...?
004	It's a fort that used to belong to Wratharis.
005	According to the Holy Guard, the monsters who have consumed Philosopher's Stones have turned it into their nesting grounds.
006	I never expected Zeke to take a route like that!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
007	He's taking Agatha through such dangerous terrain!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
008	The only thing that matters to Zeke is the resurrection of Wratharis and the downfall of our Envylia.
009	As long as he sees his daughter as a tool...there is little reason for him to care about her safety.
010	Enough!
011	How can you say that the time I've shared with my family has all been a lie?! I won't allow you to taunt me any further!
012	Dias...! Do you still continue to resist reality?!
013	There must be a reason for his actions!
014	I can't believe that a man like my father would orchestrate something like this. It's absurd!
015	There is clear evidence that points to his scheming.
016	In any case... Regardless of what I say, you will not listen. Go on and confirm your father's intentions with your own eyes then.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
017	I will! Even if we must cross swords, I will correct my father's sins!
