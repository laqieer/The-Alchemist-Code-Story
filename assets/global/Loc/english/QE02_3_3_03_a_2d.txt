001	We've finally reached Pulte Canal. Once we cross the Eperal Bridge, we'll enter Redington City.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030

004	Of course, it is. We've no time to be sneaking around. We charge through from the front.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
005	Don't worry. We have enough gunpowder to shoot down that bridge if we have to.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0007
