001	Within the forest...
002	Well, that was a bit more tiring than usual.
003	Hmmm. According to my map, the trail should be right here.
004	Except it isn't. Oh well—at least I'm not going around in circles.
005	That's what you get, Sieg, when your references are all outdated.
006	I shouldn't be surprised.
007	It's not like people have been enthusiastic about exploring this region...
008	With the chaotic years that followed the end of the warring era.
009	Still, I should've brought better equipment. All this undergrowth is slowing me down...
010	Wait, what was that?
011	...
012	I thought I heard something. Must be my imagination.
013	Wait, there it is! A hunting trail!
014	I'm definitely onto something then!
015	The Village of the Divine... looks like it's more than just a myth...
016	An isolated village protected by a divine entity and untouched by the war?
017	Finally some signs of settlement in this forest.
018	(Rustling)
019	That doesn't sound good.
020	Grrrrrrr....
021	I don't suppose you'd roll over and be a good boy?
022	GRRRRR!!!!
023	Not your ordinary forest wolves, then.
