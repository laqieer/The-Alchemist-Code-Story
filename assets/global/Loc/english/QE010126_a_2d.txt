001	Captain! The Holy Guard are approaching!
002	Is it Dias? Father, will you cross swords with him again?!
003	Dias may have taken on the power of darkness that lies beyond Alchemy.
004	If that's true, then it will be difficult to avoid conflict.
005	The power of darkness? What's that?
006	It is when one sacrifices their body to the darkness in order to obtain a cursed power.
007	When our swords crossed earlier, I caught a glimpse of that power inside him.
008	A cursed power...?! Is Dias all right?!
009	I don't know.
010	Before I could step into the darkness, I found you. Thus, I was able to stop myself from entering.
011	What is beyond that is unknown territory to me.
012	Oh, Dias! Why would you meddle with a power like that?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
013	It was my naivety in allowing Dias to use Alchemy that gave birth to this situation.
014	In order to minimize casualties, I'll need to stop him with my own hands.
015	Father, you can't mean...?! Please! Re-think this! At least spare his life!	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0005b
016	What...?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
017	Dias has merely forgotten who he is! Please, spare him!
018	You seem to have misunderstood something. I would never do something like that.
019	I'm simply going to stop him. I have no intention of taking his life.
020	Father!
021	It's a parent's responsibility to correct their child when they follow the wrong path.
022	For me, all of you are my irreplaceable children.
023	Have you forgotten the memories we've shared together as a family?
024	N-no!
025	Time is the most important thing when it comes to family. The path we've walked together is a far stronger bond than any bloodline can be.
026	We as a family have that, don't we? Our bond will not easily collapse, so there's no need for senseless worrying.
027	...Okay!
