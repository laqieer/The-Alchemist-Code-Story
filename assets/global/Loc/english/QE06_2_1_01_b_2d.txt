001	The damage is quite extensive…	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
002	We may have avoided total destruction… but our headquarters, Castle Aquila Rubrum, is half destroyed. And the corps members who faced the multiple Discarnate Powers...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
003	We lost...nearly half of them.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
004	…
005	…Sheesh. We sent them on a death mission, huh.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
006	How can you be so nonchalant at a time like this!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
007	…I'm just trying to make sense of it all. We can't give up now--that's for sure…and besides, they've taken Amane.
008	...There are more important things to consider right now.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
009	…
010	…What?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
011	Would you be able to say the same thing if Azami were kidnapped?
012	…
013	A captain who can't protect his squad...is beyond pathetic.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
014	…I know now's not the time to be wallowing in self-pity, but I'm feeling beaten down.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
015	Being depressed won't change anything! We need to think about our next move.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
016	…You're right.
017	…There are too many unknowns.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
018	What do you mean?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
019	For one, why did the Discarnate Power kidnap Amane?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
020	It doesn't make sense for her to be their target. Furthermore...
021	You both saw it, didn't you? Her power… What was that?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
022	Yes, I remember…but...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
023	Beast Art Evocations Book Two - Tigris!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
024	I don't recall ever teaching her that technique.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
025	Blade Fox members are allowed a limited amount of chakra to combat demons...but…	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
026	Hers was a different kind of power. Did you teach her that, Tanosuke?
027	…Nope, can't say it was me. But...hang on. I just realized something.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
028	…What?
029	What if that strange power was the reason the demons took Amane…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
030	…!?
