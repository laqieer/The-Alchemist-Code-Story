001	Hyaaaahhh!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0032
002	A poor excuse for a lunge, that! Huh?!	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0022
003	You took the bait! This is what you should've been anticipating!
004	Oho!
005	I got you! For once, I got the upper ha—aaagh?!
006	Ngh... How...?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0042
007	Fool. You discarded your weapon! Of course you would come at me bare-handed.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
043	Here's your consolation prize, though.
044	No! Ghaah!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0043
008	Not being a coward anymore and actually defeating me are two very different things. It would pay for you not to let your guard falter.
045	Though you are welcome to just give up, if you'd prefer! I know that's what you're used to.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0016
009	Nnrgh...
010	I will say, your fighting has improved. I hear tell you volunteered yourself for military service, and have made quite a mark.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0003
011	Your skills have made you the talk of the town!
012	Everyone is convinced either you or I will become the next emperor.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
013	What they skirt around is the fact that the other candidates are all useless cowards who only slow us down.
014	I have a long way to go before I can reach your level, but I am well on my way. Tell me, though: how did you hear of my military service? Did you speak of me with His Majesty?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
015	He is my father. I speak with him of many things.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0030
016	Is that so?
017	Never mind that, though. Come on. We're leaving.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
018	What? Where are we—? Hey!
019	You don't need to know anything. You lost, so you're going to do whatever I say, and you're going to like it.
020	...An arranged marriage? With a member of the royal family of Wratharis?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0025
021	A blood relative to the royals, but not a direct successor to the throne. The aim here is simply to strengthen the relationship between our kingdoms.
022	You mean to say we're going to Wratharis, right now?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0003
053	But we don't know how Mammon will react! It's unknown territory! What if the locals are hostile toward me?
054	Being attacked by a successor trying to usurp my position is one thing, but if an ordinary citizen in another land should draw my blood, the result could be catastrophic!
046	I'm sure it'll be okay for a few days.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
055	If it weren't, the next emperor wouldn't be able to go on any expeditions at all, ever, and that just doesn't seem right!
056	Besides, you've been wanting to see other lands for some time now, haven't you?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
047	I suppose any attempts to make you turn back would fall on deaf ears. Are you sure it's okay for it to be only the two of us, though?
023	I don't need a bodyguard, if that's what you're thinking! They just said I needed to bring one other person, so I chose you.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
048	Generally, a successor shouldn't be allowed out of the country until after their coronation, you know.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
049	Do the rules truly matter, though? It's not becoming of a lion to hold onto a dream like yours forever, without simply acting upon it.
024	You've never been on a journey like this before, have you?
025	...
050	An unfortunate state of affairs, that.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
026	Now's the time to expand your horizons. Look! You've made it to the outside world!
027	...
028	This is...Wratharis!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0045
029	It is indeed. Do as you please until I return. But don't go causing any trouble!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
030	And just what kind of trouble would you expect me to—?! Ugh, left without so much as a hint of hesitation.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
031	So, this is what it's like outside Greed Dike. The architecture is different, just like the books said. The people's clothes, too. Are they unique to this place, I wonder?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0044
032	Food and goods I've never seen, too... To think the climate and topography could change so much even within the Continent of Babel!
033	There's so much that I never could have even imagined, were I to continue spending all my days in Greed Dike.
034	Yes... It's just as I was told.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0007
035	Well, I'm here now. I see no reason not to explore a bit!
036	...
037	What?! Even all the way out here?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0016
038	Do as you please until I return. But don't go causing any trouble!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
039	Well, she said not to cause trouble, but she did also say I could do as I please...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
040	You really think you can handle all of us?!
051	I didn't make it widely known I was leaving the kingdom. Who told you I'd be in Wratharis?
052	...
041	Fine, then. Your numbers don't matter, it just means this lion will feast well tonight.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0010
