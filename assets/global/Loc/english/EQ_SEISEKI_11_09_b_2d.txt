001	I am duly impressed. I should have expected as much from such elite soldiers.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
002	Heh... Well, then...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
003	Waginau, I leave this place to you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
004	Do you have somewhere better to be?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
005	I do. After all, who better to definitively end a war than the Lion Monarch himself?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
006	I shall retrieve Northern Pride's Sacred Stone with my own hands and secure the path to the tower that will lead to complete dominion!
007	It seems that all is going according to plan. I will await the good news.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
008	Hehe... Hahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
009	Captain Othima and Captain Seida... Dead?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
010	Aahhhhhhhhh!
011	That is what I heard.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
012	As far as I know, they were killed by Sol's hand on a battlefield in Saga.
013	I-it can't be... Those two could never...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0021
014	By now, the Lord Commander Kanon should be finished as well.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
015	Huh...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
016	There is no need to grieve. I am here to ensure that you will meet them on the other side as soon as possible.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
017	Urk!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
018	Goodbye, false knights. Bionic Eye Unseen!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0014
019	Huzzzaahhh!!!
020	Huh...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
021	Aahhhhhhhhh!
022	Wh-what are you doing?! It's pointless to rush forward so recklessly!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0042
023	Kazahaya, please... We will do whatever we must to keep her at bay! Go to the Lord Commander!
024	You are doing this to cover me?! I cannot just leave you behind!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
025	Lord Commander Kanon's safety takes precedence over all! Please, Kazahaya!
026	But...!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
027	N-news from the royal palace! The enemy has made their way onto the palace grounds!
028	They what?! When did they break through the front guard?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
029	N-no, well...
030	...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
031	You!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0001
032	You're not bad to have made it this far, but...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
033	This is as far as you go! As long as I breathe, I will never let you get by me, Greed Dike!
034	Miuna! Behind you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
035	What...? Seriously?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
036	Miuna!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
037	...! What...?	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
038	It seems the most effective way to destroy these is to aim for the head. Keep that in mind.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
039	A-ah. Thank you. Nice work.
040	Just as reckless as ever, I see.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0012
041	What did you call me?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0016
042	Haaa... Haaa... Kanon... You're alive!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
043	Kazahaya! How is it out there?!
044	The Veda Templars have made their appearance, but...
045	Haaa... That's not important! The royal palace has been breached!
046	The royal palace?! Suzuka... She should already be there, backing up the Imperial Guard!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
047	That information came straight from the Imperial Guard! They can't keep up with the onslaught!
048	What?! How many enemies are they facing?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
049	That's the thing! Apparently it is just one warrior with an overwhelmingly dark aura!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0022
050	Just one warrior?! How can one man wreak such havoc?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
051	Apparently, he has the ability to command a terrifying power that allows him to attack without lifting a single finger!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
052	It can't be...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
053	It is the Lion Monarch Orion! He rode forward on his own!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0023
054	No!!!
055	This is bad... Is the Sacred Stone Lucifer still in the Emperor's custody?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
056	Yes... W-we have to hurry.
057	Hm...? Where is Zehn...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
058	?!
059	Ack!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
060	I can't believe it... Zehn, too?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0021
061	Th-the Templar from earlier?! Wh-what of the knights that were fighting you?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
062	It is my turn to ask questions.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0004
063	Kanon, behind you!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
064	Huh...?!
065	Just how many of my comrades will you take from me? This is beyond the point of forgiveness! "Crumbling Armor" Hand!!!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0013
066	Ack!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
067	What...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
068	As I said before, as long as I breathe, I will not just let you do as you like!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
069	And I will certainly not let you lay a single finger on Kanon!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0010
070	Miuna! Spica!
071	What are you still doing here? Go!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1015
072	Huh?
073	We will hold her off. You have somewhere to be, don't you?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
074	Listen to them, Kanon. The Sacred Stone must be your priority.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
075	Fine... Thank you!
076	I shall not permit you to escape!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
077	You don't seem to understand the situation. This is the end of the line for you!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
078	?! Be on your guard, Miuna!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
079	Ack...?!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0022
080	You think you can stop me...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0010
081	Wha—?! She disappeared!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
082	Grk...!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0024
083	Spica?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0028
084	Good luck with that.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0037
085	Ugh!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0019
086	Wh-what is this?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0027
087	N-no... This is terrible... All of these people were taken down by just one...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
088	Hey...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
089	...Uggh...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
090	Suzuka!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.sys_0018
091	M-Mistress... O-Orion is...still...in the palace!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
092	...!
093	Don't speak! You need a medic, badly! Save your strength!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
094	Mistress... P-please... You must... Orion...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
095	...! She's... She's passed out.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
096	Orion...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
097	H-he's here! I-it's really Orion...! Urk!
098	Emperor of Northern Pride and ruler of the continent of Babel...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
099	I, the Lion Monarch, have come to take the Sacred Stone Lucifer and your lives!
