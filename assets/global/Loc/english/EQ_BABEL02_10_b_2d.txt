001	Im...possib...le...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
002	Fools, one and all. See how they wither, Waginau?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0006
003	No matter how many cadavers you throw at me! No matter how you attempt to overwhelm me! You will never impede my path of conquest!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
004	Watch, impotent, as I liberate this world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0004
005	Hahaha... Pre...posterous. Someone...like you...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
006	...could never!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
007	No...!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
008	Mia!!!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
009	Aaargh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0043
010	I will not stand by while you pick off my precious comrades.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
011	Lord...Zahar... I-Ila...	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
012	Mia, I'm so glad! Y-you're okay!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
013	Thank you...for coming to rescue me.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0019
014	I'd never leave ya behind! After all, we're... We're...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
015	Family. Is it not so, Ila?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
016	Right...
017	Ila, bring her my parting gift—the Guard Stone.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
018	What?! Are you serious?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
019	This is a token that links one to the Shadow Messiah. You should be the one to give it to her, Ila. Stay together from now on.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
020	Lord...Zahar?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
021	Mia, you may not be an official member of Shadow Messiah...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
022	But you have my gratitude. You have walked the same path, and you share the same sense of justice and sentiments as we do.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0034
023	Thank you, Lord Zahar! Thank you for letting me be a part of such a lovely family!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0033
024	Hang on, Lord Zahar! Whaddya mean, "parting gift"?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
025	I will proceed alone from this point on.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
026	No way! I’m a member of Shadow Messiah! I should always be with you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
027	I...I swore to Corvus that I would!
028	If you truly are a member of Shadow Messiah...then you are one with me, and you will inherit my will, Shadow Messiah Ila.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0038
029	Hey!
030	Protect Mia from harm.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0041
031	I...understand.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
032	You are the ones who will inherit my will. You will carry my beliefs along the passage of time. Do I make myself clear?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
033	Y-yeah...
034	Yes.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0004
035	Zehn, I leave them in your care.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
036	Understood. After all, I still do not see any limit to your darkness.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0038
037	It will take some time for me to honor my end of our bargain, but I will do so without fail. In time, I will show you the way to the truth.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
038	I'll hold you to that.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
039	One day, a new Shadow Messiah shall rise, and so shall my will be revived!
040	We shall bring true peace to this world through the new order we build! My presence shall never be erased!
041	Let us meet again, in one form or another. Hahahahaha!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
042	...
043	Letitia... They're strong, but will they become a force to be reckoned with?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
044	(Hahaha, isn't that obvious? They are the same as you; people who have gathered as one, eager for a new world.)	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
045	This is true... You are right, of course.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
046	My Shadow Messiah comrades beyond the grave! Gather the Dark Soul Shards and obey me once more!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
047	Whatever the means, we must accomplish this deepest desire of mine!
048	I shall not cease. This is my path—now and always.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
049	The trial that awaits you all may not be an easy one, but I wish you the best of luck.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
050	Eeeeek!!! Captain Vettel is so cool!
051	Well then, I'll now explain the final trial to you! The trial will be held at the Trial Ruins.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
052	There is only one condition for passing! You must fetch a Philosopher's Stone from the ruins!
053	The roots of many a Paladin can be traced back here! Follow in the footsteps of your predecessors! Step through the door to becoming a glorious Paladin!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
054	Today, in addition to myself, I've asked another to join us.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
055	Oh! That's...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
056	Wh-what's going on?!	VO_chloe_l_cloe.chloe_sys_0025
057	I am Cadanova, captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
058	Ca-Cadanova? The Guardian of the Land...? The Flame Dragon King?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
059	He's a shining star the likes of which every knight—no, every living soul—in Babel has heard of!	VO_chloe_l_cloe.chloe_sys_0017
060	H-hey... Isn't this—?!	VO_chloe_l_cloe.chloe_sys_0020
061	A huge opportunity for us!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
062	Huh? Opportunity...?	VO_chloe_l_cloe.chloe_sys_0025
063	Even though I'm in the 13th Rank, if I impress Captain Cadanova, he might initiate me into the 4th Regiment!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0009
064	Ohh... I'm getting my hopes up!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
065	Come, Vettel... I await you here. You and your aspiring knights of the future... I will crush you all before you have the chance to become the leaders of this corrupt world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
066	My dear sister and mother, she who sacrificed her own life to bequeath me her power... I must go ever forward, for her sake!
067	You, who stand in the way of my conquest... I will show you the true form of darkness!
068	My name is Zahar; I am both savior of the shadows, and the one who rules over all darkness!
069	I am he who shall bring a new order unto the world! An order shrouded in darkness!
070	I ascend, the King of Darkness!!!
