001	Wow...this is amazing! These mountains of Alkaroid scraps go on forever!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0024
002	It's almost like an Alkaroid graveyard. What a tragic sight.
003	Yep. But...it might be possible for us to give meaning to these androids who've been sealed and labeled here as scrap.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
004	If we can extract information from them...it'll mean that at least they'll have served a purpose by being useful to us.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
005	Right. In every age of humanity, it's always been the role of those alive to give meaning to the dead. How's it going, Alkemono?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
006	They've all been intensely damaged, aye... They must've been treated...roughly.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0016
007	Allie...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
008	It'll be nice to give them one final moment in the spotlight. What kind of android are we looking for?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
009	One that still has its head circuit, aye. A good place to start is checking whether it still has a head.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
010	Actually...now that you've mentioned it, most of these androids don't have heads.
011	I wonder if the heads sell at a high price.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
012	Ronnie!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
013	I-I'm kidding!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
014	But...there's a possibility they're being recycled for further use. Look at that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
015	A-a Hound! Not those blasted dogs again!
016	Aye, I'm sure it's collecting circuits.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
017	It's equipped with a Gatling gun. It's probably the guard of Scrap Mountain. Best to avoid it if possible, but...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
018	That android it's got ahold of...is completely intact!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
019	Yep. Looks like we've got no choice. Let's drive that annoying dog away!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
