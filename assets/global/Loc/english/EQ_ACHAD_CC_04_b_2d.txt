001	Hey, whatever happened to that jester guy?
002	His powers were on a whole other level.
003	Bet he thought he could just do whatever he wanted. I mean, he jumped into the middle of the arena during a match! He even wounded that artificial maiden chick.
004	Pretty sure those Colosseum matches were fixed, anyway. The owner had it coming.
005	Yeah, it was hard to watch what he did to his slaves. The things he put them through for a simple opening act...
006	That jester killed everyone in the arena that day, didn't he? I'm glad I decided not to attend.
007	Ahh, but I heard it wasn't the jester who killed 'em.
008	I thought he was the one who interrupted the match?
009	Apparently he just stood there, laughing, as the arena got turned into a bloodbath!
010	Then, when all spectators were dead and gone, he just vanished.
011	Vanished? You don't mean that literally?
012	I dunno! That's just what the rumors say.
013	Well, where do you think he ended up?
014	Ahahahaha! I'm so glad I came to see the show!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0011
015	Haa...haa...haa...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
016	You've reached your limit. You can stop now, Am. You've done really well. We'll make some adjustments to the gear later.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
017	S-Sol!
018	Don't worry.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
019	Ahh, of course! I understand now! What's the use of having a spotlight in the underground theatre if there's no one on the stage?!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
020	...
021	Of course! That is why you must take the stage, Amu! Don't you see?!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
022	Can't you shut up? You've lost, Jester.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
118	Oh, Sol! I knew I could count on you for a good show, and you didn't disappoint! You're giving me chills!
023	Follow me, Amu! I think it's high time we brought out your true colors.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
024	The final act requires a brilliance to rival the shining sun! Or else the arrival of the long-awaited light will be ruined!
025	What are you talking about?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
026	Come now, Amu. You don't have to keep pretending to be the heroine.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0003
027	Huh?
028	Drop the act. Aren't we both the villains of this play?
029	I don't...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
030	Your poor, oppressed little soul was just yearning to be unleashed!
031	And it was. She's free now. We made that happen.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
032	No, no, no, no! You don't understand! I'm talking about a time much further in the past!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
033	Huh?
034	Amu, do you remember our first encounter? Did it not feel like destiny? It did to me! That's why I helped you!
035	H-helped me? You're the one who...who...!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0007
036	Be honest, now. Wasn't it a relief to be defeated by me? To lose your deadweight friend?
037	A relief?!
038	Why, yes! Wasn't it freeing?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
039	"If I lose, I'll be thrown away." "If I fight back, my friend will be in trouble."
040	Those were the beliefs that held you back. You had to tell yourself those things in order to repress what you truly felt.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
041	...
042	"Go get yourself killed! Just lose a match, and throw it all away! I won't miss you!"
043	You bottled up your feelings...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
044	"I suppose Bianca could draw in customers. I've left her alone up till now, because you've been doing so well in your fights."
045	Until they all came bursting out...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
046	...
047	And you killed every last person in the Colosseum.	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0012
048	What?!
049	N-no...!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
050	It was absolutely enthralling, seeing you at work.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
051	Enough of your lies! You were the one responsible for—!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
052	Who, me? Oh, no. That wasn't me! "I did it! It was me!"	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
053	I-is that supposed to be my voice?
054	That's right! You did it. You killed them! Every last one of them!	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0019
055	Y-you're wrong!
056	Am I? Are you sure?
057	I-I lost to you! And you...you killed Bianca... Y-you took my left eye!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
058	You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.
059	Wh-what?
060	You have hands, don't you? Use them while you can.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
061	Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
062	Nngh... Aaaahh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
063	Once, you were a simple marionette, performing in the comedies directed by your puppeteer.
064	No, no, no...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0020
065	Now you stand on Sol's stage, pretending to be the heroine, costar of the show.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
066	Don't...kill...them!
067	The only thing that's changed is the director. You're still a lowly puppet with no talent of your own.
068	Give...it...back!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
069	You're just a pitiful girl who tries to find her purpose in the dreams of others.
070	It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!
071	Indeed. You're so pathetic, it hurts to look at you.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
072	Kill! Die! Kill! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Die!
073	Are you starting to remember? Those lines were part of your script.
074	Ngh... Ahhh... Aaaaaaahhh!
075	Your repressed guilt manifested itself as dependence towards the first person willing to reach out to you.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0037
076	But even paying penance with both of your arms couldn't satisfy that pent-up remorse of yours, could it?
077	No...no...no...
078	Hehehe.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
079	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
080	You really do look so much like mama.
081	Ngh!
082	Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
083	You're becoming a bit of an eyesore, I'm afraid.
084	What?!
085	This power...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
086	You've done well to set the stage.
087	You're welcome. But this is your last act.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
088	Oh! I almost forgot to ask you. Did you enjoy the throne?
089	What?
090	A throne fit for the sun! Surely it must have arrived by now? I used the people of Lost Blue to send it your way.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0003
091	That crappy little chair came from you?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
092	I was right to believe in your bluff and bluster.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
093	You truly are a worthy ruler!
094	What do you want from me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
095	I humbly seek a reward for my services.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
096	What?
097	The sixth spot is still available, is it not?
098	I'm not giving that number to a fool.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
099	But I could be the Sixth Templar! You could call me Zechs! It's a rather fetching stage name, wouldn't you agree?
100	Stop joking around!
101	My commandment could be Disillusioned!
102	More like Distasteful!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
103	That still works for me!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0024
104	You're insane!
105	Oh, how I long to witness your final act, my liege!
106	We'll see about that.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
107	You still don't have a clue, do you?
108	Ngh... Aaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
109	Amu?!
110	That's all right. In fact, it's better this way.
111	What the...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
112	I don't believe it! Did he just teleport?!
113	I am the unknown variable, X.
114	If X stands for the ten of the Veda, then Z represents their end.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
115	Put them together, and you get ZX.
116	Disillusioned. Distasteful. The fool. The jester. Zechs.
117	Oh, don't look at me like that.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
