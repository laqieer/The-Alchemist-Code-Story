001	Hahahah! You talk a mean game, and now you're running, brah?	VO_aj3500.aj3500_sys_0007
002	Tsk. I guess it's using the big dog as its shield!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
003	Not a bad idea. It makes things a little more of a hassle for us!
004	Edgar, the time...!
005	Ack!
006	Hey yo! Don't be looking elsewhere when we're dishing it out, brah! Big mistake!
007	It's behind you, aye!
008	Tsk!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
009	Whoa! Where are you shooting at, brah?
010	You're finished as a gunslinger if you can't keep your cool.
011	Unfortunately for you, I tend to be conservative. I don't waste a shot on principle.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
012	Say what? Brah...you shot the Cerberus's head?!	VO_aj3500.aj3500_sys_0005
013	Now that you've lost your protection, you've no way of winning. Give it up.
014	No, no, no!!! Brah, have you forgotten about my trump card? My super vibrations exceed the speed of sound!
015	Not good!
016	You're the one who's gonna be doing the giving up. I'll shred everything within a 30 square meter range! It's over, brah!
017	Oh no! Run!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
018	We can't run, aye.
019	Allie...?!
020	Aye. We can't give up! We can't give up! We can't give up!!!
021	No, Alkemono!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
022	Say what...?!	VO_aj3500.aj3500_sys_0026
023	Agh?! Ug-gughh...?!
024	What the...?!
025	Get off me, brah!
026	You emit your super vibration by combining two waves of vibration, aye?
027	If you can prevent the waves from coming together, you can stop the super vibration from forming!
028	Edgar!
029	Do-don't do it, brah!
030	Big props, Alkemono...not for your logical solution, but for courageously standing up in the face of adversary.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
031	No! It was Ejitan who gave me the courage, aye!
032	Heh. Well said.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
033	Stop it, brah!!!
034	Don't worry. Your canine friends will take you with them...as scrap metal.
035	Agh!!!	VO_aj3500.aj3500_sys_0029
036	We've taken out its primary circuit! Aye, Ejitan...we've avenged you!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
037	Edgar! The train is beginning to move!
038	Tsk! Let's go, Alkemono!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
039	Aye!
040	We've come too close to miss it now! Clock protector...we're gonna rescue you at all costs!
