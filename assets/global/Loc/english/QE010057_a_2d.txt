001	Bertrand, you took a while. What were you and Lord Gabirond talking about?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
002	Nothing...heh...	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0011
003	What is it? What's funny?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
004	I was remembering my son.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0006
005	How he would've been a strapping young man like you are now.
006	...If he were still alive.
007	He died?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
008	Yes. He was killed.
009	What...?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0021
010	It's embarrassing to say this now, but there was a period where I turned my back on the Alchemist Code.
011	Driven by a desire for revenge, I lived quite similarly to the way you do.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0010
012	...!
013	My life consisted of looking for my son's killer and tirelessly fighting in battle.
014	Wearing the mask of justice, I eagerly awaited the day I would be able to kill him.
015	However, a certain knight who I met on the battlefield at that time saw beneath my mask.
016	That was your father Captain Zeke.
017	My father?
018	Captain Zeke admonished me quietly, asked me whether I could look my son in the eye if he were here now.
019	He told me that my son would have wanted to see his father as an honorable and proud knight.
020	I had thought I had lost all emotions, but the tears began to spill from my eyes.
021	I was on the verge of losing myself and Captain Zeke saved me.
022	... ...
023	There is no future when you hold on to revenge.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0006
024	Mark my words... With hatred in your heart, you will only end up bringing sorrow to others.
025	You cannot be an honorable and proud knight if you discard your humanity.
026	Bertrand...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
