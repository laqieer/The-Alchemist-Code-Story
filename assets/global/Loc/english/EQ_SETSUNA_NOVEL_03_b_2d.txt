001	Haa...haa...haa...
002	—tsuna...!
003	Haa... Is it...over?
004	Setsuna!
005	H-huh?!
006	Setsuna! You got them all!
007	So it's done...
008	Yeah, now we just need to find Sis as soon as possible!
009	C'mon, Setsuna! Let's go!
010	Jayme... You're so strong, you know that?
011	H-huh?
012	(Compared to him...)
013	(I must have been a terrible sight during that fight.)
014	(Yet none of that fazes him when Macherie's safety is on the line.)
015	(Jayme is such a strong boy.)
016	(He's brilliant. I wish I could be just as...)
017	Ngh!
018	(No...I can't wish for that.)
019	(I can't allow myself to have something like that. Not again.)
020	Setsuna, did you get hurt earlier?
021	No, I'm fine. Let's go find your sister.
022	Yeah!
023	(My reason for fighting?)
024	(I can't let this child go through what I had to.)
025	(If I can fight for that...)
026	I'd be fighting for a good cause.
