001	Tch. I expected rather more from you, Red.
002	*pants* I...
003	But I must give credit where it's due.
004	A pity we will not be spending a special evening together, Lord Zheng Yi...
005	I do not doubt this will be our last meeting, either.
006	Oh my! Already looking forward to me?
007	Sorry to disappoint, but you don't make the calls. I do.
008	See you again soon, darling.
009	My lord, are you all right?
010	I am. Though I must say it felt as if they were holding back for some reason.
011	Just who are they? They're too outlandish for assassins.
012	(Their manner of dress... Those strange, alien weapons.)
013	(I can think of a number of nobles who have pledged support for such organizations.)
014	Contact Shion as soon as possible.
015	The more information we have on them, the better.
016	Yes, my lord.
017	I see...
018	Guess we'll never be able to catch a break at this rate.
019	Fufu. I'm certain I will not want for work during this period.
020	Rest assured I will darken your foyer again should there be any further developments.
021	Lovely.
022	And with that, I should be going.
023	I shall be praying for Soren's swift recovery.
024	...Well, this had better be the last of the headaches today.
025	I'm not sure if I can stand another.
026	Roxanne looks over the stack of documents in her hands, brow furrowed in worry.
027	I should check on Soren before I make headway on these.
028	If this has to do with Atropos, we're in for another wild ride.
