001	Supreme Commander! Are you all right?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
002	It is already over. If you are this slow to react in battle, you'll end up at the bottom of the sea in no time at all.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0029
003	M-my sincerest apologies.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
004	It's fine. Despite your incompetence, I'm in a rather good mood. Now, take him away.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
005	Ngh! Dangit!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
006	He's nothing more than a tool. I'm sure he has no information that's valuable to us—but it would be good to make an example of him.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
007	As you wish, Supreme Commander. I will take my leave.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0001
008	You can come out now, Vivi.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
009	Phew! That took way too long!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
010	It can't be helped. That was important. I was hardly just wasting time.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
011	Well, I'd wrap up that kind of thing quickly if it was me. I have much more fun talking to you, after all.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
012	Why did you come here, Vivi? I believe I told you never to show your face before me again.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0001
013	Did you really think I'd forgive you so easily? I don't mind having you tortured, like I did with that intruder just now.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
014	You wouldn't do that to me! I trust you, Mei Fang.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0002
015	...
016	Besides, it's normal for friends to come hang out once in a while!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
017	F-friends?! You would still call us that, even after all I have said?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0025
018	I have said some terrible things to you.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
019	Well, that's the thing...	VO_vivi.vivi_chara_1018
020	Mei Fang... I'm really sorry!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0035
021	Wh—?!
022	I didn't mean to upset you. I didn't know you hated sea cucumbers so much.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0036
023	I wanted to apologize earlier, but I got stuck finishing that job. I... I really am sorry!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
024	Vivi...
025	(Trusting others leads only to weakness. That is why I don't need friends.)
026	(However...Vivi trusts me. She even calls me her friend.)
027	(Surely that cannot be weakness. Yes... I will choose to trust her as well.)
028	N-no. I am the one...who should apologize. I...was a little harsh.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0036
029	Really? A little?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
030	Wh-what?! I have never apologized to anyone before! You should be grateful!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0027
031	Hahah! I'm just kidding! So, now we're all made up, right?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0008
032	Tch. You really are insolent. Heehee... Ahahahaha! Oh, you do amuse me, Vivi.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0023
