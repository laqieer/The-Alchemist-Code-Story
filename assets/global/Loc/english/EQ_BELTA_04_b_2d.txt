001	Aaarghhh!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0025
002	...! ...Ngh... Yaaaargh!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0019
003	Heh. You can’t hit anything if you swing big and slow like that!
004	Sharon!
005	Are you okay, Sharon?!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0019
006	Why?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0020
007	I’m fine. This is nothing... This is my duty as your instructor. I won’t let you take on any more heavy burdens!
008	What are you saying?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
009	You don’t understand what it’s like to disrupt someone’s course in life... Please cooperate and get through this!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0012
010	...I’m sorry.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0035
011	Huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
012	...This is clearly my fault. Because I didn’t listen to you and chased after them on my own...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
013	You were right that we needed to call for reinforcements. We should have left while things were calm. I’m truly sorry... This is all my fault!
014	Sharon...!
015	Please, just go!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0041
016	What are you saying?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
017	I have to take responsibility for my actions...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
018	You need to run...and get reinforcements! We can’t let Wratharis soldiers invade Envylia!
019	Sharon!
020	...Please go.
021	Are you done with farewells?
022	I don’t plan on dying.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
023	Well, you might not plan on it, but it’s happening... Finish her!
024	(Sharon! ...I can’t let her die! There must be something I can do!)	VO_berta.berta_sys_0021
025	I’m sure you’ll also understand one day. The music will teach you, when that time comes.
026	That’s right... I can fire my gun to that song...
027	(I’ll load the bullet. Quickly, like a flowing stream. I’ll just put all my feelings into this bullet...)
028	...!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0019
029	Hmph... Let me show you what happens when you casually step onto the battlefield with a weapon you can’t even handle.
030	(I won’t run away anymore. My aim is steady. My target lies on the other side of these feelings I’m about to unleash.)
031	Ughh...! Stay back!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
032	(I’ve made up my mind... Now’s the time to light the fuse.)
033	...It ends here. Die!
034	And...fire!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0014
035	Gaaaahhhh!
036	Huh?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
037	What...?!
038	I told you! I’m your instructor...and more importantly, your friend!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0010
039	I fired a shot once and it was a mistake. But this time it would’ve been a mistake not to shoot!
040	I won’t run away anymore! I will never let you die!
