001	Bud! Now!
002	Leave it to me! Huzzah!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0038
003	I've gotta admit, I'm impressed. You three can go head-to-head with the Taurus even without Mecha Weapons!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0046
004	You know what they say: three heads are better than one! Besides, the way we work together, even a titan like the Taurus is no match for us! Right, Bud?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
005	...
006	(I hate to admit it, but he's got a point. I fight much better when we're working together than when I charge in on my own.)	VO_budd.budd_sys_0011
007	Bud? Bud! Come on, back me up here!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
008	Wh-what?! Never mind that—we've got bigger things to deal with right now!
009	Good point! Time to show this Giant Taurus who's boss!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
010	Keep your head on straight, little frog. Don't get cocky.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
048	...
049	Bud?
011	Oh, uh... Yeah, Victor! Cool it!
012	You're siding with him now?! Great... Now we're bickering like an old married couple.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
013	Seriously, what's up with you guys?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
050	We've been through a lot. This is actually pretty tame for us.
051	Oh... Well, then.
014	Uh... Basheeny? Why're you staring at me like that?
015	Your Mecha Weapon... It's different.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
016	Oh! Yeah. I upgraded it a bit.
017	Is that...bad?
018	Why would it be?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
019	I mean...it's a powerful weapon.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
020	Considering everything you've told me... Maybe you don't approve of making something so powerful even more potent.
021	And...while I was traveling the world, I met someone who was pretty convinced that the Mecha Weapon is a dangerous weapon. So...y'know.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
022	It is powerful, certainly—but with you in charge of it, I must confess I'm not all that worried. You've made it clear that the Mecha Weapon's purpose is to protect the people of this world, not cause them harm.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
023	(And I think we're going to need it in the battles to come. The more powerful it is, the better.)
024	O-oh...
025	Well, good! I'm glad you think so!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0006
029	I'm actually thinking of calling this a mech gear! I won't bore you with all the technical details, but by attaching this extra doohickey here, I've managed to up the firepower a ton!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0023
030	This baby's capable of piercing straight through a Giant Taurus's core—bam! And it can fly super high! And it lets me zoom around like never before!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0010
031	Sure, not many people believe in the Mecha Weapon now... But it can do a lot of good, I just know it!
032	That's why I came here—I need to use this mech gear to take down the Giant Taurus. If I can do that, people will finally see that the Mecha Weapon is a useful invention!
033	I see.
034	However, regardless of how strong that mech gear is, you can't rely on it to win this fight for you. Remember: the Giant Taurus wiped out the entire specialized combat force. They should not be taken lightly. We need to work together to—
035	Don't worry! I've got this—really! I'm going to use this mech gear to take down the Giant Taurus and keep everyone safe!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
036	Judith...
037	(I'm going to protect everyone! Then they'll finally see that the Mecha Weapon isn't some cursed weapon...)	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
038	(And that this new-and-improved version is just as useful!)
039	Anyway! Let's get going, shall we? No point dillydallying around here! We know what we've gotta do. Right? Come on!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
040	Hey! Judith! There's no need to run! We're not in a—
041	Yeah! Hear us out before you go charging off! There's no rush!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
042	Wait...
043	Is that what I'm like? Then...	VO_budd.budd_sys_0021
044	B-Bud? You okay? Why'd you go all quiet?
045	Yeah, I'm fine... I just realized something.
046	You're trying to do everything by yourself, aren't you?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
047	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
