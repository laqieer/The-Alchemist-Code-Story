001	Where... am I? It looks like there's a school over there, but... Wait...
002	Is that... It can't be... the Tower of Babel?
003	How'd I know the name of that tower, anyway?
004	You've seen this place before. It looks just like the world from ■■■.
005	This grand library is the pride of ■■■ Academy, and all students are welcome to peruse its shelves. I would think this is your best bet for relevant information.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
006	Yeah, it's time for me to get to work! Hey—why don't you come lend me a hand?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
007	I-if you give me something to eat... I'll consider letting you meet Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
008	However, know this: So long as we don't forget about the things we've lost, I believe we will always find our way back to them—or them to us.
009	We might miss them for a time, but we can be reunited with them again. Something to keep in mind.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
010	Because if you do... you'll never remember. You'll lose those memories forever.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0021
011	The life I'm leading here is really fun.
012	But... is that what I wanted? What was I looking for, then?
013	No... It was something else. It had nothing to do with this academy.
014	When you need me, just wait for me there.
015	The place where we first met.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
016	That's it—the promise! I just remembered! I did have someone with me!
017	Kaya!
018	On a whim, you decide to follow one of the steps of a half-remembered legend, that someone you can't recall once told you...
019	And cry out that girl's name.
020	About time.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
021	...
022	Are you enjoying your life here?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
023	Here, in this world, created by your own desires? There were two: Firstly, to improve your beloved TAC; secondly, to spend time with your favorite TAC characters.
024	I... I am.
025	However, the more you grew to love this world, the more you forgot about your own, and the more you forgot about your beloved TAC.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
026	Why did you disappear?
027	Well... Every time I grew to like you a little more, I learned a little more about you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
028	Perhaps for most people things would have ended there—but I'm not most people. I'm the archaeology club's prodigy. So I continued the investigation for you, and... this is the result.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
029	I know what TAC is now. I've figured out how this world functions.
030	And after learning that... I couldn't bring myself to meddle in your affairs any longer.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
031	Kaya...
032	So that's why I'm here. It's really not like me to do something like this at all, but... I've been waiting for you.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1011
033	Come. It's time to unravel the history you've made.
034	Does that mean...?
035	You've made it this far. This is the last step you need to take.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
036	Aaahh!
037	Don't worry. You can prevail. You've won battles like this many times before.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
038	Is that a... demon? Yeah... It is! I remember now!
039	You do? Then you recall the world you once held so dear?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
040	If you start prying into that world's secrets, you're sure to encounter these creatures along the way.
041	I know... They're a troublesome enemy, but not an impossible one!
042	Precisely. Perhaps we'd better let loose, then?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
