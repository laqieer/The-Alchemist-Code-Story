001	...
002	Yna? What is he saying?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
003	It's very simple, young lady.
004	You've been searching for members of the Infinite Serpent. You wanted to catch them, talk to them. A very rational idea if I say so myself. However—
005	There was one right under your noses and you missed him.
006	No way! You're saying Yna was part of the Infinite Serpent?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0021
007	...Sorry. I know I should've told you sooner.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0035
008	Oh, I don't blame you at all. Why would you ever want your new friends to know about your dark past?
009	You would've done anything, wouldn't you?
010	To bring back that ruined Avaritia Belt of yours.
011	...
012	Well, in the end you abandoned us for brighter pastures. To search for the Sephira people.
013	Though I suppose your little venture wasn't without merit.
014	Thanks to that, I could finally get the exact coordinates of the Gula Belt.
015	Which had been so rudely been hidden by its god before.
016	In other words, you can thank good old Yna here for Zafeiris's appearance in the Gula Belt. Shocking, wouldn't you say?
017	...I... I see...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0027
018	Do you even know why he's working with you?
019	To destroy all sin.
020	...
021	...Have you been watching us this entire time?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
022	How very perceptive of you. Space-Time Manipulation is a useful thing, isn't it?
023	Agh, you're the worst...
024	The two of you have grown strong... I suppose it's true that disciples will take after their master.
025	These revelations of yours are indeed shocking, but what was the point in telling us?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
026	Yna has become one of our friends and allies. So if you were hoping to cause a disagreement between all of us—
027	Oh, not at all. I just wanted to extend an invitation.
028	An invitation?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
029	Why don't you come back to us, Yna?
030	I'll have to pass. The future the Infinite Serpent wishes to save runs counter to my own goals.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
031	And...I've already given up. The things that were lost. The things that were robbed from me. They will never come back again.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
032	What if I told you there was a way to get them back?
033	What?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
034	Everywhere you've gone. Everything you've fought. This entire time you've all been dancing in the palm of the Serpent's hand.
035	It's their intention to allow you choose the future. To let you be the final key.
036	But what I wish is to change the past. Return that which is was lost and stop catastrophe from ever taking root. Is that not what we all wish for?
037	No way... So your goal is...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0020
038	Exactly. To change history. To go back to before the Cursed Beasts were born and rewrite that which caused this suffering.
039	You can't tell me you're not interested. Wouldn't you like to see your sister again, Yna?
040	...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
041	Hold up! The stuff you're talking about is impossible!
042	Forget about going back to before the Beasts were born! There's not enough magil in the world to pull that off!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
043	You'd need at least as much magil as—
044	—a Cursed Beast?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0021
045	Oh. Now I get it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
046	The rest of us don't get it at all! Can someone explain, please?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
047	Space-Time Manipulation is exactly what it sounds like. A way to manipulate both time and space.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
048	So, theoretically, you could use it to travel to the past or future.
049	But you need LOADS of magil to pull it off. Even Ambrosia gave up on ever trying it.
050	But if you had the power of a Cursed Beast...and two cores on top of that... Some madman might just be able to convert that to a massive power source.
051	...It's just like what Icona wanted to do.
052	Are you going to repeat that same experiment here? To wield the power of the Cursed Beasts?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
053	You catch on quickly. Well, Icona was, well, something of a dreamer. Unfortunately, that didn't work out for her.
054	It isn't easy to control the Beasts. It is extremely dangerous. As you saw, it can become the last thing you try to do in an instant.
055	Returning to the past, however? Why, I'd just need to pull it off once. I simply need to get back to a time before all of this started. Before it was too late to stop them.
056	Luckily, you've already proven that the Cursed Beasts can be beaten.
057	I...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
058	You'll be able to save everyone if you follow my plan.
059	Not just the ones here. Those who lost their lives. Those you couldn't save. Everything that was lost up till now.
060	Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
061	...
062	Surely, it is not such a difficult question? Why the hesita—
063	The ground is shaking again—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
064	It's started!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
065	This feels like the rumbling we felt back when the volcano erupted. Does that mean—?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
066	Fraid so. This rumbling is unmistakable.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
067	The night of fire rain has started!
068	Mt. Shinai has shown its true form. Satna is fat, sated and ripe for the harvest.
069	Wait! We haven't finished our conversation!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
070	My queen, I...
071	...
072	Live and do whatever you desire, Sulva. My brother would've wanted it that way.
073	...
074	Quence!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
075	I'll give you a little more time to think.
076	I'll be waiting by the crater of the holy Mt. Shinai, Satna's temple and lair.
077	He got away!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
078	This feels familiar... I think he went outside!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
079	Quick!
080	W-wait—
081	That's Mt. Shinai! That must be where Quence went!
082	Nimul, look out! The fire that's raining down is taking shape!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
083	Huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
084	More of them?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
085	So many rueful, cursed lives. The destruction I bring will precipitate an end to my silence, my anger.	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0003
086	Nimul! We've got to deal with this corruption first!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
087	Right. Got it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
088	Are you ready, Yna?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
089	Yna?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
090	The old dog isn't here?! Where did he go?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
091	There's no time to think about that now! They're coming!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
092	Perish! Perish! Perish!	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0001
