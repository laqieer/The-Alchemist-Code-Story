001	Let's take on the “Subdue the Owl Beast” quest then.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
002	Huh? D-do you think we'll be alright against such a powerful monster?	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0017
003	Do you mean to complain against me choosing this quest?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0005
004	N-no, I'm not complaining, but...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
005	I can't just ignore people in trouble. And I already accepted Mirina's request anyway. So let's go!
006	Hmm... I guess it must be around here.
007	Don't you feel like there's something unusual about the atmosphere?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0031
008	Huh? Don't say scary things like that!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0017
009	Oh, something moved!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
010	Hey, don't just rush in like that!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0047
011	W-wait up!	VO_shaman.shaman_battle_0023
012	Uhhh...it's so bright...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0042
013	...Where am I?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0049
014	...!<br>W-who are you?!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0025
015	I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
016	This is the Door of Truth.
017	The Door...of Truth?
018	You must be from Arcania.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0002
019	What about it?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
020	Monsters from your world have invaded this world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
021	A link was made between a part of the continent of Babel and a part of your world.
022	A link with our world?<br>Besides, I've never even heard of this continent of Babel...
023	Unfortunately, this world's people cannot defeat these monsters of your world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0030
024	Moreover, the monsters from your world have established their stronghold around the source of these events, and they're attacking the people.
025	I summoned you here due to the powerful light in your souls, to ask you to destroy these monsters, and to destroy the source of this phenomenon.
026	What kind of monsters are you talking about?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
027	Well...it seems like this one is leading the others.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
028	Oh, an Owl Beast!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0010
029	Then it seems like our objectives are in alignment!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0044
030	Umm, Miss...Ouroboros? We are adventurers from Arcania, aiming to reach Yggdrasil, you see.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
031	And we were just asked at a place called the Twilight Tavern, to subdue the Owl Beast, who has been recently causing destruction.
032	So... even though I don't quite understand this link between worlds...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0048
033	But if there are people in trouble because of these monsters, I suppose it doesn't change what we were planning to do.
034	Hm, adventurers huh?<br>Let me ask you once more then.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
035	Please subdue the monster causing destruction in this world.
036	You have the freedom to accept or reject this request though.
037	Ahaha!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0008
038	If you ask us like that...	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0030
039	We don't have a choice but to accept your request!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
040	Good! I'll be watching over the brilliance of your souls!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
041	Huh? What is this place?	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0042
042	Oh, I've seen those monsters before!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
043	Alright, let's go then!	VO_reaper.reaper_battle_0015
044	What? Already?!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0020
