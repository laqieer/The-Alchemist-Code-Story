001	Ahhh! This is it! I can die now, without regret!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
002	Those eyes, unflinching! Impetus...! Your destiny!	VO_drei.drei_chara_1007
003	Show me how the stars of your dreams shine! Oh, how exhilarating! Is it not?! Are you not exhilarated?!	VO_drei.drei_chara_2007
004	Huzzaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0007
005	You fight well for an incomplete experiment.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
006	I'll tear you to pieces!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0010
007	Allow me to...complete you.	VO_drei.drei_battle_0014
008	Rrraaaahh!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0007
009	Let me help!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
010	Zwei! Get back!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
011	O-okay!
012	You're not going anywhere.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
013	Ack...urgh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
014	You ought be kept on a leash.
015	Let. Me. Go!
016	Nngh...! Aaaaarrrghh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
017	What a shame. You were so close...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
018	Ough... Blegh! Blarglarglarglarggggh! Urgh...! Ack...! Aaahh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
019	It is time for you to be culled.
020	Aaaahhh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
021	Not yet, it isn't!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0022
022	Oho! I forgot about you.
023	Aaaaaaaahh!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0025
024	I'm done with you.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
025	Why don't we begin with one of your arms?
026	N-no...!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0020
027	Nothing in the world matters to you, yes?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0016
028	Nnngh!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0027
029	Bang.
030	You dare cull those with potential?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
031	Hmph. Such hypocrisy.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
032	Could you not use your power to strike me down instead of wasting it on the defense of these pathetic wretches?
033	I will do as I please.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
034	Vier, Füry... Not you too?
035	Don't tell me you're going to give us a lecture? I think I'll pass, thank you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0004
036	As pearls thrown before swine... Your power could be used for so much more, yet you allow the fear of losing those around you to hold you back.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
037	...
038	I don't see anything wrong with—!
039	Stagnation is abhorrent.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
040	Huff...huff... I c-can't control...my power...!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0022
041	How pathetic.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
042	I can still...fight!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
043	Hmph. I suppose this must be your limit as a discarded failure.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
044	A...what? What are you talking about?
045	Well, you must have been defective in some aspect to have been discarded as you were.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
046	Wh-what do you mean, discarded?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
047	Oh, Iris.
048	When you avenged your father, did your target even remember you? Did you remember them?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
049	H-huh?
050	You learned to fight by watching me. You claimed to be good at stealing things.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
051	Yet why is it, do you think, that a mere unnamed bandit like you was able to grow strong enough to fight off hordes of Wratharis soldiers in such a short span of time?
052	Wh-what are you saying? You congratulated me. You celebrated how I...!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0021
053	Are you sure you actually met Yauras?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
054	Wh-what?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
055	The girl who calls herself Iris is nothing more than a replication of Yauras.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
056	Wh-what?
057	A replication?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
058	What are you saying?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
059	She is much like you, Zwei. A product of Greed Dike's experiments.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
060	They were attempting to create a soldier with unparalleled strength.
061	They decided that replicating warriors known for their martial prowess would be most effective.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
062	Using the research data obtained from Corpses and the other prototypes, they first modified one of their test subject's bodies to be more attuned to the skill set of said warrior.
063	They then imbued the test subject with Yauras' genetic information, which they had obtained from the Holy Order of Babel.
064	They even implanted false memories of Yauras into her mind.
065	This was to ensure her obsession with Yauras, so that she would aspire to be more like the original. To push her to perfect the replication of her own volition.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
066	At least, that was the plan. Unfortunately, Iris chose to focus more on her hatred than her aspirations. Such a shame.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
067	Why Yauras?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
068	It did not have to be her, I'm sure. Any accomplished warrior would have done just as well. She just happened to meet the required criteria.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0038
069	Criteria?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
070	You see, they had found an orphan with synesthesia...
071	N-no...!
072	This orphan was innately attracted to beauty, of both the physical form and of Alchemia. Hence Yauras was deemed a suitable figure to influence her aspirations.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
073	That is all there was to it.
074	An...orphan? But I... The Golden Wolves...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0021
075	There has never been any band of thieves known as the Golden Wolves.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
076	B-but... No... I'd been living with my old man since I was born!
077	Those are false memories. You have no father.
078	The overseer of the experiments was a man with golden eyes. I assume a father figure was formed in your mind based on him.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
079	Th-this can't be true! It's impossible!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0020
080	None of it was ever true. That skull that was supposedly your father's...your little bottle of jewels...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
081	All of it was mere fabrication, designed to influence you.
082	N-no...! Fabricated...?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0027
083	Unfortunately, Greed Dike's experiments rarely go as planned.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
084	The production of these replications was costing them more than they had anticipated—not to mention the lack of significant results.
085	The project was shut down and the test subjects were disposed of.
086	What better place to dispose of a test subject than in Lost Blue, the trash can of Greed Dike?
087	All the memories you have of your life before coming to Lost Blue are fake.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
088	No...
089	They were never real. It was all a lie.
090	I myself left that country, on account of my hatred for such abuse of life.
091	I was curious to learn if even a fabricated replica could gain some sense of conviction.
092	Such a shame it was that losing your original humanity turned you into nothing more then an empty husk.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
093	I-I... A...replication? I'm not... But when? Fake...?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0021
094	...
095	This is goodbye.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
096	You think we're gonna let that happen?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
097	Are you willing to delay the completion of your Templars?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
098	You're leaving, aren't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
099	Sol, you are our sun.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
100	I am nothing more than a man.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
101	You shine so brightly when you stand alone.
102	Yet your light is dimmed by the shadows of others.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
103	Plucking you from the shade would do nothing for me.
104	And if I were alone?
105	Well, I would hope that you would be waiting for me in anticipation.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
106	Not on your life.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
107	You are not meant to die here. The world will kill you, mark my words. The blue sky will be the one to crush you.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
108	For my part, I look forward to witnessing it.
109	I believe that all of you will continue to grow right up until the very moment in which you would accomplish your goals.
110	Yet it is then, I am afraid, that you are destined to be trampled.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
111	Though your personages are so beautifully warped...
112	Know that this world is even more horribly twisted.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
113	Are we just going to let him go?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
114	Zwei and Sieba are in no condition to be going after him.
115	We lost. It's over.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
116	Sol...
117	(So...)
118	(When I'm alone...)
119	Attention, ladies and gentleman!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
120	I would like all of you to show me what you are capable of!
121	For I will be cheering you on from afar!
