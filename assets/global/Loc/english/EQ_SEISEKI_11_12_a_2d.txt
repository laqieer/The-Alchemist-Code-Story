001	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
002	Agh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
003	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
004	Hey now. This isn't it for you...is it? I'm even holding back to keep my wounds from opening up.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
005	Ngh! A-as if! I won't lose to you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
006	Oh yeah... That reminds me. You're supposed to be the embodiment of justice in this world, aren't you, little miss "Lord Commander"?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
007	Armageddon Sky!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
008	Hey, I'm in the middle of speaking to your little friend here.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0013
009	What?! Argh!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
010	Kagura!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
011	You'll be last. I'm going to take my time with you, so just wait your turn.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
012	Like I was saying. Lord Commander, if you claim to be the embodiment of justice, then I cannot forgive you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
013	You will pay with your life.
014	Ugh... Pay? For...what?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
015	Lost Blue... For not conforming to the continent's definition of justice...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
016	Simply for that reason, the people of Lost Blue are ostracized by the rest of the world, even to this day.
017	If you represent the justice of this continent, then logically...you are the one who should be held responsible, am I not right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
018	Ngh! B-by what right...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
019	If people are living persecuted lives for being different...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
020	Then you may be right. I accept responsibility for my part in a system that allows that to happen. I apologize.
021	Kanon?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
022	Huh...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
023	But still...it does not excuse your hurting others!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
024	The slaughter you have left in your wake will never be justified!
025	That's just a matter of opinion. Life itself has no value. Only the strength of one's willpower can determine a life's value.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
026	Willpower?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
027	That's right. Just look at the beasts in the wild. Only the ones that are determined to survive will live.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
028	That is how the world of humans should be.
029	Are you saying we should live in a world where the weak are culled out of society?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
030	Exactly. Unfortunately, this world preaches that life itself is more precious than anything else.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
031	Such naive teachings keep the weak living among us.
032	The result is this pathetic world, in which any fool can breathe the same air as we do.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
033	Those fools outnumber the strong-willed while those who do possess a strong will are seen as outcasts and find themselves rejected from society.
034	Those with a strong will to live?! Quit romanticizing yourself!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0012
035	Lost Blue is just a collection of criminals and scoundrels!
036	Fool. They are only treated as criminals for having a different set of values.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
037	From our perspective, the true criminals are the people of the rest of this world, who live lives of complacency.
038	If you, the Lord Commander, are justice incarnate, then you are leading this world down the path of sin.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
039	That's why you must pay with your life. Your death will show the world!
040	It will show them that what we are attempting to accomplish is no mere fantasy! This world can change for the better!
041	You are free to dream whatever you like, but it will never become a reality.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
042	And why is that?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0012
043	Because I will stand in your way! It is my duty to protect this world! As long as I live, I will not let you do as you wish!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
044	That is the answer I wanted. It means that killing you is a definitive step toward realizing our goal. Simple, isn't it?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
045	I'd like to see you try! Alchemia Nova!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
046	Ack!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
047	He deflected it?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
048	Don't you get it? You cannot defeat me. This is a simple fact.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
049	Your reality is going to be a thing of the past!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
050	Primordial Big Bang!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
051	Aaaghh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
052	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
053	Tch! I hate having to exert myself. I guess I could have used a lot less energy.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
054	I-if I...survive this blast...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
055	Wha—?!
056	If my blade can reach you...we can still win!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
057	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
058	Y-you...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
059	It is my responsibility to defend the peace of this world! I cannot afford to lose against you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
060	Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
061	Nngh—graaaaaahh...! Heh. Just kidding.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
062	Huh...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
063	I-I can't move?! This is...a magic circle?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
064	Did you not learn anything from watching Othima? This is one of his signature moves, is it not?	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
065	M-magic?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
066	Ex Atmosphere!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
067	Aghh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
068	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
069	I...c-cannot lose...to...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
070	No!!!
071	She didn't rise to Lord Commander for nothing. She was tougher than I expected... Now it's your turn to die. I do hope you will forgive me for keeping you waiting.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
072	You think your magic can take me out?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
073	I know it can't. Magic is your forte. I'll just have to beat you to death.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
074	Nngh! I...can't move!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
075	Die regretting your choice to get in our way!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
076	Huzzzaahhh!!!
077	What the—?!
078	Ack!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
079	That's a magic circle, right?
080	Captain Dilga taught me that the best way to release a person from the hold of a magic circle is to punch them out of it!
081	Who...are you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
082	Me? I'm Bud Crowley! A knight of the Blue Flame Guard from Envylia!
083	The Blue Flame Guard?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
084	You're Lord Commander Kanon, correct? There's nothing to fear! More knights from Envylia are on the way!
085	Chloe and Captain Vettel of the Scarlet Flame Guard should be arriving soon as well!
086	R-run!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
087	Huh?
088	That man is out of your league! You're no match for him!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
089	What are you saying? You want me to turn my back on the enemy and run? These are not words I'd expect from the Holy—!
090	This is not a playground, kid. Stay out of my way.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
091	Agh!!!
092	H-how could you?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
093	I simply got rid of a fool who could not even grasp the overwhelming difference in our power. Prepare yourself, redhead.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
094	Nngh! Y-you're the fool!
095	You...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
096	D-difference in power? Like I care! Power isn't what decides the victor of a battle!
097	The one with greater willpower wins in the end!
098	Huh, interesting. I have to agree with you on that point.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
099	N-no! Don't provoke him!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
100	I'm d-disappointed in you all! Are you really Captain Monzein's comrades?!
101	Huh?
102	If you have conviction, there's no need to run!
103	If you can't put your life on the line now, then when can you?!
104	...!!!
105	You...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
106	I'm glad to see a youth that understands. I'm impressed.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
107	However, you suffer from a severe lack of experience. You still don't know that willpower alone cannot bend the light to your will.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
108	You need to have the power to realize your desires if you want to really accomplish anything.
109	Then show me what power you've got! I'll show you that I can take it!
110	The words of those without the strength to carry out their will are nothing more than hot air. It's time you faced the truth!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0017
111	Wh-whoa!
112	Get back!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
113	What are you doing?!
114	Isn't it your duty to protect Envylia?! Don't waste your life here!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
115	You're going to sacrifice yourself for some boy you've just met? Fine. I'll kill you first, redhead!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
116	You have caused me enough trouble. Atone for your sins with your soul!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
117	Kagura!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
118	Urk! Aaaaaahh!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
119	H-huzzaaaaaah!!!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0009
120	What the—?!
121	Ugh... Gah!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0043
122	Reimei?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
123	You're tougher than I thought. How are you still alive? Do you still not understand how pointless it is to challenge me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
124	P-pointless? Urgh...! Don't be so...sure.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0019
125	What?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
126	Urk! Y-you... When...?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
127	How...disappointing. I w-wanted to...see where your path would...take you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
128	My path? What are you talking about? You think a wound like this is going to change anything?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
129	D-don't be stupid. I'm an assassin. I would never...misjudge...my t-target's strength.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
130	And...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
131	I can admit you're stronger than me. B-but...you underestimate...what others are...capable of.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0019
132	H-hey, let go! Restraining me won't get you anywhere!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
133	Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0021
134	You're making no sense. I don't have time to play games with you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
135	L-let me take back what I said. I already know...to wh-what end...your path will lead you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
136	What?
137	I-I'm saying it's easy to see...what fate has in store for you. R-right, Kudan...stein?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
138	Wha—?!
139	Hmph. Couldn't have said it better myself.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
140	You...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
141	Agh!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
142	C-Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
