001	We are not so different, you and I.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
002	Huh?!
003	Grroogh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0003
004	What the...?
005	Phantoms.
006	I loathe Alchemy.
007	I completely agree.
008	Grooorgghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0020
009	(Alchemy from their time...)
010	Accessing database file on Demonic Soldiers. "Weapons designed for slaughter. They contain and make use of ancient Alchemy."
011	(Alchemy from my time...)
012	Method of activation: there is an ancient stone which serves as the key to their activation. Furthermore...
013	As an emergency national defense mechanism, if a large amount of Alchemia or magic is used in their presence by a foreign citizen, activation will occur automatically.
014	I have seen much evidence of the heretical misuse of Alchemy occurring in our time.
015	These crimes are more than enough to warrant your execution.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_1014
016	U-um...!
017	Now, I am not saying that I wish for us to be friends...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
018	...
019	Your anger, your sadness, and your bitterness...
020	I wholeheartedly accept these emotions as reasonable and just.
021	I...	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0019
022	The enemy of my enemy is my friend. It is as simple as that.
023	We share convictions, you and I.
024	We both know the pain of losing everyone we hold dear.
025	I...!
026	Ch-Cheryl...?
027	...
028	I am merely the administrator.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_2014
029	We may share a use of Alchemy, but I will apply the righteous punishments to your hateful sins.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_1014
030	That I protect you now is merely...convenience.
031	C-convenience...?
032	I am here, so I might as well. Wouldn't you agree...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
033	Courage?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
034	Grroogh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0003
035	Now that's a big target.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0010
036	Heh. That's right, Cheryl. If it's not costing you anything, you might as well.
037	File incoming. "Battle Records of Chance Encounter with Demonic Soldiers." Received.
038	Monocle to Goggle Hat, synchronization complete! Now I know all of the Demonic Soldiers' weak points!
039	As expected, there aren't many.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
040	Heh. Afraid to show a bit of skin? There's no need to be shy!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
041	C-Courage! What do you think you're doing?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
042	Shut up, will you?	VO_courage.courage_chara_1001
043	You need my help, right?	VO_courage.courage_chara_2001
044	Grroogh! Grooorrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0020
045	Helpless rage will inevitably morph into twisted hate.
046	Like it or not, in this world, power is a necessity.
047	Loathsome as it may be, if it will allow me to protect those I love...
048	I will not hesitate to use it.
049	I will be the one to correct and regulate the rules.
050	For without order...
051	All power, be it Alchemy, magic, or witchcraft... The creation of all of it is rendered meaningless.
052	(The meaning...of its creation?)
053	Hmhm. I hope I'm not going soft.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
054	I...
055	I love Lofia and Michael.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
056	I know.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
057	If it's for them, I can do anything, no matter how difficult.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
058	Hmhm.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
059	The bitterness is what gives it its sophisticated flavor... A fine philosophy. Perhaps this applies to life, as well.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
060	I'm glad we were able to share this!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
061	Grooorgghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
062	Nrgh!
063	I'm out of bullets! Cheryl, I'm sorry, but the rest is up to you!
064	Get back!	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1001
065	Stay away from my loved ones!
066	Let's work together!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0015
067	(Milis...)
068	(I wish I could show you right now...)
069	(You wanted me to teach you how to be a gentlewoman...)
070	(Well, if you ever meet her... Cheryl is a great example.)
