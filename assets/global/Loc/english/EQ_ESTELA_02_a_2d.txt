001	Hello, Amis. You've come back.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
002	Yes. I'm sorry I left in such a hurry the other day. Is everything alright?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
003	What do you mean by alright?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
004	I heard that after we left the other day that the you were threatened by some thug.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
005	There was no need to worry. Being a fortune teller, these things commonly occur.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
007	Did you know who the person was?
008	No. It was the first time ever seeing him. I have no recollection…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
009	…
010	In any regards, could you tell me what is concerning you today?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
011	Oh, yes of course. I apologize. First I have to thank you.
012	After your reading, I evaluated the flow about the preparation of the goods and found some concerns.
013	I managed to arrange a different route to secure the goods. They almost didn't make it in time for the ceremony.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
014	It was all thanks to your help. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure there are more things to be improved…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
015	That's why I want you to go into further detail. I think the ceremony will go well if you could tell me more.
016	…
018	Estella? Is something the matter?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0006
019	No, nothing…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0039
020	I will accept your request, but I need to know the subject deeply in order to tell you further details.
021	Then I think you should see the ceremony's preparation for your own eyes.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0003
022	Amis, take her to the Central Technology Bureau. Explain to her about the ceremony. Just not the restricted areas.
023	Understood. And you…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
024	For me, I recalled an errand I must run.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0004
025	Really… Just off by himself.
026	(But that's alright. I can't rely on him forever. I'll have to take charge of the ceremony.)	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
027	(Because, I…)
028	Amis?
029	I'll…take you to the Central Technology Bureau.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
030	Maintenance inspection of the Magitek Train is complete. It's time to do a test run.
031	Yes, sir!
032	Wow… What an enormous structure of metal. So this is the Magitek Train…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0009
033	Pretty big, isn't it? This is what we've been researching and constructing.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0010
034	Vice-captain Amis, you're back! About the amount of heat given off by the train… We'd like for you to have a look at this.
035	Let's see. So, this is… Alright. These figures look stable.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0006
036	Vice-captain, could you also take a look at this?
037	And this please!
038	(She's very passionate about the work. And she doesn't have much time to spare...)
039	(But she's calmer than when she came to see me the other day. I assume that she took my readings as my advice.)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0008
040	…
041	Hmm… That's not coming back any time soon.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0011
042	You're…?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
043	I'm Megistos. I'm a clerk here. You're that fortune teller that helped us out, aren't you?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
044	You're exaggerating. I just gave a little advice.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
045	Not exaggerating at all. Thanks to the advice, I was able to get my job done without any anxiety.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0008
046	Everyone is looking forward to tomorrow's ceremony. We've all worked hard together to get the train up and running.
047	Why is everyone so obsessed with this train?
048	Because this is a feat of engineering which could bring new possibilities for the future of the world..	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
049	Alchemic carriages are commonly used for travel, but they take a lot of time to travel far. In addition, there aren't many available.
050	But with a smoothly operating train, many people can be transported far in a single journey.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0031
051	The day will come in which even people without magic abilities could travel anywhere they want easily.
052	For engineers like us, it's an exciting time to think about, so everyone is enthusiastic.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0008
053	Even more so for Amis, who researched and developed trains from scratch.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1017
054	Is that so?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0045
055	Well, I personally think the train would be even better if it was loaded with a giant cannon…	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
056	What would be good about that? If you put a giant cannon on a train, it would collapse with the weight.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
057	Oh, you're back. In that case, I'll leave customer service to the vice-captain, and I'll go back to my post.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
058	That Megistos…
059	I apologize, I was the one who brought you here but I'm going off working and neglecting you.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
060	I don't mind. It's necessary to see you working as you would be for a better reading.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0039
061	And I can admire your positive attitude. Isn't this Magitek Train very special for you?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
062	Yes. It was something I was researching about even before I came to the Central Technology Bureau.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
063	It wasn't about having or not having the skills, but my desire to create something that would help everyone.
064	The train is sure to be dream come true for many people. That's why I want tomorrow's ceremony to be a success and your help is what we need.
067	Tomorrow's ceremony will be the unveiling of the train. If all goes accordingly, we'll be able to put it into practical use…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
068	I want everything to be prepared well. So please let me know if you see anything wrong with tomorrow's ceremony.
069	Excuse me, Vice-captain Amis. Could you please look at this? We need urgent confirmation…
070	I'm sorry, please excuse me for a bit.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0006
071	Okay then…
072	I think I have everything I need to make a reading. Let me have a little look…
073	Again, the dark shadow… This is…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
074	(It's the same shadow from before… Is this the future of a mechanical civilization?)
148	(But why? I thought I was able to help with the root of the problem, but how could that not solve anything?)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
075	V-vice-captain Amis! We have a problem. The parts needed for maintenance…
076	What happened?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0020
077	They've all been destroyed. What's the meaning of this?!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0017
078	No, this can't be! This is horrible!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
149	Jean, what are you doing here?
150	I was wondering what was going on because of the ruckus. This is troubling. You might not be able to fix this in time for tomorrow's ceremony…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
151	I was also looking forward to your presentation highly.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
152	It's alright. We'll manage to do get everything together for the ceremony.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
153	Jean, you should go back to your work.
154	Understood. But don't wear yourself out. You tend to overwork yourself.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0037
079	…
080	What are we supposed to do? These parts are specific for the train.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
081	There's no way we can get replacements! If we don't have the parts, the ceremony tomorrow…
089	We did so much to prepare for it…
090	…
091	It'll be fine. I'll do something about it. If we can't use them, we'll make new ones.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0004
092	Huh? Make new ones…?
155	Everyone! Gather the bureau's metal scraps and bring them here immediately!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0001
156	Y-yes!
093	You're going to build the parts out of scrap metal? With magic?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
095	Wait a minute. You can't do this to yourself. The amount of magic needed is too much for you to handle.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
096	But if it's the only thing we can do, I have to give it my all.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0004
157	We've brought it all!
158	Thank you. Okay… This should be enough…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0033
097	…!	VO_amis.amis_battle_0020
098	Amis!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
099	I'm alright… Just a bit more…	VO_amis.amis_battle_0019
159	We must present the train. We'll show the world what it can do. For that, I'll do whatever it takes.
100	I'll…never give up!	VO_amis.amis_battle_0010
101	…!	VO_estella.estella_battle_0019
102	So, all the parts are ready, but she's knocked herself out. Ugh… All while I'm out…	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0044
103	I don’t ever recall telling you to kill yourself over all of this…	VO_vincent.vincent_chara_1005
104	This is how much passion she had for tomorrow's ceremony.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
105	Or, for beyond tomorrow, that is.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0039
106	…
107	By visiting this place, I was able to see more of the dark shadows that haunt her future.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
108	The pressure of becoming the next director is pushing a lot of stress on her.
109	Because she's strict. I keep telling her that she doesn't need put so much pressure on herself.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0004
110	But she doesn't listen. There are some that don't her as a boss because of that.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0022
111	She has the ability to use magic, but she's making things more difficult for herself. Thinking too much is hindering things.
112	The goal of the Central Technology Bureau is to advance mechanical technology. It's not about what it's used for. Even magic can be used for advancement.
113	Being able to use magic and engineering together shouldn't lead to faults like this.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0010
114	Then why did you promote Amis as the next director?
115	That's obvious. She has passion for both mechanical engineering and magic engineering.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0006
116	Passion, you say…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
117	A while back, I asked her why she wanted to join us.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0005
118	This is what she said. "Because one machine can equal the hands and feet of ten thousand of people."	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0007
119	You can't use magic without special qualities. But not for machines.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
120	Machines can benefit everyone. They can also provide hope. It's a wonderful feeling.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0008
121	The possibilities are infinite. That's why I want mechanical engineering to help the world… All from the Central Technology Bureau.
122	Her words of "the hands and feet of ten thousand people" has basically become reality with this train.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0031
123	Her proposals were turned down a number of times, but she never gave up. And here we are now.
124	If we really are to expand mechanical technology for the future, she's what we need at the lead.	VO_vincent.vincent_sys_0007
125	I see. I also think she'd be a great leader.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0004
126	In order to create a better future, she won't give up and will do her best, no matter how difficult it may seem.
127	(And so I wouldn't want her to emotionally fall apart here…)
128	(I still can't see the crucial point. What is this dark shadow pointing towards for the ceremony?)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0030
160	(There's not enough information to make a prediction. The ceremony is tomorrow… I need more time to look for myself.)
129	(Then…)
133	Our fortune telling skills can help support people to do better.
134	Now I understand what my mother meant. I want to see a successful future. I want to be part of a successful future.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0006
135	My mother was able to do fortune telling because there were people who made her feel that way.
136	The powers that I inherited from her… Now is the time to shine…	VO_estella.estella_battle_0007
137	Good. This should disrupt the ceremony.
138	That's…	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
139	And now, this should put a stop to everything!
140	…?!	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
161	(A barrier should have been placed… Did I put too much power into the spirit divination?)
162	What can I do for you? I didn't think I had any reservations today.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
141	I got a job to make sure you stop reading fortunes. You're going to go to sleep for a little while.
142	(This is bad… I can't control my body as I want to because of spirit divination...)	VO_estella.estella_sys_0018
143	Grrraaaa!!!
144	…!	VO_estella.estella_battle_0019
145	Stop it!	VO_amis.amis_battle_0010
146	Amis?! What are you doing here?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
147	Let's talk later! First, let's get rid of this guy!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
