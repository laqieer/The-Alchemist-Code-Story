001	We managed to sneak in between the women. We've confused them, just as you planned. Well done.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
002	Wait, Dias. Look, over there! Father is—	VO_logi.logi_sys_0039
003	He's cut out of the conversation! The girls aren't even acknowledging his presence!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
004	Father, what could you have done to be ignored so...?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
005	He's been telling ancient, abominable puns.
006	Huh?!
007	Sabareta!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
008	So, you've decided to show up! Sit down!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
009	I've brought a guest. I doubt you'll be able to suppress this man's long-standing grudge.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
010	What?!
011	Go, Caesar! You've never even spoken to a woman before, but on this day, we will find ourselves girlfriends together!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0009
012	Hello! I'm Caesar! My friends call me General Caesar the Demon Flame!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0008
013	What sort of nickname is that?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
014	Th-this guy...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
015	Sabareta?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
016	Zeke!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0004
017	Father? You two know each other?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
018	Yes. He and I stood together onstage as comedians a long time ago.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0005
019	What?!
020	Heh. It's been a while, On-Fleek-Zeke.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0003
021	Good to see you again, Not-a-Beta-Sabareta.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
022	Wha...? Huh? What was that all about?
023	Those were our stage names. On-Fleek-Zeke and Not-a-Beta-Sabareta.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0005
024	We called ourselves "The Word to Your Mothers."	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0007
025	Father, please...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
026	And to think, we were going to become stand-up comedians ourselves.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0011
027	Not-a-Beta... On-Fleek... Word to your Mothers...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
028	Father, please never try to be cool again.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
029	Would you mind showing us what sort of comedy you did?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
030	Wha...? Dias?! Father is the Captain of the Blue Flame Guard! There's no way he would—	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
031	Sure, why not?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0009
032	Yeah!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0009
033	What?! Really?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
034	Feast your eyes on the sickest jokes around!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
035	Yo momma's so fat that when she fell, nobody was laughing, but the ground was cracking up!
036	Yo momma's so stupid she climbed over a glass wall to see what was on the other side!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0032
037	Yo momma's so fat her belly button gets home fifteen minutes before she does!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0032
038	Yo momma's so fat, when I asked her to touch her toes, she asked me what they were!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0008
039	Yo momma's so ugly her parents had to feed her with a slingshot!
040	Yo momma's so ugly she has to sneak up to the mirror!
041	Father...?
042	A-Agatha?!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0025
043	Why were you saying all of those horrible things?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0011
044	W-well, they're just jokes, but... I mean, I'm not talking about any specific person... You see—	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
045	Oh, dear. He's having to explain his jokes.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
046	Were they supposed to be funny? Logi, were they funny?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
047	Huh? Oh, uh... I don't... Uhm...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0011
048	Dias, were they funny?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0031
049	Honestly? I snickered a bit.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
050	As if! They weren't funny at all! They were all terrible!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0015
051	Girl, we may meet again. I will have you laughing then.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0022
