001	I'm guessing you know how to evolve it to 5★, correct? Enhance your Moon Star Armor to Lv 25, then evolve it. I'll leave the rest to you.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
002	All right, let's do a final summary.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0002
003	You can equip a maximum of three pieces of gear. Limit Break 10 times to allow for the second, and 25 times to allow for the third.
004	There are three types of gear: Weapons, Armor, and Accessories.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
005	You can use one Weapon and Armor. You can equip up to three Accessories.
006	When you use two pieces of gear that have the same effect, only the stronger one will take effect.
007	Some gear adds new effects and usable skills when evolved.
008	Specific gear, when equipped, allows you to use unit-specific Gear Abilities.
009	I'm impressed you got this far. Once you manage to turn your Moon Star Armor into 5★, show me the result.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0011
