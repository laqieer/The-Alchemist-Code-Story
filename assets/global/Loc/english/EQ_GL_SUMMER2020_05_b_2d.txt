001	And that's the last of them!
002	Monsters... gone!
003	That was some pretty splendid teamwork. It was a pleasure to watch you all in action.
004	Shion handing out compliments? Now that's a rare sight.
005	It was but a simple endeavor.
006	Still... we brought even more trouble upon the beachgoers, I don't think we can make up for it all now...
007	Eira... sorry...
008	What are you all apologizing for? Weren't you fighting to protect everyone from the beasts?
009	No one got hurt, and the fight was pretty amazing to watch!
010	Eh?
011	Yeah, the way you blasted away all those wolves was amazing!
012	Did you see how the little one pounced on those octopuses? She was so cute and so fierce at the same time, somehow that just makes we want to hug her even more!
013	Mhm! In fact, this might just be the most unforgettable summer memory. I think we can all agree that that is repayment enough!
014	It seems that our patrons greatly enjoyed our unintentional performance.
015	Well... if everyone says so, then I guess it's all good then.
016	So, what are we going to do about the competition?
017	Seeing as the food might draw out even more of the beasts, I am willing to concede a draw for today's match.
018	I agree, I do believe we have all seen enough excitement for one day.
019	I guess we'll settle this some other time then. But not in front of Seigfried! He's completely off-limits!
020	Believe it or not, I am actually rooting for you Miss Roxanne.
021	Perhaps I could provide you with a few pointers? Maybe a lesson or two in my arts of attraction?
022	I don't need your tricks, I'll win Sieg over with my own effort! I'm sure of it!
023	The bickering continues even as the sky turns a stunning crimson with the light of the setting sun.
024	(Ahhh, how long has it been since I've felt this way? I can't remember when I last enjoyed human company free of avarice)
025	(Eira's friends are truly an interesting bunch. Perhaps meeting them again in the future would be... enjoyable)
026	The day isn't over yet. We're going to party twice as hard to make up for the lost half of the day!
027	Yeahhh!
028	With a loud cheer, the fun continues well into the night.
