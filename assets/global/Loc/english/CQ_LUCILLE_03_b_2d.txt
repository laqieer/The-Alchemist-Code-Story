001	(I've never thought about what the weapons might sense from me...)
002	Phew! Looks like that’s the last of them.	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0030
003	Hey, Suiran. I have something I want to show you!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
004	Wait! Hold on a sec! Look, I get it! You don't need to pull!	VO_suiran.suiran_battle_0025
005	Ohhhh! This... This is...!	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0046
006	It's really pretty, right?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
007	Watching the sunset from here is one of my favorite things to do. I usually prefer to keep it to myself, but I really wanted to show it to you.
008	It's really, really beautiful.	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0044
009	Suiran... What you said about making my weapons sad...	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0018
010	No one ever told me that it would be negligent if I didn't take care of my hands. I've been thinking about it a lot.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
011	Everyone has always said that I have to value my life more. That never made sense to me, but if it's related to my ability to continue making weapons... Then I think I finally get it.
012	What I’m trying to say is... You really opened my eyes. Your words have inspired something in me as beautiful and warm as the setting sun.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
013	Hehe, really? So that's why you wanted to bring me here, huh?	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0007
014	I've also started thinking about what kind of feelings I want to put into my weapons when I make them.
015	One day, I'll show you the perfect weapon—one that is everything I have ever wanted it to be!
016	Sounds great! But just so you know, my weapons definitely won't lose to yours!
017	I wouldn't expect anything less! Speaking of which, I just had an amazing idea! I bet I can forge a really great weapon right now!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0023
018	Let's hurry back so I can get smithing!
019	Sure! I want to work on some stuff, too. I guess it's time for me to head back to my own workshop in Wadatsumi.
020	Thank you for everything, Lucia! I never thought I'd meet a blacksmith like you. I've learned a lot today. This has been great!	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0008
021	Same here! I'm going to do my best to apply the things I learned from you today to my own blacksmithing!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0033
022	Glad to hear it! See you around!	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0037
023	The weapon can sense the heart of the blacksmith, huh? Alright, so I’ve gotta gather all my feelings...
024	And then, with my own hand, the most valuable tool of my trade, I just put them right into the heart of the weapon! Isn't that right, Suiran?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
025	Just you wait! I'm going to make weapons as beautiful as the sunset we watched together!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0023
