001	She's not here today? Then again, I wouldn't know what to do even if she was here.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
002	I doubt a genius who skips grades would want to be friends with a problem child like me.
003	But...it's hard not to want to become her friend when I remember that look on her face.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
004	Wah!	VO_pamera.pamera_battle_0001
005	Eeek!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0027
006	Eheheh! Hello! I felt you looking at me so I came over to say hello! So... Hello! My name is Pamela!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
007	I know. You're pretty famous, you know.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
008	(Well, I didn't hear about her until recently, but still...)
009	Oh, I know you, too! You're Miss Emma, right? I heard Ms. Celine call you that!
010	Here! This is for you! It's an accessory I made! It's a symbol of my friendship!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0001
011	(Whoa, she comes on real strong.)
012	Wow! How cute!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0046
013	Really?!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0025
014	Yeah, I like things like this.
015	Eheheh. I like making accessories. Well, it's yours now.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
016	Oh, but... I haven't earned it, or anything.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0044
017	Somehow, it seems like a big step to receive something handmade by someone you've just met.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
018	Eh?
019	Really? But...that's not what matters at the heart of it!	VO_pamera.pamera_chara_1017
020	No, it is. Besides, you give the same thing to everyone, right? Frankly, it's a little disappointing to get the same gift as everyone else.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
021	W-what? Well then, what am I meant to do?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0010
022	I... I... Nnngg...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0012
023	I... I didn't mean anything bad by it.
024	No! You're right! The heart of friendship itself is somewhere in your words!
025	I-is it?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
026	If I don't get to the root of the problem, then I can never move forward.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0004
027	I will definitely make a friend, just you wait!
028	Haa...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
029	(I don't think she really needs to try that hard to make friends. She's a good kid, after all.)
030	(Maybe she hasn't always been, though.)
031	I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I'll be good, so don't be mad. I'll be good.
032	I'm sorry. I'll try harder, mama. I promise.
033	...
034	What's wrong, Miss Emma?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0022
035	Nothing.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
036	By the way, you don't have to call me Miss, or anything. We're in the same grade and I just call you Pamela, so...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
037	Really?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0006
038	O-okay! E-Em...
039	Emma!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
040	What are you doing here? Oh, Pamela, you're here, too. Have you both forgotten that we're due at group practice?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
041	Ah!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0025
042	We are?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
043	Jeez. I even checked the school infirmary for you.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
044	The infirmary? Why?
045	I remember, one time, you weren't feeling well because you'd been working too much, so you had to lie down in the infirmary for a bit, and... If that was the case, I'd... Well, I'd be...
046	Hm? Were you worried about me?
047	Of course! You're my friend!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
048	Well, if you're going to worry so much, I suppose even a problem child like me had better go to class.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0023
049	...
050	Pamela? Are you coming?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
051	Oh... No. I've been summoned by the Court Mages, so...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0006
052	What? In the middle of the school day?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
053	It seems they need me for a very important experiment, regardless of the time.
054	They do? Isn't that super suspicious?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
055	It certainly is.
056	N-no, it's nothing like that! They're always really nice and give me sweets.
057	Nice people make sure that kids can go to class. A student's job is to go to school, above all else.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
058	You're right!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0045
059	...
060	It just goes to show what a genius she really is. Though...she seems to get targeted a lot because of it.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0030
061	...
062	Hey, let's do group practice together; all three of us!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
063	Huh?	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0006
064	Even if we rush to class now, the groups will already have been formed, so let's form our own group, right here, right now!
065	Besides, with you two in my corner, I'll be able to pass without too much effort. So let's go!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0023
066	W-wait, I... That's...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0050
067	Jeez. It would be better if she just said upfront she was worried.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
