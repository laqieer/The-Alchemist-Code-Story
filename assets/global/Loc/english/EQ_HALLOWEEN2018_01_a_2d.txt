001	First we need to decorate the town, but...does this look okay? What do you think, Neica?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
002	What do I think? Well... It feels really different from last year, doesn't it?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0006
003	Yeah! I thought I'd change it up a bit this year and do a Wadatsumi style Halloween. If it was the same every year, it would be pretty boring, right?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0006
004	When I was researching Halloween I realized that it shares some themes with Wadatsumi's Bon, a holiday honoring the dead, and I thought it would be cool to mix and match a bit!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0007
005	Oh, okay. What are these vegetables with sticks stuck in them? They're really interesting.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
006	Wait! Don't eat them! That's the horse!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1009
007	It's a horse? A...cucumber...horse? Not that I was gonna eat it, anyway!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0006
008	This time, I want to do a different kind of Halloween that everyone can enjoy anew.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0010
009	I see. Well, I can see everyone being surprised... I still don't think this looks like a horse, though.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0044
010	I'd like to say I'm ready to begin preparations, but...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0032
011	Why is it only you and me?! Last year, there were way more people to help out!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0019
012	Why...? Well...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
013	What?! Isn't anybody else gonna help with pep duty—er, I mean...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0026
014	Prep duty, for Halloween this year?!
015	I've already done Halloween prep for two years running. That's enough. I'm over Halloween.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0039
016	I'm sorry. This year I want to just enjoy Halloween. I am looking forward to it, though!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0035
017	I don't mind participating, but...	VO_alexis.alexis_event_1003
018	We were told to stay indoors during Halloween. Isn't that awful?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
019	Not particularly.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0016
020	Well, I mean, I was in the middle of making a new medicine so it was kind of perfect timing, but...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
021	Awww man. Well, in that case, since we worked hard last year, too...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0022
022	Hayate, don't get your knickers in a twist. You've got this.
023	I believe that you guys have what it takes to make this the best Halloween ever.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0041
024	Magnus!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0020
025	All right! Then it's decided! I'm going to be the one to get everyone fired up about Halloween this year!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0038
026	You were the one who made that big proclamation, weren't you?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
027	I mean, yeah, but...it was all Magnus' fault! He tricked me!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0029
028	He had you in the palm of his hand, and thanks to you, we don't even have any help!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0027
029	The candy wrapping isn't even done yet! We're not going to be ready in time at this rate!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
030	It's fine! There's one more person coming to help for sure.	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1002
031	Speak of the devil! Let me introduce you to the one in charge of this year's Halloween celebration—	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1009
032	What's this?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0042
033	Hozuki! Er... Uh, what's wrong?
034	This is all wrong! What is with these decorations?! Vegetables? They aren't sparkly at all!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0015
035	S-sparkly?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
036	Halloween is precious! It needs to be more, spectacular! I want it to sparkle and shine, indiscreetly!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0013
037	Indiscreetly?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
038	And you, Neica!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0019
039	Huh? Ye-yes? I'm Neica...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
040	I heard from Fujika about you and how you can make cute accessories that sparkle and enthrall people.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
041	I-it's nothing that amazing, really.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0050
042	Incidentally, what's that in your hand?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0001
043	Huh? These? These are the candies for Halloween that I'm wrapping.	VO_nacre.nacre_battle_1018
044	I knew it! The candy wrappers are amazing! They're so sparkly and wonderful!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0023
045	R-really?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
046	Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. I am Hozuki, the head of the Wadatsumi Three Blossoms School of flower arrangement.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0019
047	I heard not only about you, but also about last year's Halloween from Fujika.
048	Now that I see them up close, the things you make really are very sparkly and cute.
049	Hmph... I won't lose this challenge!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_chara_1001
050	Challenge?!
051	This Halloween will be a million times more sparkly than last year's! I'll make it unique, as only I can!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0024
052	Yes, we need flowers!
053	We'll paint the town with flowers and have a glorious Flower Halloween!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0008
054	F-flower Halloween?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
055	Are you done, Hozuki?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0002
056	Ugh. How long is this idle prattle going to continue? Let us start.	VO_meifan.meifan_chara_1006
057	And these two are...?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
058	These two are here to help us make the best Halloween ever!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
059	The woman known as the Empress of Saga who is always out of reach, Melda, and the best name in military strategy from Greed Dike, Mei Fang!
060	We need sparkling, talented help like them to make this town shine vibrantly!
061	Why is that nickname still how I'm remembered?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0029
062	Hmph. Vivi is looking forward to this festival, and so, it needs be magnificent.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
063	Huh... So, why is that one helping us then?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0044
064	So...fluffy.
065	Uh...what?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0005
066	N-no... I said nothing.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0027
067	I just wanted to help after seeing how fluf... Ahem... How hard, you were working.
068	Oh, that's great then! Thank you!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0009
069	His ears and tail are so bushy and, so... fluffy.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0020
070	All right, then! We don't have much time, so let's get to work. Ack!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0010
071	Gwwaaaaarrrrrggghh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
072	Wh-what?!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
073	Ahhhh!!! Why is it coming this way?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0028
074	Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_c
