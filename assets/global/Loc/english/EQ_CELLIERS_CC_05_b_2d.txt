001	GRAAAAAARGH!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0007
002	GWAAAH!
003	W-wait, hold on... I was wrong, I admit it! Please, spare my life...
004	...Unforgivable.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0012
005	Ah! M-my fingertips are crystallizing... S-stop! Anything but that!
006	It was a lie, I swear! I just took her ribbon, I haven't touched her! I'm begging you—
007	Celliers! You have to stop this!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0015
008	...M-Mielikki? Why are you here?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
009	I couldn't find you, so I came to look for you! I knew you had to be around here somewhere!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
010	I know you, after all. You like walking in the woods, don't you, Celliers? You and I strolled in the forest by the village time and time again.
011	Mielikki...
012	Pull yourself together, Celliers! You can't do this... You can't use such a beautiful power for something like this!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
013	I... I...
014	Oh! I-I'm doing this to...a person?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0027
015	You've got to rein in your power somehow! What you're about to do can't be undone!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
016	Y-yes, you're right! I have to stop it...
017	No, I can't. I can't stop it... What do I do, what do I do?!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
018	(Turning someone to crystal... That's an unthinkable act, I know as much...)
019	(Even so, I'm taking this power Mielikki loves, and committing such an awful deed in front of her!)
020	Ah, ahhhhh...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0022
021	...This isn't good. Celliers' mind has been thrown into disarray. If this goes on—
022	Hey! Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0021
023	Wha—Mielikki?! S-stay away, it's too dangerous!	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1012
024	It's fine!
025	No, it isn't! I can't control my power! I might turn you into crystal.
026	This power, this awful power...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
027	I said it's fine! I've worked my butt off for just this occasion.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
028	Huh?! What is this... It feels so warm...
029	You know what, Celliers? Your power doesn't scare me.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
030	I mean, you always used it to save me, or to make other people happy, didn't you?
031	I watched how hard you worked, making crystals that bring people joy.
032	That's why I love that power of yours—why I love YOU, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
033	...!
034	Oh! It stopped...!
035	Thank you, Mielikki...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0018
036	Hell's bells, I'm finally done. I have no love for this sort of paperwork...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0011
037	How are things looking, Flamel? Can Mielikki return to the village?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
038	Indeed. The soldiers have all gone, and she's received permission to travel.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
039	The men who went after you will be forced back to their country.
040	Is that so? I'm happy for her...
041	What do you mean, for her?! You're coming back with me, Celliers! That was the whole point of my training!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
042	Training?
043	The truth is...while you were separated, Mielikki underwent training in Saga.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
044	S-Saga?! You went that far away, Mielikki?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0026
045	Yep! My magic is kinda unique. Not much I could do to improve myself at Sis' laboratory, from what they said.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
046	That's when Flamel introduced me to a woman named Peridot!
047	Hmph... I see. Your power invokes the surrounding Alchemy, improving its very flow.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
048	Your penchant for growing vegetation seems to stem from this power as well. This is unlike any average magical technique.
049	If you wish to develop this power, you should commune with the nature here, and undergo training.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
050	(...Still, I never expected that man to ask anything of me.)
051	(To think we'd remain connected like this, despite being unable to meet... Human connection is an esoteric thing, indeed.)	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0007
052	So that's what happened. Still, why did you decide to do all that?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0045
053	Because, Celliers... I couldn't stop you. Even after you got upset for my sake.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
054	...!
055	I wanted to do something for you in return. That's when Flamel said that I might be able to help you.
056	That's right. When we first met, I could sense a special quality within her.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
057	Mielikki's sister also spoke often of her—how her sister's talent surpassed even her own.
058	We invited her into our ranks on multiple occasions, but were always refused. "I can't protect my flower bed if I'm in the capitol," she'd say.
059	Well, duh! You know how important my flowers are to me! And besides, how am I supposed to stay calm in such an urban sprawl?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
060	I can't imagine my powers getting any stronger in a place like that...
061	Still, Mom always said to use my power for the things I really care about. That's why I made my choice.
062	The training was no joke, but all I had to do was look at the crystal you gave me to stay strong, Celliers.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
063	After all, it was all to be with you—to back you up!
064	Mielikki...
065	So! That means we're going back together! Got it, Celliers?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
066	B-but... Is it really okay?	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
067	I almost turned a human to crystal. How can someone like me live peacefully in that little village?
068	So long as it was an isolated incident, I see no cause for concern. I'm the only one who saw you, anyway.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
069	And I do mean isolated. We'll be in trouble if it happens again...
070	Never fear, Mielikki's here! Me and Celliers, our powers are a perfect match, after all!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
071	Wait, really?
072	She speaks true... Our research has shown that your power remains incredibly stable while you two are together.
073	Your magic has the power to undo Celliers' crystallization, much like you did when healing that soldier. So again, no cause for concern.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0003
074	Woohoo!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0023
075	M-Mielikki?! Don't hug me out of the blue like that...!
076	I'm just so happy! Don't you worry, Celliers! I'm here to protect you!
077	Oh, uh, m-me too! I'll protect you too!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
078	(...This is truly what it means to use your power for someone's sake. Celliers should be just fine from now on.)	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
079	Now then, nothing up my sleeve... Aaand PRESTO!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0032
080	Whoaaa, incredible! The flowers are all back to normal!
081	How do you like me now?!
082	Amazing... Huh? Is it just me, Mielikki, or do you seem kind of disappointed?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
083	Well... It's kind of a waste, to be honest.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
084	I feel bad for the blooms that were turned into crystals, but the crystal flower bed was gorgeous, you know?
085	Mielikki...
086	Oh... One of the flowers is on the ground! I bet one of those jerks broke it when they stomped around. Poor thing...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
087	Let me see it, Mielikki.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
088	Okay, here you go.
089	Oh wow, a crystal flower! Thanks, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
090	See, I said you had a beautiful power! I just adore it.
091	Mielikki...
092	(I hated this power of mine for so long—like an abominable curse that weighed heavily on my shoulders.)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
093	(Even so, this power gave me a chance to meet Mielikki.)
094	(And now, it let me see her smile.)
095	...Thank you, Mielikki. I'll do all I can.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
096	I've been saved by you over and over. Just like you went all out for me, I'll work hard for you.
097	Celliers...
098	After all...your smile means the world to me.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0008
