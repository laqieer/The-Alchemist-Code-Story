001	Whoaa...! Not good! Those dogs are still chasing us! Go faster!!!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
002	The road to the Central Intelligence Administration...should be this way, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
003	Bzz... I've heard that the destination has moved up ahead. It should come into view soon.	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0004
004	Alkemono, are there any signs of a trap?
005	There are Guard Droids, aye, but their numbers aren't especially large.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
006	You still haven't answered my question. Why did you help us?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
007	Bzz... As my neural circuit has already reached the end of its use...I was left there to await dismantling.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
008	You called out to me...and awoke me again.
009	...Just that?
010	No... I'm also curious about him.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
011	Aye?
012	In Allie?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
013	Wait...are you a lady?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
014	No...I'm not.
015	...Nope, it's not.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
016	I didn't say anything.
017	Bzz... It's not a sensation of attraction for the opposite sex... My interest is in his human-like emotions...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0008
018	Alkaroid, you're interested in me, aye?
019	Yes. We are nothing more than machines who follow human commands.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0004
020	But...you are different. You seem to be fulfilled...with the human-like feeling of satisfaction.
021	Hmm. I don't really understand, aye. But I'm happy with Fiona and everyone here!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
022	Happy... I see... You have built trust...with humans...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0010
023	Aye?
024	You must be interested in his soul!
025	Jeez. Looks like you were influenced by Alkemono.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
026	Not good! The Hounds are after us!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
027	Tsk! No time for leisure conversation. We need to shake them off our tail!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
