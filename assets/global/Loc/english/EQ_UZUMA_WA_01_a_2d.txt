001	Uzuma...I give you this hourglass. Take good care of it.
002	If anything happens...I'm certain this hourglass will protect you.
003	(Mother? Mother...where are you? Answer me!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
004	(No...no... My feet are sinking... I can't walk anymore!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0020
005	(I'm sinking! Ohh...no...I can't...breath...)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
006	... ...!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0019
007	It's...morning.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
008	(I'm...alive.)
009	It woke me up again today.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
010	You're going out early today, "Mina."	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
011	Gotta work! That's right, old man! I heard there was a famous fortuneteller in this town. Do you know where I can find her?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
012	Oh, are you talking about Uzuma? She does her fortune-telling at the corner of the square where there aren't too many people.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
013	...But she's got a dark atmosphere about her. Besides, there are some bad rumors about her.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
014	Bad rumors? Is she a fraud?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0006
015	No, not those kinds of rumors. Her divinations are certainly accurate, but...she sees things.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
016	She sees people's deaths.
017	When she foresees someone's death, they really do die. Some believe that she uses her power of divination to kill off people who badmouth her.
018	Thus, she's received the nickname Messenger of Death.
019	Hmm. Messenger of Death, huh?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
020	I don't know what business you have with her, but I'd stay away from her if I were you.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
021	Sorry for keeping you waiting!
022	Seriously! You're late, dad! Come on! Let's go!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1015
023	At least let me eat my breakfast in peace. Honestly, you're so impatient. Who raised you this way?
024	Hahahah. Indeed, I wonder who. Reminds me a lot of a strapping lad I knew. He was filled with energy and vigor, always running about where he pleased.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0008
025	Tsk. Right. Oh, by the way...breakfast was delicious, old man.
026	Thanks for everything. Take care of yourself.
027	Hey, enough with the formalities, "Uhara"! You make it sound like this is our final farewell!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
028	Come and drop by the next time you're around these parts!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
029	Heh. Will do, old man.
030	Dad, hurry!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1015
031	Fine, fine.
032	"Uhara", huh? This pseudonym has come in handy over the years. All right, let's go Miuna.
033	Finally!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
034	(The hourglass...the falling sands... It calms me...)
035	... ...! Fate...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
036	(Today...someone will die again... Maybe...it will be me!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
037	(That tree that is supposed to be protecting us...is gone now... My mother...is gone now...)
038	I wish this divination...were wrong.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
039	Uzuma...the feared fortuneteller, known as the Messenger of Death.
040	The father and daughter hurry to her, these two who will one day be remembered as the legendary blacksmiths.
041	When these three meet, the sands of destiny will reverse their flow.
042	And when every last grain of sand has fallen, they will arrive—
043	(That man...will find a gold coin on the ground, but...he will gamble with it...and ultimately suffer immense loss.)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
044	(The lady's husband is having an affair with a barmaid...)
045	Sigh...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0030
046	(Why do I always see such bad things?)
047	Found you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
048	?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
049	(What a frightening man! Who is he?!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0020
050	Oh! There she is!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
051	?
052	You're the fortuneteller called Uzuma!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
053	Um...ye-yes, but...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
054	(Huh? That man from a moment ago is gone...)
055	We want you to divine the whereabouts of what we're searching for.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
056	Oh...	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0019
057	...Hey, are you listening?	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1015
058	Miuna, it's rude to ask like that. Seriously, who raised you?
059	You did, dad.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
060	Ack. Ah...anyway, putting that aside.
061	Ah, Uzuma, was it? Do you know about the mineral called Sephirium?
062	Sephirium...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
063	You do?! Please, tell us where it is!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
064	In the past, it could often be mined around here, but now...	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1008
065	We know that. Right now, it's a rare mineral, isn't it?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
066	It's absolutely necessary that we obtain it. We want you to divine its whereabouts!
067	Ve-very...well. I will divine your request.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
068	...From mercy to severity...the road of force...sublimity to...forever? Furthered ahead...the road of majesty...oh, no...it collapses!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
069	Origins, kingdom...is this the road of judgment? No...the reversing tides of the desert! There...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0021
070	U-um...I didn't really understand that, but...is there still some Sephirium lying around?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
071	...Yes. It is within the Temporal Cave...hidden in the desert.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
072	Hey, who's sneaking around back there?
073	?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
074	...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
075	...You're the man I saw earlier!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
076	I've finally found you...Uzuma. I'll have you come with us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
077	Huh...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
078	N-no...!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0022
079	Miuna, take her and run!
080	Understood!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
081	Eeek...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0025
082	Don't let her get away! Chase her!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
083	Huff...huff... O-ohh!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043
084	They're still chasing us, huh? Miuna, can you manage?
085	Leave it to me, dad!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0038
086	So you've given up, huh? Now hand Uzuma to us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
087	No way! We still have questions we need to be answered!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0039
088	Are you going to resist us? What can one little girl do?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
089	Hey. Take Uzuma by force.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
090	How dare you make fun of me! I'll tear you to pieces!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0016
