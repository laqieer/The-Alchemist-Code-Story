001	What's this?	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0025
002	Wh-what's going on, man?!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0029
003	Who are you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
004	Guess you won't be lowering that sword of yours.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
005	Of course not. Why would I when I have no idea whether you're friend or foe?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
006	I'll ask you again; who are you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
007	What do you mean by that?
008	Very well. Allow me to answer. We are travelers.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0037
009	We appear to have lost our way. We are unaware of our current whereabouts.
010	What country are you from?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
011	Country...	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0010
012	You can't even tell me where you're from?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
013	...We're from the Kingdom of Lucis.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0039
014	...Lucis?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
015	Judging by the look on your face, you've never heard of it before.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0006
016	Now would you kindly answer our question: where are we?
017	This is Northern Pride. We're just on the border of Slothstein.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
018	Where the heck is that?!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
019	So, you really do know nothing.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
020	Those names are unfamiliar to our world.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
021	Let me ask you another thing: do you know who those soldiers were?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
022	That would be the Imperial Army's Magitek Axemen. They're pursuing us.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
023	So, you know their names...
024	(Are the appearance of those soldiers and monsters somehow related to these individuals?)
025	Um...couldn't you put away that sword of yours?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0020
026	Fine. I'll believe your story.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
027	I'm Dias. And you are?
028	...My name is Ignis.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
029	Oh, um, you can call me Prompto.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
030	...I'm Noctis.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_1041
031	The name's Gladiolus.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0004
032	So what're we gonna do from now?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1001
033	Well, obviously we've got to find a way to get back.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0050
034	A way to get back? I came here on a mission to investigate the mysterious soldiers and monsters.
035	If you know their identity, that makes my job a lot more convenient.
036	Most likely, their appearance is connected to yours.
037	Indeed. It appears the Magitek Axemen are somehow relevant to our situation.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0045
038	If we can get you back, most likely they'll be gone from here as well. Would you accompany me in my investigation?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
039	That appears to be a convenient solution for us as well.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0037
040	Enough talk. Looks like they're back.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0018
