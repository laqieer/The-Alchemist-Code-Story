001	U-um... Th-thanks.
002	Edgar. I knew I could count on you to keep her safe.
003	Logi. So that was you, was it?
004	Yep. But I didn't come here alone.
005	I'm glad you're safe, Kasumi.
006	Tina! I'm so glad you're here! Liz... Is Liz all right?!
007	She's resting in the Cavern of Curing. Flappy's with her.
008	Curing...?
009	Lisbeth...is being taken by the Darkness.
010	What?!
011	She saved you by taking the Darkness that enveloped you into her own being.
012	If we do not defeat the Destrolurk, she will likely remain in that state...indefinitely.
013	No...!
014	Allow me to apologize. We shouldn't have left you out of such an important discussion, especially one that concerned your fate.
015	...
016	My name is Logi Crowley. No need to ask for your name.
017	Right now, our allies are preparing for an all-out attack. We are going to defeat the Destrolurk and free the Tower of Babel and the Grand Excelsior both.
018	...
019	This is surely our last chance...our final stand.
020	We have absolutely no right to ask you to sacrifice yourself for us; nor should we. However...
021	Even knowing that, for the sake of all those innocent lives who would otherwise be lost, I have to ask you...
022	Please... Save us.
023	Kasumi...
024	I'll do it. I'm...not sure if I will be able to use my powers again, but even so, I... I have to save Liz!
025	Even with your powers, Kasumi...in order to defeat the Destrolurk, you...
026	I'll be destroyed... But that's not set in stone, is it? Things might be different this time around.
027	That is...possible, but—
028	Besides, standing still won't get us anywhere, so...I'll do it. Please, let me help you!
029	Thank you, Kasumi. The fate of this world rests on your shoulders.
030	What the...?!
031	They must know of our plan! If we don't begin the attack soon, all will be lost!
032	I suppose there's nothing else for it. We've just gotta do it. I've made up my mind...and so have you, right, Kasumi?
033	Right!
