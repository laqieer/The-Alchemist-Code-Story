001	Malta!	VO_ishido.ishido_favorite_1004
002	...
003	I don't sense any darkness. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her Alchemia, either...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
004	It doesn't seem like it is the change in Sephiron that is affecting her.
005	So does that mean she'll be okay?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
006	It seems like she just fainted.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
007	Th-that's good! Right?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
008	I'm more concerned about Sephiron. What is that bright light?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
009	The Sacred Stone is attempting to awaken.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
010	Lord Waginau?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0027
011	I came here as soon as I heard there was something unusual happening with Sephiron. Hm... I thought that might be it.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
012	You know what is causing all this?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
013	I have an idea, but no proof. However, I know of another time Sephiron reacted in this way.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
014	Tell us! What was it?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
015	It was Beelzebub. Someone came here with the intention of releasing the Sacred Stone, and Sephiron began to go into a frenzy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
016	The bright light of Sephiron is a result of its attempt to awaken and purify the gluttonous power as it also begins to unfurl. It is trying to prevent these lands from being taken over.
017	Sephiron is...attempting to awaken?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
018	Yes. That is Sephiron's role as that which holds a certain "door" within herself.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
019	But...she is weak.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
020	Lord Waginau?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
021	It is nothing. I am simply thinking out loud. Why don't you return home for the time being?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
022	I heard that you were caring for a boy... Hisham, was it?
023	He will be quite distressed by these sudden changes as well, I suspect.
024	This is true. Please excuse me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
025	Sephiron is old now. With this meager light, she will not be able to stop the curse of the Sacred Stone.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
026	We must come up with a plan to stop this now. If not, the land will again be swarmed by the crushing jaws of gluttony.
027	To prevent that, the Chief of this village must be courageous enough to call for a resurrection ceremony.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
028	...
029	Father...?	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
030	Malta... You're awake.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0009
031	Father, I received a prophecy from Sephiron.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
032	One that said...the time for the resurrection ceremony draws near.
033	Ah.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0025
034	That's... I see. If the great tree, Sephiron, demands it, then...	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0021
035	Forgive me, Malta, that I am so powerless.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0035
036	No, I understand the situation, Father. To save this country, these lands... This is all that we have left.
037	I am sorry.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0042
038	Kamui...
