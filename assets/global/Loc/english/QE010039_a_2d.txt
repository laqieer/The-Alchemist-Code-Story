001	Impossible! When did you obtain so much power?! What happened?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0025
002	Nothing. I just recalled the path that I needed to follow.
003	The path you need to follow? Is that saving your sister Agatha?

016	They willingly exchange their flesh for power?! They must be extremely determined!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
017	No, wait. I, too, am willing to gamble my life.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
018	I must also determine myself! I must not fear to sacrifice anything in order to follow the path set out for me!
