001	So Superbia Belt is actually the vestiges of the dragons' world?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
002	Just a small fragment of it, but yes.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
003	Which is apparently why this is considered to be the only worthy spot to carry out the technique the dragons created—that being the Ceremony of Creation.
004	Wait, you mean...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
005	It's why Father calls the people of Superbia Belt the Pride of the region.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
006	They know they're going to be sacrificed, and welcome that fate with open arms. They're actually proud of the fact that they're the ones chosen to be the foundation of the new world.
007	These humans, so weak and transient in their existence, hold their inevitable demise as some kind of twisted mark of actual Pride!
008	What a bleak outlook...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
009	Naturally. The very laws of the world—the Truth, as we know it—will be rewritten from dust.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
010	There will be no small number of casualties, and many beyond that will be forced to abandon their lives as they've known them.
011	In a way, though, you're just like them.
012	You're willing to literally lay down your life to fulfill an uncertain goal. How is that any different?
013	They really are just like me...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
014	So you finally see it too?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
015	I do. But there is one difference. In my case...I take no pride in the death that awaits me.
016	It's little more than self-indulgence, really.
017	Is that so?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
018	I'll stop Shahel, and the Ceremony of Creation. I'll show you that I really can shoulder this burden.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
019	I'm sure that my brother, too, would wish just as strongly to save the people of this region.
020	Seems pretty prideful to me. Maybe even arrogant.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
021	Perhaps so. You would not be the first to regard me as such.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
022	But say what anyone will of me, I intend to see this through to the very end.
023	Yes, you do. That much is clear.
024	Crystal. And I'm afraid it makes you our enemy.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0016
025	Who's there?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
026	Ignacio!
027	Well met, Emmel. Apologies for interrupting your conversation. It's...all I seem to be doing to people today.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
028	Ignacio, I—!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
029	I overheard everything. You're planning to stop the Ceremony of Creation.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
030	Ignacio...
031	I may be prone to outbursts from time to time, but I still consider myself a good and loyal son. If that Ceremony is what my "father" wishes, then I will do what I can to see it transpire.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
032	And what of the wishes of your sister? Would you hear those out as well?
033	Dear sister, you're not wishing, you're acting. Impulsively, at that. And I can't very well hear out actions, now, can I?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
034	You little...!
035	Look. You're not a high elf. You do know what that means, right?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
036	Well... Of course I do.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0045
037	I don't. What am I missing here?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
038	As I mentioned before, we high elves are the Gardeners created by the dragons.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
039	And gardeners using their gardening tools to take lives would not only be tragic, it would ruin the tools as well.
040	To safeguard against this, we high elves have a warding mechanism in place that keeps us from hurting one another.
041	So your very own life is...bound?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0026
042	That's a very good way to put it, yes. But this ward does not apply to humans. And right now, we have a human who very much intends to shoot us.
043	Be on your guard. Ignacio might not be the best at using magic, but his fighting skills and, more to the point, his accuracy are definitely a cut above!
044	Understood!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
045	Stop moving! You're just making it harder for me to shoot you!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
046	But you are going to shoot, either way.
047	Of course I am! And I'll certainly try not to hit any vital organs, but that would be a lot easier if you'd just stop moving so much!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
048	You're not exactly selling that plan...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0010
