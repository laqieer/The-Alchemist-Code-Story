001	Huzzahhh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0006
002	Graaaarghh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_c
003	Are you all right, Silma?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
004	I-I am! Thank you!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0033
005	Hahah. I'll never be a match for you, Sis. I've always known that.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0011
006	Silma...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
007	You've always been so strong and kind... You're my hero. I love you so much, Sis.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
008	Silma, I...
009	Still, I understand why you have to go. It's too important to you.
010	But even so, you came back...for me.
011	I guess that's what heroes do, huh?
012	Heheh. You might be right about that. I'm your hero, and Lord Zahar is mine.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
013	I will return to this forest. I will come back to you, Silma.
014	I know. I just hope I'll be all right on my own.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
015	I think you will. After all, you're a hero, too. To Polyma and Minera, and to all the children of the forest.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0001
016	H-huh? Really?
017	Yes. That is why I know that I can entrust this place I hold so dear to you.
018	Huh? The forest?
019	This spot right here. Under this great tree.
020	We used to lie here, side by side, and doze off with our backs against the trunk. Do you remember?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
021	Yeah! I do!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
022	In my darkest moments, I treasured the time I was able to spend with you in this quiet forest above all else.
023	What I care for most in this world, what I wish to protect more than anything else, is you and Lord Zahar.
024	I get it! You want to help Lord Zahar, just like how I want to be there for you.
025	The Shadow Messiah are gone. You were right to remind me of that.
026	But so long as you and I still stand, the Shadow Messiah that Lord Zahar left to me will never truly be gone. It remains with us.
027	That is why I will return to this forest, just like I promised.
028	Lord Zahar is in good hands with you, Sis. All I want is for you to...to...do your best. If you're going, go! With your head held high!
029	Silma...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
030	It's okay. Really! I'll take care of the forest for you.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0038
031	This place is special to the both of us, and I'm going to be its protector!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0032
