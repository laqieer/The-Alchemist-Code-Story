001	"Those without form, come forth from the sea of the void!"
002	Agh?! Ngah!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0019
003	I...?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
004	I was...killed. By Nimul. How am I still alive?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0027
005	Do not tell me that you thought an injury like that would end you, Julia.
006	Your Highness? What is the meaning of this?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
007	Even after succumbing to corruption and losing my original body, I am still human.
008	Sinners are not exempt from death. That was my sole salvation, and yet...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0031
009	That would be correct, if you were a mere Sinner.
010	What are you talking about? I am a Sinner! The unyielding greed and grudge that sustains me is proof!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0027
011	You are mistaken. Sinners have no such cravings.
012	What?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
013	They are nothing more than beasts that have fallen and been devoured by corruption. They have no mind, nor desires.
014	But you are different.
015	Julia, you have not been consumed by corruption. You were chosen. You are the priestess of Beelzebub.
016	Chosen...?
017	Most Sinners lose all ties to their previous lives and live new ones.
018	But you carry so much... Too many memories, too many emotions...
019	That's not true! I only feel an ever-churning and yearning gluttony in my heart, one that cries out for me to consume everything and become one again!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0018
020	That urge is not your own. That is a phantom pain, caused by Beelzebub accumulating sinful magil...
021	You are linked with the Cursed Beast, Beelzebub.
022	You cannot be destroyed. You cannot die. So long as Beelzebub exists in this world, you will too exist, undying.
023	...
024	And that is why you are the key to awakening Beelzebub fully.
025	What?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
026	That hunger that has taken root in you and that you feed with your longing...
027	That will be what truly arouses Beelzebub from its slumber.
028	My body...? No, I can't... I don't ever want to go back there again...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0025
029	Pitiful soul lost in sin... I can give you one last mercy. In the end, you will be with your master.
030	So my conclusion is that the Asmodeus and the Belphegor we are seeing aren't the real ones.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
031	Could you explain in detail?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
032	Ah. First off...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
033	All of the Cursed Beasts we've encountered so far have had what we can call "sanctuaries".
034	These sanctuaries are what we can call their territory. In a way, it shows their sovereignty.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
035	That's because all the sinful magil the Beasts have gathered fills up that region!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
036	So basically, their territory is like its home base, I guess?
037	That's why our abilities have been weakened in their sanctuaries. Pretty dangerous, really...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
038	But as far as we can observe, the two Beasts' sanctuaries aren't expanding.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
039	That's a good sign, but...do we know exactly why this is?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
040	The current prevailing theory is that it's because they no longer have their cores as Cursed Beasts. It would make sense.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
041	I think we said this in our first report, but those are shadows of their true forms... Little more than chunks of magil that have taken shape.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
042	Perhaps something is happening with the cores sealed away inside Emmel...
043	We believe that's the most likely reason for the illusions of the Cursed Beasts we've seen.
044	To Emmel herself?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
045	Nimul...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
046	I know. If we get thwarted here, there's no way we can save Emmel...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
047	...
048	So basically...
049	The Asmodeus and the Belphegor there aren't real. Even if we don't attack with our full forces, we should be able to handle them.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
050	So... This is just a proposal, but how about spitting into three groups?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
051	To divide our power like that sounds...risky.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
052	I realize the danger, but right now we don't have many other options.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
053	Corruption keeps spreading, and with the Cursed Beasts showing up... And we don't know if Emmel is safe...
054	We can't afford to leave any of these situations be. It'll be rough, but we've got to move forward, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
055	That's right! This is such a pain to deal with but we've gotta handle it all at once!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
056	I see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0045
057	What do you think, Nimul?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
058	I think that Adaleigh's proposal makes sense...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	But if anything goes wrong and our forces are scattered, or if this plan itself is a mistake from the start...
060	Even if it's an illusion, a Cursed Beast is a Cursed Beast. If it is not put down, it will affect the other moving pieces of our plan.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
061	I want to make sure we have as much power as possible to handle Beelzebub...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
062	We'll handle Asmodeus.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
063	Yeah. I guess it was always going to come to this.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
064	Then I'll handle Belphegor!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
065	Can you really handle it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
066	I know from our previous fight that Belphegor is a destroyer of the land.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
067	If I attack from the air, it'll always be a step behind.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
068	That is why Icona was able to restrain it back in the Acedia Belt Region.
069	With Antares and the rest of the airship's defenses, I should be able to deal with it.
070	I also have the benefit of knowing most of the Beast's behavior already. If all goes according to my plan, I'll be more than a match for it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
071	On our end, we've got a plan that Ambrosia cooked up!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
072	Since the beginning, subduing Asmodeus just as our Master wished has been our plan.
073	If we fail to defeat an incomplete, coreless Cursed Beast, then we'll definitely have to revisit our training.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
074	Noooooo! That'd be the worst!
075	I see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
076	In that case, I will leave this to you three.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0041
077	Right!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
078	Okay!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
079	Great.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
080	Then, we'll lead the warriors by land through the path Adaleigh will open up for us, and slip into where Beelzebub lies...
081	And from there, it will be your turn to shine. Can we count on you, Eulalia?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
082	Of course.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
083	I will play the part of priestess of the Sephira and put Beelzebub to sleep. That's what you need from me, right?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
084	Yes. And then Yna, Waginau, and I will settle things with Zafeiris and save Emmel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
085	We will finish Beelzebub off after that.
086	(There is already proof that we can use Alchemy to eliminate corruption. All that's left is simply a matter of output.)
087	(I now also have the power I gained from the Reincarnation Ritual; the protection of the Godwolf Asena.)
088	(By combining the power of Alchemy with this magil, I should be able to completely purify any corruption of any Cursed Beast.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
089	(More importantly, Emmel will no longer have to bear her burden alone!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
090	All right, so our battle plan has been set. The war starts from now. Let's all get ready!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
091	We depart tomorrow morning. It is likely that the decisive battle for this world is tomorrow. Let's make sure we win, and everyone returns safely!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
092	Hmm, I need a wrench! A wrench...
093	Is this it?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
094	Ah, thanks. What's up? You're not usually by yourself.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0034
095	Because this is within Libra's range. I'm connected with Mira by Space-Time even if we're physically apart.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
096	I see...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
097	I'll go ahead and change the topic. That lack of interest is rather harsh...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
098	You could say that, but it's more that I'm busy right now!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
099	I have the maintenance of the Engineer Soldiers and the airship to do, and I've gotta do it all by myself, you know?
100	Small talk uses up too much precious brain power right now.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
101	Anyhow, didn't you come here to calibrate Libra?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
102	Not really. Our preparations are the same as usual. It's all we can do right now.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
103	Don't make that face! So what's up? You just came to chat?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
104	That's not quite it. There's just one thing I've been wondering about.
105	Wondering about what?
106	When will you tell Emmel about your feelings?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
107	Wh-whaaaaaaaat?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
108	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to catch you off guard.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0036
109	When did you notice?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
110	From the very beginning. Everything in your attitude.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
111	Ack!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
112	You're the very definition of someone who has their heart on their sleeve. Everyone's already knows, I think.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
113	What? You mean, Emmel too...?
114	Eh... I don't think she's ever even considered herself as someone who can inspire feelings like that, so...probably not.
115	That sounds about right! That's a relief...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
116	Uh, isn't it kind of a bad thing. Unless...you plan to part without telling her anything?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
117	I haven't been planning anything like that... Even after we take care of Beelzebub, we'll still have four more Cursed Beasts...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
118	Even so, this journey will end at some point.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
119	Ah...
120	I can't. Not yet.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
121	I'm still too much of a kid.
122	Oh. I didn't realize you were self-aware now.
123	Back off, okay! It's just... I can't protect Emmel as I am now. It's not practical.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
124	A spineless man such as myself has no right to confess.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
125	I've gotta get stronger, cooler... I've gotta grow up.
126	Well, if you're fine with that. I have nothing else to say.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
127	Anyway, why'd you bring this up?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
128	I've just been wondering.
129	Uh, okay. Whew! We still have a ton of components! With these, we should be able to go all out tomorrow.
130	There should be some in the hangar. If you're free, you mind checking if any of the magil tools need any fixing?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
131	Yeah, I'll take care of it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
132	Cheers!
133	...
134	This isn't something I want to say but...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
135	I don't know if she has enough time left to wait for him to be ready...
136	...
137	Eulalia?
138	Hey, Mira! Do you need anything?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
139	Well, not exactly, but...I'm a little free now and I was curious, so...
140	What were you doing?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
141	Paying my respects to the people of Sephira that have fallen so far...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0027
142	I see. That's what a priestess does...
143	Yes...
144	Every battle is a tragedy. Every time blood is spilled, the spirits of the land and the forest cry in agony.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
145	The voices of the spirits?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
146	Since the day I was born, I've lived alongside those voices.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
147	The lands and the skies have their own will, and which is embodied in the voices and surround us every day as we live our lives...
148	I've always thought that the Cursed Beasts might have a voice as well...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
149	But if we can end this, I think we ought to. This sad, sad way of things...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
150	Yes, we can end this. We must. So I must also do what I can.
151	Even if...
152	If what?
153	It's nothing. I'll be off now.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0039
154	Okay...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
155	I think...we feel the same way.
156	Lord Waginau! The Sephira warriors are ready to move out!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
157	Good! Warriors, fall in line!
158	Our adversary is the Cursed Beast. This is the largest, most threatening being in this world.
159	However, we are led by Lord Nimul! We have a leader that has weathered many battles; a crew of seasoned warriors!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
160	You all have exhibited exceptional strength. It will be more than enough to carve our way forward!
161	Warriors, recall your training! Cut them down with your Spiritbonding, and remember your oaths of compassion!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
162	The great tree Sephiron is always with us!
163	Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
164	Great vigor.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
165	(Tomorrow's battle will be fierce. It will be a battle of life and death.)	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
166	But we will show that we can overcome this. This is what Nimul... No, what we all desire.
167	Victory will be ours! We will restore peace to the land!
168	I've missed this place.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
169	Yes. We had many conversations here while I hammered away at steel.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
170	It seems so long ago, now...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
171	You're too young to talk like that, don't you think?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
172	You're probably right. But for me, this was the first time I've set off on such a long journey.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
173	Everything from that day... Washing up in this region, meeting you, becoming friends... I feel like everything has led up to this.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
174	Yna...
175	I am a graceless man. My demeanor is poor and I cannot get along with the people of this village.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
176	That said...
177	Now even I earnestly feel that I want to save this region.
178	Next will be your region. I promise I will save all the lands with these hands.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
179	Then we certainly cannot lose tomorrow.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
180	Yes. We must win. We will open the door to the future.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
181	This is the last blade I needed to work on. It is time to ready myself for what will come.
182	Lord Nimul! The warriors of Sephira have been assembled!
183	There is no guarantee that we will return from this battle. Have you all prepared your hearts and minds?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
184	Yes, sir! We will quell the spread of the Sinners over the land!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
185	All have set aside their fears and are ready to lay their lives down to fulfill their oaths.
186	Understood.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
187	Soldiers, fall in line!
188	The time has come! The mission to retrieve the Vessel of Purification has begun. We will settle the turmoil that has come upon us!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
189	We people of Sephira value compassion and harmony, but this is the only option we have in the face of this corruption!
190	With this offensive, we will purify our land and take it back!
191	All right, let's move out! March!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
192	Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
193	Okay, we're ready for liftoff! Mira, Nyx, are you ready?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
194	Yeah! Leave everything to me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
195	Libra is at the ready. We are just waiting for instructions.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
196	All right! Then let's get this party started!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
197	Yeah!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
198	I can't believe this. Our once fruitful land has become this...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
199	It's certainly horrible. But this is why we must return the blessings of the great tree!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
200	Morale looks to be high...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
201	It's to be expected. This is our land. You returned, along with the protection of the Godwolf.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
202	We can't afford to lose. The longer we wait, the more destruction there is. We all understand that.
203	Yes... It's quite a heavy responsibility.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
204	The time to fulfill that responsibility has come. Here we go: a horde of Sinners has showed up.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
205	You've finally made it, Pursuers of Sin. However, you've arrived too late.
206	...
207	Now, shadows of the Cursed Beasts! They have come to attack you! Retaliate to your hearts' content!
208	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0002
209	Grrroooooaaaagghhh?!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0001
210	Ugh... Lord Nimul! The Cursed Beast is here!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
211	Go forward without fear! Believe in me! Believe in your comrades!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
212	We're going to take back our home! Huzzah!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0008
213	Ah... This doesn't look good, Nimul! It's looking to trigger its earthquake!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
214	No!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
215	Grraaaaaah!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0002
216	Hey, hey! You don't think we'd just let things go according to your plans, huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
217	Argh!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0019
218	Valley of Siddim Protocol activated! Time to bind it to the ground!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1030
219	The magil output is stable! It won't be able to move anytime soon!
220	Thanks! I'll manage things here. Your battlefield is over there!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0034
221	Separation of Libra is complete. I won't warn you not to take unnecessary risks, but...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
222	Haha, I'll do it if it comes to that. You two are the same, aren't you?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
223	...Take care of yourself. We'll see you on the other side.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
224	Of course.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
225	What is up with all this manly energy here? Did you forget that I'm here, too?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
226	Of course not. To do such a thing would surely be equivalent to shooting myself in the foot.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
227	Wait, Nyx! Are you telling me that you have some complaints about having a sister as adorable as me?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
228	Haha, if you two can squabble like that at a time like this, then I'm sure we'll be fine!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
229	Nimul, we'll take care of things here. Go to Emmel!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
230	Right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
231	Onwards, to the village! There's not a moment to spare!
232	Warriors! Forward march!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
