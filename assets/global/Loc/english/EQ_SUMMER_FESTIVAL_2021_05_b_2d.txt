001	Here, you go! These lanterns are the ritual things, right?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0003
002	Yes! They are! Oh, how can I thank you?
003	It was nothing really. I found the thieves and persuaded them to return the items.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
004	Thank you all so much. Now, we'll be in time for the lantern floating. The souls we mourn will be able to find their way.
005	What's a lantern floating? I did notice a lot of people at the festival carrying lanterns.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
006	It's a Wadatsumi custom. The spirits of the dead are guided down the river by the lights.
007	Oh, so that's what they're for.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
008	Mmhmm! The lanterns are said to light the path for them, so that they have landmarks to find their way back.
009	These lanterns are decorations welcoming souls returning from the other side.
010	So you mean the spirits come all the way back here to be mourned?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0005
011	Yes. I'm sure the souls will come back for us.
012	That way the living can meet the dead and each side can find closure.
013	Well, that's rather convenient.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
014	Don't you think that's a good thing? That's something the living want, I think.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
015	...Yes, they do.
016	I'll send a lantern, too. There's someone I would like to offer my feelings to if they can make it back.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
017	Oh, that's a fine idea.
018	Well, I suppose all that pointless time did have some meaning.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
019	Seems so. What a pain in the neck!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0006
020	What will you two do?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
021	I think I'll go look for Ephylinde.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
022	Well, then I too shall seek out someone to reflect on the past with.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
023	Very well. Until next time.
024	Take this lantern. They'll be floating them down the river over there.
025	Thank you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0034
026	After the lanterns have traveled on, I'll need to speak to her properly.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
027	Tell her thank you... Tell her I'm sorry... Say all the things I haven't begun to say.
028	There are so many things I have to say. And after I've said them, I wonder...
029	...I wonder if I will be able to shake her hand again.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
