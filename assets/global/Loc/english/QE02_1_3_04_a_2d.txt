001	Jeez. That's one annoying dog.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
002	That said, I didn't expect us to be returning to Redington.
003	Tsk. I feel like that idiot with his massive arm is gonna be merrily waiting for us there.
004	Hey, are you an acquaintance of Don's?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0017
005	Well...we have one of those insufferable yet inseparable bonds.
006	Hey, you don't have to worry. The guy is evil, but he's not sleazy enough to harm girls.
007	You'll be able to keep living in Real Heaven.
008	A-are you serious?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0018
009	Yeah. But why did he go after you, little lady?	VO_edgar.VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
010	He's not the kind of guy who would try to win favor with the Beckrams.
011	Mr. Taras said that it was a moral obligation.
012	Moral obligation? Interesting...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
013	Guard Droids are waiting across this bridge, aye. It's a checkpoint!
014	What should we do?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
015	There's no other bridge nearby that leads to Redington.
016	Unless we cross the Pulte Canal we can't get to the clock tower!
017	We can't afford to have a flashy showdown on the bridge. Tsk, it seems like we may break a few bones.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
018	There's an ox cart over there. Do you think we can get this motorbike onto it?
019	An ox cart? What're you planning?
020	Forcing our way through isn't the only way, you know? Use your head. Well, just watch.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0019
021	The Hound is approaching us from behind, aye!
022	Again? Honestly, what an annoying dog!
