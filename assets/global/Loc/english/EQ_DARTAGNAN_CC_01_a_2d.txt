001	Hyah!	VO_yura.yura_battle_0007
002	Hup!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0004
003	Well done, you two! I can hardly believe you're new recruits!
004	Yes. Very impressive. As expected of therians.
005	Hehe! I'm pretty confident in my war dancing skills. We work pretty well together, don't you think, Yura?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0008
006	Let's protect Envylia together, as therians!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
007	Yeah! I'll do my best to make sure I can fight at your side, D'Artagnan.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0007
008	Sigh...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0030
009	I can't believe the captain's making me do war dancing with D'Artagnan at the parade...
010	The captain's orders are the captain's orders, but we're not like we were back then...
011	D'Artagnan is an incredible knight who would do just fine on her own. Me, on the other hand...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0016
012	...
013	I gotta stop thinking like that. I need to go on my patrol.
014	Hello, sir. Ma'am.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0001
015	Oh, Yura! On patrol? You're a hard worker as always.
016	Hello, Yura. It must be tough patrolling this whole area, especially with all of the new therians in the forest.
017	Right... There are quite a few here now who moved to Envylia relatively recently. It's a nice place to live for therians.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0004
018	But it's important to make sure everyone is safe when the number of people increases like this.
019	You've become such a wonderful knight, Yura!
020	Have you noticed any unusual changes in the forest?	VO_yura.yura_sys_0003
021	Unusual changes? Now that you mention it, there's a strange human that has been wandering around outside the village.
022	A strange human?!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
023	They haven't actually done anything, but... It's a little scary. There's stories of children being kidnapped in other villages.
024	Yes... We've yet to have any incidents here, but people are starting to worry.
025	Therians may be strong, but against a big group... We're just as defenseless as anyone else. Just like back then.
026	...
027	Nnf, let go of me!	VO_yura.yura_battle_0022
028	What happened to all that bravery from before?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
029	Listen up, therians! Resist and the kid dies!
030	Your blood will be used well. Now, follow what we say or—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
031	How interesting. How exactly were you planning on using the blood of therians?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
032	Who's there?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0020
033	I'm sorry... It was my fault for trying to do everything myself like a fool... I got caught and...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0036
034	It wasn't your fault. All you did was try to save the children who were in danger of being taken.
035	That's right. It's those humans' fault.
036	Because of them, we had to leave our home and come here.
037	...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0042
038	I know you're a knight of Envylia now, but I... I just can't trust humans.
039	I'm thankful that Envylia has allowed us to live in the forest, but...
040	It's okay, I understand how you both feel.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0030
041	...!
042	Excuse me, I'm going to go check something real quick.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0001
043	Who is that?
044	They're...looking into the village? But why...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0031
045	!
046	A knight on patrol? No matter. It's only one. Kill them.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
