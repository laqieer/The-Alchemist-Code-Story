001	I want you to be our second member. Then, with him, you can—	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
002	...
003	I am now Zwei.
004	I will not give up until the end.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
005	But still, I'm the second one to join?
006	Yeah, you're the second.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
007	You're zero... I'm the second...
008	I see. So you're much like me.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
009	What?
010	There's someone you're waiting for, isn't there?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
011	Yeah, someone who went on ahead without me.
012	My first ever friend.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
013	Hmph... Well done.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
014	I kept it open for you. The first seat of the Templars.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
015	Eins.
016	I guess that number's all that I'll be leaving behind.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
017	Why did you not stop me?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
018	What do you mean?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
019	I did not understand. These people must be important to you.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
020	Yet you tolerated this tyrannical invasion which could have taken their homes from them. Why?
021	Hmm...
022	A-are you fed up with me? Are you f-fed up with one who knows so little?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
023	Maybe I wanted you to know them.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
024	Huh?
025	If a dragon were to destroy the world, there would be nothing left.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
026	It's not something a dragon should be doing. The unseen hand of the divine ought to side with humans. That is more interesting.
027	Because life is finite and fragile, they strive for power.
028	Because their will is to topple this world—
029	...?!
030	Eins and I are connected to this Mystic Tower Veda. We cannot die.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
031	Now that Eins has become a vanguard of the tower along with me, even if he were to fall, he will someday walk within this tower again.
032	He will appear somewhere in its heights.
033	Though none can know when that will be.
034	Are you jealous that I don't have to worry about my life span?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
035	Who knows?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
036	This just means I get to catch up to you again.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
037	...
038	I was always the one waiting.
039	This is the first time I have ever had someone to care enough to reach me.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
040	And now this is the first time I shall play the role of one who sends you all out into the world.
041	...
042	You will, from now on, be sending out all who live.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
043	You cannot become the one and only for anybody. You will forever watch those you care for leave you behind.
044	It is not so bad, though. I am yet still number one for some: for Nero and for you, the Templars.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
045	Will you laugh at me, saying my efforts were wasted?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
046	I had no idea you could be as cool as you are now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
047	?!
048	You too, Nero.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
049	I am...too?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
050	Eins blazed the path, while you gave us the strength to march upon it, Nero.
051	Thank you for speaking to us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0033
052	I... Uh... But you've all lost so much, and only gained power... And yet, still...?
053	We'll gain a whole world to live in.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
054	...
055	That sounds...exciting.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0007
056	I'm counting on you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
057	The common understanding upon the battlefield...
058	The vanguard is always defeated.
059	Otherwise you hinder those that follow behind you.
060	I keep losing, but that's expected. It's my charge to keep on going. They may knock me down, but I keep getting up.
061	Go get your blue sky.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
062	Hey!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
063	Oh, hey, you're alive.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
064	I got so bored playing their games!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
065	Just to let you know, I did not lose!
066	I take it you lost.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
067	She must have lost.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0010
068	Get out! Get out of my space! This is not some rest area for souls or some park you can hang out at!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0017
069	Remember this, Nero: that's what we call a 'sore loser'.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
070	I see. Pitiful.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0044
071	Get yourself back to Veda!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
072	Come visit sometime, all right?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
073	Wh-what?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0025
074	That was a good way to kill some time, wasn't it?
075	Th-that...! W-well... I did get to see the power of human will. I can eventually visit you at some point.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0044
076	We'll be waiting.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
077	I guess I'm naive myself.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0007
078	I've gained some delightful knowledge.
079	There is always some form of reprisal if you let an evildoer go free.
080	Just as the hunter will come for the beast, the commandments will come forth to reform the world wherever vengeance is called for.
081	Ah... I see.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
082	The footsteps you leave that carry you up to your doom.
083	The path taken from a dark past to a dark future...
084	That is life.
085	Cool, right?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
086	Hehe...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0007
087	We should let them live.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
088	This is our quest to vanquish dragons.
089	If we make it above, there will be those who rule and block the sky, and they will be waiting for us.
090	I'm so disheartened. It's so preposterous, I can't see it happening.
091	As long as I live and my goal remains true, I will not lower my blade.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
092	Ugh, so predictable...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
093	This blade has been forged to endure. It is reliable indeed. It will not shatter.
094	Heheh, right. Well, at least until we close our eyes and do not open them again.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
095	Until we have our wish in hand...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
096	We will not stop.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
097	Perhaps that is why we call them dreams.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
098	There is only one dream.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
099	To bring the fake justice to ground, and a future full of possibilities to our family.
100	You're so dark.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
101	That is precisely why we need our light.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
102	I'll dazzle you all if you want!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
103	Because even the fake can become authentic!
104	Right. Until we overturn this world...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
105	I can't walk the streets with my chin held high!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
106	Let's all make it outside first.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
107	Let's go take down those obsessed with claiming justice or peace for themselves.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0005
108	Right, boss? It's up to us!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
109	I promise I won't get in your way.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
110	You have never, Acht.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
111	Even if all of my weapons are shattered...I...
112	Your efforts will not be in vain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
113	Y-yes!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
114	We will have that sky!
138	You're...staring off into the distance again.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
139	Ah... Sorry, sorry.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0035
140	But...you found us.
141	...?
115	Sol... You shone light upon us, who didn't exist.
116	If we are to topple the world, I believe we need to separate, spread across the world.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
117	That will be necessary if we are to control the whole board.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
118	Even if we do, don't forget.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
119	We will fight on our own accord!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
120	We will fight and die where we choose.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0038
121	But still, we are with you.
122	I hear footsteps behind me.
123	Ah... I see.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
124	It was the answer I could not find.
142	I suppose I could carry so much with me because of the emptiness inside.
125	It's my duty to look like I know what I'm doing.
126	Make it seem like I foresee events and indomitably stand my ground.
127	Still, my eyes are always following others.
128	So, I wanted them to be with me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
129	I wanted those selfish, egotistical, maniacal friends of mine...
130	Those friends I can see surpassing me, and I can entrust the future to...
131	Leave it to me.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
143	Even though I'm still empty, even though I still am not worthy...
144	I show off and march on, holding a place for my comrades to belong.
132	Sometimes I check the soles of my shoes, just to check.
133	In the darkness of the underground, even if I can't see the path behind me...
134	The wear and tear on my shoes is proof of how far we've come together.
135	We run further and my shoes wear down even more.
136	How exciting.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
137	We know what we must do.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
145	We've gained power.
146	We will never stop.
