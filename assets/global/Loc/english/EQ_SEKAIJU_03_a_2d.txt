001	Hey, there are a lot of monsters over there!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
002	Oh man, this is giving me an eerie feeling.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0028
003	Look, there's something weird about that tree in the center of the monsters!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0029
004	What is that?!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0027
005	Uuhh... I don't feel like getting too close to that.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
006	That's a Philosopher's Stone. Or rather, it's a former Philosopher's Stone that turned out this way due to an excessive negative energy.
007	A Philosopher's Stone?
008	Yes...it's the stone that transmuted me.
009	A certain alchemist used this stone with the ambition of ruling the continent of Babel, or rather, the whole world.
010	He overused the stone's powers though, and got trapped in darkness through his own excessive negativity, and this destroyed his body.
011	Oh boy...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
012	However, the stone is still running rampant with energy of his ambitions, and this ended up creating a link to another world.
013	When Paladins wanted to transmute me through regular Alchemy,
014	the energy of this sinister stone got mixed up in the transmutation, and I ended up getting transmuted in an unusual way.
015	So this Philosopher's Stone is the big culprit of this all, huh?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0016
016	So it's just a matter of destroying that stone, right?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0045
017	The Owl Beast!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0010
018	And we'll be able to fulfill our mission while we're at it.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0004
019	Chloe, are you alright?
020	Yes, I'm fine for now.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
021	Oh! There, right in front of the stone! We need to defeat the Owl Beast and destroy the stone!<br><br>	VO_fencer.fencer_battle_0020
