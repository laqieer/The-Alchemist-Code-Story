001	Huff...huff...huff...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
002	Logi! Enough! Tell me Agatha's whereabouts—
003	It's you who's done enough, Dias! How can you direct your sword at your brother?
004	Father! Please, tell me the truth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
005	Wratharis is a kingdom who has plunged people into fear for many years
006	You should know this better than anyone, father; you fought against them! Why change your stance now?!
007	Don't judge by what you see on the surface, Dias.
008	If you wish for true peace, then the cycle of hatred must be severed.
009	I'll ask you one more time...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
010	Father, are you truly attempting to join forces with Wratharis?
011	Returning Dias's piercing gaze, Zeke answers gravely.
012	Yes. That's correct.
013	And, you're willing to put Agatha in harm's way to achieve it! Father, you're making a mistake!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
014	I won't let you use Agatha as a pawn! I won't let my sister get caught up in the ravages of war again!
015	Dias!
016	Wait, Diaaaas!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
