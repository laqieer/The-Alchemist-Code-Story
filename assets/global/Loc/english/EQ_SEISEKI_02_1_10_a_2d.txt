001	We caught up!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
002	Ah... So you were the victors. It appears it was I the one who underestimated you.
003	Very well. Attack me if you're prepared to die!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
004	Agh! What is this power...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
005	Don't mess with us! Hurry up and give Chihaya back!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
006	Kagura! Stop!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
007	...?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0042
008	Kagura!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
009	Kagura! Kagura! Stop messing around. Come on. Answer me! Make fun of me like you always do!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0018
010	Hmph. So, she died. I'm disappointed at how little resistance she put up, but I guess it's more convenient this way.
011	...What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
012	I was going to kill her anyway. She had the potential to get in the way of my domination.
013	Right now, Wadatsumi doesn't need a royal family! All they need is my absolute power and a shrine maiden who they trust in!
014	He is attempting to reign over the currently desolate Wadatsumi.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
015	He wants to do this by joining forces with me and raising me up as a symbol to be worshiped.
016	What...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
017	If the royal family were to emerge now suddenly, it would cause a divide amongst the people who have finally begun to unify.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
018	Besides, don't you feel the same, Shrine Maiden Chihaya? Restoration without power is impossible! It is power that protects the people!
019	My armed forces will enable that!
020	... ...
021	Chihaya...you're not actually considering what he's saying, are you?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
022	It is true that some of what he says makes sense.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0012
023	However, my power will always belong to the people. I could never lend a hand to someone who schemes to dominate them!
024	That's right!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
025	Kagura?!
026	Hmph. So you're still alive.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
027	Don't be deceived!
028	All he wants to do is display his power! He doesn't care about peace in our country—
029	Kagura!
030	You scum! Prepare to pay for your actions.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
031	N-no...Ku...dan...	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
032	Captain Kudan!
033	I see... I guess I won't have to go easy on you. Very well then!
034	Heheheh. Yeah, that's the spirit. Makes it all the more worth defeating you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0008
035	No, you must not!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
036	...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
037	You must not sympathize with his darkness! It will consume you as well.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0014
038	What's the matter, coward? Are you afraid of me? Are you frightened of unleashing your power?!
039	Shut up!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0011
040	That's it, coward! Let the terror overtake you until you run away with your tail between your legs!
041	Shut up...shut up, shut up, shut up!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
042	Ack...ahhh!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0027
043	Chihaya!
044	Ka-Kanon...you...!
045	I won't let you do this anymore! I'm going to protect the lives and happiness of everyone!
046	The darkness is being neutralized...
047	Huh? I can move. Why?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
048	What?! How is this possible?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0025
049	With a heart of justice, you can do anything!
050	I'll never acknowledge a power that is void of justice!
051	Interesting... Well then, show me this justice of yours!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
052	Happily! Let's go, everyone!
