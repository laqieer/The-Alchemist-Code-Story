001	Have you managed to enhance until Lv 20? That's nothing yet. Let's continue further!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
002	Afterwards, you can check Moon Star Armor from your Gear List.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0002
003	Right now, there should 3 stars lined up on the Moon Star Armor frame. That means it has 3★ Rarity.
004	Raising this Rarity is called evolving.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
005	Next, we're going to evolve the Moon Star Armor to 4★ Rarity.	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1020
006	Listen. The higher Rarity your gear is, the higher the Max Lv becomes.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
007	In other words, by increasing Gear Lv, you can enhance even more as well.
008	According to my example, by evolving, you can increase the Max Lv to 25.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
009	Hm?! How about evolving it to its Max immediately?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
010	You idiot! Everything has its time and place. If you skip the order, you'll create something soulless!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0013
011	For example, say you were to make miso soup. First of all, you would take the soup stock, mix the miso in, and then place it over the fire...
012	Anyway... In order to evolve it to 4★, you'll need an additional 75 Moon Star Armor Shards. Go collect them...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
