001	Ack! What a terrible bombardment! It's hard to believe it's a hallucination!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
002	My technique differs from Vier's...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0010
003	Her ability is to use scent to stir up hallucinations. In contrast...my ability directly appeals to all five senses...
004	Huh...?! Fire?! ...Ugh! I-it's hot!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
005	My technique affects the senses; not just sight and sound, but touch, too.
006	Pain blurs the boundary between reality and fantasy.
007	Even if you understand it in your head, your five senses cause the hallucination to be undiscernible from reality.
008	Ugh! N-no! This pain is not real! I won't let it mislead me!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
009	Are you sure? Those flames may be real, you know?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0016
010	Wha...?! Ac...ack!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
011	Well then...allow yourself to burn to death...along with a town that is filled with false justice!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0010
012	False...justice?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
013	Every time you advocate the term absolute justice, it causes my skin to crawl. That false justice of yours is over now!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0010
014	U-ugh...! I-it's true that...we have our faults...but we...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
015	No matter how much you try to justify it, it's pointless after what happened to me.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0013
016	What happened to you...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
017	I was once abandoned by you...and left to perish tragically in my home town.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
018	You're...from Wadatsumi...	VO_caida.caida_battle_0028
019	You tolerate aggression...and refuse to take responsibility for anything. That's the truth behind the Holy Guard.
020	I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your form of justice.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0035
021	Ughh...! I-it's true...I cannot excuse myself regarding any of that.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
022	But...why? Why are you now with Greed Dike...who destroyed your hometown?
023	Of course...I have no intention whatsoever of forgiving them.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0029
024	However...in order to achieve my objective, I cannot afford to be selective of what jobs I take on.
025	I-is that what your leader Sol said?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
026	Exactly.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0005
027	Our leader said that once this is dealt with...our wish will come one step closer...to becoming reality.
028	I trust and follow these words and act on them...that is all.
029	Wi...wish?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
030	We wish to bring light to our home; Lost Blue...a sky to call our own.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
031	A sky...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
032	Yes...
033	It will save the Lost Blue people of the world who are oppressed, and will mean winning the same rights as those who live above the surface.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
034	We'll be different from you people who pretend those who suffer...don't exist.
035	There...we have the true justice...where those who truly suffer can live.
036	...!
037	In my life as a priestess, I moved from place to place, witnessing all too many acts of tragedy.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0022
038	Eventually, I arrived at Lost Blue, where the will of the leader caused me to make up my mind.
039	All this so-called justice in this world is nothing more than a facade.
040	False justice is useless. What we aim for is true justice for those who are truly suffering.
041	...Ugh...is that who you...the Templars are?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
042	Yes. Today, as of now, the words "absolute justice" will represent who we are.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
043	So...let those words burn within you and give you a peace of mind.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0012
