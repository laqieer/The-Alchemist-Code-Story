001	Hrrrrggghhhh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
002	I suppose you shan't be following that code of yours, then.
003	Hah! I've been dodging that from the start!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
004	Ridiculous! Absurd! Oh, you are too much!
005	I told you, didn't I? I'm selfish!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
006	So, you are going to kill me? Is that it?
007	Now don't go getting the wrong idea!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
008	I just...
009	Wanna give you a really hard time!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0004
010	Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhh!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0025
011	Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
012	Nnngggrrrrhhh!
013	Phew. I made it.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
014	Well, congratulations.
015	Sorry to keep you waiting.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0035
016	About time!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
017	So you were buying yourself time, were you?
018	Told ya. I was just here to give you a hard time. Does nobody ever listen when I open my mouth and speak words?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
019	Ren...
020	Mhmm?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
021	Yomi told me everything. You did well.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0033
022	Mmm...	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
023	What's the matter? Are you hurt? Wait... Don't tell me you don't know who I am!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0001
024	Huh? I mean, you look familiar... Pasty skin...turned porcelain... Carrot hair turned flame... Not a lot going on in the front back then... Don't tell me you're Kagura!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
025	No way! You used to be so little, and all roly-poly!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
026	What?! What do you think you're—?!
027	Wow, you look great! Really! You're super hot!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0024
028	I can't believe we used to play in the river together! You've really grown—and it's not just your height!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
029	Ngh... We're not children anymore, you know—and yet you still act like one. Y-you haven't changed at all. I'm...really not a fan.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
030	Ahahahah! Oh, but I like you though, Kagura!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
031	Ren...you look pretty beat up.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
032	Right back atcha, Leafah.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
033	It's not as bad as it looks.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
034	No, yeah, I mean...same. I feel fine!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
035	...
036	What is this? Have you forgotten about little old me? Why do you not come for me, mortals?
037	...
038	You must hate me so. I feasted upon your brother's body. I am doing my very best to destroy what's left of your precious Wadatsumi.
039	How very sad. Your entire clan is dead, and your domain continues to be desecrated.
040	Does it not make your blood boil?
041	...
042	Of course we despise you. Of course we are sad.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
043	Well, then...
044	However...
045	There are people I want to protect.
046	My brother...
047	He endured unimaginable suffering, and never once complained. He was always looking out for me.
048	That's why, even if I stumble, or fall over...
049	I know that I can pick myself up again and keep moving forward.
050	I won't cry anymore.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
051	Clever little fox.
052	Ren, give me Sumeragi!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
053	Go high!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
054	Sumeragi! Drink of my blood and restore unto me my demonic powers!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
055	Leafah!
056	Don't worry! I'll watch your back!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
057	No.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
058	H-huh?
059	Will you...fight beside me?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
060	I'm your ally—your friend. You shouldn't need to ask.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
061	Lady Kagura?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
062	Let's finish this quickly.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0030
063	Because there's someone waiting for you, right?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0004
064	Right.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
065	This is it.
066	The allies by our sides move in harmony with our blades.
067	We have no blind spots. Come, we will exorcise this chaos and unify the world!
068	Grrrrrrrroooooooooooorrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!
069	Give us back our peace!
