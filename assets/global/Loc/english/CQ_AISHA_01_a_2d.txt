001	I've always been told that I'm very perceptive. I was good at reading people.
002	I thought it was because I had received my mother's gift for fortune-telling. She braved the aristocracy and their raging appetites to read the fortunes of nobles.
003	Yet before long I realized the truth about my power. I saw things even when I wasn't looking for them. I was no seer, but I had the power of sight.
004	Aisha, sweetie. Give me your hand.
005	What is it, momma? Is this...a dice?
006	Yes, Aisha. It's a die. Now, squeeze it tight. Just like that. What you've got in your hand now, sweetie, is a dream.
007	A dream?
008	The pips on a die—those little black dots, you see?—mark one's future choices. The possibilities are infinite. That's why a dream lies in the palm of your hand before the die is cast.
009	So if you ever feel like you've seen too much...or that your dreams are lost, I want you to hold this die in your fist and squeeze it tight.
010	Place your bets, please!
011	All right! I won! Aisha, baby, I swear you're my Lady Luck!
012	Aw, man. I can't believe this. There goes my paycheck for the month.
013	C'mon, Aisha, I'm beggin' ya! Let me win the next round!
014	Hmm... Nope! Can't do that! It's not up to me. It's just luck; a game of chance.
015	Aww...
016	It'll be all right. You can win it back, I'm sure! After all, the night is young—but...
017	If you were to tell me something I'd really like to hear, something worthwhile, you might find that things just so happen to go your way.
018	What?
019	Oh, nothing! Hee hee.
020	Now, come. For tonight, life is but a dream. So let's make the most of it together!
021	(Standing in the center of the frenzy, I watch as hope and fear flicker from one face to the next, and love every second of it. Drawing their gazes thrills me...)
022	(And this place, with all its glitz, makes me feel like I'm in a dream. For all these reasons and more, I love my job. Being a dealer is the best!)
023	(Even if the dreams here are not all fun and games.)
024	Never a quiet night in this casino, eh?
025	Thanks to everyone's support, business is booming.
026	Heheh... I wonder how many of these chumps know who you really are?
027	...
028	Oops. Did I hit a nerve? Anyway, about the you-know-what...
029	Well, well. You found all this out? 'Spose I shouldn't be surprised.
030	I'm merely doing what I'm paid to do.
031	I'll be back.
032	...
033	Mmm... I'm so tired!
034	I never see anything good in anyone who comes here to buy information on the sly for their dirty purposes.
035	Everything I see through them is dark...murky. It makes me sick to my stomach. Ugh, I could puke.
036	At least the people who come to the casino are up-front about their vices. I'd take them over those vile nobles any day of the week.
037	You're Aisha? Hmph. Not bad.
038	I cannot seem to get ahold of your mother, so I suppose you'll have to do.
039	Now, tell me what you see. What lies in store for me in the future?
040	I suppose I must be leading a sublime life without a care in the world, with all the money and women I could ever want.
041	Hah! I'm not sure why I even bothered to ask. Now...why don't you come and sit a little closer?
042	You understand, don't you? If you want to continue your career as a fortune-teller, you'll make me feel good.
043	...
044	(I thought I had to follow in my mother's footsteps...)
045	(But I couldn't stand it. It made me sick. With the die clutched tightly in my fist, I plunged ever forward...)
046	(But there are no dreams here for me.)
047	C'mon... Give me something good...
048	Three pips total. That means...change is necessary.
049	Haa... Time to call it a day, I guess...
050	Are you Aisha?
051	Huh?
052	Um... Are you a customer, sir?
053	I'm sorry, but we're closed for today. We'll open again tomorrow night, if you're interested in playing with us.
054	Ohh, you don't say? That's not why I'm here, though.
055	I'm here to pick up requests from the Great Phantom Thief himself, Chat Noir. Hasn't that eccentric engineer told you about it?
056	Oh... Well, in that case, how can I help you?
057	Floor plans of the Paolino Residence, a mold for the key to the safe, the serial number of the Guard Droids on patrol...
058	Mhm. This is all I have on that right now.
059	Good, good. This is more than enough for me to get the job done right.
060	You're really intending to rob them? Their security is pretty tight.
061	Which means that they must have something worth guarding! Oohh, I'm so excited, I can hardly wait!
062	(Excited? He's talking about committing a crime.)
063	(I suppose Mister Paolino isn't a good man. That's what the rumors say...and I know them to be true.)
064	If he has something worth my while, I'll be another step closer to the truth! Ahh... Even just imaging it is just too much! I feel like dancing!
065	...
066	(The Great Phantom Thief, huh? Looks to me like he's just a common criminal planning his next heist.)
067	(Still, his eyes are shining with excitement. He really is enjoying himself. He almost looks like he's in a dream...)
068	Tell me something. Why are you—?
069	Shh!
070	Oi, Aisha! Think ya can fool me? I know when I'm bein' duped! Gimme back my money!
071	What's his problem?
072	This just happens sometimes. Some people get like this when they lose big at the casino and try to drink away their sorrows in the aftermath.
073	Who's this you've got with ya? You seein' this guy?
074	Here I am, doing my darndest to get your attention, and ya won't even look at me!
075	What?!
076	Excuse me? I only met this man five minutes ago!
077	Heh. I only need one to steal your heart.
078	Cut that out! I have no interest in criminals, I'll have you know.
079	Aww... I'm crushed.
080	Hey! Don't ignore me!
081	You'll regret this! Ya hear me? I'll make sure of it!
