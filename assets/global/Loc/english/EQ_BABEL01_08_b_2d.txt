001	Well, looks like things are all set over here. I'm gonna go focus on dealing with the other assassins.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
002	Did you achieve what you came here for?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
003	...I made a vow to never turn my eyes away from someone who needs help. Even a therian can have honor.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
004	I decided long ago that I would someday blow your bitterness at the past away by showing how committed I am to this path!
005	Hmph. That's ridiculous.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
006	I'm going to do it! I'm going to try! But...for now, yes, this was what I came here for.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
007	Tch. Don't waste your breath while the enemy continues to press us. We need some way to take them down for real.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
008	Nina, give your people the signal to withdraw temporarily with the Scarlet Flame Guard!
009	What? But if we do that...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
010	If we don't do that, we'll just lose everyone! Live to fight another day!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
011	Understood!
012	I've given the signal!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
013	Good. Now, you go. I will hold them off for as long as I can...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0037
014	(Moreover, I'm almost certain I can sense the presence of the person controlling these nearby...)	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
015	(I must find them!)
016	Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
017	Haaa... Haaa... You all don't give up easily...	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
018	I suppose this is a good time to experiment with the best way to kill you!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
019	Tch...! It just doesn't end!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
020	Hyaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0032
021	You! I told you to fall back! That was a direct order!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
022	You're the one who refused to allow me to join the Guard! You don't have any authority over me! Besides, it's impossible to face all these enemies on your own!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
023	I didn't ask for your help.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
024	Didn't I tell you already? I made a vow to never turn away from someone who needs help. You don't need to ask.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0010
025	Nina!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
026	What?!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
027	No... Sir Gerald! No!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
