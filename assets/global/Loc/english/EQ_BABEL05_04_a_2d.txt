001	You're joking, right?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0025
002	Do I look like I am joking?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
003	You want me to be captain?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0021
004	Do you not think you're suited for the job?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
005	So this is your way of trying to persuade me to stay, is it? Is that all you've got, captain of the 2nd Regiment?	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
006	Nobody else can surpass your skill with Alchemy.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
007	Besides you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
008	What was it you said? Ah, yes. "Alchemy can only make imitations, and never anything genuine."	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
009	Even my excuses sound genius, don't they?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
010	Have you tired of the Holy Guard? Is that it?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
011	I just realized that my mind is better put to other endeavors.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
012	What would become of Albea?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
013	...
014	She can do as she wishes.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
015	...
016	Will.
017	Well, this is depressing.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
018	Come closer.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
019	What? Is this secret only for the boy's club?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
020	It's a very radical secret.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
021	All I can do is look the other way.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
022	That's unbecoming of you, Observer.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
023	Even I can go along with schemes when it suits me.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1004
024	I choose to do so with this one.
025	Magnus?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
026	I've never been able to keep secrets from you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
027	Huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
028	I don't even want to keep secrets from you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
029	You about to expose some shocking truth to me?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0005
030	I hid my uniform under my bed in the barracks.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
031	It's yours now.
032	Why the heck would I want that?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0027
033	Keep it as a memento.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
034	A what?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
035	...
036	They'll be coming for me.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
037	What are you talking about?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
038	I'm gonna make myself scarce before they can get to me.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
039	If you choose to stay here 'til your dying days, then do what you will with my uniform.
040	I said I don't want it!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
041	However, if you ever have any doubts about the Holy Guard...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
042	If you're willing to risk your life for the chance to see something totally insane, then...
043	Then...? What?!
044	Well, just know that you can hide a lot in a coat.	VO_magnus.magnus_event_1015
045	Magnus left the Holy Guard, leaving no indication as to where it was he was heading.
046	All contact with him was lost, and then...it came.
047	It came as quite a surprise to all when Kaya resigned from her position as captain of the Holy Guard's 2nd Regiment.
048	Far more surprising, though, was the fact that shortly afterward, she disappeared.
049	The Crimson Dragon, possessor of the Alchemia Pura, vanished overnight.
050	Not a single trace of her could be found. Not even by the Lord Commander himself.
051	It was enough to spark suspicions and pique my interest in the dealings of the Holy Guard.
052	Farthest corner of the library...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
053	Bottom row, eleventh book from the right, page eight.
054	Hold Magnus' uniform in one hand and recite the password.
055	Showdown!
056	Whoa...!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
057	The page is...rewriting itself!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0027
058	The Alchemia that Magnus wove into his uniform served to activate some sort of mechanism, so that his research notes emerged before my very eyes.
059	I read about how Magnus had begun researching the Alchemy Source in order to perfect his Alchemy.
060	I learned that the Alchemy Source could somehow be connected to the Cursed Beasts, which once existed long ago on the continent of Babel.
061	I learned of Magnus' suspicions that the Holy Guard had concealed certain aspects of history related to Alchemy for unjust and monopolistic reasons.
062	I read his detailed notes on the existence of Corpse, the dark side of the Holy Guard.
063	It didn't take long for me to decide to leave the Holy Guard after that.
064	I had mottos aplenty to live by. A whole list.
065	One of my favorites was, "A wise man never courts danger."
066	Though I have to admit, I do love the thrill of danger.
067	Now maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but...
068	I always wanted to try my hand at living off the grid.
069	I tip my hat to you, Magnus. You were willing to do what it took to eradicate any mark of corruption from the supposedly upright and pure Holy Guard, no matter how small.
070	What'll it be? Will I let the flow of this river take Will where it will?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_1003
071	Oh, that's a good one. I'll add it to my list.
