001	Urrgghhh... N-not yet... I won't give up! I-I'll never...give up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
002	Wh-what are you saying?! You can barely stand. You should really—	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
003	I can't! I will bring home the Scroll of Success no matter what! Just...like I promised.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
004	The Scroll of Success?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
005	N-no way!	VO_fujika.fujika_chara_1001
006	There are rumors that my calligraphy has special powers—that it can work like a protective charm. Is that what you're after, mister?
007	...
008	My daughter has a big exam comin' up soon.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
009	Well... That's up to your daughter. If she works hard—	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
010	She is workin' hard! She's workin' more than hard enough! If she can just show her ability on the day, she'll pass, guaranteed! But she gets all nervous when it comes to the real thing!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
011	All I can do is support her...by gettin' her a charm to help her out!
012	But your accessories are crazy expensive... I can't afford 'em to save me life!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
013	So you decided to kidnap her and make her write something for you? Don't you think that's selfish?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
014	Unnnghh... I know, but...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
015	Huh? If that's all, you should have just asked, silly! I'm happy to help out!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0030
016	Do ya mean it?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
017	Huh?! You're gonna help him?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
018	I have one condition! Make sure your daughter passes that exam, no matter what, okay?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
019	Th-thanks! Thanks so much, Miss Fujika!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
020	Wow... You're amazing, Fujika! I can't believe you gave away your calligraphy like it was nothing. I'm not sure I could do something like that.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0044
021	It wasn't nothing. I pour my heart and soul, and even a bit of my mana, into every single one I do. Giving them away is part of the joy I get from making them!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
022	I see...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0020
023	Anyway, you're the one who's amazing, Neica! Look over there!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
024	H-huh?
025	Look at this stall! Oh my gosh, you can buy accessories made by Neica! Wow! There are so many!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0003
026	This one is super cute! It would look so good on you! You should put it on and go ask out that cutie you have your eyes on!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
027	H-huh?! N-no way! I can't do that! I'm not confident enough...	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0025
028	That's exactly why you need to buy one of these accessories! They'll fill you up with Neica Power! Come on, give it a try!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0012
029	A-all right. Mmm... Y-yeah! I guess I do feel kinda pumped. All right! I'll... I'll do it! I'll give it my best shot!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0031
030	Neica Power? Wh-what are they talking about?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0029
031	Your accessories are totally cute, and they give you power! That's really amazing!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
032	Th-they're really not that special...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0027
033	They are special!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0012
034	That girl got the confidence she needed to go and express her feelings, thanks to your accessory!
035	That's what your power is, Neica!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
036	M-my...power?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0044
037	(I always felt like having these powers was an inconvenience. I never wanted them, but...)
038	(Those girls looked so happy.)
039	I really wanted to come and see your accessories today, Neica!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0002
040	H-huh?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0020
041	I mean, your letters are always, like, so cute!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
042	All the little touches, like the bits of gold leaf, are so fantastic! Every time I open one of your letters, I'm always so excited! They really make me feel good!
043	I just knew your accessories had to be super cute, too! I couldn't stop thinking about them, so I had to come and see them!
044	Y-you did?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0011
045	I mean, I just adore you, Neica, and I like everything you make so much!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0004
046	When you put your heart into something, Neica, it actually gives it power, and that power can make people happy!
047	And seeing my friend's work bring smiles to people's faces makes me so happy!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0010
048	...
049	(So...my powers can make people happy.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0044
050	(I never thought of that before.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0007
051	Thanks, Fujika.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0033
052	I feel just like I do when I'm reading one of your letters—no, it's even better in person!
053	Maybe it has something to do with your powers.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0007
054	Heehee. Maybe! I guess that makes us twins!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
055	Twins? Hmm...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
056	Oh! I should make us some matching accessories, so that we have something to remember today by.	VO_nacre.nacre_battle_1018
057	Oh my gosh! I can't wait! Make sure you show them to me next time we meet, okay?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0023
058	Well, they'll be like a memento between the two of us, so...if you like, I can send yours when they're done.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
059	Of course!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0010
