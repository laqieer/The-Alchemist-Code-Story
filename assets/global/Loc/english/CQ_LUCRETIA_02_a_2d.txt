001	(We've managed to fight off the first wave. Still, the enemy's main army lies further ahead. When will they attack?)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0032
002	(It's difficult to fight when I'm not positioned at the vanguard.)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0012
003	There you are...	VO_gein.gein_sys_1047
004	You again...what is the matter?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0006
005	Well, in the battle earlier...I was stunned by the way you led your men. That being said...	VO_gein.gein_event_1001
006	I see the confusion amongst your soldiers now. With you usually at the vanguard, they are not used to this new formation.
007	Are you still thinking about the scolding you received from your varlet?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0020
008	Lord Gane, why did you come all the way here?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0001
009	You are not my subordinate. There is no reason for you to be here.
010	It's true that I am not your subordinate... However, I am a knight. Isn't it natural for me to make a stand in battle?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0037
011	I see. That is true. Well then, tell me honestly.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
012	Why do you follow me? What is your goal?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0018
013	I am here to help you, my queen. How is that for a reason?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0031
014	Do I look like someone who needs help?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0010
015	Sigh... I guess that reason isn't convincing enough.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0020
016	You're are strong... And, indeed, you do not need my help.
017	...
018	Well then...I'll tell you my goal.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0016
019	My father is a Paladin. However, there's nothing about him that stands out in particular. Furthermore, he never commits blunders.
020	He's an honorable knight... I know that sounds good, but he truly is a harmless, mediocre human.
021	I do not want to become like my father!	VO_gein.gein_event_1013
022	I will rise in the world! Yes! I will ascend all the way to becoming a king!
023	That is my hope! I will do whatever is necessary to achieve that!
024	I have already gotten close to you...for this reason.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0020
025	(So...he'll do whatever is necessary to achieve his goal...)
026	Pww...pwahahaha!!!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0008
027	What's so funny?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0002
028	I found your whole speech quite stimulating! I appreciate your resolve!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_chara_1003
029	Here they come!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_battle_0020
030	Soldiers of Envylia! We are all in this together! Follow me. I am Lucretia, the Queen of Envylia!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_battle_0015
031	Queen Lucretia...are you sure about this? You'll be scolded by your varlet again.	VO_gein.gein_sys_1047
032	Who cares. I'll do things the way I want to!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0010
033	Gane! Follow me! If you wish to be my groom, then focus on the enemy before us!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0002
034	Yes, my queen! I am your knight and I will accompany you to the ends of the earth!	VO_gein.gein_battle_0002
