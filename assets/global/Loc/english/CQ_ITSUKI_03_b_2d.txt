001	Huzzaaaahh!
002	Aaaaagh!
003	What? Done already? Pathetic! You're nothing but talk!
004	Wh-what is with this girl?! She's some kind of monster!
005	A m-monster?
006	Father! Father!
007	Itsuki! Run! Get out of here!
008	...
009	Miss Itsuki, watch out!
010	Ngh!
011	Sophia?! Wh-why would you...?
012	Do I need a reason to help a friend in need?
013	I...!
014	Wha—?!
015	That elf always gives us trouble, so we brought some reinforcements this time.
016	(I can easily take care of these guys myself, but...)
017	(If they find out that I really am a monster...a demon...)
018	Even your freakishly strong monster of a friend here can't handle all of us at once. Now, come along quietly.
019	A monster? Are you referring to my friend?
020	Sophia...
021	The only monsters I see here are you! You hurt others without remorse.
022	...
023	(If they find out I'm a demon, they'll do terrible things to me. They might kill me like they killed my father...but...)
024	Wh-what the...?!
025	(I don't care anymore! I can't let them take Sophia, even if it means they find out about me. She called me her friend—I won't turn my back on her!)
026	Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!
027	Eek! Wh-what the hell is this girl?! I think she's a real monster!
028	I'll show you what I'm capable of!
029	Aaaaaaaghh!
030	Huff...huff...
031	Miss Itsuki...
032	Sophia... Did I frighten you?
033	Not at all. How could I be scared of a friend who fought for my sake?
034	Sophia...
035	I must apologize. I saw the truth about you when I read your fortune.
036	So I know what you are, and I know why you are here in Lustburg.
037	H-huh?
038	That's why I know that you are a good person. I have already seen that a peaceful relationship between you and humankind lies in store for you.
039	...
040	Humans have persecuted my people. I can't just forget that history, and it won't ever fade away.
041	So it's hard for me to believe your words, but...
042	I guess I could let myself trust you...as my friend.
043	And maybe I can believe that someday I will find a human who I can call my friend.
044	Ugh! All this thinking has made me hungry! I want some of that lady's cooking again!
045	Come to think of it, I didn't actually get to eat earlier, because of those men.
046	Oh, my...
047	...
048	Pfft! Hahahaha! That was some tummy rumble, Sophia!
049	Hmhm. I suppose I must be hungrier than I thought!
050	All right! Let's go get something to eat!
