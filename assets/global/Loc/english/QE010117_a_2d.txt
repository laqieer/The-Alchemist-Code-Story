001	All that happened while I was passed out? And Dias is safe, right?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
002	Yeah...for better or worse. In any case, your eye saved me.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0037
003	Tell me...my eye...what is it?
004	What would you do with that knowledge?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0006
005	If, as you said, my eye is of a devil that will bring about destruction...I wouldn't want to involve all of you.
006	I don't think I should travel with you anymore. Leave me here.
007	Your brother Logi once said...
008	"Even pipe dreams can become a reality if you don't give up on them."
009	Huh?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
010	You sought a dream and extended your hand to us, right?
011	I was moved by your determination. It convinced me to try pursuing this dream once more.
012	That's why I accepted your invitation.
013	So stop whining! I've long ago resolved myself.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
014	Sabareta...!
015	Whatever it takes, we're going to make it to that dream of ours.
016	Yes! I promise I won't give up!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0005
