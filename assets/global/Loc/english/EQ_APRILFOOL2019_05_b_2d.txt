001	Dias, what I showed you today were merely...possibilities.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0002
002	Possibilities?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
003	Anybody can be called Headstrong over a simple mistake.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
004	And even the smallest mistake can bring about the greatest of changes.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0030
005	Dias... You have witnessed so many possibilities, and they have caused you great pain.
006	Your atonement is now complete. I can now release you from the curse of Headstrong Dias.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
007	Aaaaaaaagh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0026
008	Now you will never again be called Headstrong Dias.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0003
036	Ugh...	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0043
009	Producer!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
010	Dias... I put you through so much.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0042
011	I'm...so...sorry.
012	Producer!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
013	Thank you. You have freed me from this curse.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
037	Wait, no! Hold on a sec!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
014	This was all your fault to begin with! Don't try to justify yourself!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
015	Dias! C-calm down!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0002
016	Artist, please heal Producer.	VO_rattontasaki.rattontasaki_sys_0003
017	O-okay!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0004
018	Who are all of you?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
019	All right, everybody. Let's fix up Chapter 1!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
020	A-are you serious?!	VO_rattontasaki.rattontasaki_sys_0025
021	Of course! Don't you want to help Dias?	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0012
022	Producer...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
023	We don't have much time left in the schedule, but... You're right. We can't leave it as is.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0029
024	I've always wanted to touch up Chapter 1.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0031
025	Yeah... The users have commented about it, and it would help Dias out a lot.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0031
026	Th-thanks guys!	VO_dios_dios_sys_0019
027	Designer! Director! Can you do it?!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0002
028	We can and we will.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0037
029	Some parts will have to be left untouched, but we'll do what we can!	VO_rattontasaki.rattontasaki_sys_0037
030	All right! This is for Dias and his fans!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0023
031	Yeah!
032	Chapter 1 is currently under diligent reconstruction.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0004
033	Please keep an eye out for the remastered version, coming soon!
034	Thank you for your continued support of THE ALCHEMIST CODE!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0041
035	No longer will people say TAC only gets good from Chapter 2!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0016
