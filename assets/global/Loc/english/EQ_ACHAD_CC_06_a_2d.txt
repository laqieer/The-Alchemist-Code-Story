001	Let's just say they met a swift end.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
002	The...s-sky we chased after...for so long i-is...fading, but...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
003	My soul...will n-never stop...following you.
004	You're the only one left.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
005	Even you cannot defeat us all.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
006	We'll stop you before you do something that can't be undone. That's the least I can do for someone from my homeland.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
007	What do you mean "before"?! He's already caused so much damage!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
008	Let's make him pay for everything he's done!
009	You've brought terror into the lives of the people of Babel and caused substantial harm.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
010	As Lord Commander, keeper of the peace in this world, I cannot forgive you!
011	...
012	Hmph. You don't even have the strength to talk back, do you? There's no point drawing this out.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
013	Let's finish this.
014	...
015	As for the Templars' remains...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
016	Vier...
017	Do you ever dream of the future?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
018	Only of my own death.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
019	At least you're consistent.
020	I haven't set a date yet, but it's in on my to-do list.
021	You're not ready to lay down and die right now, though. Are you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
022	Perhaps not. In the end, my destination will be the jaws of the afterlife...
023	But, for now, there's nowhere in the world I'd rather sleep than here. The beds are just too comfy.
024	We're on the precipice of the final battle, and yet, thanks to you, everybody is sleeping like logs. They'll be well-rested come tomorrow.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
025	Except for you.
026	I can't sleep.
027	I could get in bed with you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
028	That'd be unfair on you. You have to stay awake.
029	I can't sleep, either.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
030	Come on. Just this once.
031	Let's talk about our dreams.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
032	Hah!
033	I didn't mean for that to come out so...cringy.
034	Ahahaha! It was cute, though.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
035	I'll take that as a compliment.
036	You should!
037	You've taught me a lot, you know.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
038	Have I been a good teacher?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
039	When it comes to giving your students good dreams? You're the best.
040	...
041	Tee hee!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0009
042	The Templars' Number Four, Vier, was found dead in Envylia.
043	Oh! Good morning, Acht. Did you sleep well?	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
044	The cause of death appears to have been blood loss from severe lacerations. However, as the body was left in the center of the battlefield...
045	I hope you always have good dreams.
046	But, well, don't worry. You can count on me to give them to you!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0002
047	It had been trampled and battered beyond recognition. Were it not for some eyewitness accounts we collected at the scene, we would not have been able to identify the corpse.
048	Füry...
049	Just let me do it alone. No one needs to fight but me!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
050	It's conceited to think you can defeat a whole country by yourself.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
051	I don't care whether I make it back or not!
052	It doesn't matter if I fall! So long as the damage caused by we who have been persecuted will leave its mark on history... So long as some light will remain in Lost Blue, faint though it may be...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0002
053	I could ask for nothing more.
054	It's all up to you. Give them the fight of your life.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
055	Somehow, even that line sounds like a curse coming from you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
056	In a sense, it is. It's my mournful wish.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
057	To think we'd join forces with Greed Dike.
058	Why not? We all know how this is gonna end.
059	With their deaths?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
060	Heheh.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
061	Hehehehe.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0008
062	Ikasa was the one responsible for that prayer, wasn't she?
063	So you knew.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
064	It'd be nice if you could watch over her for me.
065	What if she doesn't break?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
066	Good point. I think...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
067	I think she'll end up putting a spell on the world.
068	So, let me get this straight. Your magic rites allow you to use your experiences to manifest things?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
069	Yes, that's correct.
070	Good. Then the time we spent here won't be for nothing.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
071	The little taste of peace we've had here might just come in handy someday.
072	You want me to use these happy experiences as fuel for my rites?
073	You can, right? Or is that a little too optimistic?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
074	Hmm...
075	I'm glad you're our sun. That you're the one watching over us.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
076	Perhaps, one day, even these gloomy days of rain...
077	Will feel like they had a purpose.
078	Acht... I really hope you survive this.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
079	The Templars' Number Five, Füry, was found dead by Northern Pride's castle gate before the decisive battle had begun.
080	No matter what happens, you shouldn't blame yourself.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0002
081	Her body was given a modest burial by the Paladins who discovered her.
082	Sieba...	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
083	If one of my blades is stopped, I've gotta immediately strike with the other.
084	Because I fight with my heart and everything else on the line.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
085	And you don't want any help?
086	Not until the battle is decided.
087	Just remember: I don't know what Yauras looks like. And I'll be marching with Greed Dike, so I might not be able to catch up with you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
088	Whatever. Just stay out of my way, unless you want a punch in the guts.
089	You're starting to sound like Neun.
090	I'm starting to sound like him? More like he's starting to sound like me!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
091	If that's the case, try to be a better influence on him.
092	Why don't you?
093	He doesn't listen to me any more than you do.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
094	Heh. I don't bow down to anyone!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
095	There's no denying that.
096	Our life down here has no meaning, right?
097	I want to change that, even just for a moment, before I wink out of existence.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
098	I have to win at life at least once, or I'll never rest in peace.
099	...
100	But even if I lose in the end...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
101	I want "us" to win. Together.
102	I am the soldier who encompasses the best of both magic and might.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
103	And I'm the greatest dual-wielding swordswoman in the world!
104	Together, we can turn this world on its head!
105	Let's seize ourselves a real victory.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
106	And dazzle the world while we're at it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
107	The Templars' Number Seven, Sieba, met her end in Saga.
108	We have confirmed that it was Yauras who killed her.
109	Hehe. You've got some gorgeous equipment there, Acht.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
110	Don't you ever forget to polish it up, okay? And don't let anyone hold you back!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
111	We have yet to recover Sieba's body. Saga is a huge area, and the exact whereabouts of her final stand were muddled by the chaos of battle.
112	Zehn...
113	Is this...for me?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0005
114	You're giving me a ball, Acht?
115	Well, I noticed that the one that you're always carrying around is covered in blood, and falling apart at the seams.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
116	What! Wh-when did you...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
117	You were adamant about not joining the Templars, so when you finally did I worried we'd forced you into it.
118	You have nothing to feel bad about. It was only because of...a family matter.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
119	Still...I wanted to express my gratitude in some way.
120	I remembered how happy I was when Sol gave me a gift, and I thought...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
121	You mean that shabby-looking eyepatch of yours?
122	Hehe. Guess we've got something in common.
123	We need to take better care of our things?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
124	Well...anyway... That's why I asked Füry to help me make a ball for you. I thought it should be hand-woven, to match the one you hold so dear.
125	I-it's my first time making something like this, so it's a little misshapen, and it doesn't bounce all that well, but...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
126	It's a ball filled with warmth and charm. Thank you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0008
127	You mean it? Then...would you like to play together sometime? After the battle, I mean.
128	Huh?
129	W-we don't have to play ball! It could be a boardgame from Wadatsumi! I've never played before, but I should be able to get the hang of that one with all the little black and white pieces...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
130	Acht...
131	And I was thinking maybe you could teach me how to use a katana, too! What's that thing you can do? Iai? I should master something like that. I rely on my weapons too much.
132	Acht...I don't think—	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
133	And, I mean, you've been with us for a very long time. You climbed Veda with Sol even before you became a Templar!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
134	Acht?
135	I know you've been with us from the beginning, from way before you became Number Ten.
136	So...you're very important to all of us. I'm sure of that.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0005
137	You're like...a father. To all of us Templars!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
138	I...!
139	I... I just want you to remember that.
140	I appreciate that, Acht. More than I can say.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0019
141	The Templars' Number Ten, Zehn, died during the final battle in Northern Pride.
142	I feel like I might just become whole again.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
143	I could lose everything, and I would never forget those words.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
144	After facing off against half a dozen of our regiment captains, he ended his own life by committing ritual seppuku.
145	Neun...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
146	Well, you know more about fear than I could ever come to know.
147	Fear of losing your place in this world, fear of losing at all… And the fear of growing so strong, you become numb.
148	That's why I want you to walk with me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
149	I will kill those who hurt my friends by any means necessary!
150	Heh! The Templars' code for the Unforgivable! That's my favorite of all our commandments!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
151	It just speaks to me, y'know? I feel it in my core. In my heart. In my muscles. Know what I mean?
152	You were the one who created that commandment.
153	Huh?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
154	It only makes sense that it resonates with you so strongly.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
155	I don't remember doing that.
156	I know.
157	What? You mockin' me or something?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0004
158	No, but since I know how forgetful you can be, I just wanted to remind you about someone before the final battle begins.
159	About a girl you once knew, who puked up nine beers' worth of blood for you.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
160	Huh?
161	...
162	You might not remember her, but she's still alive among us Templars. I don't want her to be forgotten.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
163	The girl who became your strength.
164	The more you run your mouth, the less I have any idea what you're tryin' to say.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
165	I figured you'd say something like that.
166	Who cares about the past? And what does some girl who won't even be bashin' heads with us have to do with me?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0031
167	...
168	Feh. Bet she's just some coward who ran away at the first sign of trouble.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
169	You're wrong.
170	Huh?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
171	You're still together.
172	What d'you mean by that?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0018
173	A-and why... *Sniff* Why can't I stop cryin'?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0019
174	G-guess I must have...somethin' in my eye.
175	You're crying because you can feel her here. She's right here with us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
176	*Sniff*... Really?
177	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
178	So she was...strong, then? Real strong?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
179	Incredibly.
180	At least as strong as you are now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
181	Please don't cry.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
182	Heh... Good to know.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0037
183	You're stronger than this.
184	Thanks for the reminder!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
185	Stronger than you know.
186	Now, let's get this show on the road! I couldn't be more ready. Let 'em come! The bigger they are, the harder they fall!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0004
187	And no one's stronger than us!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0007
188	The Templars' Number Nine, Neun, also died during the decisive battle in Northern Pride.
189	Acht! You'd better keep yourself in good shape!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
190	Don't overdo it! Conserve your strength! We've got a long road ahead!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
191	His body was frozen with ice magic, then shattered into so many pieces that their retrieval was deemed impossible.
192	I will kill those who harm my friends by any means necessary!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0005
193	Acht...
194	("Unforgivable.")
195	The dark wind within Sol is getting stronger!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
196	Huh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
197	But I can fulfill one last promise to you. These bastards who took your lives...
198	Impossible!
199	I will slaughter every single one of them!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
