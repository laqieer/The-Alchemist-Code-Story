001	Why do you not fall? Do you not feel pain?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0006
002	Believe me, this hurts, but a little pain isn't going to stop me.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
003	Not while the resolve I've been entrusted with is urging me onward.
004	Your 'resolve' brings only chaos. What good do you think it can do?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0025
005	It can save this world.
006	...You are deluded.
007	The power of resolve has saved the world before. I've seen it with my own eyes.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
008	I have no more doubts. My friends trusted me to carry on their work, so I can't let anyone stand in my way—not even you.
009	I fight for this world I hold dear!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
010	(Excalibur... It's glowing?!)	VO_irene.irene_battle_0019
011	Why would Excalibur answer someone who wields the power of darkness?
012	Now that I seek to realize the resolve my friends left behind, my own resolve is pure.
013	I don't expect you to understand me now, but I hope you will someday.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
014	What do you mean?
015	Once upon a time, someone told me that my past didn't matter; that they had faith in the man I could become.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
035	I will endure any disgrace to honor that trust. That is the truth of my resolve.
041	...
042	Come after me if you want, but I won't go down quietly. I'll run to the ends of the earth if I have to.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
043	You truly have changed, haven't you?
044	I have. And all it took was for someone to have faith in me.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
045	What makes you think I can change so easily?
048	You named your dearest friend "freedom."	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
049	You mean...Carlotta?
050	Until next time, then.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
051	Basheeny... What has changed you so?
052	Resolve, you said. Perhaps I too...	VO_irene.irene_battle_0019
059	I strove to eliminate resolve because I thought it brought only chaos.
053	But you chose your own path and Excalibur answered. Does that mean it approves of your resolve?
054	I failed my mission... It feels almost like fate.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
060	I want to defend order. That's all I have ever wanted. All I will ever want.
055	I know, Carlotta. You aren't ready to give up either, are you?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
056	I have to speak with Basheeny one last time.
