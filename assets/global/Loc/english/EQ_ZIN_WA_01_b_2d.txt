001	Agh...let's get out of here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
002	G-got it...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
003	Phew. After having been away awhile, I return to this country to find it in disarray.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
004	Are you all right?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
005	Man, you're strong! You saved me!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0033
006	No need to thank me. Besides, a man of your strength wouldn't have needed help in the first place.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
007	I acted unnecessarily.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
008	No, not at all! With that many of them surrounding me, I was trembling inside.	VO_aqil.aqil_event_1004
009	I see. I don't know where you are headed, but traveling alone...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
010	Ever since this country was invaded by Greed Dike, those like the ones we've just encountered have been swaggering about this place.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
011	I'm sure you will encounter more attacks up ahead. You should prepare yourself.
012	I wasn't planning on going anywhere in particular. I'm a carefree merchant. I just came to buy some of the rare items that Wadatsumi has to offer.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_1014
013	A carefree...merchant...is it?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0024
014	Yeah! Tsk...ouch...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
015	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
016	Seems like the guys just now gave me a little cut. Ah, it's nothing.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0043
017	Here. Show me.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
018	No, it's just a scratch.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
019	It's best not to underestimate scratches. Here. Use this medicine.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
020	I've never seen this medicine before. Is it from this country?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
021	I made it myself. Don't worry. It's medicine I learned from abroad.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
022	Ah...learning medicine abroad, huh? Whoa...this medicine stings...! Oww...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
023	Bear with it. Pain is proof of life.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
024	No doubt about it. Not only did you help me, but now you've given me medicine. I owe you.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
025	No need for that. Actually, you said you were a traveling merchant, didn't you? I have a request.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
026	I want you to create a paper on the method of creating this medicine.
027	You can take that and give it to whatever medicine shop you please.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0041
028	Gladly, but what kind of medicine is this? Did you create it yourself?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
029	It's a special medicine that heals Demon's Blood. I was given it in a foreign country.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
030	I wrote down the method of purification. I've examined it and came up with the best ingredients to purify it within Wadatsumi.
031	Demon's Blood...?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_1049
032	Yes! With this, those suffering in this country can be saved!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
