001	Glurrrrrp?!
002	It worked! Even we can fight against the Jam now!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
003	Kamui! It works!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
004	Good. Now, let's get the carriage—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
005	Tch! There're still more!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
006	Kamui! We don't have time for this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
007	I know, but if we try to force our way through, we'll be cursed!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0022
008	Then what should we do?! Should we use more of that drying agent?
009	No, we've confirmed how useful it can be. We need to spare as much as possible for the Liberation Army.
010	It can't be helped. I'll stay back while—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
011	Don't be a fool! You must go with them! You must be the one who ends this hundred year long battle!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
012	Th-that voice!
013	Huzzaaaahh!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
014	Georgios?! What are you doing here?! What happened with Gluttony's army?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
015	They've all been consumed by the Jam. Ceclidis seems to be trying to replace all of his soldiers with the Jam.
016	Wh-what?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
017	That's appalling!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
018	We were nearly wiped out as well, but the desert landscape saved us.
019	Looks like you figured out their weakness as well.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
020	We did.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
021	Ironic, isn't it? That land becoming a desert was the doing of Gluttony Foss, after all.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
022	That desert is also the exactly environment the incarnation of Gluttony's vices cannot thrive in.
023	It's all that gave us the chance to make it here.
024	Boss! We've gathered the best Spiritbonders from within the Fruit Peddlers! Leave this place to us!
025	Y-you guys...!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0009
026	You've got a delivery to make, don't you? You can count on us.
027	But...there are so few of you.
028	You shouldn't underestimate us. Our might far outstrips this challenge. We'll follow as soon as we clear this area!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
029	Go! Finish this, once and for all!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
030	Thank you!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
031	Now then...
032	It's been a while since I've used my powers of purification, but it's never too late to get back in the saddle!
033	I'll have you accompany me in my warm up before the big fight!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
