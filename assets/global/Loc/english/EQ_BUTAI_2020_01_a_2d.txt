001	What follows is a tale that I was sadly unable to include in my will.
002	Though through your letters, I have seen who you truly are.
003	Haa... haa...
004	Ragged sighs spill from your mouth, only to be lost in the rain.
005	...
006	With my hand, I quell them.
007	That's enough.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
008	———!
009	Your voiceless cry reaches me even beyond the grave.
010	...
011	———!
012	...
013	I know your name.
014	Yu...van.
015	No longer.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
016	My name... is Sol.
017	Sol?
018	I'm another blank, just like you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
019	The memories rewind, stop, and begin to play out once again.
020	A new interpretation, performed by new players; enacted anew in a playhouse, and invested with raw emotion.
021	This closing tale of a saint shall be told upon a floodlit stage.
022	I think you got the wrong address.
023	Phew! I've been riding the New Year's high for so long, half the year's gone and passed me by.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
024	I mean, look at this mess. We haven't even started alphabetizing.
025	That's not like us.
026	Northern Pride: Archives (Present Day)
027	It's not like either of us.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
028	If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
029	Sure, but that doesn't mean you have to break your back over it.
030	What am I supposed to do? Lord Zain's, well... gone.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
031	...
032	On top of that, Captain Kudan's missing—and at any moment we could find ourselves in battle with Greed Dike.
033	And through it all, our brave new Lord Commander Kanon was locked in valiant battle with pile after pile of paperwork.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
034	Do you have to say it like that?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
035	And now, having vanquished her foe, she's been tasked with conducting an inventory of the archives.
036	Ugh... If I see another flyleaf, I think I'm going to scream.
037	Truly, the seat of Lord Commander is not for the faint of heart.
038	Oh, stop it. I don't know how I'm going to do this, Othima. It's too much for me.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
039	Well, you've certainly got a lot of expectations to live up to.
040	Throwing in the towel like this isn't splendid at all!
041	Captain Yauras, eh? She couldn't get back to the field fast enough. I'm sure it's just a coincidence we got stuck with all her busywork.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
042	Someone clean up this mess! I can't stand such inefficiency!
043	And Captain Seida... She sure picked a convenient time for a trip back home, huh?
044	Ugh... I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown!
045	Keep it together, airhead!
046	And Captain Kagura's gone on some sort of seaside adventure without a word of explanation.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
047	What's that all about, I wonder? Some sort of secret romantic tryst?
048	I doubt it.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
049	Ahh, to be one of the lucky few blessed with love!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
050	Dear any gods who might be listening, please let this man crash and burn.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
051	Oho!
052	What?
053	Now this is a good find!
054	Huh?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
055	Ahem! My dear Lord Commander Kanon.
056	Um... Yes?
057	I present unto you this humble gift.
058	Is this... a journal? Whose could it be?
059	Tut-tut. You're one of those people who reads the last page first, aren't you?
060	O-of course not! Lies and slander!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
061	That's a terrible habit, you know. The anticipation is half the fun.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
062	Don't judge me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
063	Anyway, make sure you read this one from the beginning.
064	Fine...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
065	It was written by Lord Commander Zain.
066	What?
067	It's his last will and testament.
068	His... His what?!
069	That doesn't make any sense!
070	Oh?
071	I'm sure all Lord Commanders must have something written down, just in case worse comes to worst...
072	But to have written an entire will...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
073	Lord Zain fell suddenly in battle! Why would he have written a will like this in advance? He didn't have any reason to—unless...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
074	Exactly.
075	Huh?
076	That's why I'm not so sure this is actually a will.
077	What do you mean? You're the one who told me it was his will in the first place!
078	I'm not sure what else to call it.
079	Honestly, I'm not even sure what to think of it.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
080	...
081	This burden seems too great for me.
082	Huh?
083	I will be the tenth to take this seat.
084	So, like my predecessors before me, I must shoulder the weight of the Holy Guard's absolute justice. And yet, I fear it will be too much for me to bear.
085	I know not whom this record is meant for...
086	Only that...
087	Come. The stage is set.
088	My tale begins with a memory.
089	It's time for the curtain to rise.
090	Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)
091	Sorry to rain on your parade...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
092	But this is as far as you go!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0014
093	Well, well. Look who it is.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
094	Sometimes you find what you're looking for when you stop to sniff the roses.
095	You don't give up easily, do you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
096	The pursuit of world peace does demand one's best efforts.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
097	I've got nothing to say to you. That's not going to change, no matter how many times you come calling.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
098	Then why do you insist on standing in my way?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
099	Because all that talk of world peace...
100	Oh?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
101	It just rubs me the wrong way.
102	Guess I brought this on myself, huh?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
103	What are you talking about?
104	Y'know, for intruding on your romantic rendezvous.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
105	Othima, we are on a mission.
106	C'mon, cut the stoic act! I can tell you're blushing!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0023
107	Othima. Focus. Now.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
108	Fine, fine! Be a grouch.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0037
109	Who's there?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
110	Well, now. What a pleasant surprise.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0001
111	Zain? This guy's got bad news written all over him!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0028
112	Identify yourself!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
113	Let's see if your bite matches your bark, shall we?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
114	Guh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
115	Please. I can see your every move long before you make it.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
116	You're... predicting my attacks? Who are you?!
117	This seems as good a time as any to close the trap.
118	Zain? Any idea where your lady love's gotten to?
119	She's not my "lady love"!
120	So you say, but if your cheeks get any redder, they'll catch fire!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
121	Silence!
122	He's right, you know. You are rather incandescent.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
123	Gwaaarrgghhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
124	Sorry, but I don't have the time to play around.
125	Extraordinary.
126	Oh, Zain. Ever the celebrity.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
127	Where have you been?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
128	Seeing her lover surrounded by such a crowd, how's a lady to feel but jealous?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
129	I knew it!
130	Do you truly consider me your... your lover?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
131	Hmhm. Why don't you tell me?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
132	You're...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
133	It's touching to see you so interested in Zain, but I'm afraid I don't like to share.
134	...
135	Have we met? That hood makes it hard to tell. You must be awfully shy, to wear it so low.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
136	Kaya, the Crimson Dragon. Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard.
137	It's not only Zain you've been stalking, I see.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
138	This will be your first and last warning.
139	Warn away.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0004
140	You are not welcome here. Leave.
141	Whatever do you mean?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
142	Enough. It's time we got down to business.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
143	Protect me, my love!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
144	You heard her, lover boy!
145	Stop encouraging him!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
146	Oh, fine. The vanguard's all yours...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0041
147	Lord Commander!
148	I suppose you can't be persuaded to stand aside?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
149	Of course not.
150	The desire that is common to all people, to preserve peace and conquer evil; this is the creed of the Holy Guard.
151	That is the absolute justice of Babel.
152	Our light shines upon all the land; from the highest mountains, to the ocean's depths.
153	And should any oppose this sacred sword...
154	Its radiance shall turn their shadow to light!
155	Ahh, Zain. Tenth Lord Commander...
156	Embrace the light that guides the world!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0024
