001	Just as I thought. The Greed Dike soldiers have infiltrated Saga after all!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
002	Yes, but judging from their size, I'm guessing they're scouts.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
003	In any case, at some point they'll most likely engage in conflict!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
004	What terrible people! I remember when they destroyed Wadatsumi!
005	...Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
006	Surely they're not planning on doing the same thing they did to Wadatsumi...
007	Kagura, I'm sure you heard about the terrible things they did to the people of Wadatsumi, right?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
008	Well, yeah...after all, I was there.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
009	You were there? Then all the more so! It must hurt your head just to remember...huh?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0045
010	Sorry, you might not have heard, but...I'm actually from Wadatsumi.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0035
011	Huh?! No, but...wait, hold on!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
012	Weren't you related to the royal lineage of some country, Kagura?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
013	...Yes.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
014	Huh?! But...does that mean...?!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
015	Yes...it does.
016	Y-you're Wadatsumi royalty?! Oh...! Sorry...I had no idea...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
017	No, it's okay. I'm just glad to hear that you have Wadatsumi in your thoughts.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
018	Yes, but...I got really upset, you know?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0020
019	Right now they've pretty much become a territory of Greed Dike, but...
020	It still doesn't change the fact that they destroyed Wadatsumi!
021	On top of that, they've never apologized for any of it. How villainous can they be?!
022	But...it can't be helped.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
023	In Wadatsumi we used something we called "Chakras" every day without realizing that it was a classification of Alchemy.
024	When it was discovered that it was in conflict with the Magna Code treaty...
025	It ultimately put Greed Dike, who had rule over Wadatsumi, in the right.
026	But...the people of Wadatsumi didn't do it with malice though!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
027	They didn't use it for military purposes...
028	Of course not! We just used it in our everyday life.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
029	Nobody even thought of using Chakras for military purposes!
030	Right?! I mean, no matter how you look at it, it was obviously an invasion!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0037
031	It's completely unfair that Greed Dike's actions are justified. Doesn't everyone in Saga say that?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0029
032	I'm sure somebody got some kind of bribe from Greed Dike!
033	It must've been Waginau...I'm sure of it.
034	Huh...?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
035	N-no...in any case, there's no point in going over it again.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
036	That's not true! I mean...this time they're trying to do the same thing with Saga!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
037	Well...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
038	For starters...why did they even need to destroy Wadatsumi?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
039	It's true that Wadatsumi had undergone their own development and were creating strange weapons and arts which must've been attractive to them...
040	But...if it was for territory expansion or to take the rights for those crafts...
041	Why would they go out of their way to actually kill the people?!
042	Like you said...at first people whispered that those were the reasons behind their motives.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
043	However...recently, I came to understand that they had a different motive.
044	Are you talking about the Mikaboshi?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
045	Huh? Why do you know about it?!
046	My teacher told me a few things when I joined her.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0020
047	It surprised me...
048	Commander Zain had heard about the discovery of the Mikaboshi and, in an attempt to prevent exploitation of it, he was killed, right?
049	Yes...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
050	The Wadatsumi royal family had something called the Kagutsuchi. It was to be used in case the hidden Mikaboshi was discovered and abused.
051	It was a secret weapon that had the ability to destroy the Mikaboshi.
052	You mean it could actually destroy it?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
053	Yes.
054	For Greed Dike, who was after the Mikaboshi, this thing was considered a threat.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
055	That's why they tried to end the Wadatsumi royal bloodline.
056	I'm sorry, I don't know what to say, but...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0020
057	Don't worry about it. It's all in the past. You can say whatever you want about it.
058	Okay. Well, if they saw it as a threat...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0029
059	Then why didn't they just sever the royal bloodline?
060	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
061	Why did they have to go out of their way to completely devastate all of Wadatsumi...?
062	I'm sorry...I'm speaking without fully knowing the situation.
063	But, you know...it seems weird that, just because they couldn't obtain the Mikaboshi, they would go out of their way to destroy the entire country.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
064	What are you saying? That's exactly what they did.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
065	But maybe...there was another reason for why they did that...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
066	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
067	No... Let's not get into it since it's just speculation. I shouldn't have brought it up.
068	Captain Othima said the exact same thing.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
069	Huh...?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
070	That they obliterated the country in order to destroy the truth of their invasion.
071	I don't really want to reflect too much on that time, but I decided to think of it that way.
072	That being said...do you think there was another reason why?
073	At the time, Commander Zain was alive and well; the world in general was more balanced.
074	In other words, in a state absent of any real conflict, why would Orion act in that way?
075	It wasn't as if the Mikaboshi was going to escape somewhere. Yet, he invaded with outrageous force.
076	...?! Watch out!!!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
077	Huh...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
078	Aghh...!!!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0022
079	?! ...Almira!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
080	So you're with someone who can read the wind, huh? I was hoping to carve you up with my beautiful blades.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
081	Ack! Who are you?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
082	I am one of the Veda Templars...Sieba, the Twin Blade. You're Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment, aren't you?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
083	Veda Templars...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
084	Unfortunately, you're not Yauras, but I guess you'll do.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
085	?! She disappeared?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
086	Let's just call this fight a prelude to my fight with her.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
087	Behind...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
088	Bloom into a beautiful flower and explode into scattering petals!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0001
089	Agh...!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
090	Kagura!
091	Ugh...! Y-you wield a twin blade like Yauras!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
092	No, you're wrong. Yauras has a twin blade like me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0017
093	Wh-who cares what the order is?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
094	The fact that the Templars are here must mean that Greed Dike has gotten their hands on some information!
095	Are you talking about Matter? Of course.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
096	If it wasn't so...I would never come all the way to this dull countryside.
097	Ack! You're not getting away! Not you of all people!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
098	Now that I think about it, you've tried to blow up the Mikaboshi before, right?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
099	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
100	Matter is our reward. I won't let you lay a finger on it.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
101	H-how...?! Aghh!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
102	Aren't you a little slow to realize that you've been slashed? This is pointless.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0003
103	H-how can she move so fast?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
104	Is that it, Paladin? At this rate you're even worse than Yauras...	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0017
105	Huh...?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
106	Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
107	You've wrapped her in phoenix wings! You can do this, Kagura!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0032
108	If I were still there at all.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
109	Huh...?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
110	Agh!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
111	You're too slow with your moves. You won't be able to catch me at that rate.	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0013
112	What the...?! Even Kagura's art can't catch her....?!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
113	Hehe. Don't worry. Rest assured I'll finish you with one blow so that you don't suffer.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
114	...Ugh! Yo...you gotta be kidding me! I'm not gonna lose to a fake like you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
115	...! What...?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
116	I-if I lost to a fake like you...I wouldn't hear the end of it from Yauras! Ugh...!
117	Fake... What exactly are you saying?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0012
118	I...I've seen Yauras right up close.
119	Her agility and technique with the sword, her gracefulness...you're nothing compared to her! You're a fake in all things, and I won't lose to you!
120	Did you call me a fake? Are you saying I'm an imitation, you little...!!!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0015
