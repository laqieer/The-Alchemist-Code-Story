001	I have been searching for a version of myself that could be beloved by another for so, so long.
002	A version of myself that is neither afraid, nor a lie.
003	Perhaps I am a plucked rose.
004	Y-you wield twin blades like Yauras!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
005	No, you're wrong. Yauras has twin blades like me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0017
006	Once I did not even possess buds with the potential to bloom, yet now...
007	In agility! In swordsmanship! In grace! I'm above her in everything!!!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0015
008	I am the fake?! You've got to be kidding me! That little rat is the one who is copying me in everything!
009	I may blossom with grace.
010	What a wonderful moment!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0009
011	The famous Yauras being carved by my blade...and kneeling pathetically!
012	It's almost like a dream!!!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0023
013	Ugh...! Wh-why do you see me as your enemy?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
014	Of course... You wouldn't remember me, would you?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
015	Have we met before?
016	Though I may go unseen by all...
017	Do you remember?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0031
018	No...
019	...I didn't think you would.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
020	But...I still remember you clearly in that moment like it was yesterday.
021	I can surely still blossom with grace. However...
022	Goodbye...
023	Agh?! Ngah!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0025
024	What a poor soul...
025	H-huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
026	If you are reborn...then you should live...however you wish to live...
027	This is how I will die. I will slip from this world, having lived a pitiful life.
028	Yet perhaps this is why I won't simply fade away.
029	I was a brazen beast, clad in a costume of lies, laughing profanely.
030	I was unsightly filth, lower than a weed.
031	That is who I was back then.
032	Oi!
033	Wake up!
034	Iris!
035	Shut your trap, old man.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0013
036	What are you doing in my vault of stolen goods?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0012
037	Ahahah! Why shouldn't I be in here? A bed of jewels, a pillow of doubloons! A crib for me, myself, and I!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
038	Sparkly, dazzling, gorgeous!
039	Get yourself ready, you lazy sod! We've gotta get out of here! Bloody hell... Cauldrons and curses!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0016
040	Wh-what's up with you? We're leaving already? Can't we wait 'til morning?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
041	A Wratharian national treasure was among the goods you stole, you dolt!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0012
042	That makes us an enemy of the nation! After all that chaff about there being nothing to worry about... That blasted client tricked us! Curses!
043	W-we could hold them off, no problem! We're the Golden Wolves!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
044	Don't be absurd! A tiny band of thieves like us would be stamped out before we had the chance to say diddly-squat. Now, is there gold in your ears, or are you just ignoring me, lass? Get yourself ready or I'm leaving you behind!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0014
045	We're just going to flee?! In the middle of the night?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0021
046	The Wratharis Guard is going to assault our base come dawn. The others...don't know about it yet.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
047	Let's load ourselves up with all the booty we can and get ourselves out of here! We're family, we only need each other!
048	Y-you mean...just leave everyone behind?
049	Iris, listen to me! Iris...!
050	D-don't touch me!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
051	I know I've put you through some rough times, but this is our chance to clean our hands of this business! We can live a good life off of this gold, and never have to steal another penny!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0011
052	You're more important to me than any of these fools, Iris.
053	B-but I...
054	I don't even care about all this loot. Not compared to you.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
055	Everything gleams like gold in my memory of this time; the goods we stole, the days that rolled on by—even my old man's dirt-stained cheeks and crooked grin.
056	Let's live an honest life together. Just you and me.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0011
057	...
058	W-well... Okay.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0020
059	Apologies for the wait, gentlemen.
060	Wratharis soldiers?! We need to run!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0027
061	Heh...heheh... Hold on, now. This is all part of the plan.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
062	Wh-what?
063	You will hand over our national treasure, as well as a large portion of your assets.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
064	Heheheh, of course, of course. Then you will crush the Golden Wolves and have medals of honor placed around your necks.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0011
065	And...you will be so kind as to forget I was ever here, yes?
066	Hand over the assets.
067	Yes, yes, of course. Right away.
068	Um... J-just so you know, I have no intention of giving up the goods I've stolen.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
069	Oh, yes. That's perfectly fine.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
070	No skin off my back.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
071	H-huh?
072	You are one of the assets that we will be taking into custody.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
073	Wh-what?! No! It's a lie, isn't it, old man? You said... You said we would live an honest life together!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
074	Together? No, no, no. I'm using you to save my own neck.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
075	She's not bad. Not bad at all.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0009
076	You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0008
077	Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0023
078	Nrgh!
079	The old geezer's gone, girlie.
080	Heheh... That makes you ours now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0008
081	Don't be absurd.
082	You've been sold out.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
083	Shut your mouth!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0015
084	You've been abandoned.
085	I don't belong to anyone but myself!
086	All of you are going to pay with your lives for this... Die!
