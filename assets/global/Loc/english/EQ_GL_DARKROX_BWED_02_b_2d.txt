001	Well, we haven't turned them into piles of scrap, at least.
002	We might be able to use one of their chips to gain access.
003	You've done this before, haven't you?
004	...Just a lucky guess.
005	This one should suffice.
006	Roxanne swipes the chip against the door's identification slot.
007	With a sharp click, the door slides open.
008	It worked.
009	Don't just stand there and gawp.
010	- Archives, Room XX -
011	An impressive army of shelves line the room in silent aisles.
012	Overhead, dim lights bathe the room in a sickly, pale hue.
013	It'd take us ages to get through all of these.
014	And the labels aren't particularly helpful, either.
015	Pick a shelf and get started. I'll stay by this side near the door.
016	Siegfried flips through binder after binder of paperwork, nearly spilling their contents in haste.
017	No good. These records are useless.
018	Accidents... Acquisitions... Acquittals...
019	Paroles. Probations...
020	Wait. Shouldn't all these be under the jurisdiction of the mayor's office?
021	Beats me. Maybe they should just all be filed under "Corruption".
022	I'm moving to the next shelf.
023	*sigh*
024	(There has to be a better way to find what I need.)
025	(That incident with Rox's house wasn't widely reported, no doubt suppressed by Goetia.)
026	(And since those legal reports appear to be copies, it seems Goetia even has eyes and ears in the mayor's office.)
027	(That means whatever they retrieved from the manor should be...)
028	A stout black cabinet is tucked into the lowest level of the shelf just out of sight.
029	Locked. No surprise there...
030	Found something?
031	Don't you make any sounds when you walk?
032	Come on, let me have a look.
033	See, this is why I wear hairpins all the time.
034	Didn't think they could be so useful, hmm?
035	There. All done.
036	You'd probably set off an alarm or two if you had your way.
037	That I would.
038	Would what?
039	It's creepy when you mumble like that.
040	...
041	It doesn't help when you don't remember.
042	Well, I'm starting to regret helping you.
043	But it's not like I'm helping you out of the kindness of my heart, or some such.
044	It's mutually beneficial. And I'm throwing you to the wolves, if they show up.
045	Roxanne...
046	I told you to STOP calling me that!
047	A sealed bag falls loose from one of the cabinet's compartments.
048	This is...
