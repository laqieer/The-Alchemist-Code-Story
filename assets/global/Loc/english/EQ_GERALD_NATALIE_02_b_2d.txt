001	Who the hell is this maniac attacking us?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
002	Rather than defending or evading...	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
003	It's more effective to commit to a frontal assault!
004	H-he's a monster! He ain't human!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
005	Prepare to meet your maker.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
006	S-stay your blade! I yield! Spare me, please, I beg you!
007	I cannot.
008	Gerald! Wait!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
009	You would stop me?
010	They've surrendered! What's the point of killing them? Shouldn't we arrest them and hand them over to the Envylian Guard?
011	If we did that, it would fail to make this a hallmark achievement for the Scarlet Legion.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
012	We must finish them off ourselves.
013	G-Gerald? What are you saying?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
014	Who cares about what this achieves for the Legion? You didn't create it to win accolades!
015	The Scarlet Legion was formed in order to carry out the oath you made, wasn't it? So just...calm down!
016	You don't understand!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
017	Tch...
018	Where are you going?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
019	I will pursue those who fled. You lot! Follow me.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
020	You're wounded. Let me—
021	If they escape, the entire mission will be a failure. I must hurry.
022	Gerald!
