001	Rega should've made it back down safely by now. The area will probably be littered with Jam, though.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
002	We've got our own fair share of Jam here, too! There's no end in sight!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
003	Georgios, can't you just use your power to take them all out in a single blow?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
004	My powers cannot be used just anywhere. Each use drains away some of my life force. We need to take these creatures out with old-fashioned grit and steel.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0040
005	It drains your life force?! Then why did you use it to save me?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
006	Reclaiming Beelzebub takes priority...and this isn't the time for talking!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
007	The part of it that was glowing green must be around this area, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
008	Yes, this should be it. Even if it's not the exact spot, as long we manage to get inside, it'll be fine.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
009	Then we've finally made it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
010	We sure did. Georgios, you ready?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
011	Hyaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
012	Yikes!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
013	Careful! You wouldn't want to fall from this height! Well...?!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
014	Muhahahaha! Feast your eyes on my strength! Behold the might of my clan!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0011
015	You cut its spine in half! The inside...doesn't look like the innards of a living, breathing creature at all. It's more like...the remnants of some ancient chamber.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
016	It's too dark to see anything. We won't be able to work out where the core is from here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
017	The answer is simple. If we can't see it from here, then we just need to venture inside and search. I'm going ahead!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
018	We should follow him. We don't know what dangers may lurk inside, so be ready for anything!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
019	Whoa... What's with this place?! We should be inside a dragon...but this is too out there. I feel like I'm going to be sick.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
020	Well, it's not like we spend a lot of time inside of other living beings, let alone dragons...but you're right. I'm getting a bad vibe.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
021	We'll just have to bear it until we find the core. Where's Georgios gotten to?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
022	Over there!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
023	Graaaah! My blade isn't doing any damage!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
024	Georgios!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
025	Is this the dragon's core?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
026	Intruders! Leave this place! Leave at once!
027	...?!
