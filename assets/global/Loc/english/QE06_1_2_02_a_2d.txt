001	Hmph, did you really think you stood a chance against me, demon?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
002	The demons are still increasing in numbers. This could mean...	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
003	Say no more. The Hidden Ogre bewilders the people, forcing corruption to accumulate within them.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
004	Then the usual demons go around biting them, spreading the harm. That's all there is to it.
005	(Still, I've never seen them organized like this before. What is their end goal here?)	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
006	(Guess you were right.)
007	Hey! What are you doing?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
008	S-sorry, sir! Someone in a Blade Fox uniform attacked us, so—
009	Captain Ugachi!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
010	Right... We need to kill that damn Hidden Ogre. Now.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
011	The Hidden Ogre is not among us! If you've got time to fight amongst each other, get out there and find the damn demon!
012	Y-yes, sir!
013	The seeds of doubt were sowed when it disguised itself as Celis, and now this is the result.
014	How egregious...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0013
015	Captain Ugachi...
016	Let's get this job done.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
017	Amane, you better be okay!
018	A-Azami?! What are you—?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0025
019	You shall serve us.
020	Y-you're not...Azami...	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
021	It is too late for you now.
022	No...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
023	Heheheh, you too shall become fodder for our ambitions.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
024	Ambitions?
025	You need not know. How does it feel to be bitten by one you trust?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
026	That emotion you feel, the corruption it spawns... That is what we feed upon.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
027	Y-you're the...Hidden Ogre!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
028	Humans have been calling me that, yes.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
029	Nngh!
030	Now, shall I devour you? Or perhaps I shall let the corruption fill you...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
031	And make you one of our own?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
032	How many have you bitten...? How many have you devoured?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
033	What makes you think I keep track of any of that? Do you remember every meal you've ever had?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
034	What gives you the right? How dare you destroy the lives of innocent people, robbing them of a future?! Inexcusable!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
035	You rage for the sake of others instead of for your current predicament? Humans are truly perplexing.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
036	As a member of the Blade Fox, I will accomplish my mission!
037	Prepare yourself!
