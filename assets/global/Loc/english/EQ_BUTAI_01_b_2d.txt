001	The Sacred Stones will beguile people on occasion, and give their desires form...
002	Even if nothing would change if their desires were to be fulfilled.
003	This is a story that took place on the continent of Babel.
004	The story of a bond.
005	The Phantom...is a Wadatsumi shrine maiden?
006	She was known as the savior priestess for dedicating her life to the restoration of Wadatsumi.
007	She was quite famous for the healing prayers and dances that she performed even before royalty, but...
008	Someone was manipulating her soul as a Phantom?
009	Yes. I saw it with my own eyes.
010	Yet you saw no sign of any alchemists there?
011	They must've done what they could to avoid leaving any trace of themselves behind.
012	Hmm...
013	This is weird. I mean, what's their overall objective?
014	These people of Wadatsumi were killed under the guise of archaeology for the transmutation of Philosopher's Stones. Isn't that what you reported?
015	Well, yes, but...I still feel like there's more going on here.
016	It's highly inefficient to work on nothing but assumptions.
017	You know I'm your superior, right? Why are all of our female knights so scary?
018	Wadatsumi is still under occupation by Greed Dike. If civilians are being abducted, it'll result in a huge blow to their reputation.
019	What if Greed Dike is involved with this issue?
020	Kudan?
021	It's not so far-fetched an idea to think that Greed Dike has continued to make the people of Wadatsumi suffer.
022	Don't you see? That is precisely the kind of assumption that we should be avoiding!
023	You can only say that because you don't know him! You don't know the kind of man Orion is!
024	Kudan...
025	We need to stop Greed Dike as soon as possible! Lord Zain, you need only say the word.
026	I understand how you feel, but we cannot act without sufficient evidence.
027	This is just like the time they invaded Wadatsumi! Are you saying that the people of Wadatsumi will not be protected from Greed Dike's cruelties?!
028	I am not saying that we will ignore the issue. You are not alone in this, Kudan.
029	We took up swords to protect the weak. Much like you did.
030	But how can I protect anything if I do not act?!
031	You protected me, Kudan.
032	Kagura...
033	So don't be so hard on yourself. I hate seeing you like this.
034	That's right! We can't change the past, so let's do what we can for the future!
035	How can you be so...
036	I was entrusted with something important, too. Captain Cadanova entrusted me with the protection of this continent.
037	...
038	So...I think I know something of how you feel.
039	We cannot overlook the misuse of Alchemy. We should gather evidence as we investigate the matter.
040	It wouldn't be splendid at all if we did nothing.
041	True. I mean, a Phantom was involved, after all.
042	Are...are you all on board with this?
043	Never forget that you are not alone in this. We would not let you bear this burden all by yourself.
044	Yes, sir.
045	You're always overthinking things. Learn to live life simply! There's no point in always being so worked up about everything.
046	You should probably try thinking a little more though, Monzein.
047	What did you say?!
048	Please stop stirring each other up. Don't you realize how inefficient this makes things?
049	I want to formally make a request as the captain of the 4th Regiment.
050	Please allow me to investigate Wadatsumi. I need to confirm what is happening there with my own eyes.
051	I ask the same! I cannot stand by and do nothing as my homeland is trampled over!
052	I'll go where you go, Captain Kudan!
053	Kanon...
054	You do realize that you could be sending your comrades to their deaths? On top of that, this could be taken as interference in domestic affairs, and could potentially devolve into a disaster of international proportions.
055	Even knowing all that, you are still resolved to go. Is this correct?
056	Raise your head, Kudan. Will you take full responsibility for your decision and actions?
057	I will.
058	Very well then. The 4th Regiment will proceed to Wadatsumi and conduct a direct investigation.
059	Lord Zain!
060	This is nothing more than an investigative mission. Any battles you engage in must be for the purpose of self-defense only.
061	Y-you're allowing us to go?
062	We share the same sense of justice, Kudan. Just don't push yourself too hard.
063	Thank you! The 4th Regiment will depart immediately!
064	Good luck.
065	Yes, sir. We're going. Make ready as soon as possible!
066	Right!
067	Kanon.
068	Yes, sir?
069	Yauras, bring Basheeny here.
070	What? I mean...as you wish.
071	Is something wrong? Did I do something wrong?
072	I'd like to ask you to do something.
073	Yes?
074	Kanon, this is Basheeny. One of the trainees.
075	Yes, of course. I know of him.
076	I'm placing him under your direct command. Understood, Basheeny?
077	Absolutely.
078	U-under my...?! What's this all of a sudden?
079	You've been in the Holy Guard for a good while now. It's about time you learned a few things about having subordinates.
080	Treat him well and teach him what is expected of a Paladin.
081	Are you sure I should be responsible for him?
082	I want to entrust him to you.
083	Well, then, I'll...I'll do my best! Nice to meet you, Basheeny! I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know!
084	Please be gentle...
085	And Kanon...please watch over Kudan for me.
086	Me? Watch over him?
087	You'll know what I mean, I'm sure.
088	All right.
089	I place my faith in the light within you that Cadanova trusted.
090	Leave it to me!
091	...
092	Now go. Take care.
093	Let's go, Basheeny!
094	Understood.
095	Why entrust Basheeny to Kanon?
096	I just had a feeling that this was the right move.
097	The light Captain Cadanova entrusted the peace of the world to, huh?
098	I simply cannot shake the feeling that the fate of this continent rests on their shoulders.
099	I see.
100	Everyone else, get to investigating this issue from other angles.
101	What we must find out is who is gathering Philosopher's Stones, for what reason, and who summoned the Phantom.
102	Don't let any little details fall through the cracks! Innocent lives are on the line here. Report back on everything you find.
103	Understood!
104	It is our duty to prevent the reckless abuse of power. We must never forget the calamity that this continent suffered ages ago as a result of the great power of Alchemy.
189	We cannot allow its misuse to go unchecked. We must never forget the responsibility we bear as those with great power ourselves.
190	This world will not be one where the weak are exploited by the strong.
191	Be righteous, for we are the absolute justice of the continent. I am counting on all of you to make that apparent!
105	Yes, sir!
106	Looks like we might get a lead sooner than I thought.
107	Leave this to me. The rest of you hit the targets ahead of us. We'll pull as much information out of them as we can! Go!
108	Yes, sir!
109	...
110	Phew...
111	Basheeny, what was that power you used just now?
112	Nothing you need to worry about. Let's regroup with Kanon.
113	Answer my question, Basheeny.
114	Come to think of it, don't you use the power of darkness, Captain Kudan?
115	Who...are you?
116	Just a newcomer. I don't intend to get in the way.
117	At least for now, I suppose?
118	You're way too suspicious of me.
119	I'm asking as the captain of the 4th Regiment. Depending on your answer, I may not be able to allow you to come any further with us.
120	Well, this isn't good.
121	There you are, Basheeny! Don't go disappearing on me like that!
122	Kanon.
123	I won't accept disobedience! Captain Kudan ordered the three of us to work together!
124	I, uh...
125	You're under my care! No more going off and doing your own thing, got it?!
126	Wait, I just...
127	Got it?!
128	Yes. I'm sorry.
129	Good!
130	You know...you also act on your own, disobeying orders all the time.
131	Shut it! I'm sorry, Captain Kudan. I should have kept better watch over him. Basheeny! You apologize, too!
132	I'm...sorry.
133	Hm? Oh, right.
134	Is something the matter, Captain Kudan?
135	Kanon, you...
136	Yes?
137	Ahh, it's nothing.
138	Wadatsumi has changed so much.
139	Yes...so much of it has been burnt.
140	I remember this place being alive with greenery.
141	Ah!
142	What's the matter, Kagura?
143	Look. There used to be a village there.
144	There's...nothing left of it now.
145	No...!
146	It was such a large village. They used to hold a festival every summer. Everyone was so happy there.
147	But now...
148	You saved me, Kudan.
149	Had I been stronger, I could have saved more lives.
150	Kudan...
151	It's not too late for that.
152	What?
153	So long as Kagura is alive, Wadatsumi's spirit lives on.
154	You protected the only hope left for Wadatsumi, Captain Kudan.
155	You... You just had to say the things he said, didn't you?
156	What?
157	I don't ever want to feel the way I did that day again. I can't stand to watch people being taken advantage of anymore.
158	Nobody should have their home taken from them. That's why we have to find whatever evidence we can.
159	We can't let the people of Wadatsumi suffer anymore!
160	Exactly.
161	Everyone, look!
162	Greed Dike soldiers?!
163	I knew you lot were involved.
164	Wadatsumi is under the rule of Greed Dike. It isn't odd for troops to be stationed here. Besides, aren't we the ones who are coming here uninvited?
165	You...!
166	Basheeny! That's no way to speak to your superior officer!
167	I was just making an observation.
168	I'm gonna give you a lecture after this!
169	...
170	Now, then. If you are involved, know that we will show no mercy.
171	You're going to tell us everything you know.
172	Kudan, calm down!
173	Huzzzaaaaaaahh!
174	What...are they?!
175	Kudan!
176	I suggest we retreat for now.
177	We will not retreat.
178	Why? Wadatsumi isn't even your home. What pushes you to—?
179	You've never had to witness the unbearable horrors that I have!
180	Need a hand, Brother?
181	You...!
182	If you can't beat them all, then you just need to stall them.
183	Kudan, now!
184	Huzzzaaaaaahhhh!
185	Are you all right, Kagura?
186	I'm fine, but...
187	Long time no see, Kudan.
