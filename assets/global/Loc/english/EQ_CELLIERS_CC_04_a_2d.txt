001	According to the results, you're in grave danger right now.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
002	You turned the flower and vase in your room into crystal without thinking, didn't you?
003	...!
004	Your crystallization ability is a power that solidifies the flow of Alchemy.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0003
005	All things cease to function when they lose that flow.
006	In other words, your power is a threat to all things with Alchemy—everyone around you. And that power is growing remarkably stronger than it used to be.
007	Your current power is like a cup filled with water. There's no telling when it'll overflow.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0011
008	......
009	I felt it too, you know. That I couldn't control my power the way I want to. I'd never had that problem before...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
010	So the control you once had is coming undone...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0031
011	(I heard that his crystallization power was closely linked to his mental state.)
012	(Could that attack have caused Celliers' power to destabilize? I wonder if that's preventing his control...)
013	If I can't control this power of mine...then I can't go back to the village, can I?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0022
014	...Yes. As of now, it would be difficult to get permission for you to reside in the village.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
015	......
016	That being said, I want to do something for you. After all, you've been trying so hard to stand on your own two feet.
017	So Michael and I will look for a way to stabilize your power, and—
018	It's okay. I won't go back to the village.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0039
019	What?
020	I was mistaken... Someone like me, with a power like this, shouldn't live with regular people.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
021	I tried to use this power to make my way in this world, but even then, I always relied on Mielikki to make it work...
022	And in the end...this power put her in danger, and...caused her sadness.
023	Deep down, I always knew this power...could never make people happy!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
024	...Is that right? If you ask me, you've made at least one young girl quite happy.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
025	When Mielikki gazed at the crystal you gave her, her eyes were filled with happiness.
026	...Come again?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
027	I met with her just recently. I had some business at the adjoining laboratory, you see.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
028	She was sad that she couldn't see you. And yet...
029	I've got to do my best! After all, I have a super special, ultra-important job I just gotta see through to the end!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0032
030	And besides, I'll be fine... I've got this, after all!
031	This is...a crystal butterfly?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0006
032	Yeah! Celliers gave it to me. Looking at this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
033	Remembering his gentle smile makes everything better.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
034	She really said that?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
035	(Mielikki... You still like my crystals?)
036	I, too, think your crystal craftsmanship is something exceptional. Somehow cool and warm in equal measure... Like morning sunlight through the trees.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
037	And what's more... You enjoy your work, don't you?
038	Well, I...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
039	Anyone could tell the truth from your pieces. Each of your wares are crafted with meticulous care.
040	......
041	The fact that you obtained this power through horrendous experiments is indisputable. I can't imagine how awful that past must be for you.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
042	Despite this, you've made this power into something all your own. You were learning to love that power of yours.
043	......
044	I can empathize somewhat, I think. The work of a Court Mage has no end of hardship, but I'm happy to be of service to others.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
045	That's why everyone here is happy to help. Being able to use one's strength as you wish is what it means to live well, and happily.
046	That's why I like this job. I hope that you can do the same—that you can use your power to do whatever your heart desires.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
047	Flamel...
048	...Why are you being so nice to me?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
049	You, Michael, everyone here... You all care so much, think so much for someone like me.
050	Celliers...
051	Why... Why?! I'm... I'm a monster...!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
052	That's not true! It'll be okay...after all...Celliers...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
053	We became friends, didn't we?
054	...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
055	Mielikki...
056	(That's right, it was the same back then... Mielikki cared about me more than her own pain.)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
057	(Despite the fear, despite the pain, she tried to protect me. That's why I'm here today. And yet...)
058	...How shameful. You all care so much for me, and all I'm doing is thinking of myself.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
059	I can't keep going on like this. I have to do something, too...for Mielikki's sake.
060	Celliers...
061	......
062	Flamel. I have an idea I need to run past you...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
063	Celliers. Finally showed yourself, have you? I'd heard you'd holed up in the laboratory. It was worth staking out the place.
064	......
065	Oh! This sweet scent... Is it that aroma that mesmerizes monsters?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
066	We weren't up to snuff last we met, but don't think it'll go so well for you this time.
067	...I get it. In that case, I'll... I'll just do what I can...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0032
