001	Grr...
002	(She's incredibly strong for a girl of her size...)
003	(It must be the sword!)
004	Huff... Huff...
005	Please... Stop!
006	The only way she'll stop is when one of us is dead.
007	I've had enough of killing!
008	You made your mistake when you dared to come back here.
009	If anything, your death will be swift. You won't suffer.
010	Roxanne loads a round into her sniper rifle and takes aim.
011	...!
012	(This is bad... Red won't be able to tank it by herself, even with my help.)
013	(Argh! There's only one thing I can do!)
014	Berith suddenly pivots himself in front of Red.
015	Berith?!
016	Before the shot goes off, a sudden burst of fire sweeps across the scene.
017	Ugh!
018	(The rifle's overheated?!)
019	Well, this is certainly another complicated twist of events...yet not entirely unexpected.
020	I hope I was not too late, little helgwn.
021	Morrigan!
022	(The entire alley is heating up...)
023	(Whoever she is, her aura is extremely oppressive.)
024	I had not wished to behold your face in such a manner...
025	The others would feel the same, I would assume.
026	I've been running into a lot of old familiar faces lately, haven't I?
027	I'm really starting to wonder if 'Roxanne' was a totally different person before she woke up.
028	You wouldn't know. You are not her.
029	...What?
030	What do you mean by that?
031	Poor creature, to be so burdened by the life and memory of another.
032	Putting you out of your misery would be a mercy.
033	If you think words are going to scare me into relenting, you've got another thing coming.
034	Roxanne fires a signal flare skyward, out of the narrow alleyways.
035	No way out.
036	Those strange demonic things... I've never seen them before.
037	They came prepared, I see.
038	My scry spoke true...
039	...But not all of the players have assembled.
040	This fate cannot come to pass.
041	Little helgwn, you have done well to break out of your cage.
042	Your story does not end here.
043	Run, little helgwn. Run.
044	There is more for you to do.
045	Look deep within yourself, and the answer you shall find.
046	...
047	As for you...
048	Ill-starred pawn of fate.
049	To ash shall you return.
050	Not today, witch.
