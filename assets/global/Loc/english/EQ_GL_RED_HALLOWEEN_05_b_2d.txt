001	...Sorry... I shouldn't have come.
002	Come, sit.
003	It's good that you feel sorry for the mistakes.
004	But, you don't have to feel too bad about it.
005	Everyone makes mistakes. It's part and parcel of life.
006	Some mistakes may have big consequences. But what has happened, happened.
007	Don't beat yourself up over it. Take this mistake as a learning point instead.
008	Stay calm, don't panic.
009	Then maybe you'll be able to stop the mistake from happening.
010	Noted...
011	Have you...made a big mistake before?
012	Hahaha...
013	I did...and I'm still in the middle of correcting it.
014	...
015	Thank you...
016	I'm glad I asked you to come with me...
017	No problem.
018	Here, have these sweets.
019	They are a little squashed...and the cherry sauce is leaking...
020	But it should be alright for your cats, right?
021	Thank you... Want to go feed them with me?
022	Delighted to, miss.
023	Red... Call me Red.
024	Alright. Let's go, Red.
025	Yes!
026	(As the two went back through the dark alleyway...)
027	(...a rumor started about a death doctor and his nurse carrying off their victims in bodybags, leaking with blood...)
028	(Back at the mansion)
029	Tsk tsk, look at this mess...
030	Hmm? What's that box?
031	Kukuku... I will keep this little treat for our Queen next year.
