001	Whew, all done!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
002	...I still have no clue why you wanted to collect a bunch of sea creatures all of the sudden.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
003	Well, did you notice how little corruption there is in this area?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
004	Fair enough, we haven't seen a single Fallen since coming here.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
005	It was similar in the Luxuria Belt, but that was just 'cause there weren't any people around, but that's not exactly the case here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
006	This place is all totally thriving and prospering, right?
007	So I figured it must be something about this ocean.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
008	Now let's take a look at the results...
009	Bingo! I had a feeling it'd be something like this. The deeper down the creature lives, the worse the corruption is.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
010	So what does that mean?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
011	It means that the source of the corruption in the Invidia Belt is...
075	A large source of sinful magil at the bottom of the ocean.
012	Back in my village, we believed that running water can banish evil... I can't help but be reminded of that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
013	According to my people, life is born on the surface of the water, while sin is swept by its currents and accumulates at the bottom of it.
014	That must be where our Leviathan is! The shrine must be at the bottom of the ocean!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
015	...How are we supposed to get there? Though I suppose we might not have to go... We did say we wouldn't kill the Cursed Beast this time.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
016	Hm, about that... Well, I guess diving would be impossible anyway. The airship's hull wasn't built to withstand that kind of water pressure.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
017	Not to mention it'd be hard to exit the ship and fight it, even if we did get there. Compared to the others, Leviathan will be a real tough nut to crack.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
018	We'll have to keep all that stuff in mind.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
019	You guys look like you're having fun.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
020	Oh, Nimul. Sorry 'bout dumping this on you, but I'd like to hear your opinion too.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
021	Anytime, but first I have a favor to ask as well.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
022	A request?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
023	Yes, I want you to think of a way to disable to magitek the Ira Belt knights were using.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
024	Hm...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0030
025	Hey there, little lady. You're looking awfully worried over there. What's up?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
026	Eek—!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0027
027	Hey now, what kinda response is that? You're going to hurt my feelings here.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0011
028	Oh, my apologies... I was simply lost in thought.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0035
029	You really lack confidence this bad, huh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
030	...H-huh? How did you come to that conclusion—	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
031	Anybody could tell. You've got a face on that's all 'I don't know why people are depending on me, so I'm feel very lost and worried about it".	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
032	...
033	Ah, I'm not trying to insult you or anything, it's just that, you know—	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0035
034	It kinda looks like you're driving yourself into a corner here, that's all.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
035	That's, well, perhaps...
036	It's simply that I don't understand. I don't think I could become someone like you...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0030
037	Oh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
038	I think your resolve is incredible. You are prepared to bid farewell to the place you were born and raised, all for the sake of justice.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
039	I think that is truly what a knight should be like, but...I don't think that I...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
040	Wait, hold up. I think we're dealing with a misunderstanding here.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
041	Huh?
042	All that stuff is just my own resolve! Knights, beliefs, justice, none of that's got anything to do with it!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
043	E-excuse me?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
044	All that stuff was just me choosing my own answers! There's no need for you to imitate me.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
045	You should do things your own way. The right answer isn't going to fall down from the sky if you just wait for it.
046	You've gotta pick your own ideals, accept yourself, and figure out the right answer yourself.
047	An answer that you can be proud of. One that you can fight for without regrets.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
048	I should...find my own answer...?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
049	Yup. I'll admit that's a pretty arrogant way to think about things, but that's just another form of a knight's honor.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
050	It's fine if you act a little more selfishly. If you want something, say it. If you want to scream, that's fine too.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
051	You can run away if you're scared and it's fine to fall to your knees if you're in despair.
052	But if you're scared, if you're suffering, and you don't want to give up? It's fine not to give up too.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
053	When things get hairy, you should ask the people around you for help too. Especially me, I'm kind of super free all the time, so just give me a call and I'll come running.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0008
054	That's... I...
055	Some food for thought, right?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
056	Yes, thank you. I will... I will take some time to think about what I want to do.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0033
057	Then I can rest easy. Oh, by the way, you don't have to tell anyone when you reach a conclusion if you don't want to.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
058	Since secret vows are pretty cool too, you know.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
059	Haha.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0007
060	His words calmed me down a little bit.
061	At that time, I could've chosen to run away...
062	But my answer... The thing I want to protect...
063	If I can find my answer, I think I might just have a way to still these trembling hands of mine...
064	...
065	Deliver your report...	VO_arius.arius_sys_0001
066	Y-yes, sir! Thanks to the serpent's assistance, all ships are cleared to leave port!
067	They did not notice our vanguard approach. We believe that our ambush will go swimmingly as well—
068	No—	VO_arius.arius_sys_0014
069	...Wh-what?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
070	No. No no no no no!! Forget about that!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0015
071	The enemy will notice! They will bare their fangs!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
072	Deploy all troops! We will trample their lands!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0001
073	Y-yes, sir! I'll tell all troops to set sail! We'll launch our attack at once—!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
074	Aaahh.... Andechs....! I will... I wiiiiiiill....!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0018
