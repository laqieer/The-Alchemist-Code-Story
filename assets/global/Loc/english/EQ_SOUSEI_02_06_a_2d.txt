001	A few days later...
002	...
003	Emmel! What're you doing over there? Penny for your thoughts?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
004	Oh, Mira...
005	Lately Nimul hasn't been coming down, not even to eat lunch.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
006	What? Is he holed up in the library again?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
007	Yes, I believe so.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
008	Whew! I'm impressed by his dedication. I know I couldn't do it! Why even come to a different region if all you're gonna do is study?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
009	Yes, it worries me greatly. He's become far too focused on this.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
010	Nimul...
011	...
012	This is the last of the books about magic in this building. I just...I'm a little concerned.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
013	About what?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
014	You've been in here every day, up to your nose in books.
015	I thought you were planning to persuade that witch to help us?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
016	I am. This is how I am preparing for it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
017	I really don't see how this is supposed to help.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
018	Waginau, these books...they carry the jewels of wisdom uncovered by the wise people of the past.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
019	Kernels of knowledge that have already been mined, polished, and presented for the benefit of all.
020	I have been consulting the greater minds of the past through these books in order to ready myself.
021	I see. I hope that they are of some help.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
022	Indeed.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
023	Look, I have to go into town to pick up some items for Adaleigh and the others. Make sure you eat something, all right?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
024	Right. I will.
025	So this is meant be the mockery of this town...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
026	I did notice several oddities while we were being shown around.
027	People so preoccupied with love and matchmaking, the lack of technological development disproportionate to a town of this size...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
028	This region should be more like ours, consumed by the corruption of the Cursed Beast, and yet...
029	I haven't seen a single Fallen since coming here.
030	How's it going, old dog?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
031	Fine. I was a little taken aback by the idea of a furnace powered by magic at first, but I've gotten used to it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
032	Have you prepared the blueprints for the parts you need?
033	Yep! From A-15 to C-7, right here... With these, we should be good.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
034	That said, I dunno if they can be made with something like a blacksmith's hammer. They're pretty high-level parts with very precise measurements.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
035	I'm not pleased with this, either. These are the only tools we managed to find, and it is rather disheartening. Still, we must at least try.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
036	Yeah. Guess it is what it is. This is gonna take a while.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
037	Hey, you two mind if I watch?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
038	Nyx?
039	I suppose not, but...why?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
040	Well, um...
041	What're you hiding? Did your teacher send you here to spy on us?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
042	Ambrosia? Hah! You don't have the right read on her at all. If she wanted to know what you were up to, she'd be the one here, getting into all of your business.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
043	Seriously? She sure is something...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
044	I just, uh...well...it's been a while since there was someone around to talk to besides Ambrosia.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
045	I dunno. I just kinda thought it'd be nice to hang out or something.
046	Oh, right. You guys don't get out much, do you?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
047	Something like that... So, is it cool? You just keep doing your thing, and maybe we can chat a little while you work?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
048	Sure! As long as you're okay with the fact that I'll probably get distracted mid-conversation a lot.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0037
049	Thanks!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0033
050	Haha! You're really excited about this, huh?
051	...
052	I wanted to talk to Yna about Nimul, but...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
053	He seems busy. Perhaps I shouldn't bother him...
054	Oh...what am I doing?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
055	Never mind. I'll just...take a nice walk and head back to Ambrosia's.
056	Oh! It's you!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0009
057	Excuse me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
058	It's me! Do you not remember me?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0001
059	O-oh...of course. We met the other day in town...
060	Just so! It was right over— Oh... Are you all right?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
061	I'm sorry?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
062	Forgive me for being so forward, but you look a little down. Is something the matter?
063	Oh! No, it's nothing.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
064	I-I see. Well, if you ever need someone to talk to...I would offer my services, but perhaps you feel that I cannot be relied upon.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
065	No, I...I simply feel a little uncomfortable, since we are essentially strangers, and...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
066	Then let us become friends!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0007
067	I spoke with some of the workers, and they suggested that I might have been a little overeager the last time we met. They proposed that I begin by offering friendship instead.
068	So, if it is all right with you, please allow me to be your friend!
069	I-I'm very sorry, but I cannot accept your offer!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
070	But why?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
071	Not that I have to explain myself, but I cannot afford to spare my attention to such things at present.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
072	Spare your attention? What does that have to do with anything? It is every living being's basic instinct to pursue that which will allow them to procreate!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
073	Wh-what?! People are not bound only by their instincts!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
074	Love is nothing so crude as that! It's gentle, yet bittersweet...at times a little embarrassing. It is the most beautiful, complex thing in the world!
075	People...?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
076	Oh, I see. I see... I forgot myself, having met you for the first time. You must be a witch.
077	Wh-what?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
078	Well, I suppose there's nothing for it. I apologize for my impertinence.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0036
079	Witches may not know love, correct? Witches who love can no longer exist as people.
080	Wait, what? What are you talking about?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
081	Nngh! This is...!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
082	Eeek?! Wh-what was that?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0025
083	Please, head back to safety! The protection of this town is the last duty that remains to me!
084	Wh-what are you saying?
085	Wh-what's...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
086	Whoa! What's with this shaking?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
087	Adaleigh! Look to the north!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
088	North? Which way? What—?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
089	...	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0003
090	It's...Asmodeus! Come to attack the town?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
091	No. It is here to look for humans.
092	You know something that you're not telling us.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
093	There's no time to explain. The two of you need to get back to Ambrosia's place as soon as possible. You mind if we use Space-Time Manipulation? It'd be faster than—	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
094	What are you saying?! If the Cursed Beast is here looking for humans, then the townspeople are in danger!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0013
095	We have to try and do something to repel the attack!
096	Our attacks may not be effective, but perhaps we can at least drive the Cursed Beast off. Let's go, Adaleigh!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
097	No, see, that's going to end up causing more problems than it solves. Come on, listen to me!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
098	Mira, can you hear me? Adaleigh and Yna have jumped into battle! Come help me stop them!'	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
099	Come help me stop them!'
100	Aw, man! What?! Come on, Nyx, what was the point of even sending you over there, then?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
101	Hey, you didn't expect the Cursed Beast to pop up over here either!'	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
102	Well, wouldn't this be the perfect opportunity to show us what you're really made of, Nyx?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
103	Anyway, guess there's nothing for it! I'll be right over. Hold down the fort!
104	Got it.'	VO_nix.nix_sys_0038
105	All right, so first of all...
106	I feared as much...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
107	Whoa! Mister Nimul! What're you trying to do, give me a heart attack?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
108	I apologize. However, this is an emergency, is it not?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
109	Yeah, kinda? Well...seems like you already know what's up, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
110	It's too early for us to face the Cursed Beast. We are not done with our preparations.
111	That is why the people in town, my friends...we need to bring them back as quickly as possible, correct?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
112	Yes! Are you gonna help us?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
113	While we're doing that, Ambrosia can work on finishing her part of the preparations.
114	Understood. I will follow your lead.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0037
115	Thanks, Mister! First, let's go get Emmel and the white-haired dude!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0033
116	White-haired...? Do you mean Waginau? His hair is actually silver, I believe.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
117	What?! He looks like some kind of wise man. I thought he'd just gone prematurely white!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
118	Aaaaahhh! Th-the ice beasts have invaded our town!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0028
119	N-no! Oh, no! It's so cold! So c-c-cold!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0026
120	Something strange is going on here. The townspeople are afraid of the Cursed Beast's ice beasts, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
121	They're not even paying attention to the actual Cursed Beast. I noticed that as well. How could they miss it? Is that even possible?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
122	Oh, hey. New sword?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
123	Trying to deal with the ice with a regular sword has been quite frustrating. Well, perhaps it wouldn't be so for a true swordsman.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
124	Unfortunately, I am but a humble blacksmith...but that means that I am able to constantly upgrade my weapons and armor.
125	I see I am not the only one trying something new.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
126	Yeah, well, my Engineer Soldiers are still back with the ship.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
127	All I have is what I always carry with me, but...it's fine! It's all in how you use it!
128	Seriously? You're just not going to listen to me?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
129	Of course we are! Once we've taken care of this problem, we'll hear you out. Priorities, you know?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
130	Okay... I guess I should have seen that coming.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
131	We've got company!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
