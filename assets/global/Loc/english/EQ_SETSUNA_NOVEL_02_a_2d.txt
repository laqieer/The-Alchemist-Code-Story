001	I told you. The sword is a part of your arm. Feel the tip of the blade with your senses, grip tightly, and swing.
002	G-got it! Huzzah!
003	Hm, your form is getting pretty good. Now try striking at me.
004	A-are you sure?
005	Hm?
006	Wouldn't it be kinda dangerous if I swung at you?
007	Hahah. You're a kind child, Jayme. But it's all right. You won't be able to hit me yet.
008	Yeah, you're right. You're Setsuna the Awesome, after all!
009	It's not a question of me being awesome. It's just that you're still at the beginning of your training. You have much to learn.
010	You're sort of an apprentice, like Macherie.
011	Like Sis? All right!
012	Now, come at me!
013	Here I go! Huzzah!
014	(Jayme's strikes are refreshingly straightforward.)
015	(Unlike how I was back then, they're beautiful and direct.)
016	That day, I lost everything.
017	I ran and kept on running. Surviving all on my own.
018	That day, I swore my vengeance.
019	Yet I would need more strength to take it.
020	I recklessly swung my blade.
021	Those who knew no better would have seen it as a very honest, straightforward sort of sword.
022	But a sword swung for vengeance, no matter how straightforward, will never bring about a good end.
023	Those who lose people whom they love can become twisted and lost.
024	I ran. I refused to connect with anyone new. I hid away from the reality that surrounded me.
025	Ngh!
026	Setsuna...? Are you all right?
027	Hm? Oh...sorry. I was lost in thought.
028	I'm fine. Next, we'll...hmm, I'll strike back. Defend yourself.
029	O-okay!
030	Huzzah!
031	Whoa!
032	(Why am I thinking of the past?)
033	(What do I hope to gain from this? There should be nothing more for me to—)
034	Huzzah!
035	Ngh!
036	(What am I doing? I know all too well that distracting thoughts will only interfere with my bladework. What's wrong with me?)
037	Whoa!
038	S-sorry, Jayme. Are you all right? I guess this is still a little too much for you.
039	I'm okay! I need to get stronger for my sister!
040	Right...
041	(That's right. That's why he can be so strong.)
042	(He wields his sword to protect.)
043	(Why do I wield my blade?)
044	Are you okay? Thinking about something?
045	I was just admiring your natural talent.
046	Really?!
047	Yes. Really.
048	(Something to protect...)
049	Setsuna, what's next?
050	Hmm... I think this is enough strike practice for—
051	Everybody, run! Monsters in the village!
052	Monsters?!
053	S-Setsuna...!
054	You'll be safe here. You know what? This is actually a good opportunity. Watch close and learn.
055	You're making this part of my training? B-but...
056	Promise me one thing. Keep away from me during the fight. I don't want you to get hurt.
057	What? Wait! Setsuna?!
058	Got it? Just watch.
059	(It's not like my fighting style is anything special, but...)
060	(To know the terror of combat, and learn when to retreat...to realize that it takes courage to do so...)
061	Sssssss!
062	Hmph. So you won't run away.
063	I'll show you how foolish not being able to judge your opponent's strength can be.
064	Taste of my blade!
