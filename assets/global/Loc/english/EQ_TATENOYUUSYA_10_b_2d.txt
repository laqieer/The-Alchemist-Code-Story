001	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0001
002	Everyone, get behind me!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
003	Ngh! It's a lot stronger than earlier!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0019
004	Are you okay, Naofumi?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
005	Yeah, I'm fine...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
006	Its defense capabilities are through the roof. Everyone's attacks are barely leaving a scratch.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
007	Is it just me, or did its stats go way up since the last time we fought it? We're not going to get anywhere like this.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
008	The only way we'll win is if we kill it in one go with the Iron Maiden.
009	But Lord Naofumi... It takes a while to cast, making it easy to interrupt.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0003
010	I'm not sure if I'll be able to protect you from so many enemies for that long...
011	What are we going to do, then?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
012	We'll take care of the rest of the monsters for you.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
013	Forget about the small fries—just focus on releasing that powerful attack of yours.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
014	No need to worry about us.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
015	Thank you, everyone!
016	...
017	(I didn't think it'd feel so reassuring to fight alongside so many other people besides Raphtalia and my usual crew...)	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0007
018	(If I could team up with the other Heroes like this, we'd be...)
019	Got something on your mind, Naofumi?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
020	Not really... I'll let you guys take care of the monsters, then.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
021	All right... Come forth, Shield of Rage!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0001
022	Ugh...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0022
023	Naofumi...
024	Lord Naofumi!
025	Huzzzzaaaahhhhh!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0025
026	Oh no!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
027	Zweite Aqua Shot!	VO_melty.melty_battle_0004
028	...?!
029	Melty?! What on earth are you doing?! Step down!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0025
030	No, I won't.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0039
031	I'm the only one who can move right now... So I'll buy Naofumi some time. I refuse to be an inconvenience to him!	VO_melty.melty_battle_0004
032	Hey, you! Come over this way!
033	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0003
034	Shield Prison!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0007
035	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0002
036	Change Shield!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0004
037	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0001
038	Within this virgin of cold ore, who shall swallow even your screams with her embrace, suffer in anguish as your entire body is stabbed and skewered! I cast the Iron Maiden!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0041
039	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0028
040	The rift is closing... Thank goodness! The Wave's finally been suppressed.
041	So we did it, then. Geez, what an ordeal that was.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
042	Sigh...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
043	Lord Naofumi!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0001
044	Are you all right, Naofumi?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
045	I'm okay, as you can obviously tell. More importantly...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
046	You put yourself in so much danger, Melty! You could've gotten seriously injured!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0003
047	I-I'm sorry for making you worry.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0035
048	I was just thinking of what I could do to help out... And then I jumped forward before I knew it.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
049	My goodness...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0030
050	Well, you're definitely not the most adept soldier out there... But what I saw from you out there wasn't bad, not at all.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
051	I could only do so because I had faith that Naofumi would protect me!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0007
052	You've really gained the trust of your companions.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0007
053	...Guess you could say that.
054	Whoa! What's this?	VO_filo.filo_sys_0009
055	Does this mean we can return back to our world?	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0003
069	Looks like it. I guess our time here's up. Thanks for your help.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0006
056	We should be the ones thanking you. You helped us protect our world. Thank you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
057	I'm sure you have a tough journey ahead, but do your best for those who believe in you.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0007
058	I'll try...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
059	Thank you again for all of your help, Ryle, Lamia...and Anastasia.
060	Melty... Don't push yourself too hard. A princess shouldn't be too reckless.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
061	Well... I must apologize to you in advance, then. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to keep that promise, but I will certainly do my best to do so.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0035
062	Oh, dear... If I was the knight assigned to protect you, I don't think having even nine cat lives would suffice...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0030
063	But even so... I wholeheartedly believe that there are things that only you'll be able to accomplish. I know you'll become a wonderful queen one day.
064	Thank you very much!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0033
065	So please continue to do your best... And no matter how many hardships you face, please continue to push forward and live on.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
066	I'll try my hardest... I may not be able to do much, but I'll definitely do everything in my power to help my kingdom.
067	While there may not be anything that I can contribute right away... I'll never turn away from the obstacles ahead of me. I'm sure of that.
068	As long as I don't give up, I know I'll be able to show myself and others just what it is that only I'm capable of accomplishing.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0004
