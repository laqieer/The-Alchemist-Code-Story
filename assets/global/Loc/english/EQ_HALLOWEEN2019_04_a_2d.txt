001	Y-you...! But why?!
002	Were you not outraged earlier at the prospect of red-and-black jack-o'-lanterns?! This makes no sense...
003	What's that? You want me to translate for you again? Sure. Leave it to me!
004	Numumu.
005	Let's just say that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
006	By no means do we condone the changing of jack-o'-lanterns from orange to red. Such savagery is not to be tolerated.
007	However, we are of the opinion that in this instance we cannot protect the essence of Halloween without smashing a few pumpkins. Squeak, squeak!
008	Numu!
009	It said all of that with just a few squeaks?
010	Heeheehee... Now, come! On this day the gates of Hades will open for us, so that we might paint this world in the most beautiful of hues!
011	Hold it!
012	So this is where you were! You've gotta come with me, quickly! A fight's broken out in town!
013	W-well...
014	Hmph. We have no choice. Leave these imps to me. The two of you had better hurry back to town.
015	Understood. Thank you, Mei Fang. Melda, let's go!
016	Right!
017	Right...
018	Goodness...
019	(The children are falling to delinquency while those of age forget all restraint...)
020	(How could the peaceful celebration of Halloween I had envisioned take a turn so quickly?)
021	After all, Halloween is full of surprises.
022	Is this what he meant? Is this how Halloween is doomed to be?
023	(No... I'm getting ahead of myself. We are still in the middle of our preparations.)
024	(If I can regain order now, perhaps it won't be too late for the solemn standards of this occasion to be restored!)
025	I brought 'em!
026	Oi, you lot! Cut it out, will you? What're you fighting about, anyway?
027	He keeps talking about dressing up as a werewolf, but that was my idea! I said it first!
028	So what? What's wrong with both of us being werewolves, huh?
029	Exactly! This is the silliest fight I've ever seen.
030	Hey, there's no garbage can around here. What am I supposed to do with this?
031	Just throw it on the ground somewhere. Those girls on patrol will take care of later.
032	Yeah, you're right.
033	H-hold on just a moment, ladies!
034	Huh? Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?!
035	Tch!
036	Cheryl, after him! He's a pickpocket!
037	No...
038	Cheryl?
039	You... All of you... You're all so...!
040	Crime must be punished...and those who would be so insolent as to disrupt the austerity of this occasion, despite the fact that they are of an age where they ought to know better, will be punished by my hand!
