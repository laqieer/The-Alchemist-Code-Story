001	Haa...haa... It really does...take a toll on you...after a while. Haa...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0029
002	Those things are merely shards of the stone's power. Thanks to you, I was able to defeat them relatively easily. I appreciate it.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0022
003	That was...easy? What kind of battles have you fought until now?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0031
004	I am a Captain of the Holy Guard, after all... Or, I was, I suppose.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_chara_1008
005	What kind of person is the one you want to save?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
006	She's someone who shines bright, like the sun.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0005
007	Pardon me—eep! Ahh!
008	A-are you okay?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0003
009	Ahahah. I tripped. Sorry, that's not the best first impression, is it?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0011
010	Who are you?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0001
011	I'm the 11th Lord Commander, Kanon. Nice to meet you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
012	The 11th?! Then, Lord Zain...	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0025
013	He...entrusted me with the future.
014	I see...
015	I heard about you from Lord Zain, Lakina; Captain of the 7th Regiment.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
016	...
017	What's the matter?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
018	It's just... I spent a long time with Lord Zain, so...it just doesn't feel real yet. That he...	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0001
019	You can talk to me frankly. We're about the same age, you know?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
020	Thank you. I don't really know how to feel about learning someone so close to me has died.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0034
021	The fact that I can only hear of it from another and never see the truth of it for myself...sort of makes it hard to take as reality.
022	I've become hardened in this place.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0018
023	I guess...I'm a bit sad.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0021
024	Sad... Yes. It is...sad.
025	When he died, I realized that I needed to step up and work hard. I did my very best, but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
026	Lord Zain...
027	Yeah...
028	Lord Zain...
029	I'm...sorry.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
030	I'm sad for you, too, Lakina.
031	Huh?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0025
032	Well, because...I can't even imagine being locked up in a place like this for so long.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
033	Even if someone dies, you wouldn't know to mourn them. When I think about that, I just...
034	You're such a kind person, Kanon. I have already come to the conclusion that this is my fate.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
035	You're crying? For me?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0011
036	Of course I am! You have to shoulder this burden all alone, and I can't do anything to help.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
037	But you have your responsibilities as the Lord Commander, and as the embodiment of justice in this world.
038	I have comrades to help me with that, but you... You're alone.
039	Hm, okay! I've decided! I'm going to try and figure out a way to get you out of here!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0038
040	Hahaha. Thank you, Kanon. I appreciate the thought.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0033
041	Just you wait. I'll figure out something.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
042	I'm not going to let you be alone anymore!
043	Thank you.
044	I have to go for today, but next time, I'll come when I can take my time.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
045	Even if it's just another mission for a Lord Commander... I feel honored. Thank you.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
046	Hey! It's not a mission or anything!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0022
047	I'm telling you, I'll come back as your friend. I won't let you be alone again!
048	Huh?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0025
049	I promise I'll be back soon.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
050	There's a tea I'm really into lately. I'll bring some next time I come, so let's drink it together! Okay, bye!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
051	...
052	Ahahah.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0008
053	What a strange girl; a girl who shines like the sun and can enchant anyone with her spontaneity.
054	Won't leave me alone, huh?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0031
055	It would be great if we really could meet again soon.
056	I pray that our paths will cross again.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
