001	Campanella!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
002	All right, then! It's tea party time!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
003	So, here we are. We meet again.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
004	We really shouldn't, though.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0015
005	Hmph! This is such a pain.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
006	Even so, you do look rather happy about it.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
007	I hate being indebted to people. It's not in my nature to stay that way.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
008	Indeed.
009	So, we need to make sure neither Mira nor Nyx catches sight of us, right?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
010	Have you ever thought that it'd be nice if one day, when you woke up...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
011	Your entire room had been made clean and tidy, and all your backlogged work had been taken care of?
012	All the time. If wishes were fishes...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
013	Well, let's do something like that for them! Let's make some magic happen!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
014	I guess I can do that. I'm actually really good at working behind the scenes.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
015	Then let's get to it!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
016	For the sake of this world...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
