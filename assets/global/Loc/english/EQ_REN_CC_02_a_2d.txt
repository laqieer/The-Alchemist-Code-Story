001	I killed again today.
002	Killed and killed.
003	And killed and killed and killed.
004	I killed again today.
005	Everyone is on the march towards death. Eventually we give out, and return to the earth.
006	I only give those who are moving towards death a little push.
007	Neither us humans nor the demons are just. There is no such thing as the divine in this world.
008	There is only the code.
009	When the threat of demons recedes, humans themselves bring corruption to the land with their evil.
010	This causes more demons to appear, and they once again become the danger that Wadatsumi must face.
011	It is like a never-ending game of cat and mouse.
012	The Black Star clan's duty is killing demons, but when they are few we are reviled.
013	We slay demons. Exterminate evil.
014	Pain, regret, and grief... Delivered by my own hand every time I killed someone.
015	But if we stopped cutting down evil, we would invite the possibility of demon rule over humankind.
016	The first time, I was scared of the blood. The second time, I managed to stop shaking. The third is when I stopped counting. And when I stopped believing in good.
017	Good and evil doesn't matter. All of it cowers in the face of our code.
018	There is much that is out of our control, that is beyond understanding. Our code. The fleeting nature of life. We drown in it.
019	But protecting the code my family has nurtured for generations with the life I have left is right.
020	But more than anything...
021	A hand, small and only just born, squeezes mine.
022	Fragile, but precious.
023	I remember feeling like I would do anything to protect that little hand.
024	No matter how illogical our code might be, I accepted it so I could protect the world that my little brother lives in.
025	But not only that. If I can, I want to be the last to carry this burden.
026	That is my dream. No matter how unlikely or short-lived it may be...
027	Like bubbles on water...
028	Aaahh! Wh-why are you doing this?
029	Don't play dumb. We know you have connections with Greed Dike and you're planning something...untoward.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
030	Th-that's not—!
031	I hate people like you. It's because of you that Wadatsumi is corrupted.
032	Your actions steer Wadatsumi away from true peace. I find that infuriating.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0029
033	The people of Wadatsumi pray desperately for peace. Do not act like you are not aware.
034	Urgh!
035	And yet you continue to perpetuate evil. I cannot allow that to happen. After all...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
036	I am a Black Star.
037	You really are fast, Natsume.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
038	Now's not the time to chat. There's still more left.
039	I know that!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
040	All right, let's have a contest and see who can kill more! I'm definitely gonna win!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
041	That's enough, don't you think? Why don't you show yourself.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
042	Hmph. You've caught me.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
043	Who are you?
044	Nobody worth knowing, I assure you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
045	The fact that you're here means that you see no problem making deals with Greed Dike. Do I have that right?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
046	And what if you do?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
047	Then you will be exterminated. As the code demands.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
048	I'd like to request you go easy on me.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
049	Oh, really? Well then, if I make it past three years, I'll let you go!
