001	Welcome back! Food should be ready in about--
002	…You.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0003
003	…
004	You must be Kaede's...brother, right?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
005	…I am.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
006	…Well, come on in!
007	I came here to make sure of something…Are you a man capable of taking care of Kaede? Can you be trusted?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
008	…Ah. I see. Just hang tight for a minute--food's almost done.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
009	…! I didn't come here to eat!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
010	Try my cooking first and then let's talk.	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0002
011	I tried it once already! I don't need anymore…!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
012	That was barely an appetizer. I've got plenty more where that came from.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
013	…Here, it's ready!
014	I'm telling you--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
015	"The earth is great. The earth is good. Let us thank her for our food."
016	…?
017	We say a prayer before we eat to show gratitude to our food. Demons could stand to do the same. I taught it to Kaede, too.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
018	That's rich coming from a human--your kind flagrantly disregards life.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0002
019	Back in the day, when I first started cooking, I hunted… I set up some bait and was waiting until my prey went for it--
020	Don't try to change the subject.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0002
021	Just hear me out… So, while the beast was distracted by the bait, I made my approach.
022	That's when the it looked right at me. I thought I was done for.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
023	But, instead, it went back to eating… As long as it could fill its stomach, it didn't need to bother me.
024	…What're you getting at?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0030
025	I hunted that beast. I killed it so that I could eat.
026	…
027	That's why I'm alive now--because I took that beast's life…Don't you see?
028	No, I don't! Just make your point already!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
029	We've got to be grateful… To the lives that are connected to ours… And in my case--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
030	That includes you.
031	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
032	If it weren't for you, I might never have met Kaede. Thanks to her--
033	I finally feel like Wadatsumi has a shot at peace.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
034	…
035	So…eat up! That way you'll know I'm the type of person that values life.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
036	…I talk a big game, but I just want Kaede's big brother to understand where I'm coming from.
037	…
038	So? Care to try some?
039	…Sure.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
040	Whatcha think?
041	…
042	…I think…I understand you a bit more.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0007
043	I was wrong about your kind…This meal proves you do value life. That much is clear.
044	…But that doesn't mean I can forgive humans!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
045	Easy there! Whoa!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
046	Now, it's time you understand me.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
047	Gettin' pretty rowdy there!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
048	Don't waste you breath!!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0007
