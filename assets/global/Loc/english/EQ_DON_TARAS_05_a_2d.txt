001	Hey. You look like you've seen a ghost.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
002	Eep! Y-you're—! B-but you—?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
003	You know ghosts don't have legs, right?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
004	B-but you fell off the clock tower! You're supposed to be dead!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
005	So you'd rather I was dead, huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
006	N-no! Of course not!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0047
007	Thought I'd come myself to collect some overdue fees. You got your protection fee?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
008	O-of course I have it ready! I, uh, I just...wasn't sure when I should pay, and, uh, what the schedule was...and such.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
009	I got no use for excuses. Just hurry up and hand it over.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
010	Eep! H-here you go! I'm sorry!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
011	Whatever. It's fine.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
012	P-please excuse me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
013	This place has gone to the dogs. No one's here.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
014	Heh. Guess I spoke too soon.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
015	......
016	Woah, you're a real mess. That dress, too.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0001
017	Does it suit me?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
018	It doesn't bother you that I'm alive?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
019	I'm not surprised, if that's what you mean.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
020	What?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
021	Well, you may have fallen from a great height, but there are a lot of things that could easily have broken your fall—such as one of your lackeys.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
022	Clever, ain't ya?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
023	I'm no fool.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
024	Well? If you're goin' to step down, young lady, then I'll gladly take over this city. It'll be Mafia Law, of course.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
025	You already know my answer, don't you?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
026	Just checkin'.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
027	I will not step down. I will protect that which is important to me.	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0030
