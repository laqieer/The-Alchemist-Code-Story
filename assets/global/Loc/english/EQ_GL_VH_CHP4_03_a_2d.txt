001	- Abandoned Ruins -
002	The yawning cavern seemed to swallow any semblance of sunlight fed into its maws.
003	Blair pulls out a small device, which begins to blink and buzz softly.
004	Hmm... Alchemia particle density appears normal and stable here. Nothing out of the ordinary.
005	Shall we press on?
006	This reminds me of when we first found Professor Minerva in the ruins.
007	One thing led to another, and all of a sudden thinking machines were involved.
008	Sure feels like an age ago.
009	Oh?
010	Yeah. Atropos was held in a vast underground facility just outside of a township near Greed Dike.
011	It was one of Professor Minerva's colleagues who tipped us off.
012	I don't think any of us knew we'd be going down a rabbit hole...
013	I think I can imagine. I remember Roxanne saying that place was just packed with Constructs.
014	You probably would've liked that, yeah.
015	A-Ahem.
016	Let's head down that path. See if we can get any better readings.
017	(Hmm... Nope. Can't feel a thing.)
018	Blair sets down her device and begins planting a few more in its vicinity.
019	Soren, I've never actually asked, but...
020	How does it feel to experience those visions you keep having?
021	It can't be pleasant if it's of something you don't remember, can it?
022	Hmm...
023	Yeah, guess you could say it was pretty disturbing...
024	Apart from what he did with the Constructs and Atropos and wanting a world free of bloodshed, I don't know much else about my past self.
025	And now we've got this "Lachesis". I don't even know what she has to do with all this.
026	I see...
027	Well, if you happen to get another vision here, my devices will be able to pick up fluctuations in Alchemia density per Professor Minerva's hypothesis.
028	From there, we can probably pinpoint a rough location of its source.
029	I don't know how you figure things out so quickly. It's amazing.
030	...It's nothing.
031	If only I turned up more about Lachesis. Emrys and I couldn't find anything we didn't already know about the Elylon Teg.
032	And if there are mentions of Lachesis, it was probably never by name.
033	Surely something so important should have warranted a study, but Emrys did say his clan was quite reclusive...
034	What bothers me is whether she was a Construct at all. She definitely didn't sound like one.
035	What if I'd made some other sentient entity using more than just machines? Is that even possible?
036	If she's also powered by Alchemia, then Goetia might go down the same route as Zheng Yi once did.
037	Orphans recruited under the banner of a twisted cause, made to sacrifice themselves in the name of a terrible ideal.
038	Shion's report did make mention of that, yes.
039	Given the relative age of the two assailants at Roxanne's manor, not to mention the leader Emrys ran into...
040	It's not a stretch to conclude they may have been orphans, or even indoctrinated from birth.
041	And if most of them suffer from poverty or sickness...it's even easier to keep them on a metaphorical leash.
042	What if they were just like Eira? That might explain the dread aura from that girl called Red.
043	This just gets worse and worse...
044	Suddenly, a low rumble rocks the cavern. The devices go haywire, frantically beeping and flashing.
045	I didn't detect any seismic movements before...
046	This frequency is definitely not coming from the earth itself.
047	Blair, look out!
048	*growl*
049	They must have been drawn by the sound!
