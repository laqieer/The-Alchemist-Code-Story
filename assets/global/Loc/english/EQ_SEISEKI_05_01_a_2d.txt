001	Wait! Please, wait! Why do the two of you have to fight?! This is wrong!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
002	This is not what I want either! Yauras, fall back... You're being deceived by Zain!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
003	See? No matter how many times you explain something to someone like this, he just won't listen.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
004	Kanon...it's fine, you just hurry up and go.
005	But...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
006	Besides...
007	Regarding the Mikaboshi, this is top secret information that must not get leaked.
008	I need to also interrogate him to find out who told him.
009	Yauras...don't tell me...from the way you're talking it sounds like you're in on Zain's plot. Are you?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
010	What are you talking about? We were supposed to be friends.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
011	You were always the one closest to Zain. Argh! I was an idiot! Well then...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
012	So you don't want me to hold back?
013	Captain Kudan!
014	Yes, that's the power I'm talking about. For your own sake as well, I won't let you pass here!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
015	Shut up! How dare you toy with Kagura. I'm going to stop your evil plot!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
016	No...!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
017	Ack! What trememendous power! When did you get so strong...?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
018	If you thought I'd remain a chickling forever...you were wrong!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
019	This is far from the limit of my power!
020	You look pathetic.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
021	...What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
022	That power of yours is the tragic results of the pursuit of easy power.
023	It's a weak symbol of your inability to restrain yourself. I'm not impressed.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0002
024	Argh...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
025	What...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
026	Aghh!!! Wh-what the...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
027	I allowed you to walk this road of compromise...this is my responsibility.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0035
028	Come here, Kudan. I am going to stop you here.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0013
029	Ack! How dare you underestimate me...I'll end you with this one attack!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
030	No! I must suppress the darkness within Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	Get out of the way!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
032	Huh? Ughh!!!
033	Kanon...?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
034	Looking away during the battle, huh? Well, that's quite the insult.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
035	Noo...!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
036	Take that! Blood Strike!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
037	Aghh...!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0019
038	That was uncalled for...
039	I told you, didn't I? I'll use whatever options are available to me in order to win.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
040	Hmph. In any case, don't get in my way.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
041	Ku...Kuda...an...
042	I didn't want to settle things like this, but I don't have time. I'm going to hurry on ahead.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
043	Lo-Lord Zain...hu-hurry...the Mikaboshi...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0028
044	Azure Grotto..a cave used for rituals, spread out deep inside the land of Wadatsumi...
045	Does the Mikaboshi lie asleep deep below...? Zain, I won't let you do as you please!
046	The Paladins have gathered at Wadatsumi...
047	Each heavy with their own thoughts and emotions, they begin to send them to the Mikaboshi sleeping in the Azure Cave.
048	They are unaware that this will be the start of a great tragedy.
049	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
050	THE ALCHEMIST CODE -Fallen Sun-
051	Wadatsumi Expedition - Departure Date<br>Holy Guard - Headquarters
052	I'm sleepy...too sleepy... Seriously. For starters, it's all Zain's fault...giving me the impossible deadline of 2-3 days to develop this ‘thing.'	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
053	If I die from fatigue...I wonder if I get my worker's compensation.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
054	Development... An invention for an upcoming expedition?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
055	Huh?
056	Agh?! Captain Kudan?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
057	What are you surprised about? Is it something that I shouldn't know about?
058	No, how do you put it, well...more importantly, what are you doing here? I thought the 4th Regiment was put on standby.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
059	While you lot have been moving about suspiciously, we of the 4th Division have received instructions from headquarters. We're just here to confirm our instructions.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
060	Oh, so that's what's going on. Well done.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
061	Tsk. The nerve of them... Where's the Master?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
062	Oh...apparently, he's having a meeting with some higher-up. I think they're around there...
063	Excuse me. I'm in a hurry.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
064	Hold on, Othima.
065	...What?
066	I don't know what you're plotting, but, once it's all finished, you better explain it properly.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
067	Whoa! Please don't glare at me with a menacing stare!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
068	Captain Kudan...you look scary enough already without that expression on your face! See ya!
069	Tsk...why?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
070	All of the Holy Guard has been summoned...
071	...yet we of the 4th Regiment alone have to remain in this place!
072	Lord Commander...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
073	What is the enforcement of justice? Is it nothing other than the exercising of power?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
074	Is that...Waginau?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
075	It can't be! Really? Here in the center of the Holy Order?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
076	Indeed. Of course, I understand.
077	Indeed. That's quite impressive. Continue to strive to and give it your all.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
078	Commander, what was that?
079	The members of the council from the Holy Order and His Most Reverend Bishop. In fact, they are higher ranked than us.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
080	That man who is connected with Greed Dike... What is he doing?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
