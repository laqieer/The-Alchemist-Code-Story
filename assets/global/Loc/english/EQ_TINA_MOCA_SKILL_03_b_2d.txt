001	Gyaaaaaaaah!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0020
002	We did it!
003	Mocca!
004	Wh-whoa! Tina!
005	You really are amazing, Mocca! I'm so proud to be your friend.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0008
006	Th-thank you, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0007
007	Hm? Mocca, you...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
008	Hm?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
009	I never noticed because of your big overcoat, but you're really skinny.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
010	Wh-what are you talking about? Sheesh!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
011	You're so pretty, too... What a waste.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
012	I'm not pretty! Sh-shut up. I...I'm not used to people saying stuff like that.
013	I don't think that's true, but... You know, it would be okay to show off a bit more.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
014	Like I said, I'm not used to showing so much skin. Ugh, this is embarrassing.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0043
015	I only took it off because I had to, to win. That's all.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
016	Really? Well, you'll get used to it with time, but... More importantly...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
017	I'm sorry about earlier. I guess the heat and the troubles of travelling got to me. I got irritated over something stupid.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
018	No, I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
019	Until we manage to cure your curse, I'll be there to support you.
020	So, until then, may I stay by your side?
021	If you would... I'd like for you to stay, too.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
022	Thank you, Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
023	I've been saved by you, once again. It seems that you're always saving me from something.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
024	That's not true.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
025	It is. This is inexcusable. I can't go on this way. I need to pay you back somehow.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
026	Whatever you want, just say it. I'll give you a portion of my food, or I'll cut down the amount of water I use... At least, I'll try...
027	This is so sudden... I don't know... Wait!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
028	Did you think of something? Don't hold back. Let me hear it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
029	Just one time...can you try saying something girly?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
030	What?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
031	I want to hear it! You're the one who said I could have anything I wanted, right?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
032	I mean, yeah, but...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
033	I'm sure my friend wouldn't break her promise to me...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0006
034	U-urghh...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
035	Well, Mocca?
036	I...er... Well, deary...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0043
037	You can do it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
038	Argh! I can't!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0028
039	Heh, heh. You're so cute.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0008
040	Stop teasing me.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
041	Who's teasing? I just thought it would be cute to see you all cutesy for once.
042	You...!
043	Mocca...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
044	Let's go, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
045	(I'm going to keep working to support you.)
046	(I know that if we're together, we can overcome anything, and I know we can find a cure for your curse.)	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
047	(Once we do, let's go home together to the land we protected together; to Saga.)
048	(It would be nice...if we could stay together then, too.)
049	Hey, wait up, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
050	(I want to stay with my precious friend, together forever!)	VO_tina.tina_sys_0008
