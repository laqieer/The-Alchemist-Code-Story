001	!!!
002	Come now, Celis Crowley. You shouldn't be surprised. Don't you think I know the identities of everyone in the Blade Fox Corps?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
003	Why, though? How? How do you know all this?	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
004	It just took the smallest bit of research. Information like that is hard to hide, after all.
005	I thought perhaps you may know something about the lost Kagutsuchi, if for no other reason than because of your royal lineage in the house of the Rising Ashes.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0003
006	......
007	What are you planning?
008	What would you do if I told you?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0006
009	If you intend to make an enemy out of Wadatsumi...I'll cut you down where you stand, without a second thought.
010	It's curiosity. Nothing more. I just want to know the whereabouts of the lost Kagutsuchi. That's all.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
011	I already told you I don't know.
012	How unfortunate. Though, I thought you might say that.
025	I was willing to keep you alive if you had any information for me.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
013	But since you don't, I guess you'll just have to die.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
014	Fragments of the Discarnate Power? How can a human control them?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
015	What you've seen heretofore were merely incomplete, experimental byproducts lent to us by the Discarnate Power.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
016	Field tests, if you will; samples to perfect the process. And perfect it, we did.
017	We've finally reached the phase where a demon host can understand and execute human commands.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
018	With the strength of a demon and a body that can't die, I'd say they make rather formidable weapons, wouldn't you?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
019	Weapons?!
020	Yes. And you should feel honored! You get to be a hand-picked test subject for them, to help calibrate them properly. It will be your final legacy.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
021	...!
022	So... Let the games begin!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
023	Uggrraaah!
