001	(I've finished tending to my blades.)	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0006
002	(That being said, my life depends on them. There's no such a thing as being too attentive.)
003	(Heh. My life, huh? It's not like I place any value in it of itself.)	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
004	(I've lived on my own until now, and I'll die on my own. That's how it's been and will always be.)
005	(However, as a mercenary, I cannot afford to lose my life before completing my mission.)
006	(No matter who I serve or what battlefield I stand on, I will leave behind the ultimate results. That is what it means to be a professional.)
007	Lucian bro! There you are!
008	...Who are you?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0002
009	My name is Retzius! As a mercenary and as a man, I am head over heels for you, bro!
010	... ...
011	Please! Make me your disciple! I'm begging you!
012	I refuse.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0040
013	Wh-why?! Of course, I still lack strength, but I'll do my best until my dying breath!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0026
014	You just said you lack strength, didn't you?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0001
015	A-as embarrassing as it is, I do!
016	I have neither the time nor do I feel obliged to look after another on the battlefield. More so, if you lack strength.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
017	B-but...I...!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0021
018	Enough. Go home.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0030
019	I won't! That is...I'm here on other business as well!
020	...What is it?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0005
021	I've received a message from headquarters! We've been ordered to attack immediately! By the way, we're in the same faction!
022	I'm gonna do my best to prove myself to you, bro!
023	... ...
024	(Honestly... I have no intention to look after a kid.)
025	Oh! I'll hold your luggage, bro!
