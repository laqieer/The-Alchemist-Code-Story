001	Suddenly, I was dreaming.
002	Everyone was laughing, sitting around the dinner table.
003	It's was just an ordinary day—one of many, from not so long ago.
004	It was a fun memory. A fond memory. But most of all...
005	...it was a sad memory...
006	...because I knew it was a dream.
007	I knew that at any moment, I was going to die.
008	Don't give up.
009	The resolve I entrusted you with has not yet been realized. I know it hurts, but I need you to stand up.
010	To save Wadatsumi.
011	...
012	......
013	...
014	That's right. I'm not finished yet. There's still more to do.
015	I can't let it end like this!
016	...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
017	Where am I?
018	Finally awake, are we?
019	Jubei! You're okay?!
020	Relatively speaking.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
021	What happened with Judius?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
022	He managed to scuttle off with his life. We'll have to settle things another time.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
023	Oh. But, that's okay! I'm just happy to see you. How's...Captain Ugachi? Is he...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
024	He's alive, at least. Though he hasn't come to yet. I did the best I could to treat his arm, but frankly, I doubt he'll ever swing a sword again.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0031
025	Oh. At least he made it back, though.
026	So, did you rescue us, then?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
027	Yeah. Sorry I didn't get to you any sooner, but it took longer than expected to get out of that rubble.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
028	Once I finally did, there was no one to be seen anywhere. I figured you might need some help, though, so I followed your trail.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
029	...
030	You're saying he just...left, without finishing me off?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
031	Sure did. I couldn't tell you why. He definitely had time. But thanks to that, you're here now, safe and sound.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
032	How peculiar...
033	Amane?
034	...
035	The Discarnate Power, Judius, and now Tamba... There's so much left for us to contend with, it's a bit overwhelming.
036	But because of me...Azami is...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
037	Amane...
038	I don't know what to do now. I don't know...how to go on.
039	I just don't understand why. Why must this life be so full of hardship? Why must fate be so cruel? What did we do to deserve this?
040	I only want to live in peace. How can something so simple and natural in concept be so difficult to achieve?!
041	...
042	Jubei?
043	Draw your weapon. And face me.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
044	What? Are we fighting?!
045	At times like this, it's best to file away your worries and move your body. That's when the way forward will present itself to you...most likely.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
046	Most likely?
047	Tell me this. Will your tearful pleas change your predicament? Will help come for you when you're hidden from view and face-down in the mud? We must each forge our own destinies.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0014
048	During my time in the Scarlet Flame Guard, it was often said that it takes a thousand swings to improve one's technique even the smallest degree. So, shall we work on ours together?
049	...
050	If you won't come to me, then I'll just have to come to you!
051	W-wait!
052	If you can argue, you can fight!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0015
