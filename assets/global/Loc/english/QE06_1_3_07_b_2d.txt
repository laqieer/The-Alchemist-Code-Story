001	Think about why the Discarnate Power would lead an army here.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
002	Why? To wipe us out, right?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
003	Right. How do you not yet see the answer? You simpleton.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
004	Words can hurt, you know?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
005	After crossing blades with us, it must have deduced that it would be more beneficial to eliminate us before taking the castle.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
006	That army is nothing more than a diversion. To ensure the elimination of us Captains, it must have decided—
007	To kill you one by one.
008	What?!
009	I knew you'd come.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
010	This was the simplest and quickest way to kill you all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
011	Not to mention the easiest.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
012	Oh, by the way...
013	I'll be taking that girl with me.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
014	Wha—?!
015	I agree with you that this is the simplest way to deal with things. I can't go all out with too many of my own soldiers around me.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
016	You always take it easy, though.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
017	Honestly, I really don't. Regardless...
041	Just as I thought. I had hoped I was seeing things for a second there.
018	The wound Tanosuke left is healed?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
019	How is that even possible?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
020	There was nothing about this in the archives. Could you demons have been doing research of your own...?
021	It matters not to those who are about to die.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
022	That looks more like...a gift, rather than something that was meticulously researched and perfected.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
023	What do you mean, Captain Tanosuke?!
042	It's easier than having to research it yourself, isn't it? Come to think of it, Greed Dike used to have something called Immortals.
024	?!
029	I knew something was up.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
030	We do what we must to achieve our goals.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
031	Hmph. So what if it regenerates. That just means we have to slice and dice it faster than it can regenerate.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
032	That is true... However...
033	If there really is somebody who would ally themselves with demons, this is no longer a simple matter between demons and humans.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
034	Somebody else's malice is intervening with Wadatsumi's affairs?
035	"Demons must be eradicated."
036	What?!
037	Amane?
038	I'm fine. Let's just focus on dealing with that thing.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
039	The rookie's right. Regardless of who is backing the demons, what we must do does not change.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
040	Discarnate Power, you die here today.
