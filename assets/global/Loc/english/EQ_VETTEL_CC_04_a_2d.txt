001	Hn... I can barely keep my eyes open...	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
002	Vettel, you look like the living dead. Don't you think it's time you got some rest?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
003	Got it, got it... After I finish up this last bit of work...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
004	After you finish all of THIS? Look at that pile of paperwork! That's not going to be done any time soon.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
005	Hold up! Vettel! You totally forgot to sign this paper! And this one, too! And this one!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
006	S-sorry...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
007	Good grief, you're barely capable of doing paperwork at your best. You really shouldn't be doing it while you're half-asleep.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
008	Yeah... I used to leave this kind of stuff up to Gerald, but... Well. It's my responsibility now.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
009	Ha. Well, he wasn't that great at it either. I used to help him with it all the time.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
010	Wait, what?! Really?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
011	He did it because he knew you had more important things to be doing.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0005
012	Things that only you, the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, are capable of doing.
013	Things only I can do?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
014	You're still not in bed? You know morning's gonna come soon, right? Don't you have to help with the restoration efforts again?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
015	Hm, yeah, I do...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
016	See, even Ren agrees with me. Ren, he's been like this all the time lately.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
017	Excuse my interruption! Captain! We've got an emergency over in the village!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
018	...!
019	Wh-what is this?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
020	H-help!
021	Natalie! We'll handle this for now. You go call for reinforcements!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
022	Got it!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0005
023	Protecting the villagers is our top priority! I won't have a single life lost as long as we're here!
024	Yessir!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0002
025	Very curious. So many bandits all in one place? And I find it very unlikely that the average bandit knows how to fight like that.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
026	...
027	Why don't you enlighten us? What are you really here for?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
028	No point in enlightening someone who's 'bout to die, kid.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
029	I didn't want to use this after I went outta my way to find it but...guess I got no choice.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
030	Huh?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
031	Uwaaaaahhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
032	What?! A demon?! What's that doing here?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0020
033	Eeeek!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
034	Watch out!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
035	Agh...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0043
036	Captain!
037	This demon's got its eyes set on me! Take this opportunity to get the villagers to safety!
038	Ngh!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
039	Vettel!
040	...It's fine! You make sure the other knights are safe!
041	Uh, are you serious?! Do you need your eyes checked? That's one big mother—	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
042	If we fight this thing together, there won't be enough people left to protect the villagers from the bandits! So leave this guy to me!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0041
043	Grrroooorrrggghhhh! Grrroooooaaaar!
044	Nnrk!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
045	Please do not panic! The Scarlet Flame Guards will protect you!
046	Easier said than done—
047	We're at a severe disadvantage with these numbers. Plus, our opponents seem determined to raze this place to the ground.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
048	To the point that they're willing to summon something like that over there.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
049	Ren and I are too busy with our own problems to take command of the Guard...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
050	But if we just ignore this demon, there will be huge casualties...
051	If only Nina and Chloe were here...
052	Nrgh! If I can just stop this demon here in its tracks, somehow...!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
053	Vettel! Are you okay?! I brought reinforcements!
054	What?! You big idiot! You're fighting that thing all by yourself?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
055	Captain Vettel!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
056	He must've been trying to protect the others by distracting that thing.	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
057	It's pretty clear what we've gotta do!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
058	Lady Natalie, please lead the villagers out of here! Commander Chloe, we'll handle the bandits!
059	As soon as the villagers are safe, we'll return to help Vettel with the big guy!
060	That way we can protect everyone!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
061	As is our duty...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
062	That's right. Vettel would certainly tell us to do the same. A knight's duty is to protect everyone!
063	Everyone! Let's do as he said!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0032
064	Agh... It's keeping me on the defensive. I'm not going to last at this rate!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0026
065	(I wonder if the villagers managed to get to safety...)
066	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
067	?!
068	Captain Vettel! We've evacuated all the villagers!
069	This guy is the last thing on the to-do list! Let's give it a beating it won't soon forget!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
070	Right!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
