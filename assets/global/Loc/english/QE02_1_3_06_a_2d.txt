001	It's coming into view. That tall tower, right?
002	I see. As might be expected from something that's been around since the founding of this country, it looks ancient.
003	The clock isn't moving.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
004	Yes. I heard that it stopped at the moment of my father's death.
005	I'm sorry to hear that.
006	So, the clock stopped working when the head of the Elester family—a family that's continually supported this country—died.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
007	Alkaroids, aye! I can confirm the presence of Alkaroids inside the clock tower!
008	After my father had died, Ethan was also removed from his position as protector of the clock tower.
009	Ever since, the position has been abolished, and the clock tower has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Beckrams.
010	Now that it's under their jurisdiction, does it mean that the Sacred Stone isn't here?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
011	I don't know.
012	But, until a year ago, Ethan worked at this clock tower.
013	It's quite likely that some kind of clue remains.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
014	Right. So, what do we do?
015	Inside this tower is pretty much an Alkaroid den. There's no guarantee we can make it out safely.
016	I will go with you, of course. All of this is my problem to deal with.
017	I'll go too. It's not like I can go back to Real Heaven now! I'm definitely going!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0020
018	That's some firm determination.
019	Well then, let's enter the now silent clock tower!
