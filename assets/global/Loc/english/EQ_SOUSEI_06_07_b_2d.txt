001	Ngh— It's difficult to inflict damage to fire!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
002	"We are the ones who embraced Envy—"	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
003	Sorry, Daphne.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
004	It's fine! Just leave the defense to me! Hyah!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
005	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
006	This is bad. Our Spiritbonding can't keep up with all this corruption.	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
007	But we can at least stop them from moving! Please, Eulalia, we'll do this together!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
008	Leave it to me!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
009	No good... At this rate things are only going to get worse!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0018
010	I can tell! Dammit! If only we had the airship with us now!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
011	Whoa, nice going!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
012	We picked it up from that Quence guy earlier.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
013	That dude may be the worst, but he knows his stuff. No shame in stealing his tricks!
014	That said—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
015	We're kinda hitting our limit here...
016	Huh? Eeeek!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
017	Ngh—!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
018	I finally caught up with you.
019	Sulva?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
020	If you keep fighting like this, you'll just lose everyone. We should retreat back into the city.
021	But then we'd have to move through this sea of flames.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
022	Don't worry about that.
023	"Awaken, King's Blade. I am your rightful master."
024	"Understand. This wrath is my justice!"
025	Did you just—?
026	That should've weakened them a little. We should take this chance to escape.
027	Nimul, we should listen to him!
028	Right. Let's retreat while we can!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
029	(Yna... I hope you're safe.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
030	Where...am I?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
031	Ah, great. You're awake.
032	Quence!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
033	No need to be so guarded. Am I not your former ally?
034	Emphasis on "former". Things are different now. I've already—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
035	Right. You gave up. Well, that's a shame then.
036	Then what? What are you planning to do with me?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
037	I have no more need for your smithing skills from here on out.
038	...It's over, Yna. Your duty is done.
039	Ngh!!!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
040	Good night, old friend. Sleep well. The next time you awaken, things will be as it once was. I will save it all.
