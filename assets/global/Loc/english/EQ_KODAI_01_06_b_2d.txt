001	D-did he just manipulate time?! How could a mere human bend the Truth of the world so readily? Truly, an impressive showing!	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_battle_0020
002	Too bad it's not enough to counter the might of a dragon!
003	Tch! The difference in power between us is too much for me to handle!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_battle_0019
004	Hmph. Bit off more than you can chew, did you? Step aside, novice. Let me show you how it's done.	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0002
005	I feel so useless... Though I guess I actually did pretty well, for a human fighting against a dragon.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
006	We should have known...! One of the seven great dragons—even one who left the line of duty—should never be underestimated!	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0016
007	Fall back! Retreat and regroup!
008	Pretty quick to turn tail and run, aren't they?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0005
009	Hmmm. Between the attempt to ambush and the quick retreat... This isn't how dragons fight. There's a human behind this somewhere.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0016
010	That sounds problematic.
011	No matter. We drove them away, and that's good enough for now.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
012	So, let's take this opportunity to greet and entertain my pupil's very first friend, shall we?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
