001	A Ratty's nest? Yes, I think know where it is.
002	R-really?	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0001
003	Let me show you on a map. Hold a second.
004	Good, good… Looks like finding where they went won't be a struggle.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0030
005	Tethys, I should thank you for suggesting we ask that peddler.
006	I thought it would be best to ask people who travel around the area. It's no big deal.
007	But, it seems you were nervous talking to him.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
008	Y-yes. I'm not good at conversations…
009	Sorry to keep you waiting. See here? This circle marks where their nest is.
010	Th-thank you very much!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_battle_0018
011	Alright! Let's go.
012	Hey! Wait just a minute!
013	Yes…?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0006
014	Actually, one of my colleagues is supposed to be here but he hasn't arrived yet.
015	He's carrying goods for the parade and also costumes, so it's worrying that he isn't here…
016	I hope he hasn't gotten into any trouble along the way.
017	If you're going on this main road towards the Ratty's nest, could you also look for him and help him if he needs some?
018	Understood.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0037
019	So…according to the map, the Ratty's nest is in this forest off the main road.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0039
020	And we should look out for the man's colleague.
021	Can I ask something?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0002
022	S-sure. What is it?
023	You don't even know that peddler. Why are you suddenly so energetic?
024	W-well, that's true, but…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0042
025	Because like me, I thought you wanted to avoid people…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0003
026	But now you're wanting to get involved, so it's confusing to me.
027	You don't like talking to other people, so why do you suddenly want to help?
028	That's because…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0006
029	After seeing the sad reaction of that person learning that the parade might be cancelled…
030	…made you want to become a real hero for him?
031	Yes. I don't like myself and I wanted to become someone special for others.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0004
032	I understood what he felt when he said he wanted to change, and I want to support him.
033	…I see.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0045
034	Is that…strange?
035	I didn't say that. But that's how you think.
036	I thought we were alike… So it feels…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0005
037	Tethys…?
038	Nevermind. But we should hurry. Even if we get the costumes back, it won't mean anything if we don't return in time.
039	Oh…yes, right! Let's hurry… Wait, what's that?	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
040	Waaaah!
041	An attack by bandits? Let's go!
