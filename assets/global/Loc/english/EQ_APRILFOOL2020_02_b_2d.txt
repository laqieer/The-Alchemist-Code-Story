001	Thankies! This job can be a real pain in the butt. You saved me a major headache!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0034
002	I probably shouldn't have been doing stuff like that, but... it was actually pretty fun.
003	Huh? Why not? You weren't breaking any rules or anything.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
004	This might be hard to believe, but I'm trying to find a way to return to the world I came from.
005	Oh... Sorry.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0001
006	Haha. It's okay—don't worry about it. I'm happy I got to help you out.
007	Aw, that's so sweet! You're so much nicer and easier to talk to than that other transfer student we got.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
008	There's another transfer student?
009	You didn't know? You should totes have a chat with him, then! He might know something that'll help you out!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
010	Thanks, Emma! I owe you one.
011	Actually, make that five—five hundred Zeni, that is. Just kidding! Haha. I'll let you off the hook this time, since you did me a favor too.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0008
012	Yeesh. Why do I get the feeling being friends with you is going to be bad for my wallet?
013	The world's equilibrium... Interesting. Then what purpose does—?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
014	Hey, Kaya! I got some info!
015	Oh? You've made some progress, have you?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
016	Yup! Apparently there's another transfer student here besides me. I figured I should go meet him!
017	Another transfer student? Oh... Right. I remember now. He's... Well...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0045
018	What? Is he a difficult guy to talk to, or something?
019	You'll find out when you meet him... If you meet him.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
