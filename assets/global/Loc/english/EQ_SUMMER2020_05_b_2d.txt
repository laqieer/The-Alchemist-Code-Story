001	Wow, you fixed our ship!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0009
002	I also fixed the Alkaroids since you went to the trouble of picking them up. Use them conscientiously.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
003	Thank you! Thank you so much! With this, we can return to the high seas!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0033
004	...
005	You really fixed it! It's like a dream! Thank you so much!
006	You're welcome.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
007	Ohhh! Amazing!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
008	You fixed it! They look so happy. That's our Albea!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
009	You're right, they do look really happy. They really treasure that boat... I'm glad.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
010	(I might've focused too much on becoming a sister my brother can be proud of.)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
011	(I thought that if I became a Phantom Soldier I'd be able to see him and I lost sight of what was important.)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
012	It doesn't matter what it means to anyone else... As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters.
013	And seeing the happy faces of my customers makes me happy.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
014	I think I understand a little how you feel.
015	I sometimes compare myself to Nyx.
016	Do you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
017	Occasionally but not that often! I'm happy with myself, so I don't really care!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
018	Besides, Magnus wants you to live your days smiling happily, right?
019	So I'm sure it's fine that you're having fun living your life as a mechanic!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
020	You think so? But then maybe I'm really not able to fulfill his wish.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
021	I rarely smile.
022	Uh, you did, though.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
023	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
024	When the pirates smiled and thanked you, you gave such a blindingly happy smile! I wanted to show it to Magnus!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
025	Oh!
026	Albea, stick out your hand.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
027	My comb! Where did you find it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
028	I spotted when the octopuses were gathering. I thought they might have it.
029	Just like you said, it glowed when I shined a light on it in the dark of the cave.
030	It was really beautiful! Magnus has got some taste.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
031	Maybe, but... He doesn't come see me in person. He just leaves things like this...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
032	Things like this? I'm sure Magnus has his reasons.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
033	Maybe he's just aiming to do things that will make you smile. Something certain, like pushing a button to get the right result.
034	...
035	Oh, looks like the ship repairs are finished.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
036	Yup! How are things over there?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
037	Um... The octopus situation got sorted out, but...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
038	Oh, it's still covered in garbage.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
039	We had our hands so full with the octopuses that we didn't get around to cleaning up the garbage they brought out.
040	Haaa... Just looking at it makes my head hurt.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
041	But we'll be fine. We've got more than enough people to help!
042	True. Since they caused all this mess, they'll help clean it up, won't you?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
043	A-aye! Leave it to us! Er... Although, that is a crazy amount of trash.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
044	Yeah... I feel a little faint... Sorting it is going to be very troublesome.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
045	Well, the Alkaroids can help out too, so it won't take that much time. See, look.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
046	Cleaning protocols initiated. Alcohol bottle, recyclable. Fake treasure map, burnable.
047	Cooperation will increase the probability of finishing this cleaning project by sunset to 65%. Recommendation: cease all useless chatter and begin cleaning.	VO_aj2000.aj2000_sys_0003
048	A-aye aye!
049	Well, let's leave the cleaning to them...and start playing!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
050	What? Is that all right? We are still supposed to be on the clock.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
051	It'll be fine. The Alkaroid problem has been solved, after all.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0008
052	But...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
053	Noah, let's eat some shaved ice!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
054	It's covered in fruit. It looks so good! But that's not the most important thing!
085	It's very cute, so I want you to see it as soon as possible!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0008
055	Those two...
056	Hehe... Your face is loosening up, Noah.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
057	Ohh...
058	When I feel at ease, it shows on my face quickly, doesn't it?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
059	This is my first mission without those two. I was honestly really worried. We were always together, even at school.
060	But... Thanks to Suzuka and everyone else, I feel like I really did my best! And I didn't panic that badly.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
061	You were splendid, Noah.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
062	I think 'splendid' is overstating it...
063	Heeey, Noah! The shaved ice will melt!
064	Wh-what?! You bought it already?! I didn't select a flavor yet!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
065	Emma asked me to hold onto the silver spoon in case something happened, but it wasn't needed this time around.
066	Thinking of doing things for others will make a person stronger. Noah has truly grown as well.
067	Perhaps she may never need this spoon again.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0045
068	Heh, and Emma looks like she's having a good time. Having friends is a good thing.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
069	Ah, the wind is blowing around trash!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0027
070	Hold on a second. This is a yakisoba tray and a stick from a corn dog from that beach hut down there...
071	This is...trash from the pirates, isn't it?! I don't believe it!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
072	Ah, uh, wait, Noah. Calm down!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
073	I've endured a lot up until this point. But this is my limit!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
074	...
075	Right. I guess this silver spoon is still necessary.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0030
076	...
077	Showdown.
078	Floating...letters...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
079	Sigh...	VO_albell.albell_event_1012
080	Sending messages like this is really annoying, brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
081	...
082	Albeaaa! Let's play!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
083	Wait, I'm coming over now!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
084	And that became a wonderful memory of summer.
