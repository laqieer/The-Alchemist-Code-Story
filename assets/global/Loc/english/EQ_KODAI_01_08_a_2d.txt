001	The lid has been tightened upon the end days. The darkness of a new beginning has descended upon the world.
002	My Lord, I've received a report from the me who is stationed with the nameless dragons.
003	The Dragon of Wisdom, Schmeier, has been captured. However, we've incurred heavy casualties in the process, making any further operations difficult at this time.
004	That is all.
005	Noted.
006	Advise your other self to come back to base with Schmeier in tow as soon as possible.
007	Surely a physical body emulating the form of a human cannot last long in a battlefield of dragons.
008	Would that be prudent, My Lord? I exist as many. Losses in these numbers were both expected and calculated for.
009	You are a newly born life. Like the humans, you deserve our utmost affection.
010	For now, I just need you to do as I command, without question. Can you do that for me?
011	Of course, Lord Ophioneus. Right away.
012	I, Shahel, shall make it so.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
013	And I shall continue to keep record of all things: your ideals, your actions, and...even your failures, without a moment left out.
014	Good. There is much I expect from you, including that very task.
015	What I must do is destroy this world and its Truth. That is the only means of atonement we dragons are privy to.
016	Destroy the Truth of...? Then...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
017	Yes. The seven pillars that shall bore through the Shell are complete. All that remains is to select those who are worthy enough to bear them.
018	It is your charge to make this selection, Shahel.
019	Oh, wow! There's so much ice in that cup now!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0046
020	That's amazing, Sia!
021	Heheh! That's the power of magic. Impressive, isn't it?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0047
022	I mean, it's hardly a match for the magnitude of what you or the other dragons can do, but if variety is what you seek, I'm your witch!
023	Still have a lot to learn, though, of course.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0006
024	We witches have to exercise control over the immeasurable magil in the air all around us to produce magical effects, and that's no easy task.
025	What else can you do? Can you show me?!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
026	Let's see... I can light fires, boil water...	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0038
027	I can also clean a whole room without lifting a finger!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0047
028	Oooohh!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0024
029	Look at her; so proud of herself!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
030	But the best she can muster is only really useful for doing chores around the house.
031	...
032	Hmm? What's up, Zafeiris? Something bothering you?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0025
033	To so casually state that your powers come from the manipulation of magil—the blood of dragons...
034	Dunno what to say. That's just kinda how it works! I believe there was another source of power, though, used to wield magic in the world we came from.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
035	Our teacher provided us with the means to use magil in its place when we arrived here.
036	She says it's a more efficient catalyst in this world.
037	Claybelle said that?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0044
038	Bit acrimonious for you to hear, I'm sure, but yeah.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0036
039	I feel no acrimony. It is only wise to use what you can for survival's sake, after all.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0034
040	Hmm... Survival's sake, huh?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0044
041	Is that not the purpose of it?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
042	Oh, yeah, it is. It's just... You're a lot different from all the other dragons I've met. Claybelle included.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0004
043	Am I?
044	My impression of dragons is that you guys live incredibly long lives and wield frighteningly immense power, yet you always seem to have such a nihilistic outlook on life.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0031
045	Teach fits that description to a T, though some dragons are even more defeatist still. I've even heard a few remark that their species is overdue for extinction.
046	You all seem to have a sort of...incertitude toward living. Like, you have no qualms about dying at any moment.
047	But you, specifically, seem to cherish life. You're different from the rest.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0002
048	...
049	Anyway, I need to tend to my cooking. Would you mind calling Claybelle for me? It's about time to get seated.
050	Certainly.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0034
051	...Do I...cherish life?
052	That can't be. I've... I...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0020
053	Zafeiris!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
054	Hmm? What is it?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
055	Are you going to get Claybelle?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0007
056	That's right.
057	Can I come too?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
058	Uh, all right. That's fine.
059	Yay! Let's explore the mansion together!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0023
060	Hmph. Still so childish.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0007
061	(She is only just a child, though.)
062	(With Ophioneus' forces after us, it would be wise to move to another Stratum as soon as possible, yet...)
063	This journey is meant to help her grow. She won't learn much of anything if we do nothing but run from one place to another.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
064	(But what can I do to aid in her education? How much must she experience—how much must she endure—before she is ready?)
065	Schmeier... Am I performing this duty as you'd hoped I would?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
066	Hmm... Seems cleansing this contamination is going to be even more difficult than I thought.
067	But where did it even come from?! No pathogen has ever produced symptoms like this in any of the worlds I've observed before.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
068	At least we've been able to confirm that infection is only possible through physical contact.
069	And I believe I've captured and quarantined all the infected. I don't think I missed any, at least!
070	Yet more cases of this illness keep popping up, and the numbers are growing. How? Why?!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0014
071	Is infection possible through other means as well?
072	...It must be as I suspected. It has to be! The true source of this illness is—	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0022
073	Claybelle! Food's ready!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
074	Ah, wonderful! Perfect time for a break.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
075	Tell Quence I'll be there as soon as I've tidied up the lab.
076	Okey-doke!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
077	You seem to have already gotten quite accustomed to having her around.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0045
078	She's no different than a human child. I've cared for my fair share of those here.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0037
079	My two disciples were just like her not too long ago.
080	For my own future reference, if I may ask: how long did it take for your disciples to fully mature?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0035
081	Heh. The short answer is, they haven't! Zafeiris, humans don't just reach maturity one day, and then that's that.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0010
082	Seeing and experiencing many things over many years, they learn bit by bit who they truly are, and gradually achieve what others might consider to be adulthood. The line is not quite so sharp, however.
083	It takes that long? But humans live such short lives! They'd barely have any life left by the time they finish growing.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
084	Ehh, you might be surprised. They have a saying: Even without parents to raise them, children will always grow up.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
085	In other words, humans are always maturing on their own through self-discovery, without any outside meddling at all. For some, you might turn around one day and realize, they're an adult now!
086	But, I don't—
087	Have the luxury of time to let it happen naturally? You've always been a little impatient that way.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0030
088	Do you remember that day we faced each other for the right to claim the title of Guardian Dragon?
089	You showed far too many opportunities for me to exploit, simply because you'd rush in recklessly at the most critical of moments.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0002
090	Ophioneus is on the move, and his forces will not rest until they've achieved his ends. Lil cannot afford to sit idle and wait for nature to take its course.
091	Hmph. You know, a good friend would've taken a moment—just a moment!—to reminisce with me after hearing something like that!
092	But, you're right, time is of the essence. So what do you plan to do now? Surely you don't intend to stay in this Stratum for long, right?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
093	I'm...not certain. I must admit, I don't fully understand what Schmeier intended for Lil to accomplish.
094	I've only been told of the final destination: the Genesis Altar. Ultimately, I must take Lil there. But I've been given no further instruc—	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0027
095	Ack! This fluctuation in the magil...!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0020
096	Seems we have more guests to entertain.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
097	Lady Claybelle. Will you not reconsider your stance? It would be most beneficial, for you as well, if you simply give us what we demand.	VO_dragonman-y.dragonman-y_sys_0016
098	Does Ophioneus truly intend to destroy the Shell of the World?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0003
099	Can he not spare but a moment to allow for the culmination of Schmeier's research? For us to make proper contact with Ouroboros?
100	He cannot. We cannot. It is imperative we proceed.	VO_dragonman-y.dragonman-y_sys_0039
101	But, why?! Why must you be so impetuous?! What are you afraid of?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0017
102	I think I can field that one. They want more than anything to start a war with Ouroboros.
103	What? Is this true?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0012
104	Lady Claybelle, you—
105	Why else would you put so much effort into the pursuit of Ouroboros' child form?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
106	Ouroboros is the protective wall keeping this world held together, all while ridding it of hostile entities...
107	Hostile entities from outside, anyway. Everything she does is directed only outward.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
108	If that child were to see and learn of all the sin in this world, and then reconnect with the Shell, Ouroboros would come to recognize the hostile entities that exist within it as well.
109	And that's what you fear, isn't it? You feel threatened by the prospect of the Shell of the World willfully smiting those like you.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0002
110	...
111	I'll take that as a yes.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0010
112	If that's what you're all about, then there's absolutely no way I can ever let you have her.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
113	Enough blood is on our claws as it is. Countless lives, not even all dragon, have been lost under our watch.
114	I cannot permit any further losses solely under the auspices of...what, hiding your shame?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0015
115	The particulars of our grand design are irrelevant!	VO_dragonman-y.dragonman-y_sys_0012
116	We must clear the way for our future! We will do everything in our power to put an end to your journey with her, no matter how much blood we must spill to do so!
117	That child—the soul of that abominable Shell—must never be permitted to encroach upon the Genesis Altar!
