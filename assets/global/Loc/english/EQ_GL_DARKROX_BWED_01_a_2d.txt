001	It's been several months since I left.
002	Don't get me wrong; I want to help Soren and the others. Help stop Goetia.
003	But not until I find out what happened to Roxanne.
004	Even...even a body would suffice.
005	...No, I refused to believe that. I'll find her, one way or another.
006	And so time and again I found myself back in Slothstein and its winding alleys.
007	Back to where I could find the truth for myself.
008	This must be it.
009	Several streets down, an imposing building stands squarely in the middle of a plaza.
010	Hundreds of shelves overflowing with damning evidence squatted within its steely confines, a testament to Slothstein's crime-ridden underbelly.
011	(Not surprised about the heavy patrols.)
012	(Guess I'll have to find some other way in.)
013	I crept from shadow to shadow for several hours in vain for an opening. There was never any.
014	Then, just when I was about to reconsider my approach...
015	(Where are all the guards?)
016	(Seems like they were called away by something.)
017	Guess this is my best shot at getting in.
018	...There she was. But this time, she had a bullet with my name on it.
019	...
020	Get out of here.
021	What?
022	Black Rose. Remember it.
023	We will meet again here, when it is right.
024	Funny how things circle right back around to where it all started.
025	On hindsight, this was a huge risk. Foolish, even.
026	But I took it. I had to know.
027	Did Goetia have her under their thumb? Was she on another of her infiltration attempts? Was the amnesia a front?
028	At least one of it has to be true... Right?
029	(Hmm.)
030	(No sign of her I can see...for now.)
031	(Just the same patrols, although it seems a little light today.)
032	Perhaps I was walking straight into a trap.
033	Turn the corner and bam - right between the eyes, like she wanted.
034	...Wouldn't that be a fitting end?
035	I don't have anything to lose anymore, anyway.
036	What's one last dance to a man with a death wish?
037	What was that?
038	Argh!
039	Coast looks clear...for now.
040	Best not to draw too much attention on the way.
