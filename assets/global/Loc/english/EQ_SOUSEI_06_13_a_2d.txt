001	…
002	Now's your chance, Emmel!
003	Okay!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
004	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
005	…There! Begone, corruption!
006	Uh…uhhh…	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
007	Yna! He's alright! He's breathing!
008	*Pant* Thank goodn--	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
009	Whoa!?
010	…This isn't supposed to happen. Ever since we met, you've been getting in my way…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
011	This ends now.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0020
012	Purify!	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0019
013	Purify!
014	Purify!
015	Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!Purify!	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0028_b
016	Satna!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
017	But...something's wrong. It's as if it's devolving…
018	Argh....Dammit. After all the time it took to "train" this thing…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0022
019	The source of the Cursed Beast's will… If the Ritual of Genesis proceeds any further, it won't be able to be recycled anymore…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
020	Ritual of Genesis?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
021	I've already won. I have no need for Libra now.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
022	Wait for me, Ambrosia! It won't be much longer, so dry your tears. With these two hands--	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
023	I'll take back the skies for you!
024	Oh…So, you DID know our Master.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
025	Huh?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
026	Your information is a little outdated, though. Master prefers laughter to crying!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
027	"Space-Time Manipulation, Initiate Anti-Sin Mode--Disrupting Satna's magil levels…Succeeded."	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
028	You two…you've already connected that deeply?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
029	Huh? What're you talking about?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
030	Mira, don't let him distract you! He's way too fast for me to handle by myself!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
031	I-I know! "Now, shake it all up!"
032	Oof!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0026
033	You just won't stop getting in my way, will you?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
034	You think the ends will justify any means.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
035	All you care about is your goal…but in my opinion, your method leaves too much to chance.
036	It would be a real shame if your sloppy handiwork robbed us of our past!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
037	Yeah! What he said! I wouldn't want the flan I ate yesterday turning into carrot cake!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
038	That's why we're here to--
039	…Satna! You're up! Use your authority to incinerate them!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
040	Not if I can help it! "Red Blade!"	VO_slba.slba_sys_0032
041	Now! Andechs! Daphne!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
042	Got it! Follow my lead!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
043	I'll give cover!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
044	Adaleigh, lend them a hand!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
045	On it! Antares, initiate emergency mode!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
046	Take…THIS!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0032
047	Tch. You've got to do better than THAT!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
