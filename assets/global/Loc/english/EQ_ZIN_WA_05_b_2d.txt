001	Phew... Now all that's left is to pick the flowers and...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0031
002	...Something's wrong.	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
003	What?
004	Look...the village... There's smoke rising.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
005	What's that? Is that a signal fire?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
006	I'm not sure... Let's hurry back down!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0016
007	What the...are these...people?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
008	What a horrible way to be killed...the houses have been burned... Was it bandits?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0018
009	Sen... Where is Sen?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
010	Med...icine...man...!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_1019
011	Sen...?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
012	Sen...she's bleeding...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0020
013	What happened?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0018
014	The villagers...they didn't want the disease...to spread anymore...so...	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0022
015	...They didn't!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
016	They killed each other...?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0027
017	I tried...to protect my father...
018	Sen...enough...don't speak...I'll apply medicine on you!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
019	Medicine...man...I know...I...won't...make it...
020	That's not true! You can survive!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0021
021	Medicine man...ahh...it's hard to breathe...please...	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0027
022	Hold on! If there's medicine, you can be saved! I'll...save you!
023	Jin! Calm down! Listen to what Sen...is saying...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0018
024	...?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
025	This is my family's blade that has been passed down from generation...to generation...in my family...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_1019
026	Like a demon blade...it is sealed with a spell...that absorbs my blood...transmuting it...into Alchemy...
027	Please, use my blood...and the blade...
028	I know that you will use it...wisely...medicine man...
029	Sen...I got it. I'll take it.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
030	I'm happy. I will become blood. Please let me fight by your side...medicine man...agh...ack!
031	...! I'll relieve your pain. Be at peace...as you cross to the other side...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
032	Thank... ...
033	... ...
034	... ...
035	How dare you come into this village...
036	You! Are you the one who commanded the villagers?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
037	Indeed. This was all to protect the traditions passed within this village...
038	It was a treatable sickness! They would've lived! The traditions you speak of killed those who could have lived!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0021
039	The blades of this village can only be made here.
040	These arcane secrets surrounding the creation of these blades...must be protected by us.
041	And you believe that is more important than the lives of your people?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0015
042	That is how we were taught to live.
043	... ...
044	Enough. Please, leave this village.
045	There are no longer any sick for you to save.
046	...Very well.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0022
047	Hey, Jin! Are you sure?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
048	The medicine will only work on those who are living. There's nothing more for me to do here. Let's go, Arkil.	VO_zin.zin_sys_1019
049	...All right...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0018
050	Elder...take generous care with the dead...
051	Of course.
052	This country may be sick...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
053	Things like tradition, law, and legend sound good, but...are they really more important than life itself?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0031
054	I don't know. Hey...Jin...
055	It may be strange for an outsider like me to say this, but...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
056	Is this country really worth it for you to save?
057	The person I really want to save...is my younger sister...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
058	Your younger sister...?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
059	I want to save her...from the sickness called the law.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
060	... ...
061	I see. Well then...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0020
062	Until a medicine to cure law is created, you've gotta run away as far as you can.
063	... ...
064	Well, I'm leaving now. I feel like I want to freely roam this country now.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
065	You're not really a traveling merchant, are you?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
066	... ...
067	I was asked by your sister to find you.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
068	So you were watching over me from the start.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0045
069	Sorry I deceived you.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0035
070	No... Is Yomi in good health?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
071	Yeah.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
072	I see...as long as she's healthy.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
073	All right then, you stay healthy as well.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
074	Are you sure you don't want to capture me and take me to Yomi?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
075	You wouldn't surrender yourself that easily, would you? It won't be easy to keep you restrained. Besides...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0040
076	She didn't ask that much of me.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0007
077	Well then, if you see Yomi again, tell her: 'We will meet again someday. I am prepared. However...'	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
078	"I want to save you. Until I find a way to do so, I cannot meet you."
079	All right, I will. See you then. Oh, before that...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0005
080	?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
081	You said when you came back to Wadatsumi, you ate something that was so delicious it made you cry. What was that again?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
082	Are you talking about the rice ball with pickled plum?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
083	Yeah, that's it. Pickled plum, huh? I'll remember that. See you around!	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0004
084	Heh. What a strange man. He truly is free like the wind, appearing and disappearing...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
085	Arkil...thank you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0033
086	(Yomi...wait for me! One day I promise to save you! I swear I will find a way!)
