001	Phew... We won.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0009
002	Let's take care of the stone already!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0022
003	Step back, Chloe.<br>I'm going to destroy the stone!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0037
004	All right! We did it!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0009
005	Huh? Chloe?
006	Huh, she's starting to fade?!	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0025
007	What?! Why is this happening?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0028
008	My transmuted body is finally released. This is all thanks to you. You have my gratitude!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0033
009	Are you serious?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0022
010	I was transmuted in an irregular way this time, but I have a feeling that one day, I'll meet you again as my true self.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
011	I may not remember today's events, but would you please not forget the name “Chloe of the Scarlet Flame Guard”?
012	How could we not?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0018
013	We won't forget!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
014	Of course we won't!
015	Thank you all.<br>You are such wonderful adventurers from a different world.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
016	You did well.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0023
017	Oh, Ouroboros!	VO_fencer.fencer_battle_0020
018	Thanks to you, the monsters were safely expelled, and the link between worlds has been terminated.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0033
019	This is thanks to the brilliance of your souls.<br>You have my gratitude.
020	We only fulfilled our mission, that's all.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0010
021	Yes... So...what will happen to us now?	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0004
022	Of course, you are free to return to your own world now. But you're free to stay as well.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0037
023	Hmm...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
024	...?
025	We may have completed our mission...<br>But we didn't finish exploring this world, did we?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0002
026	Oh...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0010
027	Hmm...	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0045
028	As adventurers, don't you feel like exploring this world just a little further?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
029	Hehe... And we may meet Chloe again too.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0007
030	Heh...oh boy.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0007
031	Ehehe...<br>So, would it be okay if we stayed a little longer to explore?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
032	I see.<br>This is the adventurer's desire for discovery, isn't it?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
033	Hm! I'll be watching over you then.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
034	Well then, we need to return to the city to enjoy that specialty dish again!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0023
035	Shouldn't we rather check out some other cities?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0002
036	Oh, right... Where are we going then?	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0006
037	The link between different worlds, as well as the monsters' threat was put to an end.
038	After a while, a certain city became famous for fried-egg bread.
039	Cheerfully and serenely, but with careful steps...
040	this trio continued their adventures, with the name Chloe in their hearts. Would their paths unite once again?
