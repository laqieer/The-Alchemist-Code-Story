001	I didn't think I would be so disappointed to face the end.
002	This isn't like me at all.
003	I should know that longing cannot change anything...
004	For it is already broken.
005	Now, I have no means of reporting my observations of the past and future.
006	If I attach a castor... Yeah, that should work.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
007	I rather overworked this one. Silly me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
008	I can tell. The bottom's all worn out.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
009	The mount has a bearing built into it, so you should opt for a wheel radius on the bigger side that won't lean into it too much. That should give it what it needs to deal with uneven ground.
010	You'll want some elasticity in the tire component, and if you're not too picky about the price, you could go with a heavy-duty type like this.
011	Come to think of it, it'd probably be better to have a stopper, too. This machine is for some kind of research, isn't it? What sort of work do you do again?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
012	I'm investigating ancient ruins.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
013	I suppose that you could call me an observer of history.
014	An...observer?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
015	The drill sensor that I had you install last time was incredibly precise. I must say that I was impressed.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
016	I just thought that something that can catch Alchemia directly would be better for geological surveys.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
017	Well, you were most correct. I have every faith in the castor that you've given me this time, too.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
018	Oof... It's really heavy.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
019	Oh, sorry. Here, I'll help you turn it over.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0035
020	There are even more parts than there were last time.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0045
021	I've been to many places since then, and have had several skilled mechanics like yourself look over my gear.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
022	Antie just keeps getting fatter.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
023	Antie?
024	That's its name. Archeological Surveyor Antie, version 5.3.1. I think it fits rather nicely.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_2004
025	Yeah, it's...kinda cute.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
026	If you give something a name, you begin to feel attached to it, even if it happens to be a machine.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
027	What about that large machine over there? Doesn't it have a name?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
028	Not yet. It's a work in progress. My father and I are working on it together.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
029	He hasn't been able to work on it much lately, though. It'll probably end up being finished after he... Well... That's why it doesn't have a name yet.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
030	I'm sure you'll find a good name for it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
031	All I can do is pretend that I don't know anything.
032	Isn't that right, Magnus?
033	Slothstein - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization
034	This castor really is superb.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
035	I'm glad I have a lantern with me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
036	I suppose I'll have to thank that blockhead the next time I see him.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
037	...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
038	It's necessary to light one's way in the darkness, after all.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0009
039	It seems the time has come.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
040	Hello, Kaya.
041	Lord Waginau...?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
042	What is the Bishop of the Holy Order of Babel doing in a place like this?
043	Surely you weren't caught unawares! Not the Crimson Dragon herself!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
044	Since leaving the Holy Guard, I have felt a presence dogging my every move, watching me from the shadows.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0021
045	Were you so conceited as to believe that no one would dare go after you, the possessor of the Alchemia Pura?
046	I knew that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared.
047	A definitive answer.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
048	An obvious one.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0017
049	...
050	You are approaching the Gates of Sin.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
051	Sorry, I don't speak cryptic.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
052	All will become clear to you in time.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
053	Well, it would have done. Meanwhile...
054	Both Magnus and I are to be...erased, I presume?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
055	It's inevitable.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0038
056	And now, I've learned something new.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
057	What would that be?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
058	There is a truth that you are desperate to keep hidden at all costs.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
059	A little arrogant, aren't we?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
060	I'm not going anywhere.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0010
061	You said it yourself, did you not? If anyone did intend to come after you, they would likely come prepared.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
062	Oh?
063	You may be confident of preserving your own life, but what of Zain's?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
064	What...?
065	You...!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0043
066	The time has come.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
067	Should you resist, you will be endangering not only Zain, but also the lives of all of the knights in the Holy Guard.
068	I am afraid that you have little choice but to cooperate.
069	No... Nnnnrrgh! Haa...haa...	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0022
070	Are you saying that if I go quietly...you'll let them live?
071	I'm not saying any such thing.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0039
072	However, you would do best not to mislead yourself into thinking you can resist me.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
073	I'm hardly...going to just play along!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0013
074	Very well, then. One can only hope that you will reconsider.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
075	Sometimes it is the most useful pawns who become the most troublesome.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
076	...
077	The sound of a lantern smashing upon the ground echoes throughout the ruins.
