001	In other words, safeguarding the origin of Alchemy...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
002	...is the true duty of the Protector. Is that correct, Lord Waginau?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
003	Exactly. This is why we must keep the village hidden.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
004	This is the true reason why the Sephira live apart from the rest of the world.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
005	The Sacred Stones are crystals of wisdom created by the Alchemy Source.
006	Controlling and regulating such power requires Alchemy, which is also drawn from the Source.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
007	Therefore, the true duty of the Protector is...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
008	It is to protect the secret behind the original form of Alchemy, then pass on the gravity of that truth to future generations.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
009	Although the Sephira are indispensable guardians of Sephiron, they also carry the potential to destroy the natural order of the world.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
010	This is...a heavy burden.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
011	It is your responsibility as a Sephira and as the Protector.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
012	I understand.
013	This is the burden of living as a Sephira.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
014	You must keep the true duty of the Protector hidden from the people at all costs.
015	Duly noted.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
016	You already have one hand on the door. It should not be long before you master this skill.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
017	Unfortunately, we are out of time.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
018	The resurrection ceremony is a trying ritual for both the druidic priestess and the Protector. Do not let your inner darkness take hold of you.
019	What do you—?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
020	Kamui, you are especially talented. You stand out even among other Sephira born with such incredible Alchemia.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
021	As a result, I suspect you are fated to encounter difficult obstacles in your life. Remember my teachings when the time comes.
022	Do not forget, Sephiron and her door lie within you.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
023	I will keep that in mind.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
024	Then this is goodbye, my young pupil. I look forward to seeing you again.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0041
025	Haaaaaah!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0032
026	Right flank! What's your situation?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
027	We are holding for now, sir, but there are just too many of the Jam!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
028	Anyone who is inflicted with the curse must retreat and be purified before returning to battle! I'll cover the gaps in our defense!
029	Our druidic priestess is holding the ritual that will subdue the curse!
030	We must buy her time! Today we put our pride as Sephira on the line and show the results of all of our training!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0015
031	Huzzzaaahhh!
032	That's it! We must stand our ground until those two can complete the ceremony!
