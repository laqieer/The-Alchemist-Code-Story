001	We've finally arrived. How do you feel, having fulfilled your duty?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
002	Don't make me repeat myself. I was just taking some time off.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
003	Well, it doesn't matter to me. My work ends here.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
004	Hurry up and collect your reward from the Guild. Then, disappear from my sight.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0020
005	Oh, about that...I won't need to be collecting any reward.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
006	What...?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0025
007	Aghh!	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_0027
008	Wh-what the...?!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
009	There. I've received my reward in full.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0023
010	What?!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0027
011	As you can see, for my reward I was given the choice between "gold" and "punching you once in the face."	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
012	You're an idiot, you know?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
013	Yep, that I am. From one idiot to another...	VO_balt.balt_sys_0008
014	Stop leaving your Guild and trying to handle things on your own, you big buffoon.
015	...?!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0027
016	I won't pretend that I don't understand why you acted the way you did, but there's just one thing I can't stand.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
017	You've put yourself in danger without informing anyone of your intent or purpose. Do you think that's what your subordinates want?
018	... ...
019	Leaders are irreplaceable.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
020	No one in the Guild wants someone that's irreplaceable like you to be putting himself in harm's way.
021	Was that reward of yours...your way of making it up to my subordinates?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
022	Not at all. That was my personal stress relief. After all, I need some form of compensation for taking on such a troublesome job.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
023	Why don't you people just leave me alone?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0042
024	An organization can't function without its leader. Whether it be the Sand Hawks or the Guild, this fact remains true.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
025	I don't need you to tell me that.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0018
026	If you know this then you should be more careful.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
027	I humbly accept your words of wisdom.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
028	Tsk. You ungracious scoundrel! That was one troublesome job. My shoulders are stiff now.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
029	Well, that being said, I'm not walking away completely empty-handed.
030	...?!
031	It doesn't seem like you're going about your job in a cold and calculative way.
032	If you had been, I might've had to crush you before you involved us in your dangerous approach.
033	I'm relieved to see that you've got some heart in the way you handle things. Your Guild is no enemy of the desert.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
034	If you had turned out to be nothing more than unpleasant business rivals, we would've immediately taken you down.
035	I doubt you could even if you wanted to.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
036	Don't be too sure about that.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
037	The diapers protecting your heads don't seem like they'd be adequate protection. I'm guessing we'd find an opening.
038	How annoying can you get?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
039	That's strange. I was just thinking the same about you.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0008
040	Hmph...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
041	See you around then.
