001	Did a monster just exit the ruins?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
002	This place is more dangerous than we thought. I better let the Holy Guard know...
003	Huh? Captain Vettel! You're back already?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
004	Yeah. Reporting to the Holy Order went faster than expected. What are you doing here?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
005	Uhm, well, I just figured that the ruins were kinda suspect. If something were to happen here, the village would be in danger.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
006	So after I finished my duties in town, I rushed here to keep an eye on things. I know I shouldn't decide these things on my own, but I figured better safe than sorry, right?
007	Nina wanted to come too, but I sent her home since I figured I'd just check in real quick... That girl's barely had a chance to breathe lately. She needs the rest.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
008	So you also came to take a look then... You've really grown, Victor. To think that you've become someone able to see beyond yourself...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
009	Forget about that, though! What are you doing here?! Leave this place to me and go back and rest already! Especially when you're dressed like that!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
010	Natalie's gonna give you a real scolding if you get that outfit dirty!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
011	A scolding? Come on, I'm not a child...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
012	Uh, Vettel? What was it that I said again? Come straight home? No distractions?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
013	...
014	I can't believe you got your brand new uniform dirty already! At least put on a fresh change of clothes before you come back, you idiot!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
015	S-sorry...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0021
