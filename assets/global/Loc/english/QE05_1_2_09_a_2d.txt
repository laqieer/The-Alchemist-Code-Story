001	Kamui! You're back!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
002	Indeed, he is! A little late though, aren't you?	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
003	Malta? I didn't realize you would be visiting.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
004	Well, I wanted to check in with Hisham. He's gotten much better!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
005	Oh, really? It was me you wanted to check on?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0010
006	Why, you! Hisham! What are you flapping your mouth about?!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0013
007	Did something happen?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
008	N-no, nothing!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
009	Did you hear? Isidore said this morning that there's a supply caravan nearby.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
010	Ah. I remember him saying something like that.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
011	Oh! That's how he got this candy!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
012	Oh, he already did some trading with them? I was hoping to get some good frankincense from them if I could.	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
013	I feel a little bad asking him to go out again for it, though...
014	I'll go take a look myself later.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
015	You...? I will go in your stead.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
016	Huh? You just got back, though.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
017	It's a good opportunity for me. I just realized I haven't gotten you a wedding present.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
018	This is the perfect time to display my loyalty to the next leaders of our village.
019	I see. Well, in that case...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
020	By the way, Isidore said that the caravan is in the tent across from the rock wall.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
021	Then I shall go see. It's a good chance to replenish our food stocks, as well.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
022	Wait, does that mean...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
023	Are you gonna make your awesome meat pie?! Yes!
024	If the merchant has any good spices I can trade for, perhaps.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
025	What kind of merchant would come this far into the desert, only to leave money on the table like that?! Of course he's got spices!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
026	Well, you never know. It's probably fine, though.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
027	Come back soon! I'm looking forward to seeing what you get your hands on!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0004
028	Be careful out there, Kamui.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
029	Hm... It does look like the supply caravan was here before, but...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
030	Is this everyone in your caravan?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0031
031	Uh oh...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
032	Yes, there was no one else with us, sir. What exactly is this about?
033	That is none of your concern. Now, you do have a valid permit to do business in our country, do you not?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
034	Of course! We would never get involved in any backdoor dealings of any kind!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
035	Good. Now, have you sold anything in this area?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
036	What? In this area? Um... There was a guy this morning that seemed like a local of some sort.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
037	Would you say he was a traveler? Wearing relatively light clothing?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0005
038	Hmmm. I would say it wasn't really the type of protective clothing one would wear if they were traveling across the desert.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
039	Wouldn't you know better than I, though? There must be one or two villages in this area.
040	Thank you very much for the information. Now, I recommend you get a move on. Our troops will more than likely come through this area.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0031
041	I-I see. We shall do as you say, then.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
042	Is the army looking for our village?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
043	Could there be something wrong with Narol?
044	Oh no!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
045	That noise... Liars! You are hiding someone!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0013
046	What? N-no, that couldn't be!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
047	Eh? Sir, please!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
048	It might be the man the General spoke of! Do whatever it takes to get your hands on him! Just make sure he can still speak in the end!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0012
049	Roger!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0001
050	What are they thinking?! Are they really so desperate to catch one man?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
051	If I cannot shake them off... Then I cannot return to the village!
