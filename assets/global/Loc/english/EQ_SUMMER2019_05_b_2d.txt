001	Ready... Fire!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0014
002	Huzzah!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0007
003	Phew! We did it!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
004	The beach should be safe now. All that's left is to return these swimming trunks.
005	Bertha...you take them. I'd really rather not touch those.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
006	What?! I don't wanna touch 'em, either!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
007	Huh? Kaya? What're you staring at?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
008	Hmm...
009	There was no trace of a human hand having meddled with the Demon's seal. What I did find was some viscous residue and a faint whiff of the sea...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
010	Could that octopus have broken the seal? No... Perhaps I have underestimated just how deeply these ruins are connected to the Octopoda...
011	It's no good. She's in a world of her own.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0011
012	This whole mission has been riddled with octopuses from beginning to end!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
013	I wonder if the treasure hidden in the ruins was meant to be the Demon? I was hoping for an epic adventure, but all I got was one giant octopus!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
014	So long as you are safe and sound, Xiao-Xiao. I need nothing more than that.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
015	Besides... An octopus that size is a fine catch indeed. You may look forward to a sumptuous feast once we are back on board the ship!
016	No, no, no, no, no! You are banned from entering the galley, mister! Not happening. Not a chance!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0039
017	Seriously?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0026
018	Su Yi worked really hard to find me... That'll be my treasure. Nothing could possibly beat that!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
019	Su Yi...? Is something wrong?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
020	Um... According to this map, the treasure should be...around here...somewhere...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
021	(Whoa! Su Yi spoke her mind! Just like that! I'm so proud!)
022	Oh! Hey, Su Yi! There's something here!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
023	Is this...an octopus pot? It's huge!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
024	I suppose an octopus as large as the one we fought would need a pot this size.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0045
025	Let's turn it over and see if there's anything inside!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
026	Umf...!
027	Whoa! What's all this?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
028	Are these...pearls? There are so many of them...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0009
029	And quite large ones, at that.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0044
030	I have heard that octopuses have a penchant for white things. It was likely collecting them and hiding them in its pot.
031	Wow, Su Yi! You make an amazing treasure hunter! Right, Liu Shen?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0046
032	Indeed. A treasure-hunting prodigy, one might say.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
033	N-no! It's nothing like that! I just happened t-to stumble across it!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0026
034	Pfft! I didn't see any stumbling! You worked hard to research and locate this place, and that means this treasure was discovered by none other than you, Su Yi!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
035	If you weren't here, I bet we never would have found this booty!
036	I worked...hard?
037	I guess I did... Heheh!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0007
038	But I didn't do it alone! This was a team effort. Bertha and Sharon helped, too.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
039	I couldn't have done it without them.
040	Su Yi...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
041	Then I guess that makes these pearls the Xiao Shenmei's...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
042	Nah, that's not quite right. They're a symbol of the bonds that bind all of us standing here!
043	Right!
044	May the summer heat open your mind and heart. Wishing you a lovely summer!
