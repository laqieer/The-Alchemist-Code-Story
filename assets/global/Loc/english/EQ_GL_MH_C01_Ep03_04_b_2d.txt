001	Meep!
002	This is...!
003	Oh, someone's here...
004	Looks like they got you too, huh?
005	You're wearing some really weird clothes. Are you from outside the city?
006	What do they want with us? I want Papa and Mama... I shouldn't have gone off on my own.
007	(These must be the missing children... but didn't they say they were kidnapping orphans?)
008	(That doesn't make sense...)
009	Um... are you okay? You're making a scary face...
010	This place is dangerous. We need to get out of here.
011	Y-you know how to get out of here? Who are you?
012	Keep the questions for later, and make sure you stay close.
013	(W-wow... he's scary...)
