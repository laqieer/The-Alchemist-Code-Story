001	I'm so sorry it took us so long to find you, Lord Naofumi.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0035
002	It didn't take you long at all. You did a great job finding me, Raphtalia.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
003	Of course—I need to be by your side at all times as your sword. I knew that I would have to find you, no matter what.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0005
004	I had faith that you would rise up against the Wave to protect everyone in this world, too.
005	You are the Shield Hero, after all.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0007
006	Raphtalia...
007	Hey, Mel, who're all these people?	VO_filo.filo_sys_0001
008	They're the people from this world who are helping us fight the wave.
009	Oh, that makes sense. Hiya, everyone! The name's Filo!	VO_filo.filo_sys_0045
010	It's a pleasure to meet you, Filo.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
011	I...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
012	These monsters keep popping up out of nowhere. It's never-ending...	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0020
013	We really have to keep doing this until we take down the boss? What a pain... It actually upsets me that you have to deal with this so often.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
014	We're not so fond of it either... The Waves keep on ruthlessly taking away what's most important to people.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0005
015	I don't want any more people to have to suffer at the hand of these Waves.	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0022
016	Raphtalia...
017	The villagers here have been so kind—they helped us try to find Lord Naofumi and Melty...
018	I even got some snacks from an old lady! Everyone here is so nice!	VO_filo.filo_sys_0007
019	They've been incredibly kind to us even though we're just strangers... The people here are too good—there isn't an ounce of hatred against demi-humans or monsters... That's why we need to...	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0005
020	Don't worry—I'll protect them. I need to do my part as the Shield Hero.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
021	But we need to lure out the boss somehow in order to do that...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
022	Naofumi, look behind that Balloon!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
023	I knew it. Use your light magic, Raphtalia!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
024	Okay!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0004
025	I am the source of power, and I command you to heed my words. Light spring forth—First Light!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_battle_0004
026	There's a face floating in that Balloon's shadow... The way it's smiling is so disturbing...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
027	There it is! Attack the shadow at the foot!
028	Haaaaaah!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0009
029	It's a Soul Eater!	VO_raphtalia.raphtalia_sys_0025
030	I didn't think we'd run into one here.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0010
031	SYAAAAA!	VO_souleater.souleater_battle_0001
032	I can't believe such a huge monster can hide in the shadows of a Balloon...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
033	That's the Wave's boss! We'll be able to suppress the Wave if we defeat it!	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
034	Let's go!
