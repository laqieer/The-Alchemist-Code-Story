001	Nu-numuu...
002	We've finally managed to corner you! Come on! Give back the candy!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0017
003	Yes! Please, give it back. I can't afford for rumors to spread about my candy containing powerful mana!	VO_nacre.nacre_battle_0019
004	Numu, numaaa!
005	Wait. Let's hear them out first! It may solve the mystery of this entire fiasco.	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1002
006	Usually...monsters won't enter a town. There must be...some reason behind their actions.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0037
007	Numu...numu, numu, numu...
008	Hmm. I see.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0045
009	What did the Rattys say?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
010	They said they wanted to attend a human festival.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
011	They became envious after seeing the humans eating candy and enjoying themselves so much.
012	When they caught a whiff of the candy, they couldn't contain themselves any longer. By the time they came to their senses, they had already stolen the candy.
013	It appears that this candy contains the effect of stimulating "the desire to enjoy Halloween."	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0045
014	What do you mean?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0025
015	I guess you can call it the power of Halloween. Usually, its effect would be limited to boosting the fun a little and not much beyond that.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
016	But their fascination with Halloween was too strong.
017	So...it sent them into a frenzy...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0045
018	So that's what happened...huh, Mia?! What's the matter?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0044
019	Sob... So that's what happened. I'm sorry...I didn't realize at all.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0019
020	Actually, I think it would've been pretty difficult to realize what was going on.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
021	So...it appears monsters also have the desire to enjoy Halloween.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0044
022	Hey, why don't you give them some candy?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
023	Just enough to make them feel better. I mean, it's Halloween after all. Right, Neica?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
024	Y-you're asking me?! I...well, as long as there isn't any strange mana inside of my candy then...I guess...it's okay?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
025	What should we do, Hayate?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
026	What do you mean...?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
027	Our mission is to protect everyone's Halloween.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
028	If the Rattys wish to enjoy Halloween then I want to allow them that pleasure, but...
029	I think it's fine. The townsfolk think that it's a costume anyway. They won't notice at all!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
030	Heheh. She's right. I think we should do...what we must do.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0007
031	What we must do...right! All right, everyone, let's distribute the candy!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0032
032	Got it!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
033	U-Um... Can I go back to the house once? I'm thinking of making some additional candy.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
034	No! Neica, you're gonna pass out the candy with us!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0014
035	Whaaat?! If I knew I'd have to do this...I would've worn a costume that hides my face completely.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
036	Wow! Candy! Trick-or-treat!
037	It looks so good! Give some to me too!
038	Hey! You guys have to wait your turn!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1024
039	Okaaay!
040	(Both children and adults alike are enjoying Halloween. This is an amazing festival!)	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0007
041	(We must protect the peace here...so that everyone can enjoy Halloween next year as well!)
042	Numaa!!!
043	Hey! You already got some just now!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
044	Have an amazing Halloween☆
