001	Hrgh! At this rate...!
002	Corvus, don't! We can't harm these people, they're being controlled against their will! They're my people!
003	What's the matter? Are you not going to fight back?
004	Or do you still believe Meliodas will miraculously overturn this situation? Pathetic!
005	...!
006	This isn't good! M-maybe we should retreat for now?!
007	This way!
008	Hmph... There's no point in running. You will be eliminated soon enough.
009	But first...
010	I can sense your presence, Meliodas. You're here in this world as well.
011	The humiliation you brought upon me... This hatred that burns within me...
012	It doesn't matter where we are. I will have my revenge.
