001	We've managed to handle the first wave, but...there's still more of them over there...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
002	I wonder if they're trying to get a read on the situation.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
003	Victor...let's take them all out now!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
004	What? Are you serious? We don't know how many of them there are. It's pretty reckless...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
005	We'll be okay! It's shameful for a knight to run with the enemy in front of him! I'm sure you learned about that from Dilga.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0048
006	Well, I did...but...!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
007	By the way, Victor...why do you feel uncomfortable around me?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0049
008	Hold on a second! Now isn't a good time to be talking about that sort of stuff!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
009	You might be right...but...I always saw you as a valiant junior knight.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0018
010	Now that we've been assigned to the same unit, we're going to be fighting together.
011	If there's anything I can do to change, I'll do it! So, please...tell me!
012	Well...I don't know...I just feel uncomfortable! That's all!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
013	Please, don't just leave it at that!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0041
014	Shh! Captain Fraise! The enemy is on the move...!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
015	...?! So, it begins! Let's go, Victor!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
016	Are we really going to go?! We should wait for reinforcements!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
017	How can we protect everyone if we can't even handle this tiny number of enemy soldiers?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0040
018	Fear not! No matter what happens, I'll protect you!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
019	Like I said, I can protect myself!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
020	Let's go, Victor!	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0004
021	Seriously! What's wrong with him today?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
