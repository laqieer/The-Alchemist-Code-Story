001	All set, Paladin! We've finished our preparations and we're ready to assault the tower!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
002	We'll distract the homunculus. You take care of the guards and the tower itself!
003	Alright, leave it to us. Wait, do you smell that? It smells so good... Aw, man. I didn't realize the time...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
004	No worries, I've got you covered! Here's meat on a stick, pickled plums, and the ever popular Colosseum Apple Pie!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
005	I can guarantee that these are the best of the best! I've sampled them all myself. Go on, eat up!
006	Oh, wow. Gutsy and overflowing with fighting spirit...and appetite! So this is a swordfighter!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0009
007	Lucky... I wish I could have some. It reminds me of Winry's apple pie.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0022
008	Ooh, food talk! I want to know more about foods from your worlds! Oh, and about the diet of the Holy Order as well.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
009	The Holy Order's...? Food in the Holy Order is tasteless and empty of joy.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
010	I'm really looking forward to trying lots of different delicious foods with you, Teona!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
