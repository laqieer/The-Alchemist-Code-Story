001	I'm gonna do whatever I can to get out of here!
002	That's one of the only memories I have of when I was small.
003	A lot of children were brought in as experiment subjects.
004	Kidnapped children, sold children, abandoned children, created children.
005	All of their memories were removed. They couldn't remember anything about their hometown, their family, or the color of the outside world.
006	From amongst them, only he was able to remember a little of the outside world.
007	There were more trees outside, the ceilings were higher. And the blue...
008	There are white masses called clouds. The rain is cold, but the rainbow after that—
009	His memory was our hiding place. He used to encourage all of us that one day we would leave this place.
010	But...!	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1005
011	After several experiments, he never returned again. All that remained was my desire not to remember anything.
012	The truth about not being able to save him when he was supposed to be my friend...
013	That is what pains me so much even now.
014	Celliers?! Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0027
015	... ...
016	The power of the crystal stopped, but...why won't you get up?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
017	Do-don't cry! If the monster comes again, it'll be a big problem. We need to hurry back to the mansion.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0043
018	Uff...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0002
019	There's no doubt about it. I finally found you.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
020	Ohh, Celliers! Celliers! I finally found you!
021	I won't let you escape again. I'm the only Mage left from that test lab. Yes, you're mine...just mine!
022	We finally arrived.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0024
023	Celliers still doesn't wake up, but...I can't carry him all the way to the room on the second floor.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
024	Uck...uhhh!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0025
025	...! I need to make a place for him to sleep! Oh, and water too...!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
026	Eeek?! Wh-what was that?! That sound...was it magic? Did it come from outside?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0022
027	Ahahah! Now go forward, you sordid beasts! Go and destroy that mansion!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0008
028	Celliers, Celliers, Celliers! Come out now, my adorable little lab rat!
029	Who is that person...? There's something weird...and frightening about her...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
030	Ah, no...I can't go back there...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0025
031	... ...
032	(I'm really scared, but...I need to protect Celliers right now!)	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
033	(Because, because...!)
034	He's my friend!
035	Stop it, old lady!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0043
036	...What?
037	Who are you? Where's Celliers?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
038	Are you friends with Celliers? If so, then cut it out! Celliers is in pain right now!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
039	I see. I wonder if it's some kind of symptom or if he's still reacting to Lustburg's curse. Heheh. Observing the situation for now might be best.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0006
040	What are you saying? You're terrible...Celliers is in pain...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
041	Terrible? Why? That thing was originally made to experiment on.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
042	Treating it like a tool and using it until its breaking point is the greatest way to express one’s love for it.
043	(Hey, what is wrong with this person?! I'm not going to let Celliers near her!)	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
044	Are you going to stand in my way, little girl?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
045	I won't let you do anything mean to my friend!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0012
046	You friend? I see. I'd like to see that kind of response as well.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0044
047	When his friend is eaten by the insects, I am so interested to see how he responds!
048	Huh?! The old lady really is weird!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0043
