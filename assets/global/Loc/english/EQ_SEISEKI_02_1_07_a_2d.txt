001	I'll shine the light of justice on you!
002	...?!
003	True, I haven't witnessed the kind of hell that you and Kagura have seen.
004	But relying on and seeking power is not the same justice that Captain Cadanova spoke of!
005	Justice isn't malleable!
006	If the pain and sorrow in your heart threaten to engulf you in darkness...I'll shine the light of justice on your heart!
007	You will shine the light of justice...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
008	Yes!
009	In the future, if you find yourself in danger of being consumed by darkness, please leave it to me.
010	I'll shine a light on that darkness and defeat it!
011	...!
012	So, please don't worry. I know you might not believe me, but...
013	This is my justice—the justice I inherited from Captain Cadanova!
014	...Hmph.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
015	Our rest is over. Enough of this silly conversation. Let's continue onward.
016	Kudan! Kanon!
017	Huff...huff...huff...
018	Kagura! What's got you so worked up? Did you find a spring?
019	Fo-forget about that! I finally found what we were looking for!
020	So you did find a spring! I was just starting to get thirsty. Come on. Take me there!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0009
021	That's not what I meant!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
022	Huh?! You brought something with you!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0029
023	Oh, come on! Not now! I'll tell you the details once we defeat these guys!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
