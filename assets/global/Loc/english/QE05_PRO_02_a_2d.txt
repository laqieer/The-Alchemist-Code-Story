001	Whoa, she's fast! She's definitely an experienced fighter!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
002	Tell me what I want to know! I do not wish to kill anyone...if I do not have to.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
003	Gah! I never expected a cutie like you to be so skilled with a sword!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
004	A cu—?! That's enough of your blithering!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
005	Where did she...?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
006	What a shallow fool! I will not let your words bewilder me anymore!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
007	B-behind me?! Urk!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
008	Wha...?!
009	Where are you aiming? Is it not clear to you that you cannot defeat me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
010	You try to act all sneaky, but you're actually a pretty honorable fighter, aren't you?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
011	What does that...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
012	The way you strike, straight and true... It shows that you aren't used to dirty fighting, meaning that you prefer to fight fair and square.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	Wha—?!
014	A steel beam?! Ack!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
015	He was aiming for the beam the whole time?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
016	Yep, all so I could position myself behind you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
017	You!
018	Checkmate. Now, I've got a few questions for you. Why are you after the man with red hair?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
019	Can't you hear them? The lamentations of the ancient ones...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
020	What?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
021	I can hear them; the wailings of a people exploited and decimated for being so pure.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
022	People? What people?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
023	I cannot allow myself to repeat their tragedy as their cries of grief echo in my ears. I cannot allow myself to be another meek fool.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
024	What the...? A black puddle?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
025	Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Snake Bind!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0004
026	Ink?! Wait, a ribbon?! Urgh, I-I can't move! What the hell is this?!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0019
027	These bindings, once they find their target...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
028	There is no limit to its ability to constrict. Do you know what this means?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
029	If I allow it to, it could rip through your body.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
030	R-rip?! Wait, wait, wait! That is so not okay!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
031	I already vaguely planned on dying of old age!!!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0019
032	Then just answer my questions. Where is the red-haired man?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
033	Oh, come on! You're sealing my fate one way or the other!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
034	What? Do you mean revealing this man's location will get you killed?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
035	No, that's not what I mean!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
036	I'm saying I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I were to sell out my friend! I'd rather die now!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
037	Wha...?!
038	Let me make this clear. Living just to survive is no way to live.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
039	The value of your life is set by how you choose to live!
040	I...see.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
041	Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute! I was, uh, just showing off! Please!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
042	Uh, why are you putting your sword away? You're not gonna beat me to death now, are you?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
043	You would choose death over betraying your friend.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
044	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
045	History is built upon betrayal.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
046	Those who are persecuted in the end are always the ones with pure and noble souls.
047	H-hey!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
048	The pure and noble souls are persecuted? What was up with her?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
049	Well, looks like Ronnie was right.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0045
050	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
051	Good to see you, Edgar L. Leonhart. Uh...I didn't know you were into this sort of thing.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0001
052	You're one of Don Taras'...! Glad you're here! Can you do something about this?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0024
053	I have to catch that girl before she causes more trouble!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
054	Girl? Where do you plan to go?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0005
055	It won't be long before she finds that place! If I don't catch her, it'll mean I let a dangerous girl roam free!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0019
056	I have to hurry to that shady city, Lost Blue!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
057	So this is how they hide the entrance to deter outsiders.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0045
058	Sure is. Are you sure about this? This is some high quality fabric. Like, it's from Wadatsumi or something.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
059	It's fine. You provided me with information worth its price. I still owe you thanks for leading me out of there.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
060	I would have been lost on my own. Thank you.	VO_amane.amane_battle_0018
061	Don't even worry about it! Haha! This'll fetch me a sweet price!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
062	A long-haired knight of the Holy Guard...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
063	I never expected Lost Blue, once known as "the sunken city that light does not reach", to be so bright and lively.
064	It's hard to believe the Templars came from there.
065	Of course this place is lively. People who've lost their place in the world gather here from across the continent.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
066	Hm?
067	Without a better outlet for all that dynamic energy, it all gets focused on keeping this place running.
068	Well, there is some support coming in from Slothstein that helps, of course.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
069	And you are...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
070	I was informed about a girl that no one recognizes entering that city. I just came to see who it could be. Did you enjoy your time there?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
071	So you came to defend your territory? Do not worry. My business is done here. Farewell.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
072	Hold it. You're the one that covered some of my people in ink, right?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
073	Some of them are seriously injured. Your method of asking for directions is a little too violent, don't you think?
074	So you're here for retaliation? If I may say, it was those men who provoked a fight in the first place. There is no reason for me to have to deal with this.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0045
075	Nevertheless, those idiots were bested by such a pretty bonny? That's a little embarrassing.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
076	A p-pretty bo—?! You're being ridiculous!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
077	What's this? Are you blushing?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
078	N-no! Anyway, I have no business with you!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
079	Oh, but I have business with you. Sorry, but you're coming with me.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0017
080	Agh?! Ow! Who just shot at my arm?!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0020
081	That was close... Hey! You okay there, power-fist?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
082	Comb-head?! What...?! When did you get back to town?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
083	Wait, hey! I was helping you!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
084	Huh.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0017
085	Hold on. Don't move. I'd rather not get rough with a lady if I can avoid it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
086	La...dy? Do you mean me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
087	I don't see anybody else here that word could apply to.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
088	S-stop it! Ridiculous! If you aren't here to tell me where the red-haired man is, then you're wasting my time!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
089	It's actually you who'll be doing the talking. I still have a lot to ask you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
090	You just don't give up, do you?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
091	Try and stop me.	VO_amane.amane_battle_0007
092	Tch! I knew it'd come to this! Let's go, top-heavy!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
093	Don't tell me what to do, washout!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0021
