001	Huzzaaaaaaahh!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0004
002	Dang it! I missed the core. Just a little higher!
003	It's no good... I can't make it!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
004	It's not going to be easy to reach the core on the back of its neck. It's just too huge.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
005	Bud, Victor! Help me bring the Giant Taurus to its knees, to give Judith a chance to reach the core. On my signal—	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
006	Huzzaaaah!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
007	J-Judith?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
008	If that's all that needs to be done, leave it to me! With its improved firepower, my Mecha Weapon is more than up to the—
009	Grooorgghhhhh!
010	Judith! Stop! It's not going to work!	VO_budd.budd_chara_2011
011	What's your problem?! Stay out of my way!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
012	Just calm down, all right? I'm telling you, you can't reach it alone!
013	You never know! Success is all about trial and error!
014	Oh no!
015	More of them are coming... Look at them all! We can't take them all on at once! Not right now, anyway.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
016	You're right. We should retreat while we still can.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
017	Wh-whoa!
018	Look how fast the corruption is spreading throughout the forest! We can't just turn a blind eye to this!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0029
019	Like you said, success is all about trial and error, but we're not gonna get anything but errors if we stay here!
020	We need to retreat for now. Being reckless isn't going to get us anywhere.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
021	Don't forget what's at stake here. We have to find a way to take down those Taurus for good—the world depends on it.
022	Right... Sorry.
023	(I feel like I'm losing touch with myself... Trial and error is one of the fundamental principles of inventing. I shouldn't need a lecture on it from anyone!)	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
024	Judith... Mind giving me a hand?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
