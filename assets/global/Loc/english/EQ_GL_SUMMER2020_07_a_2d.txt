001	Sigh... I did tell Roxanne to entertain Eira and her new friend while we weren't around, but isn't this overdoing it a bit?
002	How did they end up running a food stall at the beach?
003	Isn't it fine? Roxanne's been cooped up all this time, and this way Eira gets to go and see more of the world too.
004	Besides, I can't wait to see her in her swimsuit!
005	I just hope they haven't gotten into too much trouble while we were gone...
006	Why do you always have to be so gloomy? Can't you just look on the bright side for once?
007	Let's just say that my past few... adventures haven't exactly been very confidence inspiring...
008	Anyway, that looks like the stall up ahead.
009	Come now Eira, those are meant for the customers!
010	*Munch* *Munch* ... one more!
011	You've been saying the same thing since a few shaved-ices ago...
012	It's fine, isn't it? She shouldn't hold back on enjoying these delicacies while we're here!
013	Mmm-mm!
014	You've been indulging her far too much, Shion. This is turning into an unhealthy obsession.
015	Nonsense! This is normal for kids her age! Besides, look! We have visitors to attend to.
016	Hmm? ... Ah!
017	Big Bro! Smart Sis!
018	Eira! It's been a while!
019	Ahh, you look so adorable, I can't stand it!
020	... Aren't you gripping her a bit too tightly?
021	Ehehe... Tickles!
022	Hush, I'm recharging my fluffiness meter.
023	... What even is that...
024	Anyway, it's good to see you again Eira... as well as you, Shion.
025	It's a pleasure to see that you are in good health.
026	Even though Roxanne told me you would be here, it's still a surprise to be meeting you here.
027	Well, don't sweat the details... besides, aren't you going to introduce me to your new companion?
028	The name's Blair, State Artificer from the Slothstein Inventor's guild.
029	Oh my, it seems the child has grown a lot since we last met.
030	You've even found yourself such an accomplished partner, time sure does move quickly!
031	What? You've got it all wrong, we... we're not like that!
032	Please don't say such misleading things, I'll never hear the end of it if Roxanne's overly active imagination catches wind of that.
033	Speaking of which, where is she? I thought you were all together here at the beach stall.
034	Pretty Sis... went to forest!
035	Hmm, she said something about going to gather more ingredients... but she's taking a worrying amount of time.
036	Knowing Roxanne, she could be getting into all sorts of trouble by now. Shall we go look for her?
037	Why am I getting a bad feeling about this...
038	That would be a great help. Just remember to actually look out for Roxanne, and not get too distracted by each other.
039	I... I already told you, that isn't how this is!
040	Grr... Soren, your friend is really ticking me off here!
041	Sigh, that's how Shion is. Let's just get going.
042	According to Shion's directions, Roxanne should be somewhere in this area...
043	Nothing seems out of the ordinary... wait, what's that?
044	A small glint of silver flashes amidst some nearby bushes
045	This ornament is part of Roxanne's swimsuit! I remember helping design that piece for her!
046	Did it get caught on the bushes when she entered the forest?
047	Look, there's more on the nearby shrubbery as well!
048	There are scraps of torn fabric too, it's almost like a trail... leading deeper into the forest.
049	Maybe... she was being chased by something?
050	She could be in danger!
051	Arf! Arf!
052	Eh? One of Eira's foxes... what are you doing here?
053	Arf Arf Arfff!
054	Calm down, little guy. Did you get lost?
055	No Blair, he's trying to warn us, look!
056	Did Roxanne get attacked by these monsters too?
057	We can't know for sure unless we take care of these pests first!
058	Already ahead of you! Let's go!
