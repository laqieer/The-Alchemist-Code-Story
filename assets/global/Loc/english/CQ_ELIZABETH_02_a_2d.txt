001	Decel! Is it true that you got hurt?!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0023
002	I'll heal you right away using my medicines!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
003	Hey, wait. Why are you so energetic?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0025
004	Well, sorry about that. I was only hurt slightly. I've already treated myself a while ago.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0030
005	More importantly, the damage done to the enemy soldiers is extensive. I want you to help with their treatment.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0002
006	Of course with medicine that doesn't have side effects.
007	Oh, that's boring and pointless.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
008	Until that finishes, I won't be able to help you out.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0014
009	So you'll help me after I finish? In that case, I'll help!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0045
010	Alright. I'll be treating them over there. Do your best.	VO_desel.desel_battle_0018
011	(There's no doubt that she's talented. She just needs to devote herself to orthodox treatment methods.)	VO_desel.desel_sys_0030
012	Hwahhh! Power! I feel power surging within me!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0009
013	All right! The experiment was a success! The only side effect I can think of is that a strange smell will emit from your body for a while.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0024
014	(Please, just treat them normally.)
