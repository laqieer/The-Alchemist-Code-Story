001	They misjudged their opponent's strength and attacked, only to run away. How disappointing.	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
002	Ah, I didn't want to owe you anything, but...	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
003	Please. That was nothing. Please don't worry about it.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
004	I hate that smile of yours...	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
005	Aside from that, are you sure you don't want to pursue them?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
006	Uh, well, not really. I'll see them again anyway.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
007	Oh my... Is the reason you're here somehow related to them, by any chance?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
008	It's none of your business.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
009	My, my. How cold. And after I went out of my way to help you.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
010	You told me not to worry about it...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
011	I was seen with you, so they might have thought I was with you. This could become quite troublesome for me...
012	...
013	There've been a lot of kidnappings around this area lately. Those guys are probably part of that kidnapping group.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
014	This is one of our main routes. We can't afford to lose business here because of people like them.
015	Kidnappers... They're based here?	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
016	Yeah. I've heard rumors that they've been acting out of spite for me, but...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
017	I guess it wasn't just a rumor.
018	Why, it seems that you have enemies all over the place as well. Two peas in a pod, aren't we?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0002
019	I haven't done anything to them. I don't know why they've decided to hate me for no reason.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
020	That's just how it is, I think.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
021	But still, I can't believe Ankh would allow the man himself to come out after such a rumor.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
022	Ankh did fuss about sending someone else out, but if they've got a problem with me it's quicker to deal with them myself.
023	So there are times when you feel like acting on your own as well.
024	It's just that it's somewhat better to get it over with rather than to linger and wait.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0037
025	If someone else can find the base, all the better. All I have to do is get there.
026	I feel sorry for your men.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
027	You're one to talk. Well, I'll admit, I'm not a good boss, that's for sure.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
028	Still, I don't intend to be a source of trouble to the guild just because I'm being myself.
029	If our profits are compromised, a lot of people will be in trouble.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
030	Not only the Chamber of Commerce, but the people in the cities we trade with and the mercenaries who buy weapons from us.
031	What Hawk said about a peaceful desert might indeed be nothing more than a dream of an ideal world...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
032	But the truth is, there are people who live off of arms deals, mercenaries, and other things that are the opposite of peace.
033	...
034	Peace doesn't bring a happily-ever-after. That's why it's a hassle.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
035	It is undeniable that there is a demand for certain services that is created by conflict.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
036	And it's a fact that there are people who live by fulfilling those demands.
037	Perhaps that's why Hawk's voice didn't reach the people at the time.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
038	No one really paid attention to that... Neither Hawk nor the people around him.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0037
039	I suppose this land is too harsh to have peace. At least, not with the poverty we have now.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
040	Poverty of the body creates a poverty of the mind. It becomes natural to protect oneself with one's own hands, and not depend on others.
041	No one should be blamed for not helping others when they're too busy helping themselves, even if it is disappointing.
042	In this desert, the only people who lend a hand to others are bottomless sycophants or idiots who don't care about themselves.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
043	If there was someone who could roll with the punches and do something with both extremes, something might change.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
044	Roll with the punches and use the extremes...
045	I think you'd be good at that.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
046	Me? Do you think?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
047	Don't you use your brother like that a lot?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
048	...Ramses is inexperienced. He needs guidance.
049	He has spirit, but it can lead him into trouble.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
050	Spirit, huh? The complete opposite of me. I don't think we would get along.
051	In that case, why don't you leave a few more things to him? He's always looking for something to do.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
052	You must be joking. Ramses is nowhere near ready to take on anything I have to give him.
053	He's young. He has a long future ahead of us. We shouldn't let him carry the burdens of the past.	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
054	I suppose you're right. Peace is meaningless if there's no one around to enjoy it.
055	Not that it matters to me. It's someone else's job to figure that kind of stuff out.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
056	Captain Ryle! We've found the hideout of the kidnapper group! Wait, L-Lady Nefertiti?!
057	Good day to you, and thank you for your hard work. Don't mind me. Please, continue with your report.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
058	Yes... W-well, but...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
059	Just calm down. So, what else did you find?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
060	R-right. Proceeding with the report. The group is selling their kidnapped victims outside the desert.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
061	And we're almost certain that the buyers are in Gluttony Foss.
062	Gluttony Foss? Is this true?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
063	What, you know something about this?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
064	I heard a while ago that some desert people are being kidnapped and sold as slaves to the people around Gluttony Foss.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
065	I wasn't able to get any details because the conservatives were being a nuisance.
066	By the way, Ryle, your guild recently submitted several trade-related applications, correct?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
067	What about it?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
068	That matter has been stalled due to the insistence of someone who says another matter should be resolved first.	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
069	That other matter is the resolution of the slave trade problem. If I am a witness to what happens to the slave traders, processing those applications may go more smoothly.
070	You can't be serious.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
071	You are heading for the hideout, are you not? Do you mind if I accompany you?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
072	Suit yourself.	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
