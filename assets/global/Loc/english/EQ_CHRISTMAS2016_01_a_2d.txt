001	Phew! We're finished♪	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
002	It was surprisingly fun. I think it's this scarlet costume that makes me so excited.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
003	Yeah, this costume is really cute as well! Santa Claus is great.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
004	By the way, was Santa always part of your country's culture? Apparently, he's a recent addition to mine.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
005	I'm not sure. I haven't thought about it much. These days they celebrate the holiday in every country.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
006	What about you, Lofia? It's easier to imagine Santa existing in your magical kingdom.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
007	Hmm, I'm not sure when it started. But...maybe that's because Santa actually exists.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
008	What do you mean Santa exists?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0025
009	I mean, for our mission, we delivered gifts to the homes of underprivileged children from different countries, but...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
010	Lustburg wasn't on that list. Doesn't that mean there's someone else besides us who's distributing gifts?
011	Now that you mention it, it makes sense. So the real Santa Claus is in Lustburg?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
012	Really?! I really wanna see him! Please, please! Let's go!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0009
013	Seriously? We've finished our mission, so let's just go home.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
014	Precisely because we don't have any mission, it's the perfect time to go!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0016
015	Yes! Lustburg is close to where we are now! Let's find Santa Claus!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
016	No... I want to go home and have tea...	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
017	How about we go to Buche de Noel, the best cake shop in all of Lustburg?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
018	Ack...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
019	I'll even buy you gingerbread cookies and pudding, you know?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0023
020	Sigh... Fine. I can't win with you ladies.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
021	Well then, off we go to find Santa!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0032
