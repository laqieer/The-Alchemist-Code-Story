001	We could die any time.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
002	Where did your pet kitten come from?!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
003	Kha...! Hrhrmmm! Ha... Whoo...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
004	No pet of mine. She's got her own will.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
005	Don't get in my way!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
006	Sol told me.
007	You don't think your life has any value. That's your will, though. You do have a will of your own.
008	In that case—!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0025
009	Well, we have a will, too. We're looking forward to something! I'm waiting for something!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
010	And? How do you think that makes you different from me.
011	Nng... S-stop!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
012	You child! What do you know?!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
013	There's something you need to do before you can die!
014	If you're willing to try to force us to fulfill your will, then...	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0019
015	You have to tell us what it is, or you'll never be fulfilled!
016	There's...nothing...to say...!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
017	Ah...!
018	I've been waiting for you.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
019	What? For me?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
020	I don't know you, and yet...
021	I've been waiting for so long.
022	Hold on...
023	Because I just happened to show up at a convenient moment? Just so you could comfortably sleep beside someone?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
024	How...
025	...cold of you.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
026	C-cold...?
027	Hm?
028	Always so polite...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0027
029	Haaaa...haaaaa...haaaa... Nnng...! Nnnff...haaa...haaaa....	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
030	Zwei!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
031	So polite... So very... I've been waiting, and you've all been waiting for me, and I... I still...have...nothing to teach you...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0019
032	No...
033	I-I'm so very t-t-tired... She... I...just...wanted...to s-sleep in comfort.... Together...with you. That's...all I've ever wanted!
034	That was all! Such a small thing! So why...? Why...?! Why must I...?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0029
035	We call them dreams because they'll never become reality.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
036	...
037	I won't push you to go on living. I don't believe there's any value to life.
038	There are no words I could say to someone like you who has lived so much more than I have.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
039	...
040	A dried-up flower... Withered petals...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
041	The seeds fall from them, burying themselves in the earth...
042	It's not so bad.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
043	Still.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
044	Everyone has their own issues.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
045	Nothing stays pure. The longer you live, the more it changes.
046	If you keep using the same old rag, it gets dirty and you can't wash it clean anymore.
047	It's just that I can't help but like the idea of seeing that and knowing that I've done everything I could.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
048	Maybe it's not clean and pure anymore, but it doesn't mean it was meaningless. That's a worthy kind of corruption, don't you think?
049	...
050	Can't you at least hang around until you tire of me? That's not such a bad proposition, is it?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
053	That one...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
054	Me...?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0012
055	She doesn't have long.
056	Oh...
057	She won't survive until your dream is realized.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
058	...Yes. And when she tires, she'll need a gentle hand to help her recover.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
059	Besides, she needs more family. A home full of men is stifling.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
060	N-no, that's not true... It's fun.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
061	Of course I'd love for you to do some real work with us, but...I hoped you might be willing to care for and teach her.
062	What was that saying? "Everyone has a right to education"?
063	But you lot plan to turn the world on its head, don't you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
064	But we have to live in it until then. It's better to know more about it, all the better to fulfill our dream.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
065	Just...until I tire of you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
066	Haha. This is where you sleep from now on. Not bad, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
067	Well, Vier?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
068	Mhmm...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
069	I just...can't sleep anymore.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
