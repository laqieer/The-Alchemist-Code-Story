001	Ughh...
002	The guildmaster ran off. He's a fast one...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
003	Curses. I thought I could use him as an informant if he was connected to my brother...	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
004	Hmm?
005	Hey, wait!
006	Oh...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0030
007	You're the guy from before! What a coincidence, seeing you here!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0008
008	A coincidence, huh? This isn't a place that sees a lot of traffic. I feel it is unlikely this is mere chance.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
009	Huh? I guess you're right. It's just that it's so nice out today, I thought that I'd take a little walk...
010	I would appreciate it if you could drop the fake act. It's not even convincing.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
011	Wha...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
012	I can sniff out assassins, you know.
013	Ah...	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_0019
014	I don't plan on just allowing you to kill me.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
015	You've gotta really good nose on you, but you're mistaken on one thing. I have no intention of killing you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
016	And why not?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0044
017	Well, I haven't accepted any contract to do so. I'm not about to go out of my way to take on someone else's extra work.
018	The dirty little assassin has a sense of honor?
019	I don't know if you'd call it honor. I just do what I need to do. I don't bother with anything other than my own missions. That's the way I've decided to live.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
020	Hm.
021	I do what I need to, and that's all. If I don't have to, I don't bother.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
022	(Why did I think about Master Ryle just now?)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
023	That which allows you to stand a head above others is not your fortune, but your commitment to the precepts of nobility and dignity.
024	Hm...
025	Dignity before fortune... What in the world was he talking about...	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
026	Well... That's something I don't know. I just do my own work, that's all.
027	Persistent, aren't you? I didn't think you'd come back for more so quickly.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
028	You might've beaten me last time, but don't think I'll lose this time.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0012
029	Your guild takes on assassination contracts as well, does it?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
030	If one can pay the right price.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0006
031	Plus, if I take care of you now, it would make many things a lot more convenient for me. That's right... You Desert Wings are our competition.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0007
032	I see... So that's what this is about. Tch. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from trash like you.
033	You, over there. What are you planning to do?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1013
034	I already told you. I'll do my job, that's all.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
035	What...?
036	What are you doing?! Ugh. It don't matter to me. I'll get rid of both of you!
