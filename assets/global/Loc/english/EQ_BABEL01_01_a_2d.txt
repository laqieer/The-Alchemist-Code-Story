001	Haaa... Haaa...agh!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
002	Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
003	Ugh...! D-dang it!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
004	You have desecrated the oath we swore, Vettel.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0029
005	Gerald! Stop it! That's enough!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
006	Silence, Natalie. Those who follow me require their leader to have an iron will. I must finish this.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
007	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
008	I have not forgotten what you once said. "I want to be the sun that brings joy to the people in this world." Where is that sun now? How could it have sunk so low?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
009	Heh heh... Y-you never change. Stubborn as e-ever...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
010	I merely live by the oath we swore to uphold. This is the path we chose. For you to renounce it now... You are not the person you once were.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
011	I pity you, Vettel. We were once comrades who shared the same ambitions!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0004
012	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
013	Ugh...! Grraah!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
014	You leave me no choice. Now that you have abandoned the Scarlet Flame, I must reject sentimentality for the youth we once shared and use my blade to sever the ties that bind us!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0013
015	Aghh...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0025
016	Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0028
017	The setting...Scarlet...
018	...Flame... Iron will...
019	No, Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0028
020	We swore to uphold this oath with our lives.
021	All we wanted was a blissful world filled with laughter and joy.
022	No way, this is too lame. Do we really have to?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
023	What do you mean, lame?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
024	Well, I mean...an oath? Really? We're not little kids anymore. It's embarrassing!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
025	What does age have to do with it? It's practically a tradition. Knights have been swearing oaths since—	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
026	Cool it, would you? It's exactly that kind of earnest enthusiasm that I'm saying is lame! Don't you think so, Vettel?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
027	Actually...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
028	Seriously?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
029	Hahaha! Don't overthink it! It's just the three of us reaffirming the values we already share.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
030	But we have to take it seriously. This is how we're going to cement our camaraderie and our unyielding will—	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
031	We are so not on the same page here.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
032	Enough! Are we doing this or not?	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
033	Fine! Whatever!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
034	Let's get this over with before anyone sees us!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
035	Natalie, I'm really not liking your attitude.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0031
036	Uh-oh...	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
037	Come on, Gerald. Now we're just waiting on you.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
038	Ugh. Natalie, we will discuss this later.
039	Oooh, sorry. I already have plans for later.	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
040	Tch. Fine! Come on, let's do this!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
041	We hereby swear to defend the setting Scarlet and hold in our hearts the Flames to manifest our iron will!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
042	Our blades we wield only to protect the happiness of the people!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
043	And I promise to always support these two rash, reckless idiots.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
044	We vow now and forevermore to be the defenders of the Scarlet Flame!
045	Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!
046	I will never forget the beautiful scarlet sunset of that day as we declared those naive, honest words in our youthful folly...
047	Haaa... Haaa... Do not break rank! Stay together!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
048	Natalie! Behind you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
049	Huh?! Wha—?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
050	No! Huzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0032
051	Th-thanks, Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0034
052	Stay frosty. Something is off here... These bandits are almost too well organized. What do you make of this?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
053	I was thinking the same thing. I doubt these are our typical bandits. Did you see that therian's corpse?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
054	It looked like it was instantly mummified.
055	So the target isn't the village, but the villagers themselves?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
056	Brother Gerald! The bandits have surrounded us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
057	What?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
058	How do we get out of this?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
059	We'll charge a single point! I'll pave the way ahead! Everybody just stay behind me!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
060	W-wait a second! There's no need to sacrifice yourself like that!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
061	There's no time to argue! The therian village could be under attack right now!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
062	We must break through at once!
063	You know, I never thought I'd see such compassion from you, Gerald.	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
064	What?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
065	I'm just surprised you're willing to do so much to save therians.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
066	This has nothing to do with the therians. My priority is the mission.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
067	We need a lot more wins to make a name for ourselves as the Scarlet Legion.
068	"We must complete every mission without fail." I know. That's what we have to do in order to keep our promise with Vettel, too.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
069	This has nothing to do with him. Don't ever say that name again.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
070	They're coming!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
071	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
072	I'll deal with them! Everybody, head straight for the village! Go!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
073	Urgh...!!!
074	...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
075	Why did he...? Gerald, did you do something?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
076	Brother Gerald! The bandits heading toward our right flank are down!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
077	It's now or never! Let's go!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
078	Yes, sir!
079	Tch! After them!
080	What luck. It seems that I've caught a few more mice than I expected.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
081	Look! Another bandit down! Over there!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
082	This is the sixth one! Is it the therians backing us up?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
083	Do these look like wounds from a therian to you?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
084	You're right... These wounds cannot have been inflicted by just anyone.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
085	Could it have been the reinforcements we were promised?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
086	What?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
087	The reinforcements from the Holy Guard! Our mission is to defend the therian village until they arrive, remember?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
088	Maybe they were able to get here earlier than anticipated.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
089	If that were the case, we wouldn't have to speculate. They'd come straight to us for a status report.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
090	Well... I guess.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
091	The Holy Guard is supposed to arrive with a platoon. There's no way we'd fail to notice the arrival of that many knights.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0001
092	I see. I didn't realize you were so familiar with the organization of the Holy Guard.	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
093	What?!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
094	Oh, just admit it. You were worried about Vettel, so you studied up on those Paladins, didn't you?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
095	Not now, Natalie.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
096	H-hey... Cool it! Your hair is sparking again!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0026
097	He turned his back on our oath, and ran off to join the Holy Guard, seeking power! I told you to forget about him!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
098	And I'm just saying that's up to interpretation!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
099	From my perspective, it wasn't personal. I think Vettel just figured he could do more for people, like he wanted, by joining the Holy Guard.
100	That's enough! He's not coming back, so it's a waste of time even thinking abou—	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0014
101	Zap-zap, crackle-crackle, buzz-buzz.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
102	Yeah, yeah... I apologize for getting upset. We should get to the village as soon as possible.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0035
103	Yeah. We should just concentrate on the mission.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0037
104	Right.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
105	Brother Gerald! The therian village is right up ahead!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
106	Let's go! There's no time to waste!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
107	What a relief... It looks like everything is fine.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
108	No, listen. It's too quiet.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
109	Excuse me... Are you the "Scarlet Legion"?
110	Who are you?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
111	I am the chief of this village.
112	Oh! Our deepest apologies for being late. We were hired by the chief of Rubalk Village to—	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
113	Oh, no need for formalities. After all... Well. I do appreciate that you have come all this way. You are welcome to rest here before you leave.
114	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
115	A member of the Holy Guard has already arrived, and we believe we are in good hands.
116	He single-handedly routed the bandits that were encroaching on our village.
117	So...the job here is done.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
118	B-but wait! We came all this way—	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
119	Natalie, there's nothing we can do. May we at least have a word with this Holy Guard knight?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
120	He is alone, correct? Perhaps we can be of some help until the rest of the platoon arrives.
121	Um... I'm sure that won't be necessary. Actually, it was the knight's suggestion to let you return earlier than we expected.
122	What...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
123	I believe his exact words were, "There is no need to have unnecessary hands in the pot. The affairs of the Holy Guard should remain our own."
124	And to be honest, if we must ask for help from humans, we feel more secure asking a more reliable entity, like the Holy Guard.
125	What?!
126	Honestly, all of this could have been avoided if the chief of Rubalk Village hadn't gone ahead and contacted you without consulting with us. I apologize for the misunderstanding, but we would appreciate it if you took your leave as soon as possible.
127	This isn't right!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0020
128	...Always the same.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
129	What?
130	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
131	What might you mean by that?
132	My father, who died fighting bandits for you therians' sake, was victim to mistreatment by you lot.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
133	What?!
134	A brother-in-arms of his that was there with him told me none of you said a single word of gratitude, right to the end.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
135	Not even a prayer for the man who died protecting your people.
136	...
137	Let's go, Natalie.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
138	Uh...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
139	This wasn't a mission fit for us to begin with. There isn't a single blade wielded by the Scarlet Legion meant to protect this disrespectful lot.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0017
140	...
141	...
142	Dang it! Dang it! Dang! Dang it! Dang it!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0017
143	Hey. You're sparking worse than me.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
144	How can you be so calm?! Everything we did was for nothing!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
145	Getting so worked up over the actions of therians is a waste of emotion.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
146	Ugh!!! That village chief! And that Paladin! What's their deal?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
147	A Paladin from the Holy Guard...	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
148	"Unnecessary hands in the pot"?! What kind of person can be so dismissive of people they haven't even met before?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
149	I can't believe Vettel could be part of an organization with people like that!
150	Brother Gerald!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
151	What?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
152	Woah, uh... You seem pissed.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
153	What is it?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
154	We found another dried up therian corpse. We just figured we ought to report it.
155	Another corpse...	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
156	Ugh! And we haven't even gotten to the bottom of this mystery! This is so frustrating!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
157	Let's check it out.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
158	Uh...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
159	I have a feeling that whatever the bandits are after and...the reason my father had to die...are related.
160	Well...we do have a bit of free time on our hands now.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
161	Then I can no longer be a mere spectator.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
162	?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
163	This world is on the verge of great reform. Interference at this time is most undesirable.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
164	It would be wise to eradicate a future hindrance.
165	Who are you?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
166	Are you the one in command of the bandits?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
167	Heh heh...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
168	Heads up!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
169	Be grateful! It is an honor to lose your life to the same hands that will shape the world's future! Dark Bringer!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
170	What?! Everybody get back!!!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0022
171	Oh? A bold choice to stand your ground rather than to run. Bold, indeed...but wrong, of course.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
172	...?! Aghh!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0025
173	Gerald!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
174	Urgh! This can't be! What are you?!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
175	I...? Heh. I am the one that will lead this world into the future. You should consider yourself lucky to be cut down by my blade.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
176	Urgh...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
177	Gerald, get out of there!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0028
178	Perish before my regal grandeur!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
179	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0032
180	My, my...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
181	Ugh! Ngh...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
182	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
183	What a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect that your skill would be such that you would be able to halt my blade. However...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
184	Wh-what is this power?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
185	This is the true power of a supreme ruler. I have the strength to be the messiah this world needs!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
186	Supreme ruler...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0025
187	Heh heh... Those therians were quite fortunate to have the chance to be a part of the formation of my legacy.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
188	That power... The therians?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0020
189	So the therians themselves were the target?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
190	I tire of this. The dead have no need for answers. Die!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
191	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
192	How...?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0026
193	For this...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
194	What?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
195	To drain the blood of therians? My father died...for this?
196	Gerald...
197	What of it? Heh, a shortsighted fool could never understand how this po—	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
198	Silence!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0001
199	?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
200	Well, well. Very impressive. I never thought a simple mercenary would have such strength concealed.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
201	We are no ordinary mercenaries! We are the Scarlet Legion!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
202	A legion built on iron will that will someday bring light into this world!
203	Oh...? Iron will, you say?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
204	What?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0021
205	Whoa! Wh-what the...?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0026
206	Where did that come from?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
207	It seems my other prey has finally made its move.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
208	Prey?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
209	I sensed it every time I approached you. It has yet to show itself, but...it seems to object to our encounter.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
210	Uh...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
211	Hey, wait! Where do you think you're going?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
212	Where there is light, there is also shadow. It should be interesting to leave a challenge such as you on my path. I shall remember you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
213	Wait!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
214	Ugh!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
215	A-again?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0026
216	Haaa... Haaa... He got away again!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
217	You?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
218	Vettel? Is that you?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
219	Oh... Hey. It's been a while. Never thought I'd meet you guys here.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
220	That attack...was you? What is going on here?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
221	Nothing that concerns you. You should all leave.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
222	What...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
223	You've seen what he can do. This is beyond you all. Withdraw from this case.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
224	You have no right...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
225	Wait! The Paladin from the Holy Guard... Was that...?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
226	Yeah. I don't need anybody that will weigh me down.
227	I asked the chief to drive you away, but I didn't think you guys would end up in battle here of all places.
228	Why, you insolent...!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
229	You're lying! Even that strange man was saying that you've been trying to keep us away from him!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
230	You're just trying to protect us, aren't you?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
231	No... I simply don't have time to deal with weaklings that would just get in my way.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
232	You're lying. You have to be lying! This isn't like you, Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
233	Just say it! You're trying to protect us from that man! Right?!
234	Natalie. Stand back.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
235	Uh...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
236	You must pay for your transgressions against our oath.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
237	Gerald?! What are you talking about?	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
238	Natalie, it's fine.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
239	Vettel?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
240	Sometimes, this is the best way to make ourselves understood. Right, Gerald?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
241	...Exactly.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
242	Haaa... Haaa...agh!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
243	Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
244	Ugh...! D-dang it!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
245	You have desecrated the oath we swore, Vettel.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0029
246	Gerald! Stop it! That's enough!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
247	Silence, Natalie. Those who follow me require their leader to have an iron will. I must finish this.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
248	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
249	I have not forgotten what you once said. "I want to be the sun that brings joy to the people in this world." Where is that sun now? How could it have sunk so low?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
250	Heh heh... Y-you never change. Stubborn...as ever.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
251	I merely live by the oath we swore to uphold. This is the path we chose. For you to renounce it now... You are not the person you once were.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
252	I pity you, Vettel. We were once comrades who shared the same ambitions!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0004
253	Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
254	Ugh...! Grraah!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
255	You leave me no choice. Now that you have abandoned the Scarlet Flame, I must reject sentimentality for the youth we once shared and use my blade to sever the ties that bind us!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0013
256	Aghh...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0025
257	Vettel!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0028
258	What's the matter? Is that all you've got?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
259	Gerald, please stop! This isn't the time for this!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
260	What are you on about?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
261	Vettel was defending the village alone!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0003
262	If he's here, then the village is vulnerable! What if the bandits attack?!
263	Now that their commander has fled, I doubt the bandits will return.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
264	Besides, the Holy Guard should be arriving soon. Leave it to them.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
265	But still...!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
266	The Holy Guard are not coming.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
267	What?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
268	We received information that Gluttony Foss is making a move.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
269	No... You mean Wratharis in danger of another invasion?! Is this going to be another Thousand Nights?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
270	We're not sure. The Holy Guard has been ordered to stand by on high alert. They can't leave their stations.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
271	So they've just forsaken the therians?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
272	If that's the case...then what are you doing here?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0044
273	...
274	Speak. There's no point in keeping your secrets.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
275	I just can't ignore people in need of help, even if the government has other priorities.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
276	So you disobeyed orders and left your post?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
277	If it were just some bandits, the villagers could have held their own. However, these are no ordinary bandits.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
278	I noticed that as well. Their organization is not typical of mere bandits. What exactly is happening here?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
279	Their swordsmanship resembles that of soldiers from Wratharis...
280	I haven't found anything definitive. That said...there is a rumor among the Paladins that someone is draining the blood of therians for Alchemia Particles.
281	Alchemia Particles?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
282	A substance said to be the source of Alchemy.
283	That man was using...So that's what the source of his power was!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
284	I guess now we know why the bandits were targeting therians.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0045
285	We were commissioned to protect the therian village from bandits, but then we received orders to stay put...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
286	But it's just not in me to stand around and do nothing.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
287	I never could have guessed you guys would be here.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
288	So you disobeyed orders and slipped away. How irresponsible. You are aware of the punishment for insubordination, are you not?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0045
289	I bet you didn't expect that Gerald has been spending his time studying the Holy Guard because he was worried about you.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
290	I told you, that's not how it is!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
291	It is possible that they are right... It makes sense logically that the big picture should matter more than individual concerns.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
292	What...?
293	Unfortunately, on a personal level, I cannot handle the hypocrisy of claiming to be righteous while leaving vulnerable people to die.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
294	Even if they say I'm being naive... Even if preventing the threat of Alchemy should take precedence...
295	I just can't seem to force myself to prioritize the greater good, because I want to fight for the happiness of the individuals around me.
296	Wait... Don't tell me... Did you quit the Holy Guard?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
297	...
298	...Foolhardy as ever, aren't you?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
299	Actually, we fools prefer the term "stubborn."	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
300	Heh... You never change. Always thinking about others. You have always been the smarter, more compassionate one between the two of us.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
301	Flattery will get you nowhere. Your entire legion of people, though...that's a whole different story. Gives your words a little more weight than they used to have.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
302	Heh.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0008
303	Listen up, everyone! From here on out, Vettel here is a member of the Scarlet Legion! Be gentle with him when teaching him the ropes!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
304	Wh-what?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
305	Where else is a disgraced knight like you going to go?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0001
306	Gerald, you're a saint! What do you think...Vettel?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0046
307	Uh, but...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
308	Also, I would like for you to take my place as the leader.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
309	Wha...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
310	...?! But that's...!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
311	Listening to you has made it clear you're the better fit to lead the Scarlet Legion into the world.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
312	I am much more suited to just swinging my blade around, vanquishing our enemies.
313	W-wait a minute! You want Vettel to be our new leader?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
314	Exactly. Does anybody object?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
315	Yes!!!
316	What?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0026
317	Heh... Hahaha!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
318	Hahaha!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
