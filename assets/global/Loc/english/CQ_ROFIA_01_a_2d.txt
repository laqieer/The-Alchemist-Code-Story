001	(I wish this time of reading books could continue, but...)
002	(I think I'm starting to crave something sweet.)
003	(What should I eat as a dessert today?)	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
004	Do you have some time to spare, Court Mage Lofia?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0003
005	...What do you want?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
006	An old man like me is out of touch with today’s pop culture you young folks like!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
007	I see. I'm busy right now.
008	Oh, you really are adorable, Lady Lofia. You look just like my granddaughter.
009	... ...
010	Although from your maturity, I think my granddaughter is somewhat more mature than you, in her way of thinking...	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
011	... ...
012	Hohoh. Don't worry too much about it. You still haven't hit the full extent of puberty yet.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
013	Would you please shut up and leave?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
014	Wow. Despite my age, I feel crushed.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0020
015	All I wanted to do was take some tea with you, Lady Lofia.
016	As you can see, I also have souvenirs.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
017	That thing that Michael just pulled from his breast pocket...that sweet scent...it's a muffin!
018	Do you like sweets?
019	I don't think many people hate them.
020	(Ohh...it smells so delicious.)	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0024
021	Sweets have the effect of stimulating brain activity.
022	I see. Well then, I guess I'll accept some.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0023
023	Huh?
024	Umgf... So good!
025	...!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
026	Well, what a perfect amount of sweetness. I can feel my brain already becoming stimulated.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
027	(Ack! He's making fun of me on purpose! What a mean old man!)	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
028	Well, actually I have more. Would you like some?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
029	I don't want something you pulled out of your breast pocket that probably stinks like an old man!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0018
030	Oh...well, that's highly unfortunate. After all, I went out of my way to purchase them.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0018
031	Bad news, Lady Lofia and Lord Michael! The enemy have surrounded our special forces!
032	Understood. I'll go immediately.
033	Seriously, they're a bunch of ruffians. Let's quickly finish them off and have tea.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0016
