001	The village of Lezario. Mansion of Chief Adone of the Toxotes tribe.
002	Tina...have you performed the Ritual of Baptism?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
003	Yes. I met Asena and received guidance as a shaman.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
004	Ah. So you finally inherited the role as chief! Adone...a weight has been lifted from your shoulders.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0009
005	And...what was the color of your soul?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
006	Well...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
007	The color of her soul...? Why do you ask such things?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
008	Our tribe belongs to the Water Sprite Voda.
009	Of course, it should be blue like water, correct?
010	... ...
011	It was emerald, wasn't it?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
012	?! Y-yes...	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
013	Emerald...?! Does that mean...her power lies within the wind?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
014	It appears so. During our battle just now, I could feel a holy wind within Tina.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
015	W-wait! A wind shaman?! How is that possible?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
016	I'm surprised as well. Who would've thought...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0031
017	Ever since the destruction of the Alize people, none have appeared in this world.
018	What is going on? If that is true, word of this cannot be kept to our tribe alone!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
019	This is something that may very well shake the future of each tribe...of all of Saga itself!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
020	Calm down. News of this has still not gone out to the world.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
021	But...!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
022	Father...I...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
023	Destiny guides you. Very well...retire for now.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0006
024	Oh! Please, wait! There is one thing I must tell you!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
025	At the place where the Ritual of Baptism was held, I received another strange revelation!
026	Another strange revelation...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
027	Yes! Most likely, what I saw was the not-so-distant future of Saga. It was a land burning in flames!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
028	Burning in flames...?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
029	There I saw the tribes of Saga clashing with one another.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
030	The forest...the prairies...all of it was burning...
031	And then...I saw something terrifying...something that I never thought could exist in this world.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
032	What the...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
033	It was a dragon!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
034	A single gigantic dragon...was crying out amidst the burning land!
035	Are you saying that's the future of Saga?
036	Yes...that's what I was told.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
037	A dragon! Could it be...the work of the Tehre?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0029
038	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
039	The Tehre, the earth shamans....I'm saying that it may be them who's behind it!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
040	Right now, they are actively breeding and feeding dragons. They use Port Nahema to then ship them off to different countries!
041	They are a greedy bunch who are willing to twist the laws of nature to wield those once-feared dragons as a business device!
042	Elder...we are not certain of that yet. Do not rush to judge.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0022
043	But...!
044	If this land were to become scorched earth, they would suffer the same damage we would. I doubt they would do something so self-destructive.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0031
045	For starters, let's investigate the Tehre faction’s movements.
046	Understood...
047	The once extinct power of the wind has once again appeared in this world. That may hold some deeper meaning...
048	If so...that revelation you saw...
049	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
050	The invasion of Gluttony...the bird of a wind shaman...and that revelation you saw...
051	In any case, we must deliver a report to the Sprite Trio. Leave the rest to us.
052	Very well. Excuse me.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
053	Sigh... It looks we've got trouble ahead.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
054	Tina! Tina!
055	...! What's the matter...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0006
056	There's a strange creature in the village!
057	Glurp...glurrpppp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
058	Ack...no way!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
059	Glurp...!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0022
060	What is going on?! They've never attacked the village before...why now?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
061	Glurp...! Glurrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_b
062	Huh...?! Wh-whoa...?!
063	I won't make it...! Don't touch that!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
064	Whaaaaa!!!
065	Ack...! Horaaahhhhh!!!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0032
066	Gurrr...!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0026
067	Who are you?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
068	Th-thank you, sir...!
069	Agh...! A-are you okay?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
070	Did the Jam get you?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
071	Ti-Tina...everyone is still outside the village!
072	Ack...take me!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
073	Okay!
074	I'll go too!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
