001	Hey, Letitia?
002	Yes, Zahar?
003	What's this?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
004	That's an Obsidian Star.
005	What's an Obsidian Star?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
006	Well, a giant tree known as Sephiron once grew in the vicinity of this forest.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
007	I know that. I read about it. They called it the Tree of Life.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
008	That's right. Well, these dark stones are a material known as Sephirium, formed by the Sephiron's sap.
009	Sephirium? But the book I read said that stuff glowed blue.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
010	It normally does. The Obsidian Stars are mutations.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
011	Mutations?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0044
012	In fact...
013	It is said that this substance was created when Sephiron was corrupted. The impure sap that flowed from the great tree solidified into these stones.
014	Impure sap? So this glossy luster comes from corruption?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
015	Yes... It is quite pretty, isn't it? Hee hee.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
016	Impure sap... What a fitting substance for the two of us to pursue.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
017	Eh, sister?
018	Indeed, Zahar.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
019	Lord Zahar! We've found them.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
020	Hah. Good. Dig them up and we'll bring them back to our base.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
021	Yes, my lord!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0002
022	Aaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
023	Wh—?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
024	H-help me!
025	That's...!
026	The corruption sealed within the Obsidian Stars.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
027	Is that possible? I had no idea...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
028	It would seem so. The corruption must be reacting to the darkness within us.
029	Haha. Interesting...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
030	Lord Zahar? What are you—?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
031	Heed me, Corrupt Darkness! Your power will be mine!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
032	Lord Zahar!
033	Ngh! Aaaaaaaaaarghh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
034	Foul creature of sin...
035	Foul creature of sin...
036	Foul creature of sin...
037	Is this... the voice of corruption?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
038	Zahar...
039	You! You're the High Elf I killed in the mansion.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0001
040	Filthy half-elf! Unforgivable! You will not get away with this!
041	Oh, Zahar... Corrupt child of mixed blood...
042	Was it not enough to claim my daughter's life when you came into this world a cursed half-elf? What cause did you have to murder a noble High Elf in cold blood?
043	May you rot in hell for your crimes, half-breed!
044	Hah! I thought I recognized that old squawk. You're the decrepit elf who drove Letitia and I from the mansion.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
045	Foul creature of sin!
046	Foul creature of sin!
047	Foul creature of sin...
048	Foul creature of sin...
049	Foul creature of sin...
050	May your sins claim you!
051	Hah! Are these bitter voices meant to make me reflect on my supposed sins?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
052	Haha... Mwahahaha!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
053	Don't be absurd!
054	I walk the path of righteous conquest, the path that leads to the new order!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
055	Mine is the true path! The path that exists to destroy the present and establish a new age!
056	Pronounce me guilty of sin if you wish, but there are those who carry with them my will, and in the new world they will be the ones to turn darkness into light!
057	Corruption? Sin? Bah! Such trifles are nothing to the King of Darkness!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
058	I will devour them!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
059	Lord Zahar! Are you all—?
060	Don't worry yourself, Letitia. This corruption is powerless before my might.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
061	L-Lord Zahar, the corruption is... mirroring us.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
062	Hah! Interesting... We have to fight ourselves?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0044
063	Then come, corruption! Your powers—and the magic of the Obsidian Stars—will be mine!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
