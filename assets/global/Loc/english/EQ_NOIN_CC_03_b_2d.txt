001	You're pretty tough, yourself.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
002	What does it mean to live?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
003	You still going on with that philosophy of yours?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
004	Hmph. Knowledge and words are empty.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
005	Let's have ourselves a race, nihilist.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
006	A race?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
007	Let's see who can reach the top of Veda first.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
008	Luckily, I have a cat with me that'll take care of the rats haunting the tower.
009	I can go with you?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
010	You want to get out of here, don't you?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0037
011	I do! I want to go outside!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
012	Looks like you're getting excited.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0023
013	Heh, more than I thought I would be.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
014	We'll be the ones to topple this world's order, starting with this tower.
