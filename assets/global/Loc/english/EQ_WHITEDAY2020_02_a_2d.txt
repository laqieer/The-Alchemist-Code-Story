001	D-dammit! I hate you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
002	Oh no. They've gone. They seemed upset for some reason... Was it something I've said?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0001
003	Not sure. They were saying something about Valentine's Day.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
004	Is there some connection between Valentine's chocolates and White Day?
005	I don't know. I've been told White Day is when one gifts sweets to another, but...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
006	Excuse me, you two. If I may explain what White Day is...
007	(Well, I suppose that's not necessary as long as the party preparations move along efficiently.)	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
008	No... Never mind. Miss Plumeria, have you brought the sweets?
009	I have! Now all we have to do is make them!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0004
010	Indeed, all we have to do is make... What?
011	Miss Plumeria, did you perhaps purchase not the sweets themselves, but instead ingredients to make them?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0001
012	I did!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
013	And you not only do not deny the accusation, but announce the truth of it proudly. Did I not direct you to the patisserie to purchase the sweets from?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
014	You did! The sweets there did look really nice, but I felt like that would be lacking somehow.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0031
015	Lacking? What could possibly be—?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
016	I used to have this tutor who taught me something I hold dear to this day.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0004
017	Make sweets with love, so they might bring warmth to another's heart. Only then can words locked deep in one's heart be heard.
018	I remembered those words and I thought making the sweets ourselves would be much more meaningful!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
019	...
020	I see. Then I entrust that task to you.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0041
021	(Uh oh, he's clearly not happy. His words are pleasant, but that tone is not. And yet...)	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
022	Yay! Thank you for trusting me! I will do my best!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0008
023	Well, if she doesn't care, why should I?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
024	Anyway, handmade sweets, huh? I wonder how they'll turn out.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
025	Aaaahhh!
026	What the—?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
027	Hey, are you all right?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
028	Ah, I'm so sorry, Reimei. I knocked over a few plates and...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0022
029	This looks like way more than just a few.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
030	And...plates aren't the only things you knocked over...
031	I was trying to put away the plates, and I fumbled a little... I kind of...knocked the tea set off the table, and...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
032	This is...the tea that Ankh brought. Uh oh. He's not going to like this.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
033	I was just so anxious about making this White Day party a success...
034	Hm...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
035	I've always wanted to be helpful to someone and bring a smile to their faces.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0002
036	So I really want this party to go well!
037	Right. But why insist on White Day for that?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
038	Well, that's because White Day is—
039	Hey, watch your step.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
040	Huh?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
041	Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_chara_1010
042	I forgot I spilled whipped cream on the floor...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0042
043	What is going on here?! Oh my.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0026
044	Sigh...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
045	I'm actually amazed how much mess you were able to make in such a short period of time.
046	(This wouldn't have happened if she had just bought the sweets I'd asked her to. Pathetic, useless...)	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
047	...
048	I-I'm so sorry! I'll clean this up right away! I underestimated how clumsy I could be. I apologize.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0035
049	But! I will persevere! I will give my all to make this an A+ party that everyone can enjoy!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0032
050	...
051	I pray you too will maintain your composure, Master Ankh. After all, you are of noble birth, destined to stand above others.
052	As long as you do not forget that feeling of hospitality, then I do not mind.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
053	It is much like potting flowers for the house you serve. Your master may not notice them, but it will be there to soothe their mind if they do happen to see.
054	Always be sure to act for others and not for your own sake. I will take care of this mess.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
055	Oh, p-please, allow me to—	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0002
056	It's fine. I cannot risk you causing any more trouble in the kitchen.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0014
057	I-I'm so sorry.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0036
058	I would appreciate it if you would go purchase dishes to replace the ones that have been shattered, however. We will be needing more than these few that are still usable.
059	Absolutely! I will find dishes worthy of an A+!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0037
060	Great...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
061	Good job holding it together, Ankh. I thought you were going to explode for sure this time.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
062	...
063	Gotta be impressed by all that motivation of hers, though. Can't imagine where it's coming from.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
064	Tch. Who knows? I've never encountered another quite so frustratingly and destructively a hindrance.	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
065	I...see.
066	You seem to be worried for her. I'm surprised.
067	Trying to ignore the sincerity of people like that never really works. They're just too earnest about it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
068	Unfortunately for me, that does not negate how frustrating it is.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
069	Phew! I finally found the best plates. I asked the store to deliver them for me so that I wouldn't accidentally break them again. I think I did well!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
070	Oh, why is it that I make such a mess every time I'm in a kitchen? I've caused them both so much trouble.
071	Still, the things Ankh said... To be sure to always act for others and not for my own sake. He cares about this party as much as I do.
072	Goodness... That's exactly why I can't not do my best to help!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0016
073	I must do what I can to ensure Ankh and the party guests can smile happily.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
074	Excuse me. I'd like to order a bouquet, please. I need a gift for my girlfriend for White Day.
075	Flowers...
076	I know! Flowers! A little bit of extra hospitality for the guests to enjoy!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0045
077	A little bit of floral decorations should make the party venue even better!
078	If I can find some flowers that perfectly display my passion for this party, I can surely get Ankh to smile!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
079	Well then, I must be off to pick some flowers!
