001	On a certain day in 2018...
002	Let's take a peek at the operations team preparing for the combined event, "Phantom of the Kill & The Alchemist Code Summit".
003	They are in the middle of designing a second challenge for your entertainment.
004	Here we are in Kobe!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
005	It seems like we went from the planning stage to the big day in the blink of an eye! Is everything ready to go, Designer?
006	Good question. The stage events and merchandise are all set to go. Should we review the course of events for the quest?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0038
007	Sounds good. Artist should be here soon, too, so we can go over everything together!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0004
008	Designer, I bought some treats in Kyoto to share with everyone! They make so many flavors, it was hard to choose.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0023
009	Ah! Producer?! I'm so sorry I'm late! Did something happen with the event?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0025
010	No, no. Everything is fine. We were just about to go over the details of the quest.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0039
011	But I must say, you're really excited about these treats. Watching you enjoy them so much makes me happy.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0007
012	Oh, I know! Why don't we work that into the quest, too?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0007
013	It might not get a big laugh, but I can just see it now! The curtain rises, and Artist says, "I brought treats!" Thus, the enemy is charmed! I like it!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0045
014	Oh, so there's going to be stuff like that in the quest, too, huh? Charmed...is kinda an embarrassing way of putting it, though...
015	It's fine! Don't worry about it! It'll be great! It's just another one of those quests where you're encouraged to protect Artist.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0008
016	We've already decided that a charmed enemy will be attacking you, Artist. I'm just glad we finally found a reason for them to get charmed in the first place.
017	A quest where everyone protects me... Even though I knew it would be that kind of thing, I still feel like I need to apologize to everyone.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0028
018	Well, that's the whole plot device of this quest.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
019	If you defeat Artist, then Designer will be upset and say something like, "How could you?!" and probably get a massive power up!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
020	Yeah, and if Artist is all right, she'll just come back as if nothing happened.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0011
021	But Designer will just show up again. That's what happened in the last one! That's boring. Can't we have something more, well, sensational?	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0003
022	Sensational? If we think about it like a content creator would, then... How about, "Vampire and Zombie"?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0029
023	Okay. So what you're saying is that we'll come out at the same time. Something like... "The Vampire can't be defeated while the Zombie is protecting it."	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0045
024	Those would be our PR ambassadors? They don't seem fitting with TAC.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
025	A vampire, a zombie, and Designer? That's a bit of a heavy responsibility, isn't it?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0024
026	Then, when you defeat the three of them, that's when Producer will appear, right? Some smaller enemies were supposed to pop up alongside him, but maybe we could change that, too.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
027	Maybe a random TAC celebrity could appear. They're all really busy, so you never know who's going to show up.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0023
028	Don't forget about Director Ratty! He could give me a buff that makes me super strong, or something cool like that!
029	I guess he could cast a buff that can't be dispelled.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0045
030	Yeah, like a final boss!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
031	So, if they can defeat Director Ratty before the balance adjustment is complete, I'll be weakened.
032	It would be cool if my business cards contained Mementos and Vision Abilities so people with my cards could use them in battles.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0007
033	You two could cheer on the player and get them all fired up when they use the Vision Abilities!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
034	All right. Got it.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0018
035	Come to think of it... I'm pretty sure that there were two requirements to get that business card, right?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0001
036	Exactly. The first requirement has already been announced on the official TAC Twitter account.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
037	There is a tweet using the hashtag "TAC Producer Business Card Campaign" that people will need to have pulled up on their screens.
038	We could make a hashtag with a message written backwards! That'll give you the password for step two!
039	I see... Got it. I'll make sure all the staff know about it.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0044
040	All right, I'm counting on you! If they can defeat me in the quest, they'll get a very exciting reward.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0041
041	You can get a Lion Set and Enchantment Coins, right?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
042	Players will still be able to collect coins for the Enchanted Jobs for a while, too! I'm really excited about it, myself!
043	Right! I wouldn't let them make the rewards smaller than they were in the last one!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
044	(Is it okay to give out so much? I'll have to check.)	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0030
045	Anyway, I guess that's about it for this quest, right?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0005
046	Um... Well, since we're going to Kobe and all... You know what they say! When in Rome, do as the Romans do!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
047	When in Rome...?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0025
048	Wh-what do you mean?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0025
049	Let's go Kansai style!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0008
050	That's a great idea! Atmosphere is important, after all. We should change how we talk, and our outfits and stuff.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0003
051	I'll have to check the script, but I bet the costumes will be good.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0031
052	Something like this, maybe? Don't I look elegant?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
053	Looks great! We should start looking for something to wear, too!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0023
054	Hm... The size is right, but aren't they a bit too much?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
055	Not at all! You look all wild and cool!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0023
056	If you say so... Wait, Producer hasn't come back yet?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0016
057	So this is... I don't think I'm allowed to say their name...but doesn't it look like a certain someone's clothes?
058	Whoa! That's even flashier than I am!
059	You can tell whose it is just by looking at it! All that red and white... It's really impressive!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0024
060	Heh, even if it's just a rehash of the last live event's outfit, it still feels brand new!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
061	We're gonna make sure that this second TAC Live Event has a unique sense of drama, and an interesting strategy worthy of our audience!
062	Got it!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0037
063	I'll do my best this time around, too!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0004
064	That's the spirit! Let's do this!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0041
065	I'm going to go and let them know about the changes to the quest. There's still time... I hope.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0005
066	Okay. If they need anything from us, let us know! We'll do our best!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0037
067	We went to a lot of trouble to make this villain fight. I won't be satisfied unless it's at least a little bit more interesting than last time.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0007
068	The quest we just hashed out definitely sounds like it'll be more interesting. Well, Artist, good luck with the event!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0041
069	Okay, you too! I'll give it everything I've got!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0037
070	And there you have it! This will be the operations team's second official TAC challenge!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
071	We've done our best to scatter hints throughout the story this time around, too!
072	Battles even fiercer than the previous challenge await.
073	Alchemists! Accept our challenge, and follow the trail of clues we have left for you to beat The Alchemist Code's operations team at their own game!
074	We'll be there to support you as best we can!
075	Oh, and we really tried to make it Kansai style, too, but please forgive us if we failed!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0011
