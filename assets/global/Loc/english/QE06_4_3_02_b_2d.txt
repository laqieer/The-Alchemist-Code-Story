001	Ngh! How do you know that technique?! How can you?!
002	The lost art of Kagutsuchi. Particularly effective against demons...and already used once before to cast you out.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
003	Do you remember that?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
004	That red hair...!
005	Hyaaaaaah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
006	Whoa! That Kagutsuchi technique sure is somethin' else! With just one strike, Tamba's been slowed to a crawl!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0046
007	We might actually have a chance now!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	How's the rookie?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
009	She overdid it a bit while she was channeling us into the dagger, so it might be a while till she's back on her feet.
010	Hmph. Well, she revived Kagutsuchi. That's the accomplishment of a lifetime. Let's show this demon his place, shall we?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
011	That swordsmanship... It's like I'm looking at Lady Celis! Did you...?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
012	Yeah. My father taught me how to fight, but now it's my mother who helped me train. You can thank Amane for giving me that chance.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
013	Amane helped me discover what ties me to Wadatsumi, and got me fully committed to doing whatever I can to protect the way of life here!
014	I pray for the safety of all! For all of Wadatsumi!
015	Logi, wait!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
016	Amane?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
017	Hey, now! Little dizzy, ain'tcha? You shouldn't push yourself like that. We got this!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0014
018	Don't worry about me. I won't be passing out anytime soon.
019	Have you come to die as well?
020	I have no such plans for that, either. Listen, Tamba.
021	I want to protect you as well—your way of life. Your memories and feelings. I know how much you cared for the twins born to Koga and Kaede.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
022	Was the time you spent with them not precious to you? I know it must've been. And that alone proves that humans and demons can get along.
023	Haven't I told you never to speak those names?!
024	Do you really wish to go down this wicked road, Tamba? To mindlessly kill others while you, yourself, wither away?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
025	Agh! I said shut up!!!
026	…Ghah!
027	Jubei! The blade!
028	!!!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
029	Now, Logi! Direct your Kagutsuchi at Sumeragi!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0002
030	Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
031	Ohh! Sumeragi is reacting! Kagutsuchi's flames have made it shine even brighter!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0023
032	...!
033	We've reunited the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi. But this time, it's not to vanquish demons, it's to restore Wadatsumi to its rightful state of being!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
034	We're not here to fight you. We want to bring back the Wadatsumi you once knew: a place where humans and demons could live alongside each other in peace.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
035	And I won't let you get in the way of that! No matter what!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0014
036	Enough of your nonsense!
037	...!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0019
038	The sword might've been amplified, but that means nothing if the blade and its wielder are not in sync. So much for your little revival!
039	I'll be taking back my horn now.
040	Crap! What do we do?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0029
041	Amane...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
042	Tamba is very close to Sumeragi right now. This might actually be our chance.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
043	Let's be reckless one more time. If I lose consciousness here, I'm trusting you to handle things until I wake up again, okay?
044	Wait... You're serious? You're going to do it again?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
045	The thing I'd like to connect to is right in front of my eyes. If I try hard enough, I think I can pull it off.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
046	Is that...Alchemy?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
059	You fool! You think you have even the faintest chance of striking me down?!
060	I have no intention of striking you at all. Jubei, please hand me Sumeragi.
061	Huh? Do you have a plan?
062	What are you up to now?!
047	Humans and demons can live together, and I'm going to prove that to you right now!
048	!!!
049	What is this place?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
050	I don't know where I am, but I can still feel your presence. Stop this trickery at once!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
051	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0004
052	I know that technique, Amane! It won't work on me!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0042
053	Sorry, but I'm afraid that's not my name.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
054	...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
055	I'm Mikaboshi.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
056	And I'm Sumeragi.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
057	It's been a long time, Uncle Tamba.
058	...!
