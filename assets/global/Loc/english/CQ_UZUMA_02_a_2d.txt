001	Phew... Thank you so much for all your help. It seems that I am not yet strong enough on my own...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043
002	Hmhm. No need to thank me. Protecting you is simply one of the duties I am obligated to carry out in my position.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
003	Besides, I have personal reasons for wanting to help you. No one else can do what you can do. Your skills as a fortune-teller are indispensable.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0008
004	In fact, that is what I would like to speak to you about. Would you mind terribly if we discussed this right away?
005	What...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
006	I have some need of your gift. I hope the location is not a deterrent.
007	My...gift?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
008	If you mean fortune-telling, then it’s no problem for me to do it here. You seem to be in something of a hurry, after all.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0038
009	I appreciate your cooperation. Hmhm. I was hoping that you would help me find somewhere in this desert with an abundance of Alchemia.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
010	A place with an abundance of Alchemia? All right, let me see...
011	What...? No... This can't be...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
012	Whatever is the matter?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
013	I've found a place with sparkling sands, but... Nefertiti, are you planning to go there if I tell you where it is?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
014	Are you suggesting that there is some kind of issue with me doing so? I see that you are reluctant to speak of it, but please do go on.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0045
015	Lady Nefertiti, I see a dark shadow. The shadow of death draws closer and closer to you...
016	I have never told a fortune that didn't come true. I really think that you should avoid this place.
017	Oh, my! Then it seems I must hurry. Thank you for the warning, dear.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
018	Lady Nefertiti! Why are you so determined to go into danger alone?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
019	It is the duty I was born to fulfill. I cannot allow anyone else to be dragged into it.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0003
020	Your duty? Oh... To protect the desert, you mean?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
021	I don't know if it will help, but...
022	At the very least, as one who resides in the desert you protect, please allow me to try to do what I can to support you!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0015
023	Thank you, but I cannot allow that. Anyone who comes too close to me will only become victim to the same danger as I.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0039
024	As a descendant of the Sephira, you are far too valuable to lose.
025	On top of that, your fortune-telling skills have the potential to save many lives.
026	Truly? I... I really don’t think that something like fortune-telling could help anyone all that much.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0030
027	After all, what's the point of fortune-telling when there's nothing that can be done to change what has been foretold?
028	I do not know if that is true. I am sure that there are many situations where what is coming cannot be changed, but it seems rash to say that fortune-telling has no use whatsoever.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0031
029	To be able to see the future with some clarity allows for the opportunity to see what can be done in order to change it.
030	You are the only one who can do what you do; giving people direction when they are lost, drawing forth strength from within them that they never knew they possessed...
031	That is your power, and that is why I called upon you, rather than another.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
032	Lady Nefertiti...
033	(There's no way that's true. How can she sound so confident, even though what I have foretold will most certainly come to pass and bring unknown tragedy into her life?)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
034	(Lady Nefertiti is just one person, but now she faces danger alone for the sake of her duty.)
035	(That complete lack of hesitation to do what she thinks is right... It's just like Miss Miuna. If I was more like that, I wonder if I could change something?)
036	Thank you for saying all that, Lady Nefertiti. Shall we get moving? You'll be needing directions to reach that place where Alchemia can be found in abundance.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0037
037	Grr! Grrrrrrrr!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
038	Tsk, tsk. Looks like somebody didn't learn their lesson. Leave this to me, Uzuma. You should escape while you can.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0042
039	(Lady Nefertiti is so capable! I don't want to get in her way... Maybe it's better if I just leave. Oh, no! Why is the shadow around her getting darker?!)	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
040	(I can't just leave her like this! If I stay, maybe I can get that shadow of death to move away from her, like I did for Miuna!)
041	There's no time to waste! There must be something I can do! I just have to believe in that!
