001	...
002	So here you are.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
003	I was thinking about what you told us.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
004	You shouldn't rush for an answer. People tend to lose sight of what is truly important when they charge forward too eagerly.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
005	Though I suppose I am the one that rushed you. I haven't even asked you about your purpose.
006	My purpose?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
007	Why did you seek out the Sephira? Why have you continued to fight as the Blue Tongues?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
008	I—no...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
009	We are searching for Agatha, an important family member.
010	The surviving member of the Wratharis royal family? I have heard that she holds the Sacred Stone Satna within her.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
011	I don't care about any of that. I just need to see her again and...apologize.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
012	I need to apologize for not being able to protect her.
013	Hmm...
014	No matter how much I searched for her, I just couldn't find her. She disappears like mist.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
015	But then I heard that the Sephira have some means of pinpointing the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones.
016	When the balance of the world collapses, the Sacred Stones will gather to bring about the end of an era.
017	I heard that the Sephira have the responsibility to oversee such an event.
018	That's an old legend. Even when I lived, the Sephira were nothing but a shell of what they used to be.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
019	When you...lived?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
020	Sorry. Forget about that.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
021	It is true that we of the Sephira can foresee the whereabouts of the Sacred Stones, however.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
022	If this Agatha is a Vessel of Reincarnation, if she has the Sacred Stone within her, then we should be able to find her.
023	Do you mean that?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
024	Yes, but much time has passed since we lost the great tree's blessing.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
025	To perform the ritual, we must be in the proper place at the proper time.
026	Where would that be?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
027	The lost sacred grounds of my people, the arboreal altar.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
028	I didn't think we'd be infiltrating Gluttony Foss.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
029	I'm sorry to get you involved in my personal issue.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
030	It's not a problem. Besides, we already got you all tangled up in our problems.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
031	Sorry, Tina. I wish I could go with you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
032	It can't be helped. You can't leave the barrier set around this place, 'cause it's keeping your corruption in check.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
033	Not only that, but we are going to cross the Gluttony Foss border. There may be some chaos in the country, but we should still avoid moving as a large group.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
034	Please be careful, Captain Logi.
035	I will. Take care of everyone for me, will you?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
036	Um, I—	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
037	I'm gathering my comrades from all across the desert. I want you to tell them about what is happening in Gluttony Foss.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
038	Do not forget that this is not yet the counterattack. We must be sure that all preparations are made before we act.
039	I need you to provide whatever information you can—the situation in the country, security in the royal capital, the structure of the castle—anything that you can possibly think of.
040	I understand.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0038
041	It would be best if we could coordinate things with the rebel forces in Gluttony.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
042	I'm sorry. I was so busy getting out of the country that I never managed to...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0018
043	I see. Well, we let's just do what we can. Is there anything we can use as proof of our intentions?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
044	What about this?	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
045	This is my family crest. They should lend you an ear after you show them this.
046	Thank you. I'll definitely take good care of it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
047	Let's get going, Logi, Tina. We're going to be heading out to where my people's village used to be.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
