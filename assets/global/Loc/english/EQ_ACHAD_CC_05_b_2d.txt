001	I was stuffing my face with delicious, red fruit. It didn't taste like blood at all. It made my remaining eye sparkle.
002	And all the while, you were watching me, smelling sweeter than any fruit ever could.
003	You showed me a dream that could never come true. No matter how badly I wished it would.
004	And in my state of half-waking, I heard a voice.
005	When are you going to stop toying with the poor girl?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
006	I can't get your prediction out of my head.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
007	I told you, it's hit-or-miss. It might not come true at all.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
008	"In time, the sun will set and the stars that surround it will fall."
009	She wants to be with you, you know. To share in your dream.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0002
010	No matter how unlikely that dream is.
011	You actually managed to make one.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
012	It was a success. We created a lump of Alchemia infused with dimensional power. I've integrated it into her prosthetic eye. You should tell her it's from you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
013	Just me? We did this together.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
014	Surely you don't want to make her feel more indebted than she already does?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
015	Open your eyes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
016	Acht.
017	...
018	Morning.
019	Good morning, Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
020	Hehe. Good morning.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
021	Is her body okay?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
022	It should be; all she did was sleep.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
023	Sleep is good for growing girls.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
024	It sure is.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
025	You know, sometimes you two sound like a married couple.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
026	I was stuffing my face with delicious, red fruit. It didn't taste like blood at all.
027	I've been resting for so long, my abilities have stagnated.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
028	Don't worry about it.
029	Will I even be of any use like this?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
030	Of course.
031	I'm here because I want to fight alongside you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
032	It made my remaining eye sparkle.
033	Then I will become your weapon.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
034	Yours and yours alone. The Templars' Number Eight.
035	You showed me a dream that could never have come true.
036	I'm hungry.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
037	A few months later - Holy Order of Babel
038	And finally, as for the eradication of the Templars...
