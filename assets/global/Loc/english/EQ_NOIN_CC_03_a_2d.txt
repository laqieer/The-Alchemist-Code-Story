001	I have to lay down the law.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
002	A bit tyrannical, don't you think? King of Lost Blue?	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
003	It is. I will force this lawless Lost Blue to its knees.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
004	There are too many empty promises of justice, salvation, and the like floating around here that never amount to anything.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
005	Mm...
006	I can't believe those words anymore. I can only believe in those I see fighting.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
007	Words won't do anything for those who've been ostracized by this world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
008	Not words, not justice, but rules built upon the will of those who are willing to fight.
009	You have the power to make that happen, Dead Nine.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
010	And you have the willpower for it, Rat-Killer.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
011	Hehe, thanks!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
012	So the only thing in the way is that ceiling.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
013	Guys like you make me sick.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0029
014	Only sickening people live here in Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
015	Your kind always talk down to others from above. Is that how all philosophers are?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
016	I just enjoy pointless things. It's pointless to speak of ideals down here. My intellectual curiosity desires more futility.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
017	Things like, wondering what it means to live, or what color the sky is.
018	I...think I understand.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0021
019	Do you?! It's intriguing isn't it? Hey, Dead Nine! You have a good friend here!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0024
020	This is nonsense.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
021	Oh, come on. You can go on forever about your muscles.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0030
022	There's nothing pointless about my muscles!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0012
023	I'm just saying, your ridiculously expansive knowledge of muscles is meaningless.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0010
024	All I hear is "Poop-poop-be-doop!"	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0013
025	Hmmm? A bit fixated on poop, aren't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0024
026	Ugh... Is everybody in Lost Blue so vulgar?	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0019
027	Well, we are at the lowest possible social class, you know.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
028	How far are you taking us?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0027
029	The deepest point. The central depths of Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
030	Don't you want to see the other side of the world?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
031	The...other side?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
032	Yeah.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
033	This is the portal to the other world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
034	What...?!
035	What the—? Everything's getting distorted!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
036	This is like a landing on a flight of stairs between dimensions. Just walk gently forward and you'll make it out.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
037	W-what is this place?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_1028
038	It's so...big!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0024
039	There are no ceilings here.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
040	But...no sky, either. Just a tower.
041	What is going on?! How can there be a tower that huge in a cave underground?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0026
042	You see, Redington City, the city we live under, was once a flying city in the sky.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
043	Well, it's what remains of one after sinking to the bottom of the ocean, at least.
044	Long ago, something caused the city to rise up from the ocean and formed land around it.
045	The resulting pocket below the city is what we now call Lost Blue.
046	There are probably several factors at work that pushed the city back up, but I believe that this dimension and the tower are involved.
047	Mystic Tower Veda.
048	There is an incredibly dense current of Alchemia that can't be seen rising high into the air.
049	And that pushed Slothstein's land up from the other side of the world?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
050	I think so.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
051	The Alchemia circulating through the Alchemy Source is said to be high above in the heavens and the earth itself.
052	That which is imperceptible in the real world is manifested in this dimension as a tower.
053	It's considered to be another face of the Tower of Babel, or a parallel universe.
054	My brain isn't following.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
055	Mine either.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
056	A colossal island that carries destruction. Exactly on point, don't you think?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
057	When the land was pushed up, this dimension couldn't handle the sudden burst of energy, and time-space was torn.
058	It was just a small tear, but that must have become that portal we walked through.
059	Lost Blue's intellectuals have been studying this phenomenon for ages, using stolen Slothstein tech.
060	And so, they've made travel between the worlds possible.
061	I just wanted to see a different view.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
062	Will we be able to see from the top of that tower?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
063	We wouldn't know until we climbed it.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
064	Why climb the tower? Because it's there!
065	Ridiculous.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
066	There is great Alchemical power waiting for us at the top of this other-worldly tower. At least, that's what the intellectuals believe.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
067	Power is everything, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
068	So why not take it for ourselves and flip this world on its end?
069	Heh, that's one futile, crazy ambition.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0020
070	Want me to go bigger? World domination.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
071	Taking on the world with power from another dimension...
072	Pretty cool, don't you think?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
073	Is that why you brought us here?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
074	It's almost impossible to climb to the top of Veda. There are lost Phantoms roaming about, drawn to the concentrated Alchemia.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
075	Very few have reached the top levels of the tower. I've formed parties on several occasions to challenge the tower, but...
076	Heh, and you still want to take on the world? What a laugh!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0029
077	I'm powerless.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
078	Huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
079	Everything in this world scares me. The overpopulated cities, cesspools filled with hate and deceit...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
080	You're scared...?
081	What else can I do but be somewhat pretentious?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
082	I see what you mean.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
083	You say you're the king, the law of Lost Blue... I figured I ought to get the law on my side.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
084	I want you to come with me.
085	Not happening.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0039
086	Should I beg?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
087	You wouldn't.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
088	I can try.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
089	If you want a king to do what you want... Well, you know what to do.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
090	Does it have to come to this?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
091	I hear you're really tough, Dead Nine.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
092	You better let me handle this alone, Rat-Killer.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
093	Okay.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
094	We won't let anybody own us again.
