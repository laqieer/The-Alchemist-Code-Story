001	Oh, lucky! It seems like magil is only inhibited within that facility.
002	We should be able to use Space-Time Manipulation now. We'll be able to fight, too.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
003	It seems likely that was some kind of containment facility.
004	My Spiritbonding also seems to be available to me now. However, we ought to prepare countermeasures in case we find ourselves in such circumstances again.
005	Sure, but we have more pressing issues to be concerned with at the moment.
006	Namely, whether or not there is a hidden entrance here after all, or if it's really just a wall.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
007	Ouch. Where's the faith? Sure, it looks like a wall, but check this out... It moves. See?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
008	Is this...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
009	It's real dark in here. Watch your footing.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
010	This can't be...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
011	These are the same mechanisms as those inside the clocktower...? Minario, how can this be?
012	...This is one of the elements that allows Redington to stay airborne, yes.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
013	However, unlike the clocktower's propulsion unit, this is more of a failsafe mechanism...
014	But I've used it as my own personal hideout ever since I was a kid.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
015	I used to come here whenever things didn't go my way.
016	So what you're saying is that it's safe?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
017	Yeah, it should be. Even my father doesn't know I have a history of sneaking into this place.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
018	That you brought us here means you believe that the mayor really...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
019	Yeah... He's almost certainly in league with Icona.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
020	I'll bet they're holed up in the clocktower right now, plotting how to handle the Cursed Beast.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0016
021	Now that they've gone and made us awaken it...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
022	Speaking of, what's going on with Belphegor?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
023	Exactly! If it goes on a rampage, there'll be chaos!
024	The answer to that lies in this footage.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
025	Is this...image being projected through to us...? But what exactly...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
026	Isn't that...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
027	Is that Belphegor seated atop a vein?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
028	It certainly looks that way. This is the last of what I was able to get my hands on using the connections I have as a Special Detective.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
029	Everyone in the vicinity was swallowed up by the corruption. There were no survivors.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0013
030	How awful...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0021
031	This... Icona did this...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
032	And yet the mayor thinks they can control this somehow?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
033	If so, then it's a false dream. The sheer volume of all this sinful magil... Even that of the Luxuria Belt Region doesn't compare.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
034	How could anyone without the gift of Spiritbonding or Anti-Curse protection even get close?
035	No... If we go by the mayor's announcement, they may not need to get close.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0039
036	How could that be possible? Do they have some way to handle that Cursed Beast without coming into contact with it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
037	At the very least, they seem to think they do. Of course, the official announcement was a little light on the details...
038	So what you're saying is that we'd have to confront them directly if we want to know more, huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
039	I should have known you'd be ready and raring to go.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
040	They have Emmel... They have one of ours in their clutches.
041	Icona was keenly interested in Emmel. It seems most likely that she is being held captive in the research facility within the clocktower.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
042	While we're at it, we can get our airship back, too.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
043	Don't forget they've still got their greedy hands on our Libra!
044	We're gonna get it back!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
045	We'll have to if we want to take on a Cursed Beast, after all.
046	It's settled, then.
047	What are you up to, old dog?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
048	Don't you "old dog" me...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
049	As it happens, we've got all the furnishings to cobble together a few weapons right here, so I'm working on that.
050	Is that so? Then might I put in a request?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
051	As long as you don't mind that I can't imbue them with magic like the Dragonslayer.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
052	Whatever you can make will suffice.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
053	Don't you need to do some preparing of your own, Adaleigh?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
054	Oh, uh, yep! Right you are!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
055	Hey, Nimul, I'm going to need a little time. Say, three hours? Can you give me that long?
056	Sure. In the meanwhile, I'll be putting together an infiltration strategy.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
057	Minario, could you lend me some of your knowledge about the clocktower?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
058	You bet I can! I know a lot about this tower, whether it be its security protocols or a certain bigwig's hidden escape route.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
059	If you think that sort of tidbit could come in handy, there's plenty more where that came from.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0007
060	Hmmm... Just like I thought, a frontal assault would be pretty tough...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
061	This is the heart of this region, after all. For all of us to go charging in headfirst would be quite the challenge.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0031
062	Which is why we'll have to go covertly.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
063	Hm... Resources from across the region are currently being delivered to the clocktower to aid in the effort to control the Cursed Beast.
064	There's an idea. If we conceal ourselves among the deliveries and sneak in that way...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0045
065	Do you think you could arrange for that?
066	As long as Icona is our enemy, they'll know I'm helping you...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
067	But we'll make it work. I have a trump card for crossing that dangerous bridge when it's time.
068	I'm all done!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
069	This is the best I can throw together in a pinch. It'll have to do.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
070	Great, then we're all set. Let's go get Emmel back!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
071	Right. Leave this part to me. Don't you dare poke your noses out from that cargo, you got it?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
072	We're counting on you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
073	Emergency protocols are in effect. Your cooperation is expected. Please present your courier ID for verification.
074	Will this do?
075	...
076	ID verified. You are cleared for delivery. Please proceed.
077	Whew... I'm sweating buckets right now.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0017
078	Gah! It's so cramped! Can't we do something about this crush?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
079	You should be grateful there's anywhere to hide at all. Getting an ID for approval of cargo any larger than this would be a nightmare.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
080	At least it got us in.
081	Right? That was almost too easy!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
082	Indeed. Getting here was far easier than I expected. Is this really the right place?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
083	It ought to be... But like you say, security does seem a little light.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
084	The mayor must have learned of our escape by now... Perhaps we should consider whether this a trap.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
085	Even if it is, what else can we do if we want to save Emmel and put an end to Icona's plans?
086	Minario and I will take the lead from here. Stay close, everyone.
087	...
088	...
089	What's the problem? Why did you stop? You're not lost, are you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
090	Minario, could this be...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
091	Mhmm. That clamor is unmistakable.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
092	The clocktower's interior is shifting around.
093	This clocktower can change its internal structure? That seems like a lot of effort just to ward off an intruder or two, though.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
094	No, that can't be right! This tower doesn't have a security protocol like that!
095	If I were to take a guess... I'd say that this is happening because the clocktower is moving to separate itself from Redington.
096	Separate...? But isn't this tower what keeps the whole city afloat?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
097	If it disengages from the city, won't the city go crashing down?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
098	No, I already told you, didn't I? There are sub-mechanisms all over the city to generate propulsion in the event that the main source is cut off.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0039
099	That will be enough to sustain floatation a short time.
100	But what's the point?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
101	I'd like to know that my—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
102	The point is to generate enough power to capture a Cursed Beast, of course.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
103	Icona?!
104	Hi there, Adaleigh! I've been waiting for you.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
105	What have you done with Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
106	Oh, do calm down, won't you? We went out of our way to give you a warm welcome. The least you could do is show a little gratitude.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0025
107	You set us up to cause the Cursed Beast's awakening! How dare you!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
108	My, oh my. Sorry about that. But you lot are hardly innocent in all this.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
109	Who do you think you are, trying to quell calamities the likes of which you do not comprehend with brute force?
110	Even if it were possible, the pros and cons don't really add up, now do they?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
111	The Cursed Beasts plunge our people into sin, call down calamities upon our lands, and threaten our very existence!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
112	How can you condemn us for fighting back?
113	It wouldn't be the first time humanity clashed with the ecology of other forms of life. We see it happen between humans and animals all the time.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
114	Don't you think it's a bit extreme to resort to eradication as the first means of retaliation?
115	Shouldn't coexistence be the priority? If that fails, then separation of habitats. Eradication should only ever be the very last resort.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
116	If we resort to immediately killing off everything that gets in our way, what would become of the world? Surely you have some idea.
117	So that's your rationale for preserving and using the Cursed Beasts?
118	What greater outcome could there be than if we were to succeed? Better to leave our options open, no?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
119	The future is never certain. In order to forge on ahead, we must have a deep understanding of what we need and don't need.
120	However, how could humanity ever know which is which? What gives us the right to choose? In the absence of knowing, we must hold on to every option available to us.
121	Do you not see that the Cursed Beasts could be something we might need to forge on with our future?
122	Need the Cursed Beasts? For our future...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
123	By the looks of it, the thought hadn't occurred to you at all.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0027
124	So...you're saying that the pain and suffering of those who live in this region means nothing at all if you can harness the Cursed Beasts for your vision of the future?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
125	This region is merely a testing ground. If the experiment fails, it will be tragic, to be sure...but thankfully, there are six other regions to move on to.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
126	You fiend! Do you realize exactly what it is that you are saying?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
127	Oh, yes, but never fear. I have laid out plans for the survivors in the worst case scenario, as it were.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
128	Should the experiment fail, then the people of this region need simply to toddle along to another region that will have them.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
129	And my father agreed to all this?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
130	How expressive your face is, Minario... Indeed, your own father—	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
131	I believe that's my cue.
132	Father!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0025
133	Distance makes the heart grow fonder, my son. Yet I have no right to address you so any longer.
134	I thought you wanted to make this region thrive!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
135	Wasn't that why you imposed such an ambitious drive for production on the surface folk, forcing them to push through all of the hardship?!
136	Is this what they strived so hard for?!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0013
137	One thousand, three hundred, and eighty five.
138	What's...that?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0012
139	That's the estimated number of years required for all of the research projects we are undertaking to come to fruition.
140	Resources are limited. Even the stones of the gods that we mine from the veins will eventually be exhausted.
141	Even putting that aside, the Cursed Beast's recent activity is paring down the number of miners so drastically that the productivity of this region will collapse sooner rather than later.
142	At this rate, one way or another, our research will falter in the near future.
143	We may as well try to use the Cursed Beast's magil as a resource in the meantime.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
144	Yes... A mechanism that converts the endless font of human sin into magil... If we could get our hands on that, our energy troubles would be a thing of the past!
145	If we obtain Belphegor, there will be no limit to what we can achieve!
146	On top of that, the surface dwellers would be free of dreary, backbreaking work of mining.
147	The promised land awaits! We of Sloth will welcome a new age of indolence!
148	Don't you see how impossible that is?! You're pinning all of your hopes on capturing and controlling a Cursed Beast! That's just not—!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0015
149	I'm well aware that it's a long shot. Nevertheless, as mayor of Redington, I have deemed it worth the attempt.
150	I do not seek your approval. The way of Sloth is to revere our research above all else.
151	You...! You've lost your damn mind! Father, please!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0013
152	That's more than enough pleasantries, wouldn't you say? Do forgive me, but we'll be taking our leave now.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
153	Hey! Icona!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
154	Unfortunately, I have a lot on my plate right now, but rest assured that our little welcome party is far from over.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
155	If you're interested in learning the results of our little experiment, all you need do is ascend the clocktower.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
156	I have VIP seats reserved just for you!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
157	Wait!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
158	Nngh... There's just too many. There's no end to them!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
159	Nimul, Adaleigh... Go on ahead. We'll stay here and slow them down.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
160	Aww, we're really doing this, then?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
161	You'll just have to accept it, Mira. Only a few of us can fight at our full capacity right now.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
162	Aww, but if only we had access to magil, then... It's just not fair!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
163	This is just how it is. Get going, you two!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
164	Oh, right! Off we go!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0033
165	Thank you! Minario, you'll have to lead the way for us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
166	Got it! I've got one hell of a reason to sock my father one now, too!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
167	Are they clear...? Very well, then...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
168	I shall put this blade to the test, here and now!
169	Do keep in mind what a rush job it was, won't you? If you're not careful with it, it might snap like a twig.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
170	Then it shall be the wielder's skill that determines its effectiveness... Duly noted. Luckily, that's just how I like it!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
