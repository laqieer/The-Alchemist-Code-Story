001	Rraaaaaaaahh!!!
002	?!
003	Ngh... This is...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
004	We saw this within Mikaboshi's consciousness, as well.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
005	It's the result of uncontrolled and powerful negative emotions run amok.
006	The question is, are these all his own feelings, or were they instilled in him by someone else?
007	Either way, we need to set him free!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
008	Rgh! Looks like he's getting stronger! But we must persevere.
009	Right. We have to get him to snap out of it. It could be a bit tricky, but it's clear that's the right course of action here.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
010	We must do our best not to harm him. For the pride of the Blade Fox, we cannot turn our blades on those who are, themselves, little more than victims. Not anymore.
011	Let's go, Jubei.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
012	Okay!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
013	You good to go, little lady?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
014	I'm going to have to be. How about you, Edgar?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
015	Do you still believe we should've killed Tamba when we had the chance?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
016	What, don'tcha trust me? I told you, I'm fully prepared to do things your way.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
017	I'll fight however you guys want me to. I trust you all. That's why I'm here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
018	As you said, Amane, we need to get Tamba to remember what he wanted to protect. That may be the key to restoring Wadatsumi.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
019	Everyone's put their faith in those words. All our wills and destinies are aligned.
020	You've bound us all together with your words, and we are stronger than ever for it.
021	Logi...	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0002
022	We won't be defeated now. I'll use my sword to carve a new path toward that future if I must!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
023	Agatha, when Tamba lets down his guard, initiate the plan. The rest of us will...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
024	Got it.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0038
025	I'll be praying for our victory. May those prayers sustain our resolve.
026	And I'll be praying for Tamba, too, that he may finally be released from his long-held suffering.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0041
027	All right!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0037
028	Let's free Tamba and settle this, once and for all!
029	It's taken much too long, but now that everyone's thoughts and feelings are aligned, I know we can do this. This is our comeback!
030	Wait for us, Tamba! We'll save you yet!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
