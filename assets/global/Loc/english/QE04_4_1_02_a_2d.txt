001	There are so many of them! Why would the dragon's body be discharging all this Jam?	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
002	Could ingesting Beelzebub be the cause?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
003	Hmph. Did you fail in retrieving Beelzebub, Georgios?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
004	No, I am simply putting my original plan into motion. Your elaborate schemes aren't necessary anymore to take back what's mine. I will slay the dragon and take Beelzebub by force!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
005	Georgios! How could you kill Asena?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0013
006	Bwahahaha! I have no interest in the likes of you. Wind Shaman, your enemy is that thing over there.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0010
007	Gah! What sheer power! Are you saying that you think you have what it takes to kill it, Georgios?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
008	If not, then let me die in the attempt. I confront every foe with the same resolve. The dragon shall fall by this blade of mine!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
009	That sword... Don't tell me you're...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
010	Aye. I am from that clan. We, who have trained and honed our art for generations, perfecting it for the sole purpose of slaying dragons! Allow me to demonstrate our craft!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
011	Behold, the sword passed down in my clan from generation to generation: the Dragonslayer! Here I come, dragon!
012	HRAAAAAAAARH!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
013	He's managed to wound the dragon! What in the world is that weapon?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0022
014	One of the reasons I chose to ally with Georgios was this: his Dragonslayer. He alone holds the power to face the dragon.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
015	WRAAAAAAAAAGH!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
016	Georgios!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0025
017	Hahahahaha! I can slice into its body, but not through its bones! No matter. Being able to make such a cut means...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0011
018	It's mortal! Time to make this thing comprehend that it is beneath me!
019	Georgios! We are not here for your amusement. Have you forgotten what we're here for?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
020	Tch, I admit I did get a bit carried away, but it seems my blade can't reach its core. Tehre, have you come up with another of your schemes yet?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
021	Its core?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
022	Dragons are living organisms, too. Destroying their core will kill them, just like any other being.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
023	However, it is far larger than I expected. In order to destroy its core—	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
024	We will need to do it from inside its body. Reaching its core from here would be an impossible feat.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
025	The only way to enter its body would be through its mouth, right?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
026	But it's too high up, and we'd have to worry about it trying to scorch us with its flames.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0031
027	Then, is there another way? If we don't find another way, Saga is finished!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
028	Getting rid of these should take priority.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
