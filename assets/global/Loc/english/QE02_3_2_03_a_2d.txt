001	These annoying dogs just keep coming.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
002	We haven't finished our conversation! What promise did you make with Mayor Edward?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
003	Seriously. You're annoying in your own right.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
004	I promised her old man that I would solve the mystery of the Sacred Stone.
005	The mystery of the Sacred Stone?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
006	He told me that the Sacred Stone Belphegor is the anchor to quelling this chaotic land.
007	That it has the power to sway this country.
008	He wanted to know if I could uncover the truth behind it.
009	Mayor Edward asked you to do that?
010	Yep. A sort of tit for tat. I ended up telling him that I would solve its mystery.
011	It's not that I have any personal interest in the Sacred Stone.
012	I just need it to fulfill my promise to the old man.
013	You gotta be kidding me! Ahahahah! You're like a little kid!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0008
014	Tsk! After berating me with questions...you're gonna make fun of me?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
015	I'm not making fun of you...hehe...I'm relieved.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
016	Huh? Jeez. And what about you?
017	Your motivation isn't just based on your dislike for Alvarez, is it?
018	Yes, about that...I'll need to clarify that.
019	In order to do so, I'll need to know what his idea of justice is.
020	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
021	I'm gonna step aside for a bit. If you lose sight of the young lady, you'll have a lot to answer for, Tango!
022	He-hey...wait!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
023	Hey! Don just went off somewhere! Are you gonna let him?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
024	Tsk. It's just like him to go off and do his own thing. Never mind him. Let's pursue the little lady!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
025	O-okay...
026	What are his reasons to act? Why is that redhead chasing after the little lady?
