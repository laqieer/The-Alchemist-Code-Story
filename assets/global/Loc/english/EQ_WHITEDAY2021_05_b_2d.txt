001	*Cough* *hack*	VO_izayoi.izayoi_battle_0019
002	Ugh, my nose... This sickly sweetness is making me gag. Are you okay, Tsuru?
003	One way or another? Well that's good to hear. This is a bit tough for me...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
004	Still, that's no excuse. We made it this far thanks to those two making a way for us.
005	This is all the mashiro flour, then? That man told us to incinerate it, if I recall.
006	Okay, Tsuru. Let's light the fire, and head on back.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0037
007	I dealt with way more dangerous scenarios when I infiltrated as the Night Fox, but I felt oddly undaunted.
008	Your faith in me makes me strong, Tsuru—I can overcome and any all obstacles.
009	What? You feel the same, Tsuru? Is that right... I'm happy to hear it.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
010	Just glad I'm not the only one, that's all.
011	Yeah, we'll wrap this up together. Let's go!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
012	...And that's what happened.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0004
013	Boy, that threw me for a loop. Didn't expect it to blow up like that. We escaped by the skin of our teeth!
014	Goodness, what a squeaker. Dust explosions are certainly no joke, are they?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_battle_0019
015	Not exactly the conclusion I'd come to, but to each their own. I'm just glad you made it back safely.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
016	For sure. And for some reason the monsters are all turning back to normal. Maybe 'cause they only had a small taste.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
017	Not only that, we'd captured those hoodlums nearby, so no casualties to report, either. Good news all around!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0005
018	We handed them over to the knights not too long ago.
019	Really? So then that big old estate is practically unguarded...
020	Iyazoi...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
021	Yes, yes, I know. Can't imagine that noble having a change of heart, though.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
022	Still, I'll keep my sticky fingers to myself this time, out of respect to you.
023	Well! I appreciate that, Iyazoi.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
024	(If he tries anything again, Tsuru and I'll be more than enough to take him to task.)	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
025	The marshmallow vendor didn't sell all that much, so those who ate them only became mildly addicted. Thank heavens for small mercies.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0003
026	They'll be a bit cross for a spell, but I imagine eating some sweets should calm their agitation.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0007
027	The fair hall still has plenty of A+ confectionery to go around!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
028	Without the marshmallow stand, the attendees have moved on to other attractions. White Day is just getting started!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0008
029	...Hey pops. Disciple guy.
030	Young master! You've come back to us!
031	Yeah. I still think the old man's way of thinking is too old-fashioned, it's just...
032	It's just, I know our sweets are the best around, bar none. That's why I'll think up some way to get them to catch on.
033	...Gotcha. I knew you were just thinking of the shop's future. Sorry to make you worry.
034	So they've mended fences, have they? You can see the trust for each other in their faces. Yes, yes, very good.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0044
035	I'm sure he'll be fine from now on. Having someone believe in you offers untold strength...
036	I'm sure my tenure as the Night Fox is all thanks to Tsuru believing in me.
037	Thank you, my partner.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0033
038	Wonderful, just wonderful. Look at all those smiles.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
039	Safeguarding the smiles of the people is a tenet of the Night Fox. That'll never change, even if I'm a Phantom.
040	I modus operandi may have been a bit flawed up to now...
041	Still, we'll keep fighting the good fight, and protecting the people's happiness. Right, Tsuru?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0002
042	Oh, what a happy boy you are! Huh? What is it?
043	You were worried about me? Because Phantoms need to cooperate more than the solitary Night Fox ever did?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0006
044	But now you're relieved to see me embrace that necessity...
045	Huh? Now wait a moment, Tsuru. You leaving me behind back there was, what? A test or something?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
046	The heck?! That means you didn't trust me at all!
047	Nnggrrr... Why I oughta...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0012
048	...Hmph. Well I'm grateful you were worried about me, at the very least.
049	You know, I think I'd like to buy this guy some inari sushi after all. There must be some around here... Come on, Tsuru!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
050	Sheesh, not a sensible head among the lot of you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
051	So such unworldly people can survive in an age like this, can they?
052	This world might be changing to one that has need of life-giving swordhands. At least compared to the age we lived in.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0037
053	In a world that needs people cut down, I want to hold dear the strength required not to do so.
054	......
055	Leading the charge wasn't a waste of time after all, then.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
056	Yeah. All the stall wares look so tasty. When our mission's over, we should—	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
057	Oh, there you are!
058	Oh, it's you. What's the matter?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
059	Oh no, I just wanted to talk. I heard from my son that you're a Sosenko swordsman?
060	This is the second time a life-giving swordhand's saved my shop.
061	The second time, you say?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
062	There was a time way back when we were having trouble running the shop, see.
084	At his wits' end, the proprietor at the time tried to mug someone to raise money. The guy was being guarded by a Sosenko swordsman.
063	That man said, "No one got hurt, so I'll overlook this. In return...
064	"Make sweets that bring sincere smiles. I want to protect a world where people can eat sweets in peace."
065	"Don't worry, there's always a chance to turn things around while you're alive. So use it! That's my way—the way of the life-giving swordhand."
066	I dunno if that was your predecessor, a senior disciple or what, but I'm sure they were related to you somehow.
067	That swordsman's attire was pretty shabby, but he was a proud, upstanding guy.
068	You're kidding me...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
069	Welp, I've gotta get back to my shop. Oh right, almost forgot. Here's a small token of my thanks.
070	A coupon for free sweets from my shop. Come grab a bite when you can! Bye, now.
071	......
072	(On occasion, I've wondered whether my values still existed anywhere in this world...)	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0019
073	And yet, here they are... The ideals of the life-giving swordhand, passed down through the ages.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
074	The disciples that followed me conveyed those teachings, which in turn saved someone. It's all connected...
075	(I don't know what's happening in Wadatsumi now, but there must be someone who inherited the ideology of the life-giving swordhand.)
076	(If so, then one day I'll...)	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0005
077	That naivete of yours is infectious; at this rate, we'll run out of people looking to kill others.
078	I bet the anmitsu jelly you could eat in a world like that'd be extra sweet.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
079	Goodness, I feel like I'm always on the receiving end of that guy's help.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
080	Oh, I know. I'll go use this coupon with Reimei. It's just about White Day, after all.
081	I doubt he takes the spirit of White Day at all seriously, but...
082	I'm sure he won't say no to some goodies!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0008
083	Happy White Day, with lots of gratitude!
