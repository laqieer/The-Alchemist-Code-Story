001	Gah...
002	There are so many!
003	Nimul, is this really the right way? There are so many Sinners here... It doesn't seem like the kinda place people live.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
004	I...cannot disagree.
005	No, this should be the right direction. The barrier should be right here...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
006	Here it is! But this...
007	What's wrong?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
008	The magil of this barrier is pulsating. As if something with great power has attacked it...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018

010	Let's hurry.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
011	...
012	Are we too late?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
013	No, just...
014	Even if the dead bodies were devoured by the corruption, there would be more traces of blood.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
015	These signs of life are fresh. Maybe they were warned of the danger and sought shelter?
016	Correct. Originally, we wanted to hold down the fort here until you were able make your way here, but...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
017	That voice...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
018	I commend your return, leader of the Sephira. I, Eulalia, and everyone here have eagerly been awaiting your arrival.
019	And you finally did! It's been crazy over here, you know?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
