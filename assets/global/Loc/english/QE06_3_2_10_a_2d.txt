001	The twins Mikaboshi and Sumeragi?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
002	Yes.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
003	It's hard to believe the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi have such an incredible origin...	VO_azami.azami_sys_0045
004	My first task, it seems, is to retrieve the Mikaboshi. Err, the stone, that is.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
005	That's a lot easier said than done. The Mikaboshi is currently in the hands of Greed Dike.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0031
006	Did I hear someone mention the name of my homeland?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
007	?!
008	Oho, it's just you, then? That must mean the Hidden Ogres were successfully dispensed with. And the base is still intact, to boot! Well done. Well done indeed.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0044
009	How do you know about the Hidden Ogres?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
010	I received news from Captain Ugachi outside. Is something amiss?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0006
011	N-no, everything's fine.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0022
012	What happened with Celis?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
013	Amane!
014	I understand Celis went to meet with you. So, what happened to her?
015	Oh? I had no idea Celis had come to meet with me.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
016	In that case, why are you here?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
017	I'd heard the Blade Fox were taking a bit of a beating, and came to provide aid.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
018	But why now? You've never come directly to Wadatsumi before.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
019	Why now, you ask? An excellent question, I must say.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0044
020	...?
021	We of Greed Dike have conducted extensive research over the span of many eras. And the laborious results of those experiments...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
022	Ghk!
023	...have finally borne fruit.
024	?!
025	Injected not just with blood but with modified genetic material, and enhanced with pure corruption, the very body of the recipient will metamorphose in defiance of all natural law.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
026	By studying that undead state, a means of replicating and thus mass-producing it was to inevitably take shape. And at that point, it was no stretch to regard such beings as living weapons.
027	I present to you the culmination of this project. I call these beings...Dismortants.
028	What in the world...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
029	Now, show me your despair!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
