053	...Ngh!
001	Disappointing. I didn't take you for a deserter.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0016
002	...
003	I can't say I blame you for running away, given the circumstances...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
004	But as Lord Commander, you couldn't have made a more foolish choice.
007	In the name of preserving the balance of this world...
008	I, Irene of Corpse, sentence you to die.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003
009	...
010	That concludes my report, sir.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
011	Thank you. Hm...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0033
012	(This whole thing stinks.)
013	(The Lion Monarch's Charge and the Giant Taurus left the Holy Guard in tatters.)
014	(We're only now getting back on our feet.)	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
015	(But recently, we've been assigned endless archaeological investigations...)
016	(And possible successors to the post of Lord Commander keep getting put out of commission, or worse. That can't be an accident.)
017	Excuse me?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
018	As I said, I believe the time has come for you to step aside as Lord Commander.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
019	You have served the Holy Guard admirably. Brought it back from the brink, even.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
020	But I believe it is the new generation, raised in the light of peace, who must lead the world into a new age.
021	I can't give up now. I still have an oath to uphold.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
022	I admire your dedication, of course, but I must warn you: if you imagine yourself to be acting for the good of all...
023	Well. Then you are gravely mistaken.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
024	!
025	(Corpse must be behind this.)	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
026	Sir? Is something amiss?
027	Hm? Oh, nothing. My apologies. You are dismissed.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
028	Our most promising members fall one by one, day by day, while the Holy Order's assassins prowl around in the shadows.
029	Outwardly we're recovering, but in reality things are worse than ever.
030	If I could just learn to wield Excalibur, then maybe...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
031	...
032	If only you were here, Commander Kanon... I'm sure you would know what to do.
036	There was so much more I wanted to learn from you. So much I still had to offer you.
037	But I can't hide in your shadow forever.
054	The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.
055	I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
056	It's our duty to build the peaceful future our captains hoped for!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
038	On that day, I swore I'd realize the justice you entrusted to me.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
039	We swore to build a peaceful world with our own hands, and thanks to each other, we've stayed our course ever since.
040	So I have to do what I can.
041	I lived in darkness, once. I'll never be pure enough to illuminate it, but I can expose it from within and drag it out into the light.
045	The real question is whether I'm strong enough...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
057	There is no need to dwell on things so.
046	Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.
047	!
048	Are you certain, sir? It's just a routine investigation. We can take care of it ourselves.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
049	Think nothing of it. I only want to make sure we don't suffer any more unfortunate casualties.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
050	I'll lead from the front. I expect you to follow my orders as best you're able, but also to know your limits.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
051	(Now isn't the time for second thoughts. I have a duty to uphold.)
052	(I must realize the justice I was entrusted with, and I must fulfill my oath.)
