001	Damn... It got away.
002	That monster didn't seem quite right to me. What is going on here?
003	It's Rosa's concoction.
004	Mei Fang!
005	The moment you left, that little imp began testing her concoction on that monster.
006	What?!
007	I was intending to deal with her the moment I caught her in the act, but the monster went on a rampage and I lost sight of her in the confusion.
008	It is as you feared. She has not given up on her tincture after all.
009	Unbelievable! With me, both of you. I will not allow such misdeeds to go unpunished, not by any means!
010	This is it! This is just what I wanted. Thank you, Elizabeth!
011	Well, the effects were a little bit more extreme than I'd expected, but that's exactly why I used a monster for my first test.
012	Now that I know its effects better, I'm gonna use my special tincture to dye this year's Halloween red and black! Heehee... This is gonna be so much fun!
013	Not if I have anything to say about it!
014	Oh, my. Look what the cat dragged in.
015	Rosa... There will be consequences for your actions this day. You have imperiled Halloween and dashed the expectant spirits of all the children who look forward to it!
016	Upon my word, I will ensure that the standards of this occasion are upheld!
017	Really? Who jeopardized Halloween for the children first, I wonder?
018	Come again?
019	If anything, I'm the guardian angel of all children. In fact, I believe I am the savior of this entire world.
020	Yeah! Yeah!
021	Wh-what is the meaning of this?!
022	Heehee... The time is nigh. Now we will let loose all we have been forced to suppress!
023	This is a holy war and you are the warriors who will fight it, O Sweet Children of Rot und Schwarz. You shall stain this dark night blood red!
024	So come! Come together, my little ones. We will take back our Halloween...and paint it red and black!
025	Huzzaaaaaah!
026	Trick or treat! Give us our candy or you'll get pranked! Let us stay up late or we'll give your hair a yank!
027	Oh ho. They're quite spirited, aren't they? Their words amount to nothing more than a pitiful tantrum, however.
028	Still, they might have something of a point.
029	What are you saying?! She's turned the children into delinquents! This is bad, but there is still time to make it right. The buds of misconduct must be plucked before they have a chance to bloom.
030	Yes. Staying up late flies right in the face of the standards for this occasion. As their elder, I must steer these children back onto the proper course!
031	You want us to listen to you, but you won't listen to us! Well, if you won't hear us out, then take this! Come out, my little fiendish friends!
032	Numyua!
