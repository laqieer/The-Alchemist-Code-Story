001	You're with the Holy Guard?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
002	Yes, I stand as the Captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
003	Why would you do something like that?! You should know that they're the ones plotting foul deeds in the shadows of history!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0021
004	Of course I know! You see... I, too, am involved in those machinations.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
005	What did you just say?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
006	I am a member of Corpse.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
007	No!
008	Dias! How could you join Corpse?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
009	They're the ones that caused the ruin of Envylia!
010	That is exactly why I joined them!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
011	Logi, this world is crooked. Good deeds bear no fruit while evil laughs from the shadows.
012	To rectify this truth, to change this sad world, we need power. We need unstoppable, absolute power in order to uphold order.
013	I will become the Lord Commander! Everything I am, everything upon which I stand, guides me toward that single purpose!
014	Dias!
015	Logi, my hands are already stained red with blood.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
016	I've championed my own justice and decreed others to be evil. I have trampled over countless dreams and wishes. I can no longer turn back.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
017	Which is exactly why I am the one who can—no, the one who must—change this world! I will restructure this system of life that perpetually gives birth to sorrow!
018	...
019	Take Agatha and get out of here, Logi. Go to Saga or Wadatsumi... Wherever Northern Pride's influence is at its weakest.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
020	Please... Wait for me there. Wait for me to change this world.
021	I will remake this world into a place where the you two of you can live without fear.
022	You know we both want the same thing for Agatha. We both want to protect—	VO_dios.dios_sys_0041
023	No... No!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
024	I can't do that! I, too, have ambitions! Things I've sworn to myself that I will protect!
025	I have comrades who have followed me all the way here!
026	How could I possibly run now, knowing that I'd be leaving them all behind?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
027	I suppose you're right.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
028	Somehow, I knew that that would be your response.
029	Which is why I must do what is necessary to end your career as a warrior!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0003
030	Hah!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0007
031	Nngh! Th-this is just like when—!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
032	Do not be so foolish as to assume that my powers are the same as they were before!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
033	The Holy Guard has taught me all about the power of Alchemy! The art of harnessing the strength of this power is ingrained within my very being!
034	Ngh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
035	This is where your journey ends, Logi! Leave your regrets and bloodshed with me! I will bear them all in your stead, forevermore!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0012
036	That is not for you to decide, Dias!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0017
