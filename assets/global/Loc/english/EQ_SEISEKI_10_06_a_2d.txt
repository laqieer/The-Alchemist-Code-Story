001	I can't believe Captain Yauras is gone...and they've taken Captain Kagura as well...	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
002	... ...
003	If anything were to happen to Captain Kagura...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
004	The only captains left under Lord Commander Kanon would be Captain Othima and Captain Seida. What is going to happen?
005	...What about you?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0002
006	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
007	Kanon always told me that you're always supporting her when it matters, Basheeny!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0016
008	Everyone is relying on you?! Don't lose faith now!
009	...Okay.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
010	Both Captain Yauras and Kagura entrusted this to us! Whatever happens, we have to...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
011	...Almira?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
012	...Hide!	VO_almira.almira_chara_1011
013	Huh? Wh-whoa?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
014	Is that...Greed Dike's main army?! Look how many of them there are!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
015	It's like I can't see where their numbers end... They've increased their numbers exponentially since when we encountered them in Saga!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0028
016	Hmph. You're Paladins, yet I smell darkness within you. What a strange one you are.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0004
017	Huh...?! Get down, Almira!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
018	I see. You've countered my blow. A somewhat worthy opponent for a change.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0044
019	Ack...?! Are you a Templar?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
020	A Templar...?! What are you talking about?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0012
021	My name is Zangetsu. I am who despises Paladins.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0016
022	So you have nothing to do with Greed Dike?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
023	I don't like groups.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
024	I am merely taking advantage of the situation that the Holy Guard has been placed in due to all this conflict.
025	Ack!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
026	The time has come! The time take down the Lord Commander Kanon who stands in my way!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
027	...Where is she? Is she in Northern Pride?
028	D-do you really think I'd tell you...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
029	...In that case, I'll pry the answers out of you.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0032
030	Aghh...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
031	Whoa...?! N-no, you're in front of the soldiers!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
032	N-not good...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
033	Oh? Well, there's a face I haven't seen in a while.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
034	Ack! Lo-Lord Waginau!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
035	Hehe. You're not going to tell me you've decided to switch sides again, are you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
036	Agh! Almira! Behind me!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
037	Hehe. Do you think you can escape an army like this?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
038	Th-this is really looking bad! What should we do...?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0028
039	...Ack...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
040	Hyahah! The once noble Holy Guard and now look at you. How the mighty have fallen.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0008
041	Argh! Shut up!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0019
042	A-a large horse is closing in! It's...	VO_almira.almira_chara_1011
043	Orion...!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
044	Waginau, what are you doing?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
045	Ah! That brat Basheeny, who went over to the Holy Guard's side, is blocking the path ahead.	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0003
046	We're wasting time. Take care of him.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
047	...You don't have to tell me.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
048	I've been told by my leader to take out any who block the march on Greed Dike.
049	Behind us...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
050	Wh-whoa...when did they get there?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
051	Soldiers of Greed Dike, there's no need for you to make a move.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
052	W-who are you?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0013
053	I am one of the Templars...Zehn. In accordance with my master's orders, I will take you out for blocking our path.	VO_zen.zen_chara_1001
054	The Templars! Almira, be careful!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
055	G-got it!
056	... ...
057	What're you doing? Are you dancing around in order to show off your blade?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
058	Does this look like a dance to you?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
059	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
060	...Aghhh!!!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0022
061	Almira?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
062	Wa...was I just...cut down?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
063	It can't be...?! Almira!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
064	How?! How did you get to Almira when she's behind me?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
065	So...you're the one who killed Vier with the help of Monzein?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
066	...!
067	I will not let those who've murdered my comrades survive.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0013
068	Under my iron command...your life is surely forfeited.
069	A-another blade...?! Not good...!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
070	...Grand Cross!!!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0032
071	...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
072	Ugh! You...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
073	Huh? Did you do that?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
074	... ...
075	What are you playing at? I thought you despised the Paladins...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
076	Of course, the Holy Guard are nothing more to me than an entity that must be annihilated. Still...	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0016
077	I have no intention of joining you, Greed Dike. You, too, are nothing more than an entity that must be annihilated.
078	I see. So you turn your blade against us as well?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
079	To begin with, my cursed fate began...when you people destroyed my homeland of Wadatsumi.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0042
080	In other words...your annihilation takes priority over the Holy Guard!
081	Because of your greed, you senselessly destroyed my homeland. Taking you down now...seems to be the most logical course of action!
082	Heheh. I'd love to accept your invitation; however, I happen to be quite busy at the moment.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
083	Never mind. Take him out.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
084	Hmph...	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0007
