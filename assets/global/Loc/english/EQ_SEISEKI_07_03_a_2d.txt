001	A few days ago...near the border of Greed Dike.
002	Halt! Who are you?!
003	I am Kudanstein. I heard that Emperor Orion wanted to meet me, so I've come.
004	Ku-Kudanstein...?! Ah...I-I've been informed of this!
005	...Where is Orion?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
006	He should be in his royal castle Dynam Dionysus.
007	?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
008	...!
009	You're fast...I see. Your skill with the lance is quite impressive.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0044
010	Who are you?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
011	It's a pleasure to meet you too. I am Fung Liu.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_chara_1024
012	Fu-Fung Liu...?! He-hey! Look!
013	Impossible! Did the experiment really succeed?!
014	...What do you want?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
015	The Emperor is waiting for you in the royal castle. I am here to convey this to you.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
016	So you're my guide? Then quickly...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
017	?!
018	Ack! What're you playing at?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
019	What am I...playing at? I am here to kill you.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
020	So...you're not my guide then?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
021	I have conveyed to you that the Emperor is waiting to meet you. From here...I will return to my original mission.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
022	Your mission?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
023	My original mission is to eliminate any foreign knight who enters within Greed Dike. That is all.
024	As long as we're meeting like this, you fit the criteria as a target...for me to eliminate.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0001
025	Ack! Seriously. What an annoying nuisance! ...Fine.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
026	Anyone who stands in my way, I'll cut down. That's all there is to it.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
027	...You're fast!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0027
028	Aghh!!!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0025
029	What rubbish. You'll pay dearly for this rude welcoming...Orion!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
030	Meanwhile. In the Greed Dike's royal castle Dynam Dionysus.
031	We've received word that Kudanstein has shown himself.
032	Did he encounter Fung Liu?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
033	It appears so.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
034	I'm sure even Kudanstein will have a hassle dealing with him. After all, his assassin's technique was inspired by origami art.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
035	Hmph. More importantly, you want to boast about the research you of the Corpse have been engaging in, correct?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
036	Hehe. Quite so. Having turned Fung Liu into Prototype 0, he is practically a human weapon.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
037	Kudanstein should not be able to easily beat him.
038	Now, hurry up and take me to him. Or...do you want me to cut you lot down too?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
039	You should save those words...for after you've defeated me.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0010
040	?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
041	Ack?! What's going on? I know for a fact that I punctured his vitals!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
042	He is the ultimate warrior...the product of repeated experiments.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
043	There is no such concept of death to a man who, through the technique of we the Corpse, has glimpsed the Door of Truth.
044	The ultimate warrior that cannot physically die, huh? I'm interested to see how Kudanstein responds to him.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
045	Impossible! I'm certain that I pierced his heart! What are you?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
046	He disappeared!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
047	No matter how strong you are, I will never be defeated.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0013
048	After all, I cannot die. Goodbye.
049	Aghh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
050	So you've managed to dodge my attack. Your defensive instinct is...fantastic.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0029
051	Y-you can't die...? Are you a...phantom soldier?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
052	Am I a phantom soldier? Now that's an interesting idea.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0012
053	Ack...! Huzzzaaaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
054	...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
055	I will tell you once again...you cannot kill me.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
056	Aghh...!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
057	Ug...ugh...! N-no...I'm sure that your body is made of flesh! Are you really...immortal?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
058	Fung Liu, huh? Now that I think about it, he's a man that's been born time and time again under an unlucky star.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
059	Very much so.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
060	If only he hadn't been born in the witches' country of Lustburg...
061	Most likely, he would never have ended up becoming an assassin.
062	You speak almost as if we tailored him to be an assassin.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
063	Having been born male and abandoned by his country as a child, my army took him in.
064	Shouldn't we be praised for our actions?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
065	However...fate would have it that he was picked up by Greed Dike's special assassin forces.
066	Heheh. Of course, I don't intend to belittle the circumstances.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
067	Thanks to that, he was able to develop the techniques of an assassin even before he could learn to think for himself.
068	Tsk...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
069	No. I'm not there anymore.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0039
070	Huh?! ...Ackkk!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
071	No matter how much you resist...you cannot defeat me. Please...give up.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0013
072	Agh...! Why? I seem unable to read you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
073	But...I hear that you cannot develop new prototypes after Fung Liu. Why was he the only one who managed to survive?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
074	Of course...I believe that his unique life of having been raised solely as an assassin plays a small part in this.
075	It's not every day that you find an individual who has been trained to erase their emotions from their early childhood.
076	...So you're saying there's another reason?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
077	Yes. What's noteworthy about him is not his technique as an assassin...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
078	The reason why Fung Liu was able to become Prototype 0 was because of his unusually strong attachment to life.
079	His attachment to life...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
080	Huff...huff...! Argh...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
081	There's no point in continuing any longer. Let's finish this soon.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
082	Ack! Huzzaaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
083	You don't seem to know when to give up. What's the point of what you're doing?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0011
084	Shut up! I can't afford to die here...huh...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
085	Your back is completely vulnerable.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0017
086	Gahhh!!! Ug...gfff! Wha...what is your body made of...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
087	Who knows? It's time to say farewell.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0014
088	You have no body temperature...or any pulse! Are you...dead?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
