001	...
002	So that's what happened... I'm so sorry. If only we'd noticed sooner, then we could've aided you in battle.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0022
003	Don't worry. The reinforcements you sent our way were already plenty of help.
004	It's unfortunate that it's become extremely difficult to travel in large numbers.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
005	That man, Quence, possesses Space-Time Manipulation powers that can cover a large area.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
006	Leading a large troop of men would be like leading lambs to the slaughter. He'd just have to make the air grow heavy again and it'd be over.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
107	I see...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0045
108	But the shield regimen—
109	I'll take them under my command. Daphne, you should travel with Nimul and the others. I'll leave their protection to you.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0039
110	With the Silver Shield's divine protection, there is none more capable than you, even alone.
111	Yes, sir!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
007	Yeah, but that guy is a huge cheat! Why does he get to use all the magil he wants?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
008	He said he controls the Cursed Beast, so I assume that must be it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
009	Space-Time Manipulation requires you to manipulate the magil in the atmosphere to be effective.
010	So if we were to control that Cursed Beast—
011	Don't be ridiculous! Sure, in theory that'd be possible, but seriously? Do you think we could actually do that?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
012	Even Icona struggled with that.
013	But somehow that man achieved it. We must not forget that.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
014	But we can't deploy the army... This is tricky.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
015	The Ira Belt army has surely been told of our approach. They'll be wary.
016	Traveling in small numbers brings its own risks. It'll be over if the enemy manages to surround you.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
017	...I may know a good path to take.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
018	It's the road I took when I slipped out of the Ira Belt.
019	It's a very narrow pass, so we can't move a lot of folk through it at once, but if you want to move stealthily it is easily our best option.
020	Andechs! You shouldn't be up yet!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
021	I'm afraid there's no time for me to slumber while the Ira Belt is in danger...
022	Quence told us himself, didn't he? This place will soon perish.
023	...It's true. Looking at it objectively, the Ira Belt's days may soon be numbered.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
024	That's why we have to hurry— Ngh—	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
025	A-are you okay? Can you still move?
026	Heh, I'm your everyday righteous knight! Getting cut to pieces is all in a day's work... Hahaha...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
027	That's no laughing matter...
028	But we have no choice but to rely on him for now. None of us know this region like he does.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
029	What about that child from before? Sulva, right?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
030	We took him back with us before he could slip away, but I don't think we can ask him.
031	He seems so absent-minded and confused. It's as if he can't get his mind in order.
032	Let's wait a little longer so that Andechs can recover instead. We can decide what to do then.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
033	We can go now, I'm fi—
034	No, you're not.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
035	Ouch, ouch, ouch! You're surprisingly strong for a little lady!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0043
036	We depart for the capital tonight. We'll want to move under the cover of darkness as much as possible.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
037	Let's get Libra back!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
038	Yeah, we're going to have a hard time with the Cursed Beast if we don't retrieve Libra first.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
039	Isn't it kinda weird, though?
040	What's weird?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
041	We've got other Gears of Judgement, so why did he want Libra out of all of them?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
042	Well, the guy also uses Space-Time Manipulation, right? So maybe Libra would the easiest for him to use?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
043	Do you really think that's all there's to it?
044	I...
045	Here we go! I'm back on my feet!
046	Your wounds haven't closed yet, so don't overdo it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
047	Yeah, yeah, I gotcha.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
048	So, about that path?
049	Right. We'll need to head east from here, until we hit this place where there used to be a large river.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
050	The heat has long evaporated all of the water, but that means there is now a narrow and covert path surrounded by large boulders in its place.
051	It will lead us straight into the capital.
052	I used the same path when I slipped out of this country.
053	Are you sure about this? We won't get caught?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
054	I can't make any promises, but I'd say it beats traveling over land and getting surrounded by the enemy.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
055	Got it. Let's use the path you spoke of. Is everybody ready?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
056	We will continue to explore the surroundings. If the chance arises, we'll distract the enemy troops.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
057	...I know it's not much, but I figure it's still better than nothing.
058	No, I appreciate that and I'm sure it will be helpful. Just be careful.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
059	Of course.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
060	Nicaea is taking care of things back at the border camp. We won't have to worry about attacks from behind.
061	That is most reassuring.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
062	Let's go then. Everyone, after me!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
063	Hey. Sulva, right? I brought you a little midnight snack.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0001
064	Huh?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0005
065	Where did that child run off to?
066	My brother failed to invade the Invidia Belt.
067	And now the Invidia Belt has come to attack us instead. I see.
068	Then this is all going according to that serpent's plan.
069	That man is dangerous.
070	He's definitely just using you, my queen.
071	Hm, he likely is. But I fear I have no other options.
072	We were simply left with no other hope after my brother fell to the corruption.
073	Hope...
074	What is hope anyway? My queen, what do you expect me to do?
075	What am I supposed to do here? What am I...
076	Is this the place?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
077	Yep. The Nameless Valley. We just have to walk upriver and we'll stealthily slip into the capital in no time.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
078	You can tell where the water wore away the riverbed... But it really is all dried up now.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
079	This river dried up just before I had to make my escape.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
080	Satna's awakening has twisted the earth and warped the flow of nature...
081	Look at how much this place has been twisted and destroyed. Even if we defeat the Cursed Beast now, how much will be left?
082	...Perhaps we're wrong...and it's already too late.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
083	Save the pessimism for when it's over, Andechs.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
084	The Invidia Belt started to change for the better after the Leviathan was slain.
085	I'm sure the Ira Belt will experience the same thing.
086	Of course, you're right... Sorry, this gloomy place got to me for a moment there.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0036
087	The path gets a little complicated here, so make sure nobody gets separated—
088	Tsk. So it's started this already.
089	What did?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
090	Over there! Mt. Shinai is erupting again!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
091	We have to hurry!
092	Hurry?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
093	Andechs, what's the sudden rush?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
094	Nimul, wait! The magil in this area just flared up in a very strange way!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0029
095	That's...the corruption!
096	Dammit! We're too late!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
097	I remember this—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
098	This is just like when the Gula Belt was enveloped in Beelzebub's corruption...
099	It's started...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0018
100	A sign that the night of fire rain is coming.
112	The night of fire...what?
113	The name of the catastrophe that made me leave the Ira Belt for aid.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
101	The sacred mountain Shinai erupts once every 10 years due to the influence of the slumbering Satna.
114	It's a minor eruption for now, but it'll grow in ferocity over time.
115	At full power, its flames are powerful enough to extinguish all signs of human life.	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
103	And as for the flames that touch the ground—
104	They turned into Fallen!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
105	I'll hold off the corruption in this area! Everybody else focus on the enemies in front of us!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0007
106	Here they come!
