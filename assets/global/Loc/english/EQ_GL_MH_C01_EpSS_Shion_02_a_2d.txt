001	A few weeks after the first mission...
002	Shion! You're hurt!
003	Your clothes... They're torn.
004	I'm fine. It's nothing serious. You should have seen the other person...
005	Asuka brings out bandages and medicine and begins treating Shion.
006	Shion, it pains me whenever I see you like this.
007	I know the nature of your work, but still...
008	Don't say that. I know full well the path I walk.
009	It was never your fault to begin with.
010	I was born a son out of wedlock between a Greed Dike nobleman and the only daughter of a noble family from Wadatsumi.
011	Even back then, Greed Dike and Wadatsumi were hardly ever on good terms.
012	Since my earliest memories, I was subject to nothing but barely veiled hatred and derision.
013	My very existence tainted the pure lineage of both families, and the truth of my ill-kept secret was banned from polite discourse.
014	Mother was sent back in shame to Wadatsumi. She avoided being cast out of the family altogether on account of being the only child.
015	Mother was the only one who loved me, and she paid no heed to the vehement objections from everyone else.
016	A short while later, she was betrothed to another Wadatsumi noble in an attempt to sweep the scandal from public memory.
017	That was when Asuka, my half-sister, was born.
018	Her pedigree this time was assured, and heirdom of the house was bequeathed to her.
019	As for me... it was decided that I would be raised as a girl, so that none could contest the authenticity of a female—but pureblooded—heir.
020	Once more. And don't mess up again.
021	One, two, three, four...
022	Five, six... seven, eight.
023	[Dancing in these weird shoes is hard...]
024	...Ouch!
025	Sigh... I don't know what Milord is thinking, asking me to teach a boy how to dance like a courtesan!
026	Focus on your footwork, girl! Remember, you're a woman now. Don't let me catch you stomping around.
027	Y-yes!
028	... ...
029	I was groomed to be a retainer for Asuka. Being "female" meant I could accompany her everywhere.
030	The more Asuka grew, the more she resembled Mother—in her looks, her personality, her gentleness.
031	For her sake, I trained hard day and night. I would endure anything to keep my beloved sister safe.
032	Even when Zheng Yi extended his protection to us, I made sure Asuka never had to face monsters in human skin up close.
033	...This man, huh.
034	You seem acquainted with him.
035	Men like him are the reason I would never allow Asuka to go unaccompanied.
036	Mm. Do not worry. I share your sentiments.
037	... ...
038	Well, I shall take my leave. He won't wait forever.
039	Make good on your word and take care of her.
040	Of course. As they say... a man's word is his bond.
