001	Hmm. Response time to commands is optimal. Furthermore...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0045
002	Power and endurance seem to be on par with the original Discarnate Power. Exquisite!
003	Urgh... Hyaaaaah!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0022
004	Oho! The Crimson Flame Blade! If those flames had come from Kagutsuchi, they might actually be a problem.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
005	Fortunately, that move has already been...recorded.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
006	?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
007	"Recorded"? You can't mean―
008	I've seen those moves before. They won't work on me twice.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
009	Yes. After much research, we of Greed Dike have reached a clear conclusion.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
010	This is a weapon that learns from past pain and obeys human commands.
011	So it was Greed Dike!
012	Haha. I suppose it would be a shame to just kill you after all this. You did lead the Blade Fox Corps and help elevate this creature into the weapon you now see, after all.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
013	So before you depart this world, allow me to tell you the truth.
014	The truth?
015	I've been conducting this experiment for a long, long time. And only now, finally, has it borne fruit.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
016	All is for Wadatsumi!
