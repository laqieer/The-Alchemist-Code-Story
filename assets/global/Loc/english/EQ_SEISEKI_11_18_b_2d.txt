001	The one who is be to destroyed is you! Dead the End!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
002	I will protect the future of this world! Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
003	Give up already! Die!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0032
004	No matter how hard you resist, this is how it ends for you!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
005	Urk...! Grnk... You think...this is the end?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
006	D-don't make us laugh... As if we would die here!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
007	What? The light and the darkness are coming together?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
008	Huzzzaaaah!!!
009	Argh!
010	W-we did it!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
011	What...was that?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
012	I must admit...the depths of your doggedness continue to surprise me.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
013	No...!
014	Watching the two of you struggle so mightily and stubbornly almost gives me hope for humankind as a whole. Almost.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
015	It didn't work?! He even seems stronger than before! How can this be?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
016	No... It's not over yet. Look at that.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
017	Oh! Orion's Phantom is...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
018	Yes. We were able to at least destroy the top half of it. That's significant.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
019	It didn't affect Orion at all.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
020	We don't know that yet. We just have to play it smart to win the battle.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
021	We just have to take advantage of this technique which combines our opposing elemental natures of light and dark.
022	Play it smart? What do you mean?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
023	The opposing energy of light and dark cancel each other out when they come into contact. If that phenomenon is used against Orion, perhaps we can cancel out his strength.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
024	Cancel Orion's strength...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
025	This is just a theory, but...look at the wounds we left on the Phantom.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
026	They look...like flesh had been gouged out by the waves of our energy colliding, but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
027	I'm almost sure that we hit Orion, but it doesn't seem to have done anything to him.
028	It's possible that Nimul's manifestation has bulwarked his defenses.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
029	If only we had a way to lower his defenses for just a moment...
030	What can we do? With every passing second, Nimul's soul grows stronger within Orion.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	And his defenses along with it. In order to gain the strength to oppose that...
032	I feel it... It's here! It's almost fully manifested! Hahahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0046
033	Tch... There's no time to think!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
034	Please, wait! We still don't have a proper plan of attack!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
035	If we don't take this chance now, it may never come again! We cannot let it go to waste!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
036	Captain Kudan!
037	Heh... Have you resigned yourself to death already?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
038	Heed me! Even if there's only a tiny chance this will work, I'll take it!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
039	I am the true successor of the title of supreme judge! Any incarnation of Nimul who dares to face me will die by my hand without achieving their goals!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
040	You...?! With only one hand?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
041	Indeed. You have no chance of winning. All your hopes will die here and now.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
042	No... No! It can't be!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
043	Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
044	Get away from here! You'll just get sucked into this as well!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
045	I know that, but I can't just let this stand!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
046	You should pride yourselves on being the ones who have made possible the resurrection of a legendary power!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0007
047	Tch... Is this...all we can do?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
048	No! This can't be the fate of humankind! This cannot be our end! No destiny is impervious to the possibilities carved out by free will!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
049	Please, Excalibur! Please, give me strength one last time!
050	Just enough to save this world from catastrophe! Please!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
051	What...is this light?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
052	It...repelled me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
053	Now, then. This battle is just beginning.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
054	Huh...?
055	You...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0017
056	Don't give up, Kanon. It isn't over yet.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
057	Zain?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
058	Lord Zain?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
059	Ha! I was wondering who else might show up...and now you, one of the lauded Lord Commanders himself, have fallen so far as to become a Phantom.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
060	Long time no see, Orion. You, who see other humans as less than yourself, have come this far in achieving your ambitions...but it all ends here.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
