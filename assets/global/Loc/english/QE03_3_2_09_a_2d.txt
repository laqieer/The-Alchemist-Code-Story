001	Alma...what do you mean "not all of them'?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
002	There's still a way! The sweet alcohol you have is a hint.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
003	The caramel jaeger?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
004	That sweet alcohol originates from Slothstein, right? That made me remember something.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
005	It was such an extreme rumor that I didn't believe it at the time.
006	It must lack credibility if even you didn't believe it, Alma.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
007	What Dias said earlier confirmed it though.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0016
008	Dias?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
009	It was a rumor that a man had infiltrated this country a little while ago.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
010	He was caught a few seconds after entering...but apparently, he'd entered from Slothstein.
011	Another man that isn't Dias?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
012	A Paladin is one thing, but it's hard to believe that a regular man could enter this country's security...
013	I thought the same, so I didn't believe the rumors, but...when I heard about Belphegor, it changed matters completely.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
014	Belphegor...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
015	I heard that you were after the Sacred Stone, but...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
016	Don't tell me you're also trying to get your hands on Belphegor as well!
017	Wh-what are you talking about?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
018	It's not a redeeming quality to interrupt people's conversations!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
