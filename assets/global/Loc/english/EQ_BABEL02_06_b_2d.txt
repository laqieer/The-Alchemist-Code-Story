001	Yaaaaaargh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
002	Urgh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
003	Huff... Huff... Huff...	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
004	Ila, you fought well.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0009
005	Corvus, you gotta show me some more of your tricks. I wanna be able to take them all on my own next time.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0041
006	That's been my plan from the beginning.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
007	Spica, why are you here?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
008	The rumors of the Shadow Messiah led me here. I was sure it was you, Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
009	I know fate sent me here to serve under you, my lord.
010	Please allow me to serve you once more.
011	...
012	Um... I'm Spica's little sister, Silma!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
013	Can I join your band of merry minions, too?
014	You're both welcome to join my Shadow Messiah.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0038
015	Thank you!	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
016	We won't let you down!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
017	We've stripped the Holy Guard of their alchemy and pried the Philosopher's Stone from the cleric.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
018	Letitia!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
019	Spica, it has been quite some time, hasn't it?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
020	...
021	We're heading back.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
022	Corvus! Let's go!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
023	I'm right behind you.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
024	Don't forget about me!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0001
025	Eat this!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0004
026	Haaaarrrgh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0003
027	Yaaaargh!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0004
028	...
029	(Evil Eye, tell me... Why do I have to train Spica and Silma too?!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
030	Why did you appoint him their trainer?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
031	Corvus must build solidarity within the Shadow Messiah.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
032	Solidarity... Heh heh. He would surely excel at that.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0045
033	Solidarity among comrades can mold them into a strong cohesive unit...but could also weigh them down like a set of fetters.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
034	Neither you nor I can afford to be chained down.
035	You know I'm ready anytime, Zahar, my dear.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
036	...
037	No, it isn't time yet. You still have another role to play.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
038	As you wish, my lord.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
039	How is our progress?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
040	The advance goes as planned. However, it appears we will need those notes after all.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
041	Are you referring to the tome that was left behind at the Wratharis Research Laboratory?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
042	Yes, I will begin a search for it at once.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
043	I trust you won't let me down.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0041
044	Have I ever?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
045	Together with the darkness in our blood, alchemy and the Philosopher's Stones will grant us even greater power.
046	It is nearly in our sights—the power to utilize dark alchemy at will, and the unparalleled Sacred Darkstone.
047	The creation of the Guard Stone is the key to eliminating the Holy Order forever. It will give me the power I require!
