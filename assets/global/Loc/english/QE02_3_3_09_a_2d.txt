001	Whew. Quite the home base they've got here. This place is crawling with one vile thing after another.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
002	With a production line that size, it makes sense. Hmph!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
003	Discovered. Intruders discovered. Elimination will now begin.
004	Bazookas don't work...?! Not good. They're coming this way!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
005	Hey, what's the matter? You've got an uncharacteristically timid expression on your face. Are you trying to make me laugh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
006	Idiot...I was thinking!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
007	Don! They're coming, Don!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
008	Shut up. I'm taking a break. Hey...what's got you thinking now? Is there something that bothers you?	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0015
009	I told you how there was a pedestal like the one we just saw at the clock tower, didn't I?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
010	Yeah...what about it?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
011	These pedestals are located in two places...underground and at the top of the clock tower.
012	There was a similar facility underground.
013	Most likely, the Demons now loose in our world were resurrected there.
014	And...?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
015	What I'm curious about is the pedestal at the top of the clock tower.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
016	Since there was no power source up there, I jumped to the conclusion that that's what the Sacred Stone was being used for, but...
017	There's no way they'd use a legendary Sacred Stone just to run a clock.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0045
018	Agreed. There's still some secret hidden within that clock tower; my instinct tells me so.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
019	Don!!!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0028
020	Tsk. Shut up. This should have an effect.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
021	What's that?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
022	I found this bullet in the underground facility. It must be pretty effective if it's a weapon they're developing.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
023	Wh-whoa...! You just blew away the lot of them!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0046
024	No...there's still more.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
025	Make a move, intruders. I'll shoot you down from here.
026	It's hitman-type Alkaroid. I was nearly taken out by it. Don't let your guard down!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
027	I'm no schmuck like you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
028	Tsk. You idiot!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
