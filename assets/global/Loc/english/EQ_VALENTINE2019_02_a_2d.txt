001	Aww... They got away. Oh, well. Guess I'll just go back now.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0030
002	Hey!
003	What are you doing here? I'm about to head back. Wanna come with, Suzuka?
004	Sure.
005	...
006	What? Is there something on my face?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0006
007	What were you just doing?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
008	Just getting rid of monsters. It's our mission to protect the farm, remember?
009	But none of those monsters were even approaching the farm.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
010	Yet you went out of your way to attack them, and even hunted down the ones that were running away. That's not how security is meant to act.
011	...
012	Itsuki!
013	What? They were an eyesore.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0029
014	What did you say?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
015	What am I getting chewed out for, anyway?! I was being good the whole time!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0017
016	I was being nice, and I even kept up a smile in front of all those thoughtless humans, no matter how annoying they got!
017	Itsuki, what are you talking about?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
018	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
019	Monsters! The ones that got away must have brought their friends!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
020	Hey! Are you two okay?!
021	Aaah, monsters!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0026
022	Good thing you two kept an eye out! We're here to help!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0045
023	...
024	Is everything all right, Itsuki?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
025	Ugh! What is with this feeling?! I hate it!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
026	Why should I have to be friendly to humans just because I'm a Phantom now?! They've been nothing but cruel to me!
