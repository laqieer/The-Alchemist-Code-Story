001	There's not a sound. Not even a footstep.
002	Only imagining something won't change anything.
003	Dreaming of the sky above is but a fantasy.
004	Move forward, ahead of everyone else.
005	Qilin, standing alone.
006	Yes, I'm the only enemy here.
007	Try and stop me.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
008	Wh-who is that?! Who are you working with!?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
009	With no one.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0016
010	Wh-what?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
011	This is a world with nothingness.
012	Y-you have no plan, and came alone?!
013	I can fight.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
014	Huzzzaaaaaaahh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
015	S-stop him! Don't let him...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
016	Holy Guard, 4th Regiment...
017	You guys represent absolute justice?
018	The knights that protect the continent?
019	Isn't there anyone here that can claim those principles?
020	From the darkness...
021	That's where I also emerged from. The name "Nero" is the only thing I can recall.
022	Can anyone help me...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
023	How long must I feel alone?
024	Can anyone tell me anything?
025	Someone that I can trust?
026	Where I sleep is in a mysterious tower.
027	It's terrifying to try and descend it, as the tower itself seems frail below.
028	I had no choice but to ascend it, towards somewhere unknown.
029	Someday, somehow, I hope to find someone that can reveal the truth.
030	Hmm...?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0007
031	...to give answers... That's no fun...
032	This will do away with some boredom...	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0009
033	Just missing the finishing touches...
034	So... it looks like it's my turn.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
035	You're in a trap, Flame Dragon King!	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
036	This has to be stopped.
037	I see you Cadanova, Guardian of the Land. The Flame Dragon King.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
038	So it's you that's been tailing me.
039	That's not all...	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
040	The number of corpses around explains that...
041	Let me ask you something...	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
042	I refuse to answer.
043	How many regiments are there in the Holy Guard?
044	I said I refuse.
045	Seven?
046	You don't take no for an answer...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
047	It's a good thing one of your subordinates already told me the answer.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0016
048	You are...the first.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
049	It is worth it to try out my "Waterfall Skill"...
050	The technique of taking down a dragon that doesn't exist. That seems like a waste of time.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
051	Is effort a bad thing?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
052	Let's find out.
053	I say, you must live to walk on the path towards death.
054	And you still say it is a waste of time?	VO_eins.eins_battle_0029
