001	Father...! What is his condition?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
002	We tended to him, but we only have temporary measures. Eventually, his body will begin to corrupt again.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
003	There is still no true way to purify the blight of the Jam.
004	No...! Are you saying that there is no way to save him?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	Any possibility would lie with our Sprite.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0031
006	The Sprite who is well-trained in the ways of Mother Nature may know of some way.
007	He took on the curse to protect me and the children of our village.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
008	I will deliver him to the Sprite!
009	To Voda...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
010	Yes. In any case, I am a wind shaman.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
011	I must report about Gluttony Foss's invasion, the truth about the raids, and what I have witnessed with my own eyes. Don't you agree, father?
012	Don't worry about me.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
013	Ever since I began investigating the Jam eco-system, I knew something like this would happen.
014	You...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
015	My failure has caused considerable trouble for you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0036
016	I would like to apologize to the people of the Toxotes tribe for this disturbance. I am Mocca...from the Neva tribe.	VO_moca.moca_chara_0001
017	Please, raise your head. I am the one who should thank you for saving my daughter.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0039
018	Please, it was nothing. Saving a fellow individual from Saga is the least I could do.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
019	The Neva tribe...are you from the Fire Sprite Fuu's faction?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
020	My tribe belongs to that faction, yes. As for myself, I have no intention of being tied down to any faction.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
021	But...neutral trading villages are one thing...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
022	But it is prohibited to enter villages of other tribes unless in the event of an emergency. You are aware of that, right?
023	Yes.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
024	I believe that all of Saga is currently in a state of emergency.
025	You said that you were investigating the Jam's eco-system, didn't you? Are you talking about that outbreak we had?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
026	Indeed. It's not just limited to this village.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
027	I learned this from having traveled across the land.
028	All across Saga there have been mass outbreaks of the Jam.
029	What...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
030	If this situation is left like this, it will develop into a serious situation.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
031	I've been investigating the Jam's source while alerting each tribe I travel to.
032	But...why are you doing this on your own?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0045
033	If this situation is so dire, then shouldn't those of the Neva tribe work with you?
034	I am working alone because of the tribal boundaries you just mentioned.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
035	If I were to go around with my tribe, there is a possibility that other tribes would not accept me.
036	Hm...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
037	So...what does any of that have to do with me?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
038	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
039	You said that you were looking for me...didn't you?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
040	... ...
041	Looking for Tina...? What does that mean?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
042	Please, I would like to request that you leave her in my care for a while.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
043	Wh-what...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
044	What are you talking about?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0031
045	Tina is...a wind shaman.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
046	Ever since the destruction of the Alize people, there have been no Shamans to take on the title of Wind Sprite.
047	The wind crystal Matter has lost its power.
048	And wind shamans are no longer being born.
049	I believe that the massive outbreaks of Jam began when the wind Matter lost its power.
050	What does that have to do with my power?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
051	To settle this problem and return peace to this land...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
052	I believe that the Sprite Quartet must be restored.
053	To do so, it is crucial to restore the power of wind Matter.
054	If someone with the power of a Sprite can shower the wind Matter with their Ouija, I believe it will regain its strength.
055	I would like to ask for her assistance in this...as a wind shaman.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
056	What...?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
057	Y-you want me...to restore the wind Matter?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
058	To be honest...I thought I was chasing an impossible dream.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
059	But...I actually managed to find her.
060	In the fight just now, I sensed her potential as a wind shaman...
061	It filled me with the desire to bring her full potential to fruition.
062	Please. Would you let me take her with me?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
063	We could revive the wind and bring back the equilibrium of the past...and restore peace to Saga!
064	But why does one of Fuu wield the wind Matter?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
065	Excuse me, Chief Adone! We've identified what appears to be a Gluttony soldier on the outskirts of the village!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0036
066	How large is their army?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
067	W-well...there's only one of them! However, this is no ordinary individual!
068	Father! I'll go!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
069	Tina!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
070	When I think of the village...my instincts tell me to stay. But when I think about Saga as a whole...	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
071	There he is! Over there!
072	...!
073	Who are you? Weren't you supposed to go and fetch Chief Adone?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
074	Tsk! I am Adone's daughter, Tina, the eventual 45th chief who will lead the Toxotes tribe!	VO_tina.tina_favorite_0002
075	Oh? In that case...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
076	Show me what you're made out of.
077	...!
