001	The horn isn't resonating... Why? I've done everything I was supposed to!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0025
002	Has Sumeragi been broken for too long? No, that can't be possible. It's all right here:
003	Strike both the sword and horn thrice with uniform strength, bearing the wishes of those for whom you forge it in your heart.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
004	The horn shall resonate, and become the blade itself.
005	So many people are counting on your return... Please, listen to the wishes in my heart, Sumeragi!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
006	Help us defeat the demons!
007	Hear our pleas! Don't let Celis' death be in vain. We need your strength!
008	I'd gladly give my life if that's what it takes... So please!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0043
009	...!
010	Tch. Just when I thought we had things under control.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
011	Hyaa!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0004
012	Your movements are so predictable. But that doesn't even matter right now.
013	There. What is that?
014	...!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0019
015	A broken horn? Whose could this be?
016	Mine?
017	Gah!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
018	It is... It is my horn!
019	Ahh... Aaaah...
020	Aaaaaaah!
021	Why...? Why isn't it working?!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0006
022	We're running short on time. Hurry up and fix Sumeragi!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
023	Yeah, hurry it up, Jubei!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
024	?!
025	What trickery is this?!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0020
026	Wait, Edgar! Tanosuke? Is that you?
027	Yep. Sorry about all of this.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
028	What...is happening?
029	Tanosuke, you moronic—!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
030	You said it yourself. There's not much time. I can only hold back Tamba for so long.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
031	I'm sure you've got a real earful for me, but save it.
032	Fine. Then you say your piece. I know you wouldn't do something like this without a good reason.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
033	I figured you'd understand, Captain! What I want you all to know is that Tamba's desire to protect is still present.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0044
034	What do you mean?
035	Malice is twisting his mind, though I don't think he even knows it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
036	Or, maybe he just doesn't want to acknowledge it.
037	So? Are you suggesting we let him loose? Are you trying to get us all killed?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
038	Of course not! Just...believe in him. That's all.
039	Please don't forget who our true enemy is. Rrg... I thought I'd have a little more time than this.
040	The rest is up to you.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
041	Tanosuke!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
042	Hyaaaahhh!
043	...!
044	He's as irritating as ever. He has no idea the trouble we've gone through!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
045	What are you talking about? Get out of my way!
046	Every time... Every single time...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_battle_0019
047	He just says whatever he wants and then leaves us in the dust!
048	Ugachi?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0006
049	Stop dawdling! Get Sumeragi fixed! Now!
050	But the horn won't resonate. I've followed the procedure exactly, but it just...isn't responding!
051	...You're many things, Jubei, but I never took you for a fool.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0012
052	What?!
053	You've piled too much onto yourself. Celis' death was not your fault.
054	That's not true! That's why... That's why I have to defeat the demons in her stead now!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
055	What would Celis say if she heard that?
056	What do you mean?!
057	You think that the desire to kill demons will fix Sumeragi? Is that the hope Celis left behind?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
058	...!
059	Think of what it was she wanted to protect. That's exactly what that idiot was just trying to tell us.
060	Hmph. Next time we see that Tanosuke, we're going to have some words!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
061	What she wanted to protect...
062	Ask yourself: Who's our enemy? Tamba?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
063	Judius, maybe? He was the one who took Celis' life. But even that's not quite right, is it?
064	It's the demon known as Malice.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
065	...!
066	I'm counting on you, Jubei.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0041
067	What she wanted to protect...
068	(I see. I had begun wishing for the destruction of the enemy in front of me...)	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
069	(But Celis...didn't fight just to kill demons. It was never about that with her.)
070	(She fought to protect peace. How could I have forgotten something so fundamental?)
071	It seems my young pupil has one-upped me.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0007
072	Then here I pray. Become a blade once more, so that we may protect this land from the demon known as Malice.	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0004
073	I will strive to be one who wields my blade not of hatred, but of love.
074	I will protect this land, its people, and its peace.
075	I won't forget this again. I will see Celis' wishes made manifest.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
076	I will protect the way of life of those who dwell in Wadatsumi!
077	So I beseech thee, resonate with these proclamations, Treasure Blade Sumeragi, and return to us once more!
078	Ohh! This is it! It's the Treasure Blade Sumeragi! It still needs reforging, but this shine truly is befitting of the name!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0023
079	Lend me your strength, Sumeragi!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
