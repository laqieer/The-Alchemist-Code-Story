001	Grr… H-hey you! Stay by my side!	VO_gino.gino_battle_0022
002	B-but…with all these bandits… We should run away!
003	Just shut up and get behind me. Squirming like that makes things difficult for me!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0002
004	Hey, hey, you're only playing defense, huh? What happened to that confidence you had earlier?
005	Dammit… At this rate…	VO_gino.gino_battle_0019
006	Hyaaaah!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
007	?! W-who are you?
008	Me? I'm Victor, Envylia Royal Knight!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
009	H-he's strong… So this is the power of a real knight…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0046
010	Thank you very much! You saved me!
011	If you hadn't come, I don't know what would've happened… And I'm so impressed with the power of you two Envylia knights!
012	Hm? Well, I'm just…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
013	Yes! And feel safe! Envylia knights are sworn to protect the people!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
014	Right, Gino?
015	Um… yeah…
016	Alright, then. We've captured all the bandits, so case closed.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
017	…
018	Don't expect your first real battle to go perfectly. Plus, you're still a cadet at the school.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
019	Also, you're not a knight yet. Don't go into battle alone like that.
020	I commend you for wanting to save that person, but if I hadn't come, things could've gone badly.
021	It's not like I asked you to come…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
022	You're really a piece of work…
023	Well… you did save us…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0037
024	Thank you…
025	But, why were you even around here?
026	I was just scouting around. There were rumors of bandits appearing in this area.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
027	I also thought to go look for a missing cadet that wandered off.
028	W-why… How…?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
029	It's also the job of knights to look out for rambunctious young cadets.
030	Huh? What's that supposed to mean?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0016
031	You know, I used to be a bad kid. I got into random fights and got beat up. I was terrible.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0002
032	At the time, I wanted to get stronger only for myself. That's why I got into fights. To get used to fighting.
033	But one day there was a knight that helped this little brat. And he said it was his duty to do so.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
034	…
035	That gang that was beating me up got wiped out instantly by the knight. Vettel… he was just amazing.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0023
036	It was then that I decided to become a strong and proud knight like Vettel.
037	And then you became a knight?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0044
038	Yup! Good story, right? That's where it all changed for me.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
039	…
040	? What now?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
041	Just…cheesy.
042	Huuhh? Cheesy? That was a great story!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
043	Nope. Really cheesy. A cliched episode.
044	R-really…?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
045	W-well, cheesy or not, that's not the point!
046	To become a strong knight, you need the spirit and the confidence and you must remember that!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
047	Yup, yup… Getting serious about it like that is also cheesy.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0007
048	What the…?	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
049	(Although…I can see how strong you are with that conviction.)
050	So, what made you want to become a knight? Not fair to only share my story here.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
051	Not fair? You said your story all on your own.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
052	Shut up! Just tell your story!
053	Fine then… Really… The reason I wanted to become a knight…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
054	I want to protect the people of Envylia and to become much, much stronger.
055	…
056	Oh, sorry Gino. This story is probably boring you.
057	Uh-uh. It's so cool, Fraise!
058	Huh? R-really?
059	Yeah! I want to be like you!
060	(That's right, I also…)
061	Well, well… We didn't see you around and here you are on your own!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
062	Gino! You were instructed to observe and report! What are you doing?!
063	I… I apologize.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0036
064	Let's not be too harsh. According to Victor, he was very helpful in the ordeal.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
065	Those burly bandits were taken out by only these two. How amazing Fraise's brother is!
066	…
067	Commander, you are mistaken.	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
068	Hm?
069	Do not refer to him as "Fraise's brother." He is Gino.
070	He may be terribly impertinent and negligent, but when a person needed help, he couldn't back away. He is truly an exceptional cadet on the way to becoming a knight.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
071	…!
072	You're right. We are looking forward to you becoming an exceptional knight one day.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
073	…
074	Hm? What's wrong?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
075	Umm… Well… It's nothing.
076	Hm? Alright, nevermind then.
077	Anyway, I'm proud of you. Even though his name was mentioned, I thought you were going to lose it again.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
078	You know, I'm just not going to let it bother me anymore. I know I'm at a different level than he is right now.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0037
079	Hmm…	VO_victor.victor_sys_0044
080	And so…
081	?! Why are you suddenly lowering your head?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
082	I apologize for saying you look weak when we first met. You're strong. I now know what a real knight is.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0022
083	I realize I don't have the strength at the moment to be a knight. So I request for your help.
084	…
085	W-what is it?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
086	You're brash and easily get angry so I thought you were completely different from him…	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
087	But how straightforward you are…is just like him.
088	What? What are you talking about?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0016
089	As for helping me with training, what's your answer?
090	Well, if you're going to be that serious about it, sure. I'll help you personally.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
091	R-really…?
092	Sure. But…it's going to be tough. Don't cry and run away to your brother!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
093	D-don't you dare say that!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0010
