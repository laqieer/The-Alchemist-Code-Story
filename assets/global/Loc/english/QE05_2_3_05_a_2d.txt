001	...
002	Lost in thought again, Kamui?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0002
003	Ah, Hisham... Lately, I've been preoccupied with ominous thoughts.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
004	I have this strange sense that someone has been manipulating the breakout of all these wars across the continent.
005	There's no point in worrying about it if you have no concrete information regarding the issue. Was it not you who taught me that?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0030
006	You're...right.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
007	Why not go get some fresh air?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0031
008	I've been asked to do a favor, but a long trek like that would be too harsh for this old body to handle.
009	...
010	Now, don't make that face. It's the natural order of things for people to age and die. I'd rather see you smile.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0008
011	I have lived my life to its fullest. I couldn't say it was the easiest or happiest life, but it wasn't a bad one.
012	Oh...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	A request to deal with some monsters?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
014	It's a request from a village that we just formed ties with. Could you take care of this?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0004
015	Sure. I suppose I won't solve anything by shutting myself in.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
016	Some exercise should do me some good.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
017	Grrrrrrr...
018	Well, this is quite a spectacle.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
019	There are a few too many monsters here for this to have happened naturally.
020	I seem to have been set up. Not unduly so, but... What is this? A test?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
021	Grrroooohhh!!!
022	I better just focus on the task at hand first.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
