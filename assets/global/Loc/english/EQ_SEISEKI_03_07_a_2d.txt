001	I'm so relieved that there was a clinic near the ruins.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
002	Thanks for telling us about it, Almira.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
003	The injury was bad enough that our emergency first aid equipment wouldn't have been enough.
004	It's nothing. I'm glad I could help! At least I was able to play the role of a guide a little!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0007
005	That being said, don't you think it's inefficient from a management perspective to build a clinic in an area like this with so few people?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
006	Who knows? All I know is that it's a standard clinic for the hunters and nomads passing through this area.
007	The fewer the better.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0011
008	The fewer patients I have the more I can concentrate on my research.
009	Kagura! Can you stand already?
010	Somehow I seem to be able to. Dr. Alexis really knows what he's doing.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
011	Thank you, Dr. Alexis! I am really, really grateful!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
012	It's nothing. An injury like this is no different than a scratch when using my medicine.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0010
013	Cough! Cough!
014	Are you okay?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
015	Excuse me. Recently, my health hasn't been very good. It often happens that a doctor will neglect his or her own body.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0035
016	I'm going to take some medicine, so please excuse me for a moment. It will still take some time for her to completely heal, so how about you hang out here for a bit.
017	He's gone...
018	More importantly, what happened inside the ruins?
019	Ri-right! We don't have time for this! We need to hurry back into the ruins!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
020	Huh?
021	That man was chasing Kudan. He's extremely dangerous!
022	Vice-Captain Monzein should be heading deeper into the ruins. Are you talking about Waginau? The man dressed in black...
023	No...that's not him. I think he's someone even stronger who wields a deadly power.
024	He was leading a large herd of monsters that attacked us. They took us by surprise and it was all we could do to defend ourselves.
025	A large herd of monsters? Wait, could he have been behind the monsters that attacked us on the hill?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
026	Who exactly are you talking about? Was it someone you know?
027	No, but Kudan seemed to know who he was.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
028	He went chasing after him into the ruins with a just small band of knights.
029	No way. That's the same thing that happened last time...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
030	Yes. He might discard his own justice and become possessed with the desire for power.
031	The stronger the opponent's power is the more danger there is of this happening.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
032	Oh dear! We need to stop Captain Kudan before it's too late!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
033	Wait, what do you mean? Are you gonna stop Captain Kudan?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
034	I'll explain the details to you while we run! We need to rendezvous with Vice-Captain Monzein and head inside the ruins!
035	Dr. Alexis...?!
036	Don't jump out suddenly like that! You scared me.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0012
037	Monsters...?! What are they doing here?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
038	Oh? You're right.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
039	What is going on?! Wait...are you working with them?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
040	What?	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0006
041	Here they come! Get ready!
