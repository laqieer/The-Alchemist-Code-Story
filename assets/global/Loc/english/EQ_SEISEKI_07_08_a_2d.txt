001	So, how did you feel?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
002	About what?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
003	About speaking with the Lion Monarch Orion. You snuck in to ascertain his way of thinking, right?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
004	I gained a lot from it. Apparently, I have the potential to gain even more power than I have now.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
005	More power than you have now? Is that what you're seeking?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
006	If Zain's ideology still exists amongst the others of the Holy Guard...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
007	The tragedy he endured will repeat itself.
008	I must do everything I can to stop that violence from occurring.
009	And you need power to do so?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
010	Yes. I wasn't able to stop him or to open the eyes of my comrades who were being used by him.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
011	No...in fact...if he had the power to destroy the Mikaboshi...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
012	I'm sure he wouldn't have thought of using Zain and Kagura.
013	Are you saying that everything occurred due to your lack of power?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
014	Right now I'm too vulnerable.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
015	In order to protect this world and to save my comrades...I must obtain even more power than I have now.
016	However...if you seek more power than that which you can contain...you will fall to the darkness. That man Fung Liu warned you about that.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
017	That'll probably be the case if one were to solely pursue power. However, I have determination on my side.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
018	This determination will protect me at all costs from being consumed by the darkness...as long as I have something I need to protect.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0029
019	Kagura, huh? But don't you think she shares the same ideals as Zain along with the other captains?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
020	That's not a problem. Kagura and I have a deep bond from having lived together. She's just been a little confused.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
021	Hmph. It seems like you've got everything figured out now.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
022	Zain was in the position of "supreme judge". He was supposed to govern the equilibrium of this world.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
023	Yet, he attempted to extend his grasp to the Alchemy of Power.
024	What that man was attempting...ultimately, it wasn't a mistake.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
025	What do you mean by "supreme judge"?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
026	I'm talking about someone who observes the equilibrium that balances this world's power. Without such an individual right now, this world is in an extremely dangerous situation.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
027	In order to save this world...I need to quickly obtain this power.
028	Wait, you're not telling me...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
029	Under normal circumstances, the current Lord Commander, Kanon, should be the one to succeed to the position of "supreme judge". However...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
030	With the Corpse having infiltrated the Holy Guard, I cannot leave this position to them. I must instead fill the role.
031	What...?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
032	I will take the position of "supreme judge"...and defend the equilibrium of this world.
033	That's the responsibility I should take as the one who killed Zain.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
034	Wh-why would you say something so outrageous...?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0027
035	I don't intend for you to understand what I mean.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
036	Seriously. Your thinking surpasses my own limits time and time again. Look, we're in view of it now.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
037	...So that's it.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
038	Yes. That's Ramproad Mountain.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0038
039	Monzein the Great Thunder Axe; Seida the Hurricane Arrow...and Kagura the Law of Hellfire...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
040	Even if they can be taken on individually...if they team-up together, it'll be a hassle to deal with.
041	In order to ensure I can obtain the Holy Sword Excalibur, I should wait until we're alone.
042	It'll be a bit of a hassle.
043	It seems like you were scolded.
044	I was told that I shouldn't hire some random guy as my bodyguard. He won't even listen to what I have to say.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
045	Seriously. Why are you such a hassle all the time? Fine. I'll go talk to Captain Monzein.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
046	Sorry.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
047	Lord Commander Kanon...we're finally alone now.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
048	Are you gonna tell me that you were waiting for this moment?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
049	?!
050	You...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
051	I knew I was right! You're here to assassinate Lord Commander Kanon!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
052	Little frog...did you come back here all alone?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0044
053	Yeah? So what?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
054	Well...instead of waiting for the captains to be away...	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
055	I'm thinking it'll be a better idea to use this opportunity to defeat you first and complete my mission.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
056	So you've finally shown your true colors! Fine! Let's settle it here.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
057	I'm pretty sure I warned you already. Your enthusiasm alone won't make you victorious over me. I'm sorry, but I won't hold back.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
058	...!
059	Ughh...?! Lo-Lord Commander Kanon?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
060	What are you doing, Basheeny? Now isn't the time for this!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_1004
061	My apologies. I was careless. You've gotten in my way, little frog.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
062	Lord Commander Kanon, please be careful! That man...!
063	Huh?! Why are you pointing your sword at me?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
064	Victor, even if you're Chloe's junior...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
065	If you're going to hurt Basheeny, I won't stand by silently.
066	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
067	N-no, there's been a misunderstanding!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
068	This scum is an assassin! His aim is to steal Excalibur from you!
069	You mean his aim "was", right? He's now a Paladin, just like you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0039
070	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
071	What do you mean?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
072	Exactly what I said. No matter what your original mission was for getting close to me...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
073	Right now, you're no longer capable of enacting it, Basheeny. You're one of us now.
074	...! Are you saying that you knew what my intent was all along?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
075	Who knows? In any case...right now your mission is to protect me.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
076	Jeez...that's pretty cruel. So you were toying with me all this time?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
077	It doesn't matter how you perceive it. Just rest assure that I trust in you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
078	Huh? How can you even say that knowing what you know?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
079	I'm somewhat aware of the fact you're dealing with a lot of issues right now.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
080	But...there's no way that I can see you as a bad person.
081	I just think you didn't have anyone in your life that you could call your friend.
082	Friend...? Haha! I have no need of such a thing...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
083	It's not about whether you need one or not. In any case...you're no longer alone. You have us now.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
084	You're kidding with me, right? If you are, it's really not that funny.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0022
085	I'm being serious of course.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
086	We've already been bound together as friends.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
087	I'm sorry, but I won't fall for those words. If you wish to maintain that facade, then by all means do so.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
088	Ack! You're not getting away with this!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
089	...!
090	Lord Commander Kanon! Why?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
091	I'll tell you this once again. If you intend to harm him, I won't stand by idly. Put down your sword.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
092	What are you thinking? I'm a spy and you're my target.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
093	I don't care about your past. I'm talking to you directly...the person who is standing in front of me.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
094	...! You're looking at me directly?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
095	Kanon!!!
096	Captain Monzein?! Ah...please calm down!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
097	What are you saying?! Hurry to the summit! You need to quickly rendezvous with Kagura!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
098	Huh...?
099	I can feel the dark presence approaching! Most likely, it's Captain Kudan!	VO_caida.caida_chara_1004
100	...!
101	I'll confront him first! You take them and head to the summit!
102	But...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
103	Don't worry. If we end up engaging in conflict...the two of us should be able to suppress him.	VO_caida.caida_battle_1012
104	In any case, you protect Kagura and these two.
105	All right. Captain Monzein...I leave it to you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
106	Got it. Let's go!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0037
107	...Why?
108	Those two were supposed to have been highly suspicious of me...and yet now they're telling you to protect me.
109	They feel the same as I do. Even if they say abusive things with their lips, in their hearts, they also think of you as a friend.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
110	What is wrong with all of you?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0013
111	We're just normal people.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
112	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
113	When you're with someone long enough, you learn to accept each other. That's what normal people do. Idiot.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
114	... ...
115	Come on. What are you doing? We need to hurry to the summit.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_1004
116	It's difficult to comprehend the way you guys think.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
117	In any case, I'll go stop the bothersome intruders. We'll talk after that.
118	Huh?! He-hey, wait...Basheeny?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
119	I...didn't come here to be protected by the likes of you either!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0023
120	Lord Commander Kanon, please hurry to where Kagura is!
121	Victor?! Seriously...what's wrong with both of you?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_1004
