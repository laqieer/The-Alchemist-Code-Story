001	Gyarr?!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_b
002	Huh. I think I've gotten a little rusty.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
003	What do you mean?! Miss Malta, that was amazing! I should have never doubted you!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0026
004	Hehe. Now do you get it?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
005	Yeah! I totally understand what they meant when they told me that I should never, ever make you mad.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
006	I understand that fear on a visceral level now!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
007	Wait, who said that?	VO_malta.malta_chara_1009
008	Ahem. Malta?
009	Yes, Isidore?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
010	You're off the hook this time, but you are a druidic priestess. You're vital to this village.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
011	It's important that you not risk yourself when so many are relying on you.
012	But this was easy enough to do myself...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
013	That's not what I'm talking about! Kamui, say something.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0030
014	Me? Uh, hmm...
015	The precision of your Spiritbonding is brilliant, as always.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
016	I learned a lot from observing your techniques, such as your ability to sense the beasts before you could even see them...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
017	Not that! I'm trying to say we were worried!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0012
018	No matter how strong you are, a single slipup and it could be the end for you.
019	Even though you're a master at Spiritbonding, you're still a woman, and I...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
020	If anything happened to you, I...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
021	I think you're worrying too much.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
022	And what's wrong with that? I—	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
023	There you are!
024	What the...?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
025	The Chief has called an urgent meeting! He wants the three of you to gather immediately.
026	My father?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
027	We'd better hurry. Can you take care of Hisham? I need you to take him home.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
028	Understood.
029	What? But...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
030	From here on, it's grown-ups only. Don't worry about it yet.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
031	Okay.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
032	Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's hurry.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
033	Yeah, but what do you think could be so urgent?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
034	They're here.
035	Sephira Guard Captain Isidore, at your service.
036	Father, what's going on?
037	The oracles have foreseen an outbreak of corruption.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0016
038	...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
039	The incarnation of Beelzebub's curse, the Jams, have appeared?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
040	Then it is our duty to eradicate them.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
041	Yes.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
042	Now is the time for us, the people of Sephira, to fulfill the duty entrusted to us so long ago.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
043	Where should we go?
044	At the eastern end of this southern region that our hidden village is located, there is what seems like the remains of a village.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0037
045	It is a long way from our village, but the fastest horse in the village can reach it in a day.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
046	I will gather our warriors immediately!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0001
047	No... It may be better not to bring so many people.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
048	With the unrest in the royal capital and the uprisings in other regions, it would be a bad time for us to come to light.
049	We have already left the stage of history. Getting entangled in the troubles of the outside world may trigger new tragedies.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
050	So then...?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
051	Malta and Kamui, I entrust to you two the task of purification.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
052	Please wait! I should also—	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
053	Isidore, what is the post that has been assigned to you?	VO_iakof.iakof_favorite_0003
054	...Captain of the Sephira Guard, sir.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
055	You cannot leave the village and your warriors.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0005
056	In addition, you are to be the Chief of this village.
057	You understand the confusion it will bring if you abandon your duties for personal reasons, don't you?
058	Yes...
059	I trust that with your skills, you two will need no extra escort. I leave the task in your hands.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0041
060	Yes.
061	Yes, father.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0006
062	I'll go ask the stable master for horses!
063	Wait, I'll—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
064	Isidore...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
065	Take care of her.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
066	Like I said, no matter how skilled she is in Spiritbonding, she's not a warrior.
067	I wish I could go with you and protect Malta with my own hands.
068	But that would force me to turn my back on the duties I have pledged to fulfill as a Sephira.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
069	So I'm leaving it up to you, my best friend.
070	If anything happens, you protect her.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0041
071	Of course.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
072	According to what the Chief said, the place filled with corruption should be just up ahead, but...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
073	Malta, can you sense it?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
074	Yes, I sense some distorted Alchemia.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
075	It's...much bigger than I imagined...
076	Then let's purify the land first.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
077	We'll use our skills to separate the Jams from the Alchemia of the earth to weaken them!
078	Got it! Leave the purification to me. Kamui, synchronize with me!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0038
079	Got it!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
080	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_malta.malta_battle_0007
081	Wait, Malta! They've already found us!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
082	Kamui, what do we do?	VO_malta.malta_chara_1009
083	You purify the land! I'll take care of the Jams attacking us!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
084	I'm on it!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
085	"I wield understanding in my right hand and mercy in my left. With the wisdom I have inherited, I will guide you to right the wrong—"	VO_malta.malta_battle_0007
