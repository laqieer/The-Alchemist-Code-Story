001	(How did it come to this? I only wanted to save her!)
002	(And now I have no choice but to put this pitiful woman down.)
003	(The one who shares the face of my beloved...!)
004	A high-caliber bullet pierces one of the steel shelves near Siegfried's head.
005	Come now. We can pretend we never saw the report.
006	Roxanne is dead. I am her now.
007	You're insane.
008	You're just a pale imitation of the only woman I ever loved.
009	Siegfried holds up the rest of the report.
010	A biological copy. That's all you are.
011	You're not Roxanne...and you will never be.
012	I felt her draw closer.
013	A silver knife, a hidden pistol—I should have moved away instead of waiting for my demise.
014	But all I felt was the brush of tentative fingers against my arm.
015	Then tell me, Siegfried.
016	Who am I?
017	...
018	She may never wake again. I am all that remains of her.
019	How are you so confident I won't come to remember the things she has forgotten?
020	If you were to run...
021	They would most assuredly kill me.
022	...Isn't that what you want?
023	I can't lose her again.
024	Then my demise won't matter.
025	You are such a fool of a man.
026	Where are you going?
027	Out of here. We've wasted enough time.
028	Take your prize and follow me.
029	...
030	- Archives, Hidden Backyard -
031	Pushing open an old rusty door, Siegfried and Roxanne emerge into a deepening sunset.
032	(I've been here before...)
033	(Had to pick Rox up after another of her infiltrations.)
034	(Could she have remembered...?)
035	What's with that look? If they catch me with you, I'm as good as dead.
036	Go on. Get out of here before I change my mind.
037	...Thank you.
038	You should be thanking Roxanne.
039	...
040	This diary is really important to me. As are these reports.
041	I promise you. I'll do whatever it takes.
042	I'll make you whole again. I swear it.
043	And just for that one moment, wrapped in his embrace...
044	I believed him.
045	- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -
046	Mmgh.
047	Awake? Good.
048	How are you feeling?
049	A little drowsy, I suppose.
050	That is expected. Here, drink up.
051	It will ease the dissonant thoughts in your head. So that they don't bother you, yes?
052	You have an important mission from the Director, after all.
053	I stared at the vial of colorless liquid in my hand.
054	I concealed the truth of my encounter the day before from the Doktor as much as I could...
055	...But my memories grow fuzzier with each dose.
056	Regardless, I steeled myself for more of this bitter nepenthe.
057	In time, it will just be another forgotten piece of my past.
