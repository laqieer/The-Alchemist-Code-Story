001	A few hours earlier in Saga region. Where the road diverges towards Northern Pride.
002	All right, Kazahaya. I'm sorry, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
003	I understand.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
004	The main Greed Dike army is currently headed towards Saga. Their final destination is Northern Pride.
005	Yes. Assuming the worst possible outcome...that Saga's Matter has been taken...we must tighten our guard.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
006	Of course. We have no intention of letting them do as they please.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
007	Captain Othima...please, you must stop Orion's march.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
008	Trust me. I'd love nothing better than to do so.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
009	Still, even if we cannot stop Greed Dike's invasion...if we manage to steal their Sacred Stone.
010	I'm thinking we may be able to reverse the tide.
011	Sacred Stone...? Are you referring to Envylia's Leviathan? If so...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
012	No...I'm talking about Greed Dike's Sacred Stone Mammon.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
013	Greed Dike's Sacred Stone...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
014	Yes. This is the shrewd Orion we're speaking of. I'm assuming he's not complacent enough to leave the Sacred Stone Mammon in his country.
015	There's a high chance he's carrying it with him.
016	I see! An eye for an eye, huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0045
017	Indeed. If we manage to obtain it, we won't be placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the sheer number of Sacred Stones.
018	Yes. However, I doubt matters will go so smoothly...judging by the look Basheeny's face.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
019	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
020	You really are an honest one, aren't you? It's written all over your face.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
021	Oh... Well, um...how can I say it...I just recalled something that's been bothering me.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0047
022	Bothering you...?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
023	It's just a rumor...one that I heard when I was with Waginau.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
024	Apparently, Orion is harboring Greed Dike's Sacred Stone Mammon within his body.
025	...!!!
026	The Sacred Stone...is within his body?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
027	Ah, well...it's only a rumor. However, if it's true, it can pose some serious problems.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
028	It was such an absurd story, I had completely forgotten about it. However...
029	I see... So that's why Orion has been obsessing over Nimul's power.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
030	What...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
031	Sorry, Kazahaya...there's another thing I wish to relay to Kanon.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
032	In fact...it's by far the most important thing she must know about.
033	The most important...?! What is it?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
034	There is a possibility that Orion is a Vessel of Reincarnation.
035	...I'm sorry, but you must convey this to Kanon...even at the risk of death.
036	...!
037	Present day. Somewhere in Saga. A windy hill.
038	What a deep blue sky...what bright and warm sunshine!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0024
039	What a wonderful view! It surpasses anything I've imagined!
040	It's a far outcry from Slothstein's foggy sky.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0046
041	Who would've thought such a beautiful sky existed in this world!
042	... ...
043	Soon, this sky will belong to us, the Lost Blue! The mere thought fills me with excitement!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0009
044	...Hey, redhead...you'll lend me your strength as well, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
045	If you're from Wadatsumi, then you must've lost your sky as well, right?
046	...Don't put me in the same boat as you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0015
047	Jeez... Well, I guess that's what happens when people have different definitions of justice.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
048	Never mind. Not only will I change your rigid worldview, but I'll change this entire world as well!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
049	This entire world...? That sounds like a pipe dream.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0012
050	A pipe dream...?
051	How long do you think the Holy Guard and the ruling countries are gonna let your tyranny go unchecked?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
052	They'll wipe that smirk off your face soon enough!
053	Are you sure about that?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
054	Of course, I am! At the very least...after what you did to Yauras...I will never, ever forgive you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0013
055	Those who live for the moment...will never carve their names in history.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
056	...What?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1017
057	You'll never grasp the world if you remain focused on just one aspect of it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
058	It's only the arrogance of those who live in their minuscule worlds who think there is only one truth in this world.
059	What are you talking about?! Speak in a way that I can understand!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
060	No need to rush things. Eventually, you'll be forced to understand...when this sky belongs to us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
061	...Anyway! Enough of that...let's enjoy this deep blue sky for now!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
062	Hahah! Honestly...it makes me feel lucky to be alive!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0009
063	What's wrong with you...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
064	Maybe you should be asking them instead of me.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
065	Them...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
066	...?! What the... Who are those troops?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
067	Halt! So...you're the one who's been working in cohorts with the Greed Dike army.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
068	Gluttony Foss, huh? If you don't wish to die then go home. I have no business with you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
069	What did you say...?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0016
070	The woman called Seida has your Sacred Stone Beelzebub, doesn't she?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
071	I said that I have no time to waste on you.
072	...! So...you know about that!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
073	I've heard rumors.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
074	I also know that woman Seida isn't one to easily reveal the location of the Sacred Stone.
075	In that case, wouldn't it be more efficient to aim for something certain?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
076	Something certain...?	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0005
077	The sacred crystals which belong to the Saga tribes called Matter.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
078	I plan to quickly get my hands on them. I have no business with you people who have no Sacred Stone of your own.
079	How dare you...! Even if you have no business with us, we have business with you! Attack!!!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0013
080	...Get back.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
081	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
082	Ack...! Artillery...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
083	If you don't want to die then stay put there. Honestly. To think I was going to spare his life.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
084	...! What are you gonna do?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0039
085	A little warm up. I'm gonna destroy Gluttony Foss.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
086	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
087	Aghhhhh!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0026
088	Ca-Captain! Our pincer assault was blown apart!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
089	Impossible! What happened?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
090	N-no way... You took out all those soldiers with one blow?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
091	Don't worry. I won't lay a hand on you...not until I can get ahold of your Matter.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
092	Wa-wait! Stop!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
093	Kingdom of Envylia.
094	Huff...huff... All that's left are those so-called "experiments," but...!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
095	Argh... They're too strong!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
096	...Not good.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
097	Huff...huff...! ...Hyah!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
098	Even though they're  strong individually, if we work together, we should be able to take them down!
099	Exactly! It's not like you to cave in Captain Vettel!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
100	No... I'm not talking about Envylia.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
101	Huh...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
102	Look how much we're struggling against this scouting party. They're not even the main army.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
103	And the mysterious Templars are the ones leading them.
104	If Greed Dike were to come at us with full force, even Northern Pride may not stand a chance...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
105	...! Kanon is in danger...?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
106	...?! Chloe! Don't let your guard down!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
107	?! O-oh no...!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
108	Chloe!!!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
109	...That must be quite some skill to catch you off guard from behind.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
110	Huh...?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
111	What's is going on here?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
112	Spica...!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
113	Ag...ggh!
114	...! It's not done yet!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
115	What...?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
116	...Hyaaaah!!!
117	Gggaah...!!!
118	You gotta be kidding me! You're not getting away with doing whatever you want!
119	Bud...!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
120	Spica, please! Head to Northern Pride!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
121	...? Northern Pride?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
122	Greed Dike's army is making its way there as we speak!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
123	Captain Vettel, she is familiar with Kanon as well! I'm sure she will be an asset to the Holy Guard!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0041
124	We of the Scarlet Flame Guard can't afford to leave our posts here.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
125	However, with the king now dead...and you of the Blue Flame Guard having lost your role as the Royal Guard, you should be able to move about as you please.
126	Bud...I ask you this as a fellow Flame Guard captain... Would you please deliver her to Northern Pride?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0041
127	Me? But...for the sake of my scattered comrades of the Blue Flame Guard...
128	If Northern Pride falls...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
129	Not only Envylia, but the entire continent of Babel will be engulfed in darkness.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
130	After I finish off the Greed Dike soldiers here, I'll follow after you.
131	I understand your dedication to your men, but...please.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0041
132	...! Captain Vettel...
133	Kanon is in danger! Please, Spica! Lend Kanon your strength!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
134	...!
135	Meanwhile...in Saga region.
136	No...way! How could you take out all those soldiers...in such a short time?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
137	The deciding factor of strength in battle is not the number of soldiers. If you can't understand that...then you have no right to be in command.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
138	Ug...ghh...!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0026
139	I was planning on letting you go...but you really are an idiot, aren't you? Goodbye.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
140	Wa-wait! Al-alright...! I'll tell you the location of the Sacred Stone!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0020
141	What...?
142	I-I'll tell you the whereabouts of our Sacred Stone Beelzebub!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0019
143	So, please, spare my life! I have a newborn child!
144	Indeed. Well, where is Beelzebub currently located?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
145	It's been securely kept in the army's headquarters! Let me take you there immediately!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0018
146	...I see. You must be executed after all.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
147	What...?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
148	We have an absolute law that we must never lie. You have broken this law. Thus, you will be executed.
149	Wa-wait...! Please, wait!!!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0027
150	If Beelzebub was in Gluttony, wouldn't they first and foremost solidify their defenses there?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
151	That Seida woman, who is famous for her shrewdness, would never hide it somewhere so obvious...idiot.
152	!!! Wh...what have you done?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0028
153	It's all right. He was instantaneously turned into ashes. He wouldn't have felt any pain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
154	H-how insignificant is a human's life to you?! You crushed him as if he were an insect.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
155	Are you saying you'd be fine with me killing an insect?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
156	Huh...? No...it's not that I would be fine with it, but...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
157	Humans, insects, plants...they're all living entities, aren't they? Do you mean to tell me that one life is worth more than another?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
158	...Well...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
159	You people speak of valuing life...but, you're wrong. A life itself has no value.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
160	Do you understand your stupidity in valuing each life while their numbers are countless?
161	Stupidity...?! How dare you?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
162	Don't you realize the contradiction in your own argument?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
163	Isn't that very mouth you use to utter such niceties also used to consume animals?
164	Sacrifices must be made in order to survive!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
165	We pay respect to the creatures we consume as food. We're not the same as you! You slaughter with no regard to the life you've ended!
166	Heheh. The frenzy in your voice is more than enough to prove you aware of the contradiction in your logic.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
167	Humans eat other creatures, thus terminating their lives.
168	No matter how eloquently you put it, that's the unwavering truth.
169	It's in human's nature to lengthen their own lives by robbing other creatures of theirs.
170	Agh... Then...if you say that life itself has no value, then where does value exist?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
171	It's obvious. It exists in our resolve.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
172	Our resolve...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
173	Our resolve will continue on long afterward our spirit and flesh perish. You understand that, don't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
174	All things physical will fade away one day. There is no value there.
175	There is only one thing that determines the value of life-resolve.
176	So...there's no sin in taking the lives of others then?! There's something fundamentally wrong with your way of thinking!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
177	No matter how much I try to convince you, I doubt you'd understand. You've never seen the "dimension beyond."	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
178	...Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
179	Ah, nothing. More importantly, we have company.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
180	Company...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
181	Are they...from the tribes of Saga?
182	Enough talk. Come on...let's go, redhead. The first Matter is already right before our eyes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
183	Wa-wait...stop!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
