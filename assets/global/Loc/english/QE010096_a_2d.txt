001	Wait! I haven't finished with you yet! Why do you know the secret of Agatha's origin?!
002	Honestly... How am I supposed to be the grand councilor for a kingdom, if I cannot even perceive something so obvious?
003	Listen, Dias... Nothing remains hidden from me. Remember that well.
004	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
005	Noticing that Gabirond's gaze is directed towards his right arm, Dias quickly hides it.
006	I-in any case, why do you believe that taking Agatha in as his daughter is proof that he regrets the sins from his past?
007	Don't you understand?
008	It's because he regards Agatha as the object of penance for his own sins.
009	By raising a child of Wratharis, he must have thought it would lead to atonement towards the people he massacred.
010	Wh-what?!
011	To explain it plainly...Captain Zeke may have predicted that events would unfold in this manner.
012	Wh-what do you mean?!
013	I mean that Captain Zeke could have raised Agatha for this very purpose.
014	To position Agatha, whose lineage is that of Wratharis blood, as the representative to establish a dominion.
015	He may have done so to escape the suffering he felt regarding his own sins, or...
016	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
017	In any case, I pity Agatha who was raised without knowing the ulterior motives of his love...ugh?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0042
018	You speak too much.
019	Ugh...! Wh-what are you doing?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0043
020	My father is not that kind of man!
021	He raised us with the same amount of love he gave to Logi...even though we weren't his real children!
022	I will not allow you to insult my father any further!!!
023	Le-let me...go! It...hurts!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0043
024	Agh...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0022
025	As the pain increases in his right arm, Dias involuntarily relaxes his hand.
026	Then, he brushes Gabirond aside and walks off on his own.
027	Cough...cough! Y-you...where do you think you're going?!
028	Where do you think? I'm going to confirm my father's true intentions. There is nothing that is more important right now!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
029	Ack... That brat...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0042
030	Yet...slowly, his beliefs are beginning to sway.
