001	We trained every day like nothing had changed.
002	Like she had never collapsed.
003	I fought and lost, got up again, and lost again. Over and over.
004	But I didn't hate losing. If my sister was still able to beat me down in training, then she was still alive. That's what I thought.
005	She would train me and I would stop worrying again. But then that worry would come back. Then seeing her alive again would put those worries to rest.
006	I did that over and over again.
007	I hoped that those days would continue.
008	Then, one day.
009	What?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
010	You heard me. Come at me like this is life or death.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
011	That's... What's wrong all of a sudden? Come on, I've never held back!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0002
012	I'm not weak, you're just way too strong! I'll beat you someday!
013	Just do it.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
014	Natsume...	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
015	I said do it.
016	...
017	Okay.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
018	Good. Prepare yourself, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
019	...!
