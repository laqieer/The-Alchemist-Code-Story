001	Um... What? This looks like where we just came from. Could we be lost?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
002	Maybe, maybe not. We have been wandering around in this cave for quite some time.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0003
003	Of course...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
004	Are you okay, Su Yi? Are you tired? You've seemed okay lately, but we don't want to risk... Su Yi?
005	The rugged rock walls, the moistened earth, the smell of the tide... We're really here.
006	This is where The Adventures of Joe Vandelle... I can't believe we're here.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0009
007	Xiao-Xiao?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
008	Oh! Sorry! I got a little lost in the moment.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
009	Nothing wrong with that! This is where Su Yi's beloved tales of adventure took place, right?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_event_1006
010	It is. It brings back so many memories. Whenever visiting, Xiao-Xiao would always read that book.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
011	Of course. They were the best stories of a great pirate who would brave any danger in pursuit of treasure.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0037
012	In the tales, this was where the one of The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure came from. How I've longed to come here...
013	Just setting foot here and walking in this cave is so thrilling!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0007
014	Really? Well, I'm glad to hear that!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
015	Well, so long as you're happy... But I am getting a little anxious to find this treasure.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
016	Having seen most of the cave on our long stroll, I think I have a pretty good idea of the place.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
017	The only place we haven't been to is around here, so the treasure must be nearby.
018	Hah! Su Yi, you're always so clever! That means very soon...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0009
019	Wait. There's monsters. Let's go ahead, Xiao-Xiao.
020	Right! Su Yi, wait here. We'll push that way and take care of the threat.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
021	B-But... I can fight, too! My medicine is working, and my seizures...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
022	No, no, no! We can't have you straining yourself.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0039
023	We'll be right back, so just hide behind this rock for now. You'll be safe here. See you in a jiff!
024	But...
025	(This again... Every time a monster pops out, this is what happens.)	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
026	(I understand why they worry about me, but I'm really fine now...)
027	(I want to carry my own weight as a pirate. I want to become strong and stand alongside everyone else.)
028	Footsteps?! Who could it be? I better hide...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0027
029	Eh? What's this child here?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0006
030	Uh...
031	Eh? What's that? I can't hear you.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
032	...!
033	Captain! More monsters!
034	Gah... More of you? You ants keep crawlin' outta the cracks.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0016
035	Y'all get ready for a fight! And I'll teach you what it means to face Gormalas.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
036	Whoa!
