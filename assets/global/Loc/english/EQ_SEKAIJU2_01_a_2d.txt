001	Led here from the land of Arcania, in which Yggdrasil, the great tree, pierces the sky...
002	Our three adventurers, Fencer, Harbinger, and Shaman put an end to the war ravaging the continent of Babel.
003	However, their inquisitive minds unsatisfied, the three young women continued to seek out adventure in Babel.
004	Their journey goes on, even now...
005	Haaa... Harbinger and Shaman are probably super worried about me.
006	I can't believe I fell into a trap in that cave and got separated from everyone! I'm such an idiot... I'm so sorry, everyone!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0048
007	Hmm, actually... Exploring a cave, getting separated from your friends...and then a heartfelt reunion with them at the end?
008	This is what adventure is all about! Heh, this is actually kinda exciting! I'm definitely gonna find those two!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
009	What am I saying? I can't afford to stand around yapping, I gotta get going!
010	Huh?! Wh-what was that?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
011	Aaaaahhh!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0026
012	...lp...me...elp...me...
013	Wh-who is that?! Wh-what did you say?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
014	H-he...lp...me.
015	Help me?! Is someone calling for help?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
016	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhhhhhh!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0028
017	Wh-what was that?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
018	Ow... Goodness, what was that all of a sudden?!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0043
019	Ngh... Wh-what is this light?!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0043
020	Everyone, are you all right?! Actually, before you answer that; who are you?!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0042
021	That is what I would like to know! State your names and titles immediately!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0012
022	Shouldn't you start by giving your own name and title first? Hm...?	VO_princess.princess_sys_0002
023	Wh-what is the meaning of that ridiculously enormous tower?!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0026
024	I-I can't see Yggdrasil! We're not in High Lagaard anymore!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0025
025	Hmm...? Are you adventurers as well? I am Sovereign, adventurer of Armoroad.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0006
026	I don't fully understand this situation yet...but in any case, I'm a Protector of Etria—and an adventurer!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0016
027	I'm Gunner, from High Lagaard.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0016
028	Um... I guess I'll introduce myself, too. I'm Fencer, from Arcania.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0049
029	So... You guys must be adventurers from the other world, too.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
030	O-other world?!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0025
031	Yep. We're currently in a place known as the continent of Babel, but what I want to know is why the worlds have become linked again.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0005
032	Maybe that cry for help I heard earlier had something to do with it.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
033	Wh-what?! I heard that as well! All of a sudden, I was enveloped in a radiant light and I heard someone cry "Help me!" Then I found myself here!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0012
034	I heard it as well, but what did you mean about the worlds being linked?	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0045
035	Not too long ago, our world became linked with this one.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0049
036	At that time, some monsters from our world wandered into Babel.
037	Wait, I know! You guys came here through the Door of Truth, right? Did that weird little girl, Ouroboros, say anything to you?	VO_fencer.fencer_chara_1001
038	The Door of Truth? Ouroboros? What are you talking about?	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0006
039	H-huh? You're telling me you didn't come here through the Door of Truth?! Th-that's so weird. That's how we got here, so...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
040	Wh-who is this?!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0026
041	I am Shenmei! Are you the ones who called me?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_chara_1009
042	Huh? What are these clothes? Wh-why am I dressed like this?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
043	What are you all in a dither about? The better question is—who are you?!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0003
044	I'm not sure, but I think she might be what's called a Phantom. They're meant to be summoned by using something known as Alchemy...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
045	But none of you know how to use that, right?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
046	H-huh?! Then who summoned me? More importantly, why am I wearing these weird clothes?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
047	I'm a pirate, but now I look like a dancer for some reason!
048	Maybe when the worlds became linked, some Alchemy or...something got mixed up in it all and you were called here by accident.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0005
049	I've met someone like that before, but it looks like there aren't any weird side effects this time... Probably.
050	The worlds became linked? What do you mean by...weird side effects?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
051	All of this information is starting to get incredibly confusing. I feel a headache coming on.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0029
052	Me, too. For her... Um, for Shenmei's sake, let's go over what happened from the beginning.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0045
053	Wait! Something's coming!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0002
054	Grrrrrrrrrrrr!
055	M-monsters?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
056	That means enemies! We can talk after we've taken them down!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0010
057	L-linked?!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0025
058	Hmmm... It sounds like that voice led us all into this world.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0011
