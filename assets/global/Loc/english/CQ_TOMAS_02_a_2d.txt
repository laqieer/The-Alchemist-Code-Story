001	Whoa!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0022
002	Hmph. Ran off with their tail between their legs.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
003	Um, so... Mister Gormalas?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0001
004	Just Gormalas is fine.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
005	All right, Gormalas.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0004
006	I'm Tomas! This is Fons—the bigger one—and Reeves is the smaller one.	VO_thomas.thomas_chara_1001
007	So, were they acquaintances of yours?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0001
008	Nah. Never saw those guys in my life, but I’m not surprised they knew me. Probably seamen of some sort.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0006
009	Seamen?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0046
010	Yeah, the sort that aren't honorable, but aren't complete good-for-nothings, either.
011	Like...former pirates?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0031
012	If I had to guess, I’d say they were probably pirates that I got the better of.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0004
013	Wow! You're seriously strong, huh, Gormalas!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0024
014	Oh, hey! I forgot to thank you for your help just now!
015	You even offered your help when I was at the pharmacy. Seriously, thank you!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0033
016	You've got it all wrong. I'm not the charitable sort.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
017	Then why did you help me?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
018	Hah! You're still just a kid, huh? You've got a lot to learn.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
019	I never help anyone out of the goodness of my heart. There's always gotta be something in it for me.
020	Something like what?
021	Something worth the work I've put in.
022	Worth? Uh... I don't know if I really have anything like that.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0031
023	I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to pay you back for helping me.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0035
024	I don't know about that. You definitely have something worth my time.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
025	Huh?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
026	Tch. You might regret being so bloody innocent one of these days, you know that?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
027	Heh! Anyway, this is pretty exciting for me!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0007
028	I can’t believe I bumped into my hero twice in one day!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0009
029	Uhh...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0048
030	I wanna explore the world! That's why I've always looked up to you, Gormalas! We’re both from Saga, too! Hehe...	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0047
031	I've never even seen the ocean! Maybe I should become a pirate, too! Haha, just kidding!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0008
032	Tch... There's gotta be limits to how naive a kid can be. You can't just joke around about becoming a pirate like that.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
033	Your fighting style isn't half-bad, but it needs a hell of a lot more polish.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
034	And fighting out on the open seas isn't anything like fighting on land.
035	There're completely different techniques and strategies you need to know. The way you are now, you wouldn’t last a week before you’d be sleeping with fishes.
036	...
037	On top of that, a pirate's got to be smart. Strength'll only take you so far. If you don’t have the brains to back it up, you’re gonna end up getting swallowed up by the sea sooner or later.
038	...
039	What? Got nothing to say? Heh. I guess you hadn't thought of that, aye, boy? It's not an easy business, pirating.
040	Um, so by brains, do you mean that I should study more or something?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0031
041	I'll definitely train more! And I'm not good at studying, but I'll do my best!	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0032
042	R-right...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0049
043	What should I study? Like, to become a great pirate like you?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0001
044	Heh. Less talk, more action, huh? You’ve got the right attitude. Your eyes, though. Hmph... They’re still too soft.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
045	Uh... They're just a normal blue.	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0025
046	Oh! I've been told that they're the color of the ocean! The ocean's blue, too, right?	VO_thomas.thomas_sys_0007
047	And I heard that the water in the ocean is salty! How do fish live in salty water? That's so weird!
048	Ugh... That childish innocence of yours is starting to make me feel sick.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
049	I mean, sure, I'm sure there are places where the ocean is just clean and bright like that, but it's not that simple up in the northern seas.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
050	There, the waves are so vicious that it makes it difficult to make food, let alone sleep.
051	And I don't know how many times I've seen ships where sailors died just because the voyage went on longer than expected and food ran out.
052	Do you think you could handle that?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
053	Uhh...
054	Seems like this has knocked some sense into you, at least.
055	No, I just...
056	Grrr!
057	Fons?
058	There! I told you, it's Gormalas!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
059	Hah! Fools! I should've put you out of your misery while I had a chance!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
060	You'll pay for what you did to us earlier! Let's see how you do now that you're outnumbered!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
061	This will be our revenge for you stealing our pirate flag!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0030
062	This is the end of the road for you, you miserable cowards! This is what you get for running from the seas!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
063	Whoa!
