001	There's nothing for us to talk about. Hurry back to your Water Temple.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
002	Hehehe. You were always an easy boy to read. The more stubbornly you try to protect something, the more you hold it inside.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
003	Why now? Do you mean to tell me that those children managed to move you somehow?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
004	Indeed. That girl...Tina... She's the one I've long waited for.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
005	The one that you've...long waited for?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
006	So, this is...the Water Temple.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0044
007	Ack... Those Gluttony scum, they've invaded quicker than I anticipated. Hurry, we must take Voda away from here.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
008	Huh? Didn't you just send them packing, Tina?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
009	Yes, but it doesn't change the fact that they've caught up with us.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
010	Visitors? What a rare treat. What brings you here, girls?	VO_voda.voda_chara_1002
011	Voda, I am Tina, the newly appointed 45th chief of the Toxotes tribe.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
012	The Toxotes tribe...? I'm sorry to hear about Adone.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
013	...Thank you.
014	I didn't know Voda was such a...beautiful person!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
015	He-hey! Lisbeth! You're being too forward...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
016	Hehe... It feels good to be complimented. That being said, daughter of a foreign land, I have lived many times more than you.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
017	Whaaat?! I can't tell at all! I've come from Lustburg. My name is Lisbeth!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
018	Lisbeth! Please. Restrain yourself.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
019	It's fine. Women appreciate compliments no matter how old they get. So, what business do you have with me?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0023
020	Voda...I received a vision during my Ritual of Baptism.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
021	I saw the...horrifying future of Saga...
022	I saw the land burning, people clashing...and a giant dragon descending upon the land of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
023	A dragon...!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0027
024	I also witnessed another vision of late. It was of you, Voda, losing your life at the hands of Georgios.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
025	I have come here in order to change the future revealed to me through my vision.
026	Voda, I implore you to hear my request.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0036
027	Would you please come with us? The Gluttony army is closing in on this place. Your life is in danger!
028	...And where would we go?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
029	To Fuu's base at Lilith’s Hill. Voda, this is for the sake of Saga's future.
030	Saga's future...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
031	Yes. We wish for you to ask Fuu for reinforcements...that's how dangerous the approaching enemy is.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
032	Georgios the Flame-Armed General, who leads the Gluttony army...
033	He also killed my father Adone...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
034	What?! I see. I didn't think Adone was one who could be easily defeated.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
035	Furthermore, my friend who is indispensable to the future of Saga has been infected by the Jam's blight.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
036	He is also in the Fuu faction.
037	So, you want me to help this friend of yours. What do you mean when you say he is "indispensable to the future of Saga"?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0045
038	He is a Wind Shaman. He holds the key to reviving the power of the wind.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
039	A Wind Shaman...?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0012
040	Look how far they've managed to come! ...Haaah!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
041	Tina! There's a lot of them outside as well!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
042	We can't let them get near Voda! Voda, please on hold for a moment. First, we'll annihilate the Jam!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
