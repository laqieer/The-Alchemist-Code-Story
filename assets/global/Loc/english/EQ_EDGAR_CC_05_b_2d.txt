001	Agh...huff...huff...! That scum. He really went all in, didn't he?	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0026
002	Why? Why are you doing all of this...?! I just want to die...!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0019
003	I deal with life in my job. I'm also just betting on life.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
004	But you're trying to die before you can stop dancing...that I don't understand.
005	Like I said...it's impossible.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0018
006	What is impossible? You're willing to risk your life on it, right? If you really want to do it, then you should be able to.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
007	... ...!
008	Tsk. He's here already. You get down.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
009	Yep. This battlefield is for me and the comb head guy.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0037
010	Young lady, I can't afford to even let you, the client, get involved.
011	Or should I just carry out all the job requests at the same time?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
012	...!!!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0019
013	...It's over.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
014	I-I'm sorry. It's my fault. I've involved you as well, Edgar...	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0042
015	You've got it wrong. With that one bullet, the version of you that will get married and stop dancing...has died.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
016	What...?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
017	But, at this rate, the dancer version of you will die as well. Hey, do you really want to die? Or do you want to bet on the future?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
018	I-I...	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0018
019	...?! What...?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0019
020	If you want to die, then you can just remain complacent like this. That bazooka will promptly finish you off.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
021	But, if even a part of you, doesn't want to die, then place your finger on the trigger.
022	I'll hold the gun. With your will to live, pull the trigger.
023	W-wait...I've never shot...	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0043
024	I'm sorry, but you're out of time. I've got my next appointment coming up as well. It's over!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0036
025	Close off you future and shoot down your ghost!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0004
026	O-ohhh...!!!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0028
027	Oh...oh...I'm...alive?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0027
028	Hmph. Was that a cancellation request for me?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
029	Yes, I guess so. The client who felt despair because she thought she wouldn’t be able to dance...is now dead.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
030	Honestly, that's some free work I did there.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
031	Huh? Dead? Cancellation...?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
032	Heh. Like I said, the person before me now is nobody. She's a lady who just likes to dance.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
033	And wherever she may go, she will not blame anyone.
034	Oh...
035	That single shot was filled with emotions. You really are an amazing lady.
036	Edgar...am I...allowed to live as I please?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0019
037	Only someone who is determined to create their own future can truly grasp hope.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
038	I'm sure you can do it.
039	Thank you...Edgar.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0010
040	I completed the job, my dear client.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
041	Just so you know, I really hated having to hire you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
042	Well, that's rich coming from you. Especially after you got me involved. Anyway, I can understand why you would get desperate. She's a good dancer.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
043	Hmph. That was quite the performance, to be honest.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
044	Tell me that after you pay up.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
045	I completed my job. Now hurry up and give me my reward money.
046	This should be enough for the likes of you!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
047	What're you playing at?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
048	I told you to escort her. Not only did you do that, but you made her fall in love with you!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
049	Huh?! What kind of nonsense are you spewing?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
050	You always go too far! Argh!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0040
051	Edgar? What are you doing reading the newspaper? You look really happy...
052	Ah, it's nothing. It's just nice to see someone I know from the old days doing well.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
053	Is that so? By the way, were you always like this with women even back then?
054	Hey, hey, back then I was even more of a "cool and quiet" type. Ah, don't give me that suspicious look...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
055	Oh, could you tell?
056	I can read that much of a woman's heart.	VO_edgar.edgar_event_1011
057	Ahaha! I wouldn't call that a woman's heart!
058	Hahah. You've got a point. Shall we?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
059	Where are we going to next?
060	I feel like going somewhere where I can enjoy a drink...while watching a beautiful woman dance.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
