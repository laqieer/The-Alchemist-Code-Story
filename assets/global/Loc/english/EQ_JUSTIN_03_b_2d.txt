001	Justice will always win!!!	VO_justin.justin_battle_0029
002	... ...
003	Y-you...! What you doing?! Hurry up and finish him off!
004	No. I already fulfilled my end of the agreement. I've no reason to follow your instructions anymore.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_1005
005	What?! Y-you! What's that in your hand...?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0027
006	I knew you were after this toy. That's why, well, I thought that if I were in your good graces, it'll help me save considerable time and effort.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0010
007	S-since when...? We-were you in on this since the beginning?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
008	Hardly. I'm not that much of a straight shooter. Just on the way back to your mansion, I managed to squeeze myself into the role.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_1001
009	That being said, I'm surprised you actually let a Guard Droid loose on the streets.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0030
010	You really are a bad person. I was smart to put you in my list.
011	All the treasure that you've accumulated for yourself will be put to good use, so don't worry!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0008
012	Hey! That's my collection! You...you scum!!!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
013	Chaaat Nooooir!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0012
014	Hey, Justin♪ I truly do appreciate all your hard work. Thanks to you, I was able to really enjoy my work today!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
015	Also...
016	... ...
017	Thank you for repairing it properly. It helped a lot, lady. But it was a pretty exciting experience, wasn't it?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0033
018	Yes, it was. Perhaps fate will bring us together again, Chat Noir.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
019	Well then, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed today's show. An encore will not be necessary!
020	You're not going to chase him?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0002
021	There's something more important for me to do first.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
022	Th-that brat! What are you doing?! Hurry up and catch him! Get me back my fortune!
023	You are guilty of having made a Guard Droid go on a rampage and of attacking a toy shop. You are a criminal.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
024	One day, I will catch him with my own hands.
025	However, in order to succeed, I must not allow the evil in front of me to escape. That would go against my justice!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0010
026	Ugh...you...you...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
027	...Sigh.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0030
028	Oh? How uncharacteristic of you.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_battle_1018
029	Anyone would want to sigh in this situation. This is the 718th time he's gotten away...	VO_justin.justin_sys_0031
030	You two really have a long relationship.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0045
031	An unwilling one...that is.	VO_justin.justin_sys_0004
032	What about you? Why are you cooperating with Chat Noir?
033	Personally, I have a hard time seeing the kid as a bad person.
034	Just like the kid who couldn't get the toy he wanted at the toy shop, I see him as a kid who wants something he can't obtain.
035	Besides...
036	Taking from the proud and giving to the weak...sometimes that is the most direct way to save people.
037	I believe that there are some forms of justice where this is absolutely necessary.
038	... ...
039	But still, I truly believe in creating a world where one day everyone can live justly!	VO_justin.justin_sys_0039
040	After all, that...is my justice! That's why!
041	Heheh. Not the most eloquent way to put it...but I'm looking forward to seeing the results.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
042	... ...
043	I fixed it...just like I promised, old man.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_chara_2001
044	O-oh...is that so? Who would've thought there was someone in this town who could fix it...
045	This toy has a special mechanism incorporated within it. It's a piece that has been lost and does not exist anywhere...and yet you were able to fix it in such a short period of time.
046	The technology that my brother left behind was indeed inherited...!
047	Well then, will you keep your end of the promise? Tell me about the hidden side of Babel that would never appear in its history... "the sunken city where light does not reach"...
048	That evil land that was sunk by your younger brother...the place they call Lost Blue.
