001	Huff... huff... Have they been taken out? I can't believe the Lizard Brigade were lurking in a village like this.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
002	A-ahh...!
003	Tsk! There's still more hiding! Die!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
004	Wait, Dias!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0014
005	?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
006	These are villagers! Put away your sword!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0015
007	He-help!
008	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
009	What are you doing, Dias? Hurry up and finish them off.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
010	Lord Gabirond! These are not knights of the Lizard Brigade.
011	I am speaking to Dias! Do not interrupt me!
012	These are the ones who will carry on the legacy of Wratharis.
013	If you let them escape, they will eventually bare their fangs, with Philosopher's Stones in their hands! Cut them down.
014	Pl-please, wait! There are children here! Spare our lives!
015	...!
016	Hurry up! You must pluck the buds of rebellion here and now!
017	...No.
018	What did you say?!
019	The purpose of our mission is to annihilate the Lizard Brigade, not the people of Old Wratharis.
020	If you're worried that the roots of evil will remain, then just destroy the Philosopher's Stones.
021	You...!
022	Dias...	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0002
