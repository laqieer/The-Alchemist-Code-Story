001	Wh-what the...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
002	Oh dear...it seems like we messed up on our estimation a little.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
003	In fact...it's best to assume that the transmission of information has been delayed...
004	Was it Lord Waginau?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
005	That's my guess, but there's no point in speculating. Come on. Let's go, Kagura.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
006	H-hey, hold on! The scale of Greed Dike's army is completely different than what we were told...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
007	Don't worry. Our backup will come eventually. We just have to hold on a little longer.
008	That being said...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
009	It's true that Greed Dike's soldiers...especially the combat level of their special assassin forces, are far more advanced in comparison to the army of other countries.
010	That being said, they're still human. There are ways for them to be conquered...although there are exceptions.
011	Exceptions...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
012	You've heard, haven't you? About the prototypes that are separate from ordinary humans.
013	The immortal soldiers...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
014	Speak of the devil...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
015	B-bugs?! Giant bugs?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
016	Ack! If you're gonna call yourself immortal, then tell me that after you've been on the receiving end of my Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
017	H-h-hey! Hold on a sec! No! Those are the villagers!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
018	Huh?!
019	Amongst the men in Lustburg, there are those who've been turned into insects!
020	You've heard about it, haven't you?
021	Oh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
022	You're so dangerous! You almost attacked the villagers!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
023	I-I'm sorry. It's the first time I've seen them properly...but...what do you mean by the prototypes?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
024	Well, just watch. Piercing Light!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
025	Aghhh!!!
026	...! When did that...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
027	You have to keep your guard up.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0014
028	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
029	Ug...ghh...!
030	No way. You obviously hit its vital points.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
031	Like I said, they're immortal. No wonder the soldiers of Lustburg are having so much trouble.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
032	...Ugghhhh!!!
033	C-Captain Othima! Here they come! Now isn't the time to be showing off!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
034	Calm down, calm down. Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
035	Aghh...?!
036	...! It stopped?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
037	See? They become troublesome if you try to kill them.
038	As long as you just stop their movements, they're no trouble at all...
039	Guugggaa!!!
040	Yeah, yeah. The best they can do is go on moaning...agh?! Another one?!
041	Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
042	Whoa?! No way...it disappeared?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
043	It's too cumbersome to stop their movement. I prefer to use Kagutsuchi and eliminate them completely.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
044	Seriously. Why are the girls in our Guard so strong?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
045	Yes?
046	Oh, nothing! Yeah, let's go with that. Do however you please, Kagura! In any case, let's split up and evacuate the villagers.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
047	On second thought, sorry, I take back my words.
048	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
049	Look at that...
050	...! Smoke coming from the castle?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
051	It seems like they've arrived at the castle. I'll go from the other direction.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
052	Kagura, you meet up with the royal army and intercept the Greed soldiers.
053	Understood. Once I've finished there, I'll also head immediately to the castle.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
054	Please be careful.
055	Come on. I'll be fine.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
056	Still, right back at you. We've no idea what tactics they might use. I forbid you from overdoing it, okay?
057	Got it.
058	All right. Off with you then.
059	Honestly. She really does do whatever she pleases.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
060	Now that war has been declared, we'll have to take full responsibility for it.
061	Ultimately, it's you who'll regret it in the end...Lion Monarch Orion!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
