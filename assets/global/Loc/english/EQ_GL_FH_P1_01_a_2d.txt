001	Several months since that fateful encounter...
002	In the dim light of an abandoned safehouse, the final Sister revealed her identity at long last.
003	Clotho and the Director were one and the same.
004	Disdainful of mankind's innumerable sins, she vowed to purify this world in Soren's name.
005	If I must force you to see the truth of this world, then so be it.
006	Give it some thought, Master...
007	I will be waiting. As I always have.
008	While Goetia ramps up their operations, many of its members still remain oblivious to the Director's will.
009	But not all are content to remain unwitting pawns in the grand chessboard of Clotho's vision.
010	- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -
011	What's her status?
012	There is...ah...promising progress.
013	Her signal is quite pure, quite pure indeed... Far better than expected.
014	However there remain a few...obstacles.
015	Get to the point.
016	You will know soon enough. Her training session has been approved.
017	Let's not dawdle then.
018	...
019	There is no need to worry. Your vitals are in excellent condition.
020	You've just been...asleep for a long time, after your little accident.
021	But look how far you've come from that frail maiden lying under rubble.
022	That's...right, I suppose.
023	Thank you, Doktor.
024	Ah, a final request before you leave.
025	Your thoughts, whatever they may be. Write them down. Do not forget.
026	I would hear them. So that...that you can be whole again, yes?
027	...Yes. I'll do that.
028	If there's nothing else...
029	She has not protested her ministrations?
030	Not at all, Doktor. She takes her doses without complaint.
031	Good, good...
032	All that remains is her combat performance, then...
033	Let us hope Grimm won't work her to the bone just yet.
034	I expect you have gone through your lab simulations, but this is the real deal.
035	You will patrol this stretch of Slothstein.
036	As this is a restricted area, intruders must be dispatched immediately.
037	I needn't tell you to clean up your messes after.
038	Understood.
039	When will this exercise end?
040	When I say so. Dismissed.
041	With a curt nod, Roxanne slings her rifle over her shoulder and makes for one of the many winding alleys.
042	(It's almost too quiet here.)
043	(Was this place supposed to be...livelier? I don't remember.)
044	Tracing the faded edge of a stone wall, the sniper looks skyward at the setting sun.
045	At some point before her reawakening, she must have beheld such a scene. Perhaps even countless times.
046	Yet all Roxanne felt in her chest was a seizing wistfulness for something she couldn't quite recall.
047	What was that...?
048	(There!)
049	Wait... You're...
050	How long has it been, Rox?
051	An entire mansion gone, just like that.
052	You were there. Weren't you?
053	All of us were. And so were you.
054	You were one of us.
055	...
056	The one with the Alchemia...he was too dangerous.
057	We should never have taken him in. Goetia was right.
058	We damn near raised the boy! How could you be so heartless?
059	You're the one who threw your lot in with those criminals!
060	(He seems familiar too...)
061	(But why can't I remember?)
062	Haaah!
063	...!
064	Roxanne... I'm disappointed.
065	You've forsaken everything that you stood for.
066	That's enough.
067	I'll hear no more of this...
068	You've got a lot of nerve showing up here in the first place!
