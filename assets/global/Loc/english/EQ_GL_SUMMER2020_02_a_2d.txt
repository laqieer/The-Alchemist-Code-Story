001	...
002	Ooooh...
003	Is this your first time in a city? It's quite the sight, isn't it?
004	many... things! Shiny!
005	For all their faults, humans do manage to create some truly impressive constructs.
006	(Thankfully the humans here seem to lack magical aptitude, no one has been able to see through the illusion I cast over us)
007	(Still, we shouldn't wander for too long, it would be best not to draw any unwanted attention)
008	Shall we get going? It wouldn't do to keep your friends waiting.
009	...Yes!
010	*grumble* First Siegfried disappears off somewhere again, and now Soren and Blair leave on some trip without inviting me!
011	And he still has the gall to ask me to take care of guests in his stead!
012	Although he did seem kind of desperate... I just can't refuse him when he pleads with such sincere eyes...
013	Sigh... I guess I do owe him for all that trouble I put him through when we were preparing Blair's clothes.
014	*Knock Knock!*
015	That must be them!
016	...
017	...
018	So...
019	So?
020	Soooo Adorable!!!
021	Ahhhh, you're so fluffy! And cold! And what are these furry ears? Are they real?
022	!!!
023	soft.... pillows.... can't... breathe
024	(This lady, she can see through my illusions? Fufufu, she's a sharp one...)
025	Greetings, I presume you are the owner of this mansion?
026	Indeed, and you two must be the visitors that Soren told me he was expecting?
027	Ah, that is the acquaintance my friend and I are seeking. But first... could you perhaps let my companion go?
028	must... escape ...
029	Oh dear, where are my manners! Your companion was just so adorable that I couldn't help myself, my apologies!
030	That is quite understandable, she is such a darling after all. Her name is Eira, and you may call me Morrigan.
031	Nice to meet the both of you, I'm Roxanne and a close friend of Soren, he practically treats this abode as his home...
032	And he also did not mention that my guests will be quite so fetching! Now I feel rather unprepared.
033	Oh worry not, you are certainly more than adequate.
034	Thank you. Now, unfortunately both he and Blair left for a research trip just this morning...
035	He tried to tell you not to come, but apparently the little one hung up before he could get a word in.
036	... Big Bro... gone?
037	Oh my, so our journey was in vain then?
038	Not to worry, their trip is a short one, and they said they should be back by tomorrow!
039	In the meantime, Soren has asked me to play host and show you around the city.
040	I'm afraid we'll have to decline. We'd rather not wander around lest we attract unwanted attention.
041	Don't worry, no one in Slothstein would dare mess with me, and even if they did they'd soon regret it!
042	Besides, the little one has never left her countryside home before, wouldn't this be a good opportunity to broaden her horizons?
043	... Eira, what do you think?
044	... if... Big Bro says...
045	then... okay!
046	Well, it seems we've reached a decision. It looks like we'll be taking you up on your offer.
047	Wonderful! There's plenty of fun to be had, so let's get going!
048	follow... Pretty Sis!
049	Awww, I love you already!
050	I had a feeling it would be something like this, but... couldn't you have picked a place with less people?
051	It's summer, so of course the beach is the place to be! It'll be a nice change from the frigid air where you come from.
052	Besides, everyone is too busy having fun to take any interest in both of you!
053	Oh... the cold never bothered me anyways. Then again, it wouldn't hurt to live a little.
054	Eira... melting...
055	Come now, don't sweat the details. I know, lets head over to that beach stall and pick up a cold snack!
056	Hey girls, you seem a little lonely, how about you join us?
057	Yeah, we've got plenty of booze with us, let's have a great time together!
058	(Oh great, these type of fools. I wish Sieggy was here to get rid of them... ahhh, if only he were here with me...)
059	...
060	Hey lady, what's the deal, you're hurting our feelings here!
061	It doesn't matter which of you comes along, if you're not interested, we'll just take this small cutie here!
062	The thug grabs Eira by the arm and roughly pulls her
063	...ah! Hurts!
064	Release her at once fool.
065	Don't you dare hurt her!
066	Oh yeah, or what?
067	Watcha gonna do about it? A broad like you is better seen not heard, gwahaha!
068	Oh no you didn't... Well, this 'broad' is about to change your mind!
