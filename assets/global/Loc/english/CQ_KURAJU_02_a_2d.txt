001	What's this invention anyway?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
002	Oh, you'll know it when you see it.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
003	Whoo, I win! Check out my sick skills!
004	Get back here, dammit! I want a rematch!
005	Are they...racing? Wait, scratch that, how are they flying?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
006	Courtesy of a mechanical exosuit I put together based on my own augmentations. It's got strength enhancements, flight capabilities, onboard communication systems, and an inbuilt heater for melting snow.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
007	With the steep slopes and the heavy snowfall, just maintaining the main road is an ordeal in this town, and it's only gotten worse with the younger residents moving away.
008	But with my exosuit to do the heavy lifting for them, I predict the townspeople's labor efficiency improving dramatically.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
009	Pass it here, you whippersnappers! I'll show you how it's done!
010	Either I'm seeing things, or one of their team is older than the rest put together.
011	And he's keeping up. That's my exosuit in action.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0032
012	Hm? "Today Only: All Items 20% Off!"? Why, they've turned my suit into a hovering advertisement!	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
013	Are you just going to let them do that?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
014	Why not? People who can't think outside of the box aren't any fun to observe.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
015	Why do I feel like that was directed at me?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0012
016	That was not my intention...but more importantly, I seem to be missing several suits. Commencing scan...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
017	Hm... I've detected a cluster of multiple suits clustered on a road in the western outskirts of town.
018	Trust you to install a tracking function... Hm, but what are they doing all the way out there?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
019	Please! Don't hurt me!
020	Area clear! Let's get to work, boys!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
021	Those merchants are in trouble! Wait, aren't those your exosuits?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
022	Heh, what a cinch! These suits make robberies a piece of cake!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
023	But of course they do. That's hardly worth saying, let alone shouting.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
024	Are you just gonna sit there smugly while your suits are used to rob people, or are you gonna help me get them back?!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0001
025	Why would I? I thought I told you, I don't mind how my suits are used.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
026	Although I wish they'd handle them with a bit more finesse. It's like watching apes banging rocks together.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
027	They aren't apes, they're people! And look what they're doing with your inventions! Don't you care?!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0016
028	That's rich, coming from the one who used my gun as a club.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0001
029	Look, I'm sorry about that, okay?!	VO_courage.courage_battle_0019
030	Gahaha! With these babies, we're gonna rule this whole town!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
031	But at least you'd never catch me saying something like that!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0010
032	Remember when you said it wouldn't be fair to my gun to not use it properly?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
033	Well, I think it would be even less fair to point it at the wrong people.
034	Couldn't you say the same thing about your suits?
035	An interesting point. If a tool is used to do evil, then the tool itself might end up being considered evil...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0045
036	Hm. I suppose I do dislike the thought of that.
037	In which case, I don't want those apes playing with my suits after all. Would you mind helping me clean this mess up?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
038	Not at all. Just tell me where I shoot to stop them.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
039	You won't get a bullet through the armor plating, but I never found a way to reinforce the energy intake on the rear.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
040	...Yeah, I see it.
041	Now we just make like a tree and skedaddle!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
042	But hitting such a small, fast-moving target probably isn't even—	VO_regen.regen_sys_0016
043	Who's shootin'?! Huh? This damn thing's seized up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
044	Isn't what now?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
045	...isn't even a challenge for the best sniper I know?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
046	That's more like it. You know, he's coming back to earth a lot slower than I expected.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0007
047	That's the emergency deceleration system at work. Just one of my exosuits' first-class safety features.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
048	Huh. I didn't have you down as the 'safety first' type.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0044
049	The shot came from over here! Hey, I found 'em!
050	It's a shame it's gotten us busted.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
051	Just because they're coming closer doesn't mean you have license to beat them with your gun again.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0022
052	Then keep them off me so I don't have to!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0010
