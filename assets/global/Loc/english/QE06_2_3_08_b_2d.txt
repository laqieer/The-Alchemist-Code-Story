001	Captain Tanosuke… Are my eyes playing tricks?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
002	Her strikes are like bolts of lightning! They're so fast I can't even see her unsheathe her sword...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
003	Yeah, I can barely follow it either.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
004	How can she be so fast wielding two blades…? Is it the way she draws her swords...? There must be something to it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
005	My technique is unrelated to swordsmanship.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
006	...It is the vulgar artifice of an assassin.
007	Incredible!
008	…You're quite the nuisance.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
009	That's why we set up this ruse and had me leave the Blade Fox Corps, is it not?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
010	…What?
011	…Let's save that talk for later, Jubei.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
012	By all means!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
013	Escape while you can, Tanosuke!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
014	Amane! Let's go!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0010
015	…You meddlesome wretch.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
016	My blade is a demon slashing blade…but you are not its main target.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
017	In order to dispatch the true "demon," I wield this blade in the shadows.
018	…What are you implying?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
019	You can't possibly be unaware.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
020	…I have no interest in your blathering. My sole purpose is to be king and make Wadatsumi a kingdom of demons.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
021	…So long.
022	…Miscreants--every last one… You're there, aren't you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
023	I was wondering what happened. You had high hopes for that girl… To think she managed to escape.
024	Confound it! If you were watching, you could have aided me.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
025	Demons operate by their own code, do they not? I don't have a part to play in this.
026	Are you just an all-seeing god? Is this not all your doing?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
027	Not at all. All is for the future of Wadatsumi.
028	…Always disappearing so suddenly-- You think you can just manipulate us.
029	Well, if you are the artist, I am the brush.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
030	I won't allow you to do as you please.
031	*Pant* *Pant* What happened to--	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
032	It's okay, she'll catch up soon enough.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
033	…Sorry I'm late.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
034	!!!
035	Ah! When did you--	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
036	…Fast as ever, Jubei. Thanks for your help back there. We owe you one.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
037	No need to thank me. I was tracking the demons' movements anyway.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
038	Er…well, we're deeply indebted to you! My name is Amane and--	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
039	Introductions are unnecessary. I heard about you from Lady Celis.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
040	…Oh?
041	I can't always be around to assist you... Be on guard… Both of you.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
042	Wait! Where are you going?
043	We have chosen different paths. It should not matter where I go.
044	But--	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
045	Now that I know what we're dealing with…we must go our separate ways in order to reach the true "demon."	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
046	The true "demon…"
047	In any case, you are not my enemies... I'm sure we'll meet again.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
048	…Do you ever plan on coming back? I'm sure now--	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
049	I am a "traitor" who killed her comrade. My return would just cause trouble.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
050	You killed…your comrade--	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
051	So long.
052	Ah…
053	…I'll explain it all later. Let's head back for now.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
054	…To where we belong.
055	…Alright.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
