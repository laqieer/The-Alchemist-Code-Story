001	This is...the dragon?! I thought it was referring to the top of the mountain, but this whole area is the dragon?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
002	No wonder this mountain range in Saga is called the Dragon's Spine... It's actually the spine of a dragon!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
003	What the hell?! It's glowing green!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
004	Tina! Mocca! Get down!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
005	?!
006	The forest... It's on fire!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
007	If we don't put it out now, all of Saga will be in flames! We have to hurry! Eugh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
008	Tina?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
009	Aghhhhhhhh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0025
010	This is...the future I glimpsed that day of what would befall Saga!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
011	So, you saw this in one of your premonitions? Then that means the dragon must be...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
012	Tina, Mocca, Lisbeth! Are you all safe and sound?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0027
013	Voda, my apologies. Asena is...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0036
014	We can talk later. First, we need to deal with the dragon. Could it be a manifestation of nature itself? A living embodiment of its rage and fury?	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
015	Alia...did you foresee this? Did you entrust the fate of Saga to us?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
016	It is just as our ancestors have foretold: "Those who walk not with nature shall endure judgment under the ancient dragon."	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
017	Tehre, you knew of this, and yet you murdered Asena?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
018	I had to be certain...but we will need to formulate a new plan. I had no idea the dragon would be this mammoth monstrosity!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
019	Hey! Isn't that—?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
020	It swallowed an entire village! It's going in the direction of Lilith's Hill! Fuu!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0021
021	You don't need to tell me! I will go evacuate the villagers. Don't you dare get yourselves killed in the meantime!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
022	The Forest of Rukifojio is on fire, too! Dang it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
023	Tina, slow down! What do you expect to do on your own?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
024	I can't just stand around! It's going to destroy our homeland! We've got to stop the dragon!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
025	This is my home, too! But what we need to do right now is come up with a plan to prevent as many casualties as possible.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0014
026	I will join you in evacuating the locals! Tehre, I leave this place to you!	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
027	I'm coming, too! My magic should be able to extinguish some of the flames! Tina, Mocca, stay safe!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
028	The ancient dragon of legend... Immense as it is, its size will impair its movement. We will have ample opportunity to strike.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
029	How can you be so calm?! You're the reason we're in this mess to begin with!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
030	I am devising a plan of attack, just as you suggested. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear as if they'll give us any chance to execute it, though.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
031	There are Jam coming from its body! Get ready, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
