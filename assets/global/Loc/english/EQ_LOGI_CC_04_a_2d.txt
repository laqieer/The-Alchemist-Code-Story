001	...! Huff...huff!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
002	What's the matter, Logi? Are you not gonna attack?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0004
003	I...I'd very much like to, but...you have no opening! How can you obtain so much power?	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
004	I obtained my power only for myself.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0040
005	Logi, you are going to obtain an even greater power than that which I could obtain.
006	Huh...?
007	The power that you obtain to protect yourself will, ultimately, only protect you.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0017
008	Find people that share your aspirations and do whatever you can to protect them. That's how you must obtain your power.
009	All this time, I have blindly wielded my blade. I couldn't achieve that level of power, but you can, Logi.
010	I can do something that you couldn't...?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
011	Those who surround themselves with friends and allies are always the ones with the power to choose justice. This choice is not born from a sword that ends lives.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
012	Logi, first you encounter friends and allies whom you wish to protect.
013	Find friends and allies and protect them? Do you think I can find them that easily? And can I succeed where I've failed before?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
014	... ...
015	N-not good! The bandits are here again!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
016	Ack. They're coming in droves! There's nothing left for them to steal!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
017	What?! Bandits have made it this far?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
018	Se-Setsuna! Please wait. There's too many of them!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
019	Why? You're coming with me too, aren't you?	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0025
020	Oh...um, yes! Of course, I will!
021	I want to protect this village that let me stay all this time, but...!
022	Logi, you just asked me whether you could succeed where you've failed before.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0002
023	...Yes.
024	I'm not one to give you kind words of comfort and I doubt they would be of any help. Instead, let me just tell you this...
025	You will never succeed unless you resolve yourself to making this happen.
026	Understood!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
027	First of all, as practice, you can try by doing your best to protect me.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0031
028	Got it!
029	Let's go. Those who aim to take have no empathy.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_battle_0030
030	It's not just Setsuna. I need to protect all those who are dear to me!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0014
