001	I'm glad we got that over with, but I'm surprised that one country's civil war could have such an impact on the surrounding environment.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
002	As the population rises, so does the country's power, and so, too, does its need for resources. It will soon do all that it can to obtain such resources.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
003	This is one form of prosperity, which Gluttony Foss has chosen to adopt.
004	So this is the result of neglecting nature and balance.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
005	However, none can truly say that they were wrong.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
006	Humans are weak and fragile. Though highly adaptable, it is necessary for humankind to come together as one.
007	Balance is everything. The balance between nature and people, between light and dark, between compassion and power... All things are built atop balance and necessity.
008	That may be true, but...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
009	Bigotry is the seed of tragedy. As one who has dealings with the Truth, you must be aware of that.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
010	Sure, but we we're not gonna last long if we keep getting assaulted like this.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
011	Isn't there a route that we can take to avoid them?
012	Hmm...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
013	...
014	Ah, and I suppose this is where I come in.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0045
015	We need to find a route with the least chance of encountering monsters. Can you give us a reading?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
016	Well, let's see. First, head to that large stone over there.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0004
017	Are we out of the desert already?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
018	He is very adept at navigating the desert. Phantoms are not merely pawns for us to fight our battles with.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
019	They unleash their power as needed by the caster. They are our most trusted allies.
020	You seem to have no hesitation about using Alchemy.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
021	This power is the blessing Sephiron bestowed upon me. There is no reason for me to shun it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
022	The Sephira have always possessed powers like this.
023	Something similar to the Ouija we Shamans of Saga wield, I suppose.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
024	That sounds about right. Let's rest here for a moment.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_031
025	It's going to be a long journey. We should recover from the day's exhaustion while we can.
026	I never thought of Alchemy not being taboo.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
