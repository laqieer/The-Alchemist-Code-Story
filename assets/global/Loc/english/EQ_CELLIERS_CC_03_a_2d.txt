001	...Wh-where am I?
002	Awake now, are you?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
003	Flamel...! Wh-where's Mielikki?! A-augh...
004	Don't force yourself to get up. Your power ran amok, and you lost consciousness.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0017
005	Don't worry about Mielikki. She's gone to tend to her flower bed.
006	Oh, right. The flower bed...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0037
007	I was unable to capture your assailants. Forgive me.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0022
008	N-no, that's my line. I'm sorry I caused so much trouble...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0039
009	...They were after your crystals. I suppose Michael was right to be concerned.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
010	......
011	Is there any veracity to their claim? That your crystals have the power to remove curses.
012	...One of the guys involved in my experiment said something to that effect.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
013	Still, any attempt they made to remove curses seemed to end in failure. That power must be beyond me.
014	In fact, all this power's done is put Mielikki in danger. Even take her precious beloved flowers, and—
015	Celliers, you're awake! Thank the stars!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
016	Mielikki...
017	...Are you okay, Celliers? You're not looking too hot.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
018	I'm... I'm so sorry, Mielikki. Your precious flowerbed, I—	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
019	You, nothing! You didn't do anything wrong! It's those jerks that caused this!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
020	You saw them stomp all over my flowers, and got upset on my behalf, didn't you?
021	But they were after me. That makes this all my fault.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
022	Celliers...
023	......
024	......
025	...Um, perhaps the two of you would accompany me to our laboratory for now?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0001
026	You should go into hiding for now—Celliers, of course, but you as well, Mielikki. They've seen your face, after all.
027	We have ample security at the laboratory. Even if they show up, we can drive them away. What do you say?
028	Hmm... What do you think, Celliers?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
029	...I'm for it. If this happens again, the villagers might be the next ones caught in the crossfire.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
030	(And if anything else were to happen to Mielikki, I...)
031	Okay, then it's settled! If you're going, I'm going, too!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0038
032	Very well. We should set up at once.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0032
