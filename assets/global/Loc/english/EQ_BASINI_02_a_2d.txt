002	You can only be here for one reason. You've come to erase me, haven't you?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
003	Corpse's duty is twofold: to deliver a warning to those who threaten to stumble on the truth, and to eliminate those who do come too close.
004	Why would you come here, knowing the price you would pay?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003
005	In order to preserve the order of this world.
006	That is not your burden to bear.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
007	The order of this world is ours to protect. The Lord Commander must serve as a guiding light...but in your weakness, the light you cast is frail.
008	Poor, pallid Lord Commander, wavering in the darkness... I will gauge the threat you pose by my own hand.
011	How can you stay with Corpse, knowing Waginau's true goals?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
012	As long as he does not threaten the world's order, he is no concern of mine.
013	Well, if you think I'll go quietly despite that, you've got another thing coming!
018	Nngh...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
019	Your doubts and your hastiness still dull your blade.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
020	You have failed to heed my lessons.
022	Why do you still follow Waginau, with this kind of strength at your command?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
023	When new and disruptive powers arise, those who would use them for evil ends soon follow. Corpse secures such powers and keeps them from the masses.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
024	Powers such as the Mecha Weapon that stood against the Giant Taurus.
025	Then...it was you!
026	You were the one who killed Judith's father!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
027	I did not wield the blade myself.
045	But you should understand better than anyone the nature of our work.
028	Whenever a destabilizing power emerges, Corpse intervenes to secure or eliminate it before it can plunge the world into chaos.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0004
029	Thus is order preserved, and we will stop at nothing to maintain it.
046	All the more so when some unwitting fool stumbles across the secret of the Cursed Beasts.
031	I cannot deny that great power can bring catastrophe if it falls into the wrong hands...but not everyone is so callous.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
032	There are those who seek power for the good of all. To protect the world, not to plunge it into chaos.
033	I have known such people myself. I once walked by their side.
034	My resolve is their legacy...and so I cannot allow anyone to stand in my way.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
036	Resolve serves no end but to undermine this world's order.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
043	Once upon a time, I was just another Corpse recruit under your command. But now...	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
044	Now I am the Lord Commander, the living embodiment of absolute justice!
