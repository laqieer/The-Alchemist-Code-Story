001	He was so good at spinning tops.
002	The top would spin on and on.
003	He would spin one for me whenever I would start crying.
004	It always cheered me up.
005	I would beg to have a turn, take the top from him, and practice with all my heart.
006	Now don't just force it. You wrap the yarn around and around like this...
007	Around and around! Then what?!
008	Then you relax your shoulders and fling it.
009	Relax, then...fling it!
010	Hahahahaha! Not bad, not bad!
011	It brought me joy when I could spin the top well.
012	It made me feel like I could make my brother happy, the same way he made me happy.
013	Soon, I became skilled with a blade as well.
014	The promise we made under those stars...
015	To protect Wadatsumi together...
016	I was a disappointment to my father, who desperately wanted a son for the sake of the Kagomurasaki Clan's traditions.
017	I wanted to make my father proud. As the future head of the clan, and to keep the promise I made with my brother, I spent my days training furiously.
018	I would come home all bruised and worn, and my brother would gently brush the tangles from my hair. It always made me feel better.
019	He helped me forget how I could never live up to my father's expectations.
020	To protect Wadatsumi, to keep my promise with my brother, and to gain my father's approval...I pushed myself to the limit.
021	Then...my brother killed my father.
022	He killed everyone in the clan, broke our promise, and ran away from home.
023	He was so good at spinning tops.
024	Uh-oh. Whoops. Definitely took a wrong turn somewhere, haha. Erm, so... There was another way into the mansion, but it was a while back.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
025	That would cost us precious time! We push on through!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
026	Aw, Jin... I know we're in a bit of a hurry, but haven't you heard that haste makes waste?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
027	Right...but...	VO_zin.zin_chara_1007
028	Who's that there, plotting away? I am Leafah, General of Greed Dike! Do not think I will hesitate to apprehend interlopers!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
029	You two alone wouldn't want to fight all of us now, would you?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
030	We aren't anybody you need to be concerned with. We're just on our way to the Shiba Senko mansion to save Yomi.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
031	Ren!
032	Trust me, this is easier. If they aren't the type to negotiate, then we'll just force our way through.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
033	Did you say Yomi? What do you mean by saving her?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
034	...
035	Well...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
036	The Shiba Senko are planning on exploiting Yomi for her Discarnate Power? Are you serious?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
037	That would be such a weird thing to lie about.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
038	I'm also going to take back the sword that can dispel the demon from her.
039	You mean Sumeragi?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
040	Yeah. I mean, the Shiba Senko've got their hands on both the Discarnate Power that threatens Wadatsumi, and Sumeragi, the sword that can exorcise its influence.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
041	Not exactly ideal, now is it?
042	Then it would seem that your goals align with ours.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
043	Oh, really? Sweet.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
044	Greed Dike intends to manage and regulate the turmoil within Wadatsumi.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
045	Unfortunately for you, there are rumors that you are the root of all of this chaos...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
046	Jin, the Demonic Killer.
047	...
048	Whew! Ain't you famous!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0024
049	You're seen as an aggressor against the Shiba Senko, who have now allied with the Kagomurasaki in order to hide away your sister and exploit her powers.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
050	The question now arises as to whom I should believe—the monster who killed his entire family, or the Shiba Senko, the most prominent clan in Wadatsumi.
051	Oh, shoot. This does not look good. Do you take bribes? Uh-oh, should I not have said that?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
052	What do you get out of saving Yomi, anyway?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
053	Erm, I just sort of got mixed up in this, but if I had to give a reason...? I guess it would be to take the next step forward. I figured I've run from my responsibilities for long enough.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
054	And you?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
055	I want to help Yomi face her future. That's all.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
056	Hmm...
057	So, you think Yomi is averting her eyes from her own future?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
058	What do you know of her?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0006
059	We watched each other's backs...once.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
060	If I'm the reason she can't move on with her life, then it's my duty to free her from what's holding her back.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
061	I must help her come to terms with her past...with what I did.
062	Let them pass.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
063	G-General?! We're going to take them at their word?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
064	He speaks like Yomi, with the same glimmer in his eyes.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
065	What do you...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
066	When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
067	There have been those who showed me their determination, and there have been those who poured out their hearts and souls before me.
068	Ever since I was little, I have been despised and looked down upon. As a result, I do not trust others easily.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
069	Who really does, though, right? Right? No one?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
070	A person's eyes will reveal whether they are lying to me or not.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0003
071	We, too, are looking away from the past and toward the future.
072	But...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
073	I will take full responsibility! Let them pass!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
074	Hahaha! Well, that went better than expected! Buh-bye now!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
075	...
076	Jin, why do you choose to shoulder all of your burdens alone?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
077	Ren is an idealist, but reality is harsh. It does not concern an outsider like you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
078	Let me tell you a secret.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
079	A secret?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
080	You wish to save your sister.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0003
081	I do.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
082	I wish to...g-gain a...f-friend.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
083	What?
084	This is the only place we haven't looked yet. It has to be here!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
085	Th-this is...!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
086	Sumeragi, the legendary sword! It...looks just like an ordinary sword. Can it really exorcise demons?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0024
087	Oh, wait, I remember my sister saying something about how to get Sumeragi to exorcise demons.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
088	Hmm...
089	Oh well. The Discarnate Power hasn't shown itself, so there's no harm in just taking this—	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
090	Whoooaaa!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0028
091	The intruder's caught in the trap! Get him!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
092	An alarm? As soon as I pick up the sword?! Oh, nooo. I'm sooo scaaared. How'd you guys get this to work, anyway?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0046
093	Oh. Wow. That's a lot of guards.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0024
094	Haha! This is getting good! This is getting really good! Thanks for the warm welcome!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
095	Are you nervous that I'm not nervous? Smart! I'll give you a hint as to who's going to be in trouble in a moment: It's not me!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
096	I knew something was off, ever since I heard Yomi's story.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
097	Yomi said she doesn't like the idea of having to kill you.
098	There's no way someone like you would kill his entire family without a legitimate reason.
099	If your plan is to protect Yomi, then I'll lend you a hand. Anything f-for a f-f-friend.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
100	Why would an outsider from Greed Dike want to meddle in my private affairs?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
101	I-I said...anything for a f-friend.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
102	You should just leave me be.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
103	...
104	Wow. You are really terrible at hiding your true feelings.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
105	I never said I was good at it.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
106	It's written all over your face.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
107	What is?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0044
108	That you're hurting inside.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
109	...
110	Psh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
111	Ha! Hahahahahaha!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0023
112	Having been charged with oversight of the general state of Wadatsumi, I cannot simply leave you to your troubles!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
113	Hahaha! Such a childish assumption!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0008
114	Who're you calling childish?! I just look young!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1003
115	Hah! No doubt about that.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
116	It's just a pity that your maturity doesn't show because of your baby face.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
117	You dare...? Why does it feel like I'm still being patronized?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0043
118	Please.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
119	Will you lend me a hand?
120	I thought I was an outsider.	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
121	I can't call someone who wants to become my sister's friend an outsider.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
122	You listened to her when she had much to get off her chest, did you not?
123	Well, yes. Just for a little while.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
124	That's more than enough. In fact, I'd be grateful if you could continue to lend her your ear going forward. Please.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0033
125	As her friend.
126	Jin, you...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
127	What's written all over my face this time?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
128	Something...I hope I'm reading correctly.
129	...
130	Come! For both Greed Dike and Wadatsumi's sakes, we must combine our strength!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0007
131	We are not here to slaughter! We came to unveil the cause of turmoil in Wadatsumi! Onward, to the Shiba Senko mansion!
