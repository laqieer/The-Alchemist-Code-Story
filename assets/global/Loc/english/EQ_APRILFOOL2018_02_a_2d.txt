001	Yo, look at all these monsters! Why'd this Chihaya person decide to hide out in this mess?	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
002	Her way of thinking is too naive.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
003	Her intentions may have been good, but she failed to consider how her actions could bring about war.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
004	Chihaya is a shrine maiden who is trying to restore the land of her war-torn country. The locals trust her deeply.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
005	In the midst of her activities, I heard she was under attack by someone who wields Alchemy.
006	So, she ran away into this cave with a kid called Mizuchi, huh?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
007	Apparently, it was this Mizuchi who contacted the Holy Guard.
008	So...we just need to rescue this Chihaya and Mizuchi, yeah?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
009	No more talk. Focus on fighting.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0015
