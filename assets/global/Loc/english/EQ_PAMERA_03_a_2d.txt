001	Oh, wow! She's gone, just like that!	VO_pamera.pamera_battle_0014
002	That's all for today!
003	Whoa! Pamela, you're awesome! That was great!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0046
004	Eheheh. I guess I got really into it.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
005	Group work is so much fun! This is my first time working with others, so I'm really excited!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0008
006	Really? Well then, let's keep working hard again together next time, too!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
007	How about you try working at all next time?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0001
008	Yeah, yeah.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0037
009	You three did wonderfully today. I was wondering what was going on when you came in together, right at the chime, but...	VO_celine.celine_sys_0007
010	I can't complain about these results. You three make a great combination.
011	Yeah! You're right! Eheh.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
012	Indeed.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0025
013	Heh. Well, it's lunch break, so why don't we all eat lunch outside together? The weather is really nice.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
014	Yay! That sounds fun!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0037
015	Oh, I forgot my lunch. I'm gonna go buy something, so go on ahead.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0036
016	Okay. Let's go, Pamela.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
017	Hey, Ms. Celine...?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0001
018	Sorry to keep you waiting!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0036
019	No problem!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0023
020	It was a good opportunity to get to know Noah better!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
021	You're exaggerating.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
022	Pamela! There you are! You didn't arrive at the specified time so I came looking for you!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0012
023	Oh yeah! I forgot!
024	But I'm going to have lunch with these two now, so I'll come and join you later, once—	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0007
025	Lunch?! Who do you think you are?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0013
026	Oh... I... Uh... Is it something to get so mad over? If people don't eat they die, you know!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0025
027	Obviously!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
028	That's not the issue here! If you need lunch, we'll arrange that, so come. Get a move on.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0014
029	The preparations are already made and we can't miss this chance! Well? Hurry up!
030	H-hey! What is wrong with you? This is not acceptable! Pamela doesn't want to go with you, or is that not obvious enough?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
031	Noah's right! Let Pamela go!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
032	Shut up. This has nothing to do with you average school girls!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0015
033	We are under the orders of the Helkovara family. If we say so, you'll be expelled. Is that what you want, Noah?
034	What?!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
035	I said I'll come later!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0013
036	What difference does it make to you if you come now or later? There's no reason for you to be so attached to this school where you have no friends!
037	Th-that's...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0020
038	You were abandoned by your family. The only purpose of your existence is to devote the use of your magic to our cause. That is the only reason you've been allowed to live this long.
039	...	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0018
040	Pamela...
041	(We're the same, she and I.)
042	I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
043	I'm sorry. Don't be mad. I'll be good, so don't be mad. I'll be good.
044	Please don't say you don't need me anymore!
045	I should never have had you!
046	(Pamela is in the same position as I was back then... She's given up looking for someone to save her.)
047	(I can't just leave her be.)
048	Who let you come to school at all? Who let you live to such an age? It's high time you repay that debt!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0017
049	Excuse you... You're really damn annoying, you know that?	VO_emma.emma_battle_0011
050	Excuse... Excuse me?!
051	No one gets to decide Pamela's reason to live except for her!	VO_emma.emma_battle_0019
052	What are you getting all upset about? This has nothing to do with you!
053	Of course it does. You're talking about dooming my friend to some weird fate of your choosing!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0032
054	Emma...!
055	Emma is correct. Your uncompromising attitude is unacceptable, and I—for one—am thoroughly opposed.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0017
056	Heed me, Noah... These delinquent children will wind up getting even you, an honor student, expelled! What a waste that would be!
057	Emma and Pamela are my friends. Don't you dare insult my friends!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0012
058	I'm your...friend?
059	What nonsense! This brat couldn't possibly make any friends!
060	Wrong. She's already made some. We three get along awfully well, don't we girls?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
061	Awfully well. What's more, we friends are about to have lunch, so why don't you take your high hat and toddle off to bother someone else?
062	You cocky brats!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
063	Enough! We don't have time for this! Come along, Pamela!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0014
064	I get it now. So that's how it works... That's how you make friends.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0044
065	All my efforts were just clouding the heart of the matter.	VO_pamera.pamera_chara_1017
066	What are you on about?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
067	What it comes down to is that I have friends here, and if I have friends here, then I have ties to this school!
068	I haven't even had the chance to eat lunch with my friends, yet!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0008
069	You expect your debts to just vanish into thin air?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0013
