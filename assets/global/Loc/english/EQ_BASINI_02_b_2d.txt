001	What?! She took my strike on purpose...to create an opening?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
002	Have you forgotten? I feel no pain.
003	Pain and resolve alike only hinder me. They are meaningless before the order I am sworn to defend.
005	She always did fight with no regard for her own life. All that ever mattered to her was eliminating her target.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
006	In the old days that made her a powerful ally, but now it makes her a deadly foe.
007	Try as you might, you cannot defeat me.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
008	I wouldn't be so sure!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
009	...
010	(Why? Why are you so...?)	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
011	You've changed, Basheeny.
012	Does that hurt?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
013	It's just a souvenir from my last mission. It doesn't bother me anymore.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
014	You're lying.
015	Hah. I should have known I could never fool you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
016	These wounds stem from your doubts and your hastiness. You must kill such emotions, lest they hinder your mission.
094	Unless, of course, you plan to abandon Corpse...and follow your most recent targets to the grave.
095	Why would I do that? Running away wouldn't solve anything.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
096	My targets turned against Corpse because their mistaken resolve led them astray.
017	They misunderstood their roles. We of Corpse exist only to serve.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
018	So you do understand. There is hope for you yet.
019	You know, I could get used to hearing you say that.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
020	That is another lie.
021	Got me again, eh? You always could see right through me.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
022	You may deceive others, but you will never fool me. I can sense the resolve of others. Remember that.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
023	You were right to say that resolve undermines order. Those who seek to protect the world's order have no need of it.
025	I only hope I can be like you someday.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
026	Now that you understand what you must do, you need only to put it into practice.
097	(I really can't sense any resolve from her at all...)	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
098	...
099	There is no need to dwell on things so.
027	I...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
028	Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
100	Nor does life, if it comes to it.
030	Human resolve lies at the root of all chaos and conflict. The world has no need for individual will.
033	I can sense my own resolve inside me...and I cannot stand it.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
035	All I desire is to follow in your footsteps.
037	There is no need to dwell on things so.
039	Perhaps you're right.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
045	...
046	(So he still can't wield Excalibur's power fully...and that's the least of his problems.)	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
048	As long as your resolve persists, your attacks are as clear as day to me.
049	Ungh...	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
050	You truly have changed, Basheeny.
051	And you are the same as ever. Do you still consider Corpse a necessary evil, even now?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
052	Good and evil are not my concern. It is the preservation of order that I serve.
053	And does crippling the Holy Guard help to preserve order?
057	So long as the world remains in balance, the truth of it justifies our actions.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
058	Irene!
059	Besides, in your current state, you are unworthy to be Lord Commander.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
062	You might be right, but I still have no intention of stepping down.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
064	Human resolve is what safeguards this world. My friends entrusted me with their resolve...and I won't betray it.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
065	Your ideals are a falsehood. You hold proof of that in your own two hands.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0016
101	How can a Lord Commander protect the order of Babel when he cannot even wield his own sword?
067	If human resolve is truly worthy of safeguarding the world, why does Excalibur not answer your call?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
068	...
069	I will trade no more words with you.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
070	You are unworthy of the title of Lord Commander.
072	If I judge you a threat to the balance of law and order, through incompetence or otherwise, I will eliminate you.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
074	Irene!
102	Let's go, Carlotta.
076	I know my own shortcomings only too well.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
077	...
081	If we faced them in our current state, could we survive? If only I could draw out Excalibur's true power, maybe I could find a way...
082	Your ideals are a falsehood. You hold proof of that in your own two hands.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0016
103	How can a Lord Commander protect the order of Babel when he cannot even wield his own sword?
083	Excalibur... The symbol of absolute justice, and a means of pacifying the Alchemy of Power should the Alchemy of Compassion ever be lost.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
084	A treasure bequeathed from Emmel, the founder of Alchemy, to the Lord Commander, the supreme judge, so that they might keep the balance.
085	Or so Lord Zain's notes claim. Although that, too, is drawn from Captain Kaya's observations.
086	And yet I am still unworthy of wielding it.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
087	If human resolve is truly worthy of safeguarding the world, why does Excalibur not answer your call?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0002
090	I know full well that I will never be Commander Kanon's equal.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
091	But I refuse to believe resolve is meaningless. I have seen its worth with my own eyes. I have been inspired to follow in its wake.
092	If I fall here, the last of my friends' resolve will die with me.
093	And that I cannot allow.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
