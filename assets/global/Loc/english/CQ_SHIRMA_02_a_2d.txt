001	Pick on somebody your own size! Got it?! Hmph. Next time, I won't let you off so easy!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0014
002	Polyma! Minera! It's all over now. Your friends are safe now!
003	I envy you guys... You're always together. It must be nice.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
004	I...really thought my sis and I would be together forever, just like this.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
005	I love her so much. She's the only family I have, but even more than that...she's my hero.
006	Lord Zahar must keep moving forward. However, I'm...afraid.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
007	I'm not worthy of being by his side.
008	Is this really what you wanted?
009	Sis... Did you really have to...?
010	I guess...
011	I want to know. In fact, I need to know.
012	...
013	She's never coming home, is she?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
014	Never...
015	Wh-what is it, you two?! What are you chattering about all of a sudden?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
016	Jeez... Huh? The wolf from earlier brought friends?
017	Oh gosh... There are so many of them!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
018	I'd heard that some beasts who got chased out of another forest had settled here, but...
019	Ohh! I wish I'd talked to my sister about it before she left.
020	I don't think she was really up to giving me advice, though.
021	Either way, I have no choice but to take care of this myself!
022	Nngh... They just keep coming.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
023	Argh! N-no!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0043
024	Silma!
025	Sis!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
026	Wh-why?! I thought you'd...!
027	Do I really need a reason to protect my sister?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
028	B-but I thought you'd already left. You're strong enough to keep going, even alone.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
029	No, I'm not. You should know better than anyone how weak I am.
030	I ran away. From my...hero.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
031	But we don't have time to dwell on that right now. Let's take care of the threat standing before us first!
