001	Aahhh...mortal. I pray unto thou... Forgive me...for I...have...sinned.
002	This is it... The final core of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
003	Will you cleave it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
004	There's no need. It is no longer plagued by the corruption.
005	Whoa! What the hell was that?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
006	The dragon has lost its final core—it's beginning to deteriorate. If we don't do something quickly, we'll be trapped!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
007	Then what are we waiting for?! We need to run! Now!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
008	Right. We've come too far. I'm not about to die here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
009	I will save them all myself! This region, Sephiron, the Sephira people...and Emmel! I will not allow any of them to come to harm!
010	Emmel...? What are you doing here?! Are you all right?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
011	N-Nimul... Julia... Julia is...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0019
012	I...see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
013	Look, guys, we've gotta go! Hold on tight, okay? We're gonna blast our way out of here at maximum speed!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
014	Hmph... And so...the Great Nidhogg sinks into its eternal slumber amidst the Forest of Suga.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
015	All living beings, regardless of their might, will one day return to the earth.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
016	Their spirit will in turn nourish new life, and the cycle will go on, creating order anew for all the world.
017	Nothing is wasted under the circle of life.
018	That is...true enough.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
019	...
020	Unnghh... N-no... J-Julia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0019
021	I get that you're upset, but can we get back to the village now? I mean, the Matter is complete, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
022	It is. All that is left is for us to return and put an end to the tyranny of the Cursed Beast, once and for all.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
023	Hold on... What is that?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
024	What's the matter, Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	Look! Over there, in the direction of the village!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0028
051	Nidhogg...is no more.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
052	Twas the last friend that mortal filth has known for some time.
053	Hence...the time of the covenant has passed.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
054	Mortals... Filth thrown unto the world... Know that no one is left to watch over your fruitless floundering.
055	All that remains for you is my way... My salvation.
056	Now, it is time. Awaken! Sins borne of mortal flesh.
057	Unto the mortals, you will bring nothing less than their deserved punishments...and thereby save the world.
026	Wh-what is that? It looks like something's falling from the Cosmic Egg!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
027	Nnngh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0043
028	Emmel...?! Are you all right?! What's wrong?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
029	Wh-what's...? My...head...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
030	The time of...awakening? N-no! Stop!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
031	Emmel! Wake up!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
032	Urrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
033	What?! What is that?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0028
034	S-something just...popped right out of the ground and...woke up the Cursed Beast!
035	The Light of Judgment.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
036	What?! Have you seen this before?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
037	Unfortunately...yes. My homeland was destroyed by light just like that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
038	What? Not by the Cursed Beast?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
039	No... I don't know anything about the light myself, but—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
040	Damnit! Adaleigh, turn this ship around! We need to get as far away from the village as possible!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
041	Huh? But—
042	Aaaaaaaaaaaaarrgghhhh!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0025
043	No! Aaarrgghhhh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
044	Everything happened in the span of a single moment.
045	Our bodies were rent by vibrations and rocked by a thunderous roaring so terrible that it threatened to tear us apart. Everything went dark, until...
046	Nnnghh... Is everyone all right?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0042
047	What was...? Of course... We must have been attacked by Beelzebub.
048	What is this place?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
049	Wait...! Am I...? Am I in a different region?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
050	Little did I know, a new trial awaited me...whether I was ready to meet it or not.
