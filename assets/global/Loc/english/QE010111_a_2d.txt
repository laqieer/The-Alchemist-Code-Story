001	Gabirond!
002	Dias, where were you? Just when we finally found Agatha...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
003	Agatha! Really?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
004	Yes.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
005	However, the Lizard Brigade used her as a shield. Unable to rescue her, we had no choice but to watch them take her.
006	Honestly...that devious lot.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0030
007	They used Agatha as a shield?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
008	Wratharis is treacherous by nature. They speak of peace, yet it's nothing more than a facade.
009	There is no doubt that they are attempting to use Agatha as leverage for their treaty.
010	They are taking advantage of Agatha's pure heart.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
011	I knew that from the start!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
012	Wratharis's rebellion has produced considerable tragedy in this world!
013	All of this has happened because we've averted our eyes from this fact!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
014	Let's go, Dias. We must do everything we can to destroy the Lizard Brigade. Agatha is in danger!
015	I'm well aware of that! Hold on, Agatha!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
