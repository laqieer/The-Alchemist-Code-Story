001	... ...
002	Retzius? What's the matter? You've been absentminded recently. Did something happen?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
003	Nothing's happened! That's the problem! Argh! I can't stand it.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0012
004	I see. So your uncharacteristic silence...was merely you racking your brain.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
005	I wonder if this is what I'm supposed to make of my life. Am I supposed to live out my days as a thief?! In order to survive, perhaps I have no other choice...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
006	But I want to live more passionately! I want to burn brighter! Do you understand what I mean?!	VO_retzius.retzius_chara_1011
007	Well, I'd be lying if I said I didn't, but...please, hang in there. That mindset of yours will get in the way of our work.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
008	Yeah, yeah. I know! I'll do my job properly. Um...was it around here?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0005
009	Yes. It's that house we can see over there.
010	Those unscrupulous merchants have been attempting to monopolize the oases around here... They're real hoarders, aren't they?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0010
011	Are you really all right on your own?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
012	Yeah. The rest of you guard the area and ensure our escape route. We're getting out of here as soon as the robbery is complete.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0004
013	Understood!
014	It all comes down to the when the sun sets. All right, let's pull this off!	VO_retzius.retzius_event_1012
015	...Tsk!
016	Why are there so many guards?! This is news to me!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0017
017	Hmph. Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. You're a rather scrawny looking rat, aren't you?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
018	How dare you...! I'm not scrawny! I have the glorious name of Retzius...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0013
019	And now you've given up your name.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0023
020	Darn it!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0020
021	What an overconfident piece of trash. Take him out!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
022	...?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
023	...?
024	What...who are you?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
025	... ...
026	Argh...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
027	I will now be seizing all the possessions of this household. You, more than anyone, know the reason for this.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0002
028	Uck... Who...are you?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
029	My name is of little consequence. What is of consequence is what I was hired to do.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0010
030	Wo...wow...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0020
031	... ...
032	...Um!
033	...What is it?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0005
034	Um...thank you for...well...saving me.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0020
035	I don't recall saving you. I fulfilled my mission. That is all.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0016
036	...! Still, thank you! My name is Retzius. What's yours?	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0021
037	My name is of little consequence.	VO_rusia.rusia_chara_1002
038	Oh, um, well...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
039	Those who allow their circumstances to limit them will end up dead. That is all.	VO_rusia.rusia_event_1006
040	Oh...!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0020
041	...He...!
042	...Is so...cool!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0009
043	You really had me scared there, Retzius. We thought you were done for.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
044	Hmph. You idiots. That was a piece of cake for me.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0010
045	Um...Retzius...I've been wondering about this for a while, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
046	What is it?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0006
047	Well...that overconfident attitude doesn't really suit you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
048	....Oh, really? I guess I've got a long way until I reach that bro's level! His coolness was unreal...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
049	That bro...?
050	How can I say it...? It was like he was exuding masculine confidence! "My name is of little consequence"...hah! A man amongst men!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0005
051	All right, I've made my decision! I'm gonna become that man's disciple! As of today, our band of thieves is disbanded!	VO_retzius.retzius_event_1012
052	Whaaat?!
053	I've finally discovered the way of life for me! I'll become a man amongst men! Just you wait, bro!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0007
054	...But how are you going find someone whose name you don't even know?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
055	Yeah, that's the catch...hmm... Hey, do you have any ideas?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0029
056	You've put me on the spot, but...oh, that's right!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
057	I've heard about a fortuneteller in Lustburg who is always accurate! That being said, they're only rumors, so I'm not sure how much weight they hold...
058	That's it! Thanks! All right, hold on, bro!	VO_retzius.retzius_chara_1017
059	Hey, wait...! Retzius!
060	Thanks for everything until now! Stay healthy!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0008
061	...I've never seen Retzius so excited about anything before.
062	Good luck, Retzius!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
063	Phew. All right, I've finally arrived. Now, where's the fortuneteller's house...? Ack...there's no one to ask anyone this late at night.	VO_retzius.retzius_chara_1011
064	(...Wait. What is that girl doing out alone in the middle of the night?)	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
065	... ...
066	(What is she doing? Is there something up there in the sky? Anyway, I'll ask her about the fortuneteller.)	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0006
067	Hey...hold on!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_1050
068	Well, well. You really shouldn't be walking around alone this late at night.
069	Tsk. What timing. Actually, I can get some directions!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0016
