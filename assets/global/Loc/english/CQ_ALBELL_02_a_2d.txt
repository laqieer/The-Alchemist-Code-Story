001	Sigh... What's wrong with them? Who tries to take someone by force?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
002	It seems like they want to use my fortune-telling abilities.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
003	Yeah, I guessed as much.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1015
004	Albea, thank you for saving me.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0003
005	It's fine. After all, I need to talk with you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
006	I want to listen to what you have to say, but...	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0031
007	What is it now? They're not here anymore.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
008	No. But the stars are still badly aligned.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
009	They seem quite serious today. More of them will come today.	VO_deneb.deneb_battle_0019
010	Please, run away.
011	No. I have an older brother. He used to be a skilled Alchemist.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0040
012	Used to be?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0025
013	Yes. He serves in the Holy Guard. Apparently, he's not an Alchemist anymore. Besides, I've never met him once.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
014	What I really want to know about is my brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
015	Tell me! Is he still alive? If he is, where is he? What kind of person is he?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
016	I would like to read your fortune, but there's no time. They're closing in again. Please, hurry!	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0035
017	That's for me to decide. And I have no intention of running away.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
018	If more of them are coming, I'll take them out. Then, I'll have you read my fortune.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
019	You're surprisingly stubborn. Heheh.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
020	I get that a lot. I'm called the "stubborn artisan."	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
021	Heheh. It's perfect for you.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0008
022	Yeah? I don't really understand it myself.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
023	...! Here they come.	VO_deneb.deneb_battle_0019
024	Deneb! How dare you treat my subordinates like that!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
025	They really are persistent!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
026	Huh? Who are you? Oh, well that's a pretty face you've got on you. How about we sell you off as well?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
027	What? You're a vile and greedy bunch, aren't you? I'm under no obligation to follow your orders!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
028	Shut up! Both of you come quietly! If you don't...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
029	You'll suffer for it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
030	We'll see who does the suffering!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
