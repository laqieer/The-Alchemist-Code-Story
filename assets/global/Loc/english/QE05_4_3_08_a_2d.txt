001	O Great Tree of Calamity... Reverse all that has come before!
002	These guys are practically falling on their swords here! Urgh... Kamui, we won't be able to hold them back forever!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
003	Huzzah!
004	It looks like we can cut them down, but there's just too many for us to take them on one by one!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
005	Something strange is going on here. No matter how many we defeat, they just keep coming.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0025
006	There are so few Sephira left now. Ceclidis' reach is wide, but I cannot understand how he could bring together so many... It should be impossible.
007	You make me laugh, Protector! Have you not realized it yet?
008	What?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
009	No, wait... It cannot be! Your bodies... You are not human?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0021
010	I told you, Protector. The Sephira are no more.
011	We are the Fallen! We abandoned our human vessels in our quest for wisdom and truth! We have been reborn into a new form of existence...as the Jam!
012	N-no... That can't be possible!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0018
013	That pathetic, quavering anguish on your face... Yes. That is what I like to see.
014	Still, no good thing is made to last. I shall extend you one final mercy. We shall swallow you up and put an end to your suffering!
