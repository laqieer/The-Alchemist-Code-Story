001	So that's the Central Intelligence Administration. I see...the pompous amount of security definitely makes it stand out.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
002	Can we save the chatter for later? That's an incredible amount of Guard Droids!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0016
003	Plus, the Hounds should be catching up with us soon!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
004	In other words, we're blocked off from both sides. Well...either way, we've no choice but to ride in. Might as well make a show of it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
005	...I'll be back in a bit. Hide somewhere safe.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
006	Wait, are you gonna try to ride in on your own?! That's way too reckless!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0017
007	Jeez. You're talking to the wrong guy. Save those words for the Guard Droids that are standing in our way.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	Idiot! This is a facility where they gather information, right?!
009	What are you gonna do if they order all the Guard Droids around the vicinity to gather here?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0015
010	Who knows? I've got no clue what's gonna happen. You'll have to direct your questions elsewhere.
011	Are you serious?! You're totally gonna wing it, aren't you?! Miss, please say something to him!
012	B-but...the fact is we don't have any other option...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
013	...This way may actually work...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0018
014	Hmm... That's a good idea, aye.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
015	What's going on?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
016	Ehem. No need to worry about the Guard Droids, aye! We'll take care of them!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
017	Take care of them? What do you mean?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
018	Bzz... The Guard Droids at this facility work a 24-hour shift.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
019	Most likely...they are charged and exchange information wirelessly.
020	If we can find a wireless route and use his hacking skills...
021	We may be able to shut down the movement of the Guard Droids.
022	You can actually do that?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
023	Sure we can! We'll stake our hope on this one chance. That's what it means to be a man, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
024	Heh. Well said.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
025	Allie...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
026	While I jam the radio waves, my movement will become slow, aye.
027	Fiona, Ronnie, I want you to be on the look out!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
028	Got it! Edgar!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0006
029	Jeez. With the stakes this high, we can't afford to fail. Good luck, guys!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0041
030	Bzz... We'll stake our hope...on this one chance...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0020
031	Aye?
032	What you just...moved me...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0021
033	...Aye!
