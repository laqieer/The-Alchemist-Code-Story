001	Ahhh!!
002	Ugh...!
003	Not bad, witch!
004	Heheheh... Ohh, if I had blood it'd be boiling!
005	Come on, get up, Red! It's far from over!
006	That's... ENOUGH!
007	... ...
008	Berith trembles for a brief moment before his glow fades, rendering him silent.
009	(How curious...)
010	(She is more resilient than I thought.)
011	A loud alarm sounds off somewhere in the depths of the tunnels.
012	Hey! What's going on?!
013	It's that demon girl's cell! Gods, she'd better not have broken out!
014	You need to leave. Now.
015	Not going to surrender me to your masters?
016	...Don't make me change my mind.
017	You...
018	Red takes a deep, stabilizing breath.
019	You have more to say.
020	In time, I will.
021	We shall meet again, little helgwn.
022	Until then, cherish the memory of the older fox. Cherish the little joy it brings.
023	Tell me your real name, next time.
024	...!
025	With a shower of embers, Morrigan dissolves into thin air just as the guards burst into the cell.
026	Ugh...what a damned mess.
027	Looks like she's gone nuts again. At least nothing is actually on fire.
028	Tch. More work for us to do...
029	Don't touch me.
030	Not like I want to...I wanna live, you know.
031	The guards perform a rough sweep of Red's cell, then slam the gate noisily, leaving Red alone in the fading embers.
032	...
033	Who am I?...
034	Shadowed figures sit around a long table, glinting gazes giving away little as each eyes the other.
035	That concludes my report, Director.
036	And yes, all the information regarding Atropos's Core, as well as its method of reactivation, has already been compiled for you.
037	Unlike some people, I take pride in seeing a job to the end.
038	Hmph.
039	You sure made a mess in Greed Dike doing so. Extensive measures were taken to silence the populace.
040	Take care you do not jeopardize our organization while flaunting your firepower.
041	Hoooh? Far better than being a glorified doll whose tin-can soldiers had failed to guard even two simple prisoners!
042	Say that again. Louder.
043	Enough.
044	Sit down, Li Wang.
045	Of course, of course. My apologies, Director.
046	We will come to that later.
047	We may have Atropos now, but we are still missing the two keys to unlock the puzzle that is Lachesis.
048	Without her, Atropos is but a mindless Construct, devoid of sentience and body both.
049	Soren and that little girl cannot be suffered to run loose.
050	I will make certain of their recapture, Director. I sincerely apologize.
051	There is also the matter of Subject VI...
052	What do you make of it, Doktor?
053	The head researcher casts a nervous glance around the room, lingering on Eliza for a brief moment.
054	The experiments may have...certain unforeseen flaws due to factors outside of laboratory control, Director.
055	Namely that of...of the host's individual capacity for emotional response.
056	This isn't something we can definitively control while the subjects remain active agents on the field.
057	Hm.
058	The Director taps a heavy finger rhythmically upon the hardwood desk, as if measuring a response.
059	Grimm I.
060	Yes, Director.
061	You will be aiding Eliza in her endeavors. See to it that they do not escape again.
062	Your wish is my command.
063	Director, there is no need f—
064	...
065	I spoke out of turn. Thank you for your generous offer, Director.
066	With a dismissive wave, the Director stands to leave.
067	I expect better results next meeting.
