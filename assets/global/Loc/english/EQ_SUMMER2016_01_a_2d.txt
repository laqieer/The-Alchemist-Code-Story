001	In a resort area south of Envylia, a pirate ship docks without permission.
002	During this period, only small boats visiting the resort are allowed to dock.
003	After that day, monsters begin to appear one after the other within the beautiful resort, driving those in charge to their wit's end.
004	To ensure safety, phantoms are summoned and deployed.
005	To avoid a further decline in tourists, the resort resolutely opposes a shutdown.
006	To disguise them from the public eye, a priority is made to deploy phantoms who possess swimwear.
007	There's surprisingly little decline in tourists.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
008	Well, people usually decide their summer vacation plans well in advance. I guess they're pretty set once they make plans.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
009	A beautiful sea like this, I think I could forgive a few monsters. I'd probably come anyway!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0024
010	It looks like there's more than a few.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
011	Hey, what's that?! Oh, and that over there! Do you think it's edible?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
012	Huh? Are you gonna eat a lizard man?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
013	Rin, it's best you don't.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0011
014	Anyway, the safety of the tourists is our main priority! To avoid any more issues, we must keep the situation under control. Let's go!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
