001	I have to confess, I'm not fond of my own name.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
002	Button?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
003	My family saw it as a cute name.
004	Also because a button is an object to fasten things together.
005	They saw it as a fitting name for someone who would serve the royal family.
006	It's always sounded weird to me.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
007	It's nice, though.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
008	What is?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
009	Button.
010	What do you mean?
011	What do you want it to mean?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
012	I...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0039
013	Button... How beautiful.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
014	Which Button are you talking about? My name, or a button...?
015	The fitting one.
016	So, the one on clothing, then?
017	Maybe...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0031
018	Honestly...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0013
019	Heh. It's you I'm talking about, silly.
020	Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0009
021	Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!
022	A-are you talking to me?
023	Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...
024	It's just that you're a real live knight! Look, Ikasa! As I live and breathe, a knight! In the flesh!
025	That's hurtful, Button...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
026	I'm on patrol right now, you know.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
027	Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're on duty! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!
028	There are many knights more esteemed than I stationed at Spandau Castle.
029	I intend to visit the castle too, of course! It's just that seeing knights like you protecting the capital, watching the people here go about their days...
030	It's so much more exciting than seeing this place in pictures! It's just... This is it, you know? I'm really here! It's indescribable!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0046
031	She's like this with everyone.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
032	If you feel that strongly about it... Very well. Let's shake hands.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
033	Thank you so muuuuch!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0033
034	I'm really sorry about this.
035	Yes, I'm really sorry about this!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0035
036	Hmm... That's a rather exotic outfit.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
037	Oh! How rude of me. Where are my manners?! My name is Button.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
038	I am a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi traveling the world to further my studies and understanding of each culture.
039	How curious. I thought that Wadatsumi only allowed passage to and from Greed Dike.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
040	Well, exceptions are made when you're from the line of shrine maidens who serve the royal family.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
041	Conflict has died down in Wadatsumi of late, so traversing the border is not as difficult as it once was.
042	That is good! A promising sign of peace. I must apologize to you for my rudeness and ignorance, my lady. I had no idea you were of noble lineage. Please forgive me.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0006
043	Oh, no! Not at all! You weren't rude! There's nothing to forgive!
044	Thank you for your kindness, Lady Shrine Maiden.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
045	N-no, thank you! Thank you so much!
046	I didn't know you were the fangirl type.
047	Fan...girl?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
048	What is the right choice?
049	I keep asking myself that question, over and over again. To live up to my name. To become the savior of Wadatsumi.
050	Right versus wrong, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0031
051	Yet I still don't know the answer to my own question.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
052	Don't peek.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
053	Wh-what?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
054	I'm going to take a bath.
055	Wh-why would I?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0013
056	I mean, I've grown a lot. Bet you're curious to see how much.
057	I am not!
058	You haven't changed much, so...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0024
059	These clothes just make me look very slim, okay!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0012
060	Heheh. No peeking, okay?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0008
061	Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0009
062	Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!
063	Huh? Me?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
064	Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...
065	It's just that you're a real live knight! Look, Ikasa! As I live and breathe, a knight! In the flesh!
066	Really, that's hurtful, Button...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
067	I'm on patrol right now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
068	Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're on duty! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!
069	Okay. Why not? Let's shake hands.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
070	Thank you so muuuuch!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0033
071	I'm really sorry about this.
072	Yes, I'm really sorry about this!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0035
073	Are you going to be like this with everyone?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
074	Everything's just so...so new, and wonderful!
075	Heh. Total country bumpkin.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0029
076	Still, I must say that none of the seafood I've tried so far even comes close to beating Wadatsumi's.
077	Didn't know it was a competition.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
078	Hee hee!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
079	Y'know...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
080	Yes?
081	Ahem.
082	What about me?
083	Hm? What about you?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
084	Don't you have something to say to me?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
085	No...?
086	I'm a knight too.
087	I could ask you the same question.
088	Huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
089	Don't you have something to say to me?
090	Well...
091	I'm sorry.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0035
092	What're you apologizing for?
093	Not power?
094	No. Not power.
095	That's why you're accompanying me, isn't it?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
096	I guess.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
097	Having a Paladin accompany me on my travels is very...extravagant.
098	My father taught me about the use of Wadatsumi's Chakra and Samurai.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
099	Yeah, but they've got different names in Babel. Chakra is called Alchemia and Samurai are known as Phantom Soldiers.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
100	Alchemia is used in Alchemy. Alchemy can be used to summon Phantom Soldiers, but to do so is forbidden on the continent.
101	So the power that is a part of everyday life in Wadatsumi, and the Samurai we summon...are forbidden here.
102	Do you wonder why?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
103	No. I understand.
104	I figured. You would know better than most how devastating the abuse of Alchemy can be. Just look at the ongoing conflict in Wadatsumi.
105	The Magna Code dictates that the only people who are allowed to use Alchemy are members of the Holy Guard.
106	As such, my role is to protect you, but also to monitor you.
107	I see.
108	Doesn't sound great, does it?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0036
109	I don't mind. In fact, I support it.
110	You already knew, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
111	I believe that this world should be connected by something other than power.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0005
112	Oh, oh! Oh my goodness!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0009
113	Please, would you... Would you shake my hand?!
114	Huh? Are you talkin' to me?
115	Y-yes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course if you don't want to, I wouldn't presume to...
116	It's just that you're a gladiator! An actual living, breathing, talking gladiator! Can you believe it, Ikasa? We're speaking with a gladiator!
117	Huh.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
118	Wh-what is it?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
119	Oh, nothing.
120	I'm gettin' ready for my next match, y'know.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0031
121	Oh, of course! Of course! How silly of me. You're preparing! I didn't mean to disturb you. I'm so uncultured, you know. I don't know anything, anything at all!
122	Well, whatever. I've got time for a handshake. Put 'er there!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0006
123	Thank you so muuuuch!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0033
124	I'm really sorry about this.
125	Yes, I'm really sorry about this!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0035
126	Huh?
127	Whoops! Sorry.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0035
128	Oh, no, I should apologize. Are you all right?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
129	Bwahahaha! You idiot!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
130	Um...?
131	Check your pockets! Are you missin' anythin', lady?
132	Oh, um...
133	I don't think so?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
134	Wait a minute...
135	My luggage! It's all gone!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0026
136	Thief! Someone catch that lout!
137	I-it's all right! Please, don't worry about me. You've got your match to get to. I wouldn't want you to be late!
138	A-are you sure, lady? Are you gonna be all right on your own?
139	We'll be fine, I'm sure. After all—
140	Wait... On my own? But I'm not alone. Ikasa's right...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
141	She's gone!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0026
142	Guess she left you to fend for yourself, huh?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
143	No!
144	No.
145	You okay?
146	She promised me.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
