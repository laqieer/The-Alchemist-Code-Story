001	"Long ago, humans and animals lived harmoniously on the land of Wadatsumi."
002	"I was imagining that world when I was drawing this."
003	(A picture?)
004	"Even the despised serpents and the ferocious felines..."
005	"In ancient Wadatsumi, they were close friends."
006	"So, even you and I can—"
007	(This voice... So warm and familiar...)

009	(Wha—?! Where is this power surging from?!)	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
010	Ama...ne?	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
011	What the...hell is that...?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
012	Amane!
013	I grow tired of this!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021

023	Sometimes I do not know who I am. I cannot tell if I am cutting down demons myself, or if someone is killing them through me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
024	But now, none of that matters.
025	That voice, those visions... They are part of my everyday life now.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
026	To protect my everyday life, I will wield this blade as I see fit.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
027	This is who I am! Amane, member of the Third Squad of the Blade Fox Corps!
