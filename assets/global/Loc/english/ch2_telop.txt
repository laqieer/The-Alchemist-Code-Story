001	I've always given myself to the natural flow
002	With nothing but the clothes on my back...
003	Wherever the wind takes me
004	Resisting the natural flow
005	will only get you swallowed by the waves
006	You can entrust your future to the wind
007	That is way easier
008	than a path full of attachments
009	However...
010	A lady's tears are never needed for that
011	"I won't watch any lady cry."
012	In my wandering life,
013	that is my single
014	iron principle
