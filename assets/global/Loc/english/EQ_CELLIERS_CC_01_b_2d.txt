001	HYAAAAH!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0009
002	It's okay now, Celliers.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0032
003	Oh... S-sorry. I couldn't do anything...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
004	Don't sweat it! I know you're no good with bugs. Leave the extermination to me!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0037
005	Thank you...and sorry, really. I like butterflies now, but this is just too much...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0018
006	S-stop... Stay away...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0010
007	N-no... I don't want to do that anymore. Please, don't make me.	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0011
008	...So it couldn't nullify the curse this time either, I see.
009	Clearly its life energy is amplifying the anti-curse properties of the crystal.
010	...Won't its mind shatter if we keep this up?
011	We'll just have to make sure it doesn't, now won't we?
012	That is the only subject who fused with the crystal, acquiring the power of crystallization. We must yield results at all costs.
013	Even so...
014	If there's any possibility of it gaining the power to repel Asmodeus' curse, then we must do all we can, inhuman or otherwise.
015	Now then, prepare for the next experiment.
016	Y-yes, sir!
017	Yeek! P-please, no more...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0027
018	I'm sorry. I don't want to do this to you, but...the cost of refusing is too high.
019	O-oh... Ahh...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
020	AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0028
021	Wh-what in the—?! My body, it's—NNGAAAAAAHHH!
022	Celliers! Celliers?! What have you done?!
023	It turned a human into crystal...
024	We'll be in trouble if that power's turned on us.
025	Yes, we must drill into him the cost of rebellion. Deep into his flesh, if need be.
026	Ho ho... Oh, Celliers, my dear, cute Celliers. I'll teach you some manners...
027	...! Ah, ahhh...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
028	You okay, Celliers? You're white as a sheet.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
029	*Huff* *huff* M-Mielikki...
030	It's okay, no more bugs! I squashed them all like, uh, bugs. So you're safe!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
031	Oh...
032	Everything here's been crystallized...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0020
033	*Whew* Th-thanks...and sorry.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0022
034	Don't worry about it! Everyone's got their Achilles' heel.
035	My mom used to say that, instead of making yourself do things you're bad at, focus on what you're good at!
036	...So you have things you're bad at, Mielikki?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
037	Uhh, guys, maybe? Not the villagers, though, they're nice. Strangers are kinda scary, though.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
038	...I'm a guy, you know.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
039	Celliers is a Celliers, that's what I know!
040	Uh, sure... Heh heh.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
041	Oh! You smiled, Celliers! That's great to see.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
042	...Talking to you soothed me somehow.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
043	Thanks, Mielikki. Having you around keeps me calm.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0033
044	Really? Heh heh, happy to hear it.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0050
045	In that case, you oughta have me around all the time.
046	I love seeing you smile myself!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0007
