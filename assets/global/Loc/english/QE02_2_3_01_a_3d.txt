001	Gi...giga...! Gigagagaga!	VO_aj3500.aj3500_sys_0029
002	Not cool...brah...gi...gigaga...! You...did this to me!
003	For-forget my orders, brah! I...I'm gonna go all out and blowing this station to pieces!
004	Co-come on, gunslinger! Let's go out together with a bang, brah!
005	The station too, huh? Even for a final death wish, that's going too far.
006	Wh-who's there, brah?!
007	I won't allow innocent people to get caught up in this. I'm sorry.
008	Gi...giga... Yo-you, brah...! You...newb...
009	Well then...
010	Oh no! The locomotive is leaving the station!
011	Ack...!
012	Squeak! Guard Droid detected! Guard Droid detected!
013	Numerous armed androids are shooting at us! We've got to stop them, aye!
014	Tsk!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
015	Eeek!
016	You all right, little lady?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
017	Y-yes! Bu-but the locomotive...!
018	Ack. It's not over yet. Alkemono, check if there is any road that overlaps with the tracks?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
019	Armed androids closing in! Armed androids closing in! They've locked in on us, aye!
020	We won't let them!
021	Eeek!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
022	Alkemono, quickly find a route!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
023	Aye!
024	Tsk! You gotta be kidding me! No way are we gonna give up so easily!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
025	Oh no! It's pulling away little by little!
026	Even if we continue to run parallel like this, it won't get us any where!
027	Alkemono, have you found a road that intersects with the railway?!
028	Aye, there's a large intersection 3 km ahead! The railway crosses under an overpass!
029	And after that?
030	The next is 8 km ahead, aye! But, before that, there's the Redington River!
031	We'll have to take a detour to cross to the opposite shore, aye!
032	If we take a detour there's no way we can catch up. That makes the overpass 3 km ahead our last chance.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
033	Can we make it?!
034	We have to.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
035	Don't worry. I pride myself in my ability to make calculated adjustments.
036	You just think of what to say to Ethan when you're reunited with him.
037	Squeak! Guard Droids detected! Guard Droids detected! They're trying to shut down the road!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
038	As if we'd let them! Let's ride this through at full speed!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
