001	Wow...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0024
002	Sure, they're just Familiars...but he took them all out with one move.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
003	So cool...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
004	Edgar L. Leonhart, who placed Belphegor in your hands?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
005	Ah, now who was it again? Sorry, but I'm not really good at remembering the name of men.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
006	You entered this country to try and "reset" this Sacred Stone, didn't you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
007	...Who knows?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
008	Re-reset this Sacred Stone?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
009	I didn't know the witches in this country didn't know about it. I heard that it's an ancient magic, so maybe they don't teach it to you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
010	Ancient magic?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
011	We learn ancient magic at school, but we've never heard about "resetting" a Sacred Stone.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
012	The ancient witches of this country erased the memories and emotions within Asmodeus in order to remove its curse.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
013	They created a magic that could return it to the same state it was when it was born. They called this magic Arestorus.
014	Arestorus...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
015	Even I've never heard about that magic before. I'm impressed by the Holy Guard.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
016	I guess it makes sense that you don't know about it. After all, without any way to reach Asmodeus, this magic must have been buried in history.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
017	Arestorus is merely a spell that erases the curse on the Sacred Stone and doesn't reverse its lifespan.
018	But, Edgar...the person who entrusted you with Belphegor, they must have been betting on the potential of that spell...am I correct?
019	How would I know? All I'm doing is keeping a promise.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
020	A promise?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
021	Arestorus...with that magic the curse of Asmodeus can be removed. If only we can get the Sacred Stone!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
022	Edgar! Please! We'll use any means necessary to get above those clouds!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
023	I'm questioning him now. Sorry, you'll have to wait—	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
024	After seeing the desperate look on your faces, girls, there's no way I can turn you down.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
025	That being said, when it comes to getting above the clouds...the way...cachou!!!
026	Oh! Edgar, you must be cold!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
027	Now you notice?! Of course-,- I'm cold! The witches tore off all my clothes. I just hope they didn't throw them away.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0029
028	Hmph...	VO_dios.dios_battle_0003
029	Whoa! He just sliced through the iron bars!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0023
030	With all the Familiars around here, we won't be able to get much talking done.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
031	Let's hurry up and get out of here. As for you, just put something on. You look unsightly.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
032	I've encountered a lot of extraordinary people recently. Guys who slice through trains and now iron as if they were butter...	VO_edgar.edgar_event_1011
033	As you can see, I don't have any weapons, so good luck covering for me. See. Here they come already.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0041
034	Familiars again! We cut the iron bars, so now they're even angrier.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
035	Please...open a path!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
