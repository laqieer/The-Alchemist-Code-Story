001	This isn't it. Or this. Or this! Ugh... The bookshelf is a mess again.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
002	People just throw books back on the shelves wherever they see fit. It's unbelievable! They have numbers written on them and everything!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
003	Hm...? There's a book missing here. I'm certain that no one has checked it out—which means that someone must have borrowed it without permission again!	VO_noah.noah_chara_1001
004	I cannot fathom how they manage to bungle even such a simple rule! It is really not that difficult! Ugh!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
005	Boo!	VO_emma.emma_battle_1017
006	Eeek!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0028
007	E-Emma?! What are you doing?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
008	Sorry, sorry! It's just that you're always so serious, so I wanted to have a little fun with you, that's all.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0036
009	You're so cute when you're all panicky.
010	What is that supposed to mean?! You're the one who's always—!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
011	Now, now. Polish this, and calm down.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
012	A silver spoon.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
013	Haaa...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
014	(I really can't keep up with that girl.)
015	(Oh, well. I suppose that I shall have to be the grown-up here.)
016	I always thought it was interesting that you calm down when you polish silverware.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
017	I don't really understand it, either. Haaa... So, what's wrong?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
018	Huh?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
019	Didn't you come here to tell me something?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
020	Oh! That's right! Um...	VO_emma.emma_chara_1006
021	Noah? Are you here? I wanted to talk to you about the student council documents... Hm? Oh, hello, Emma! Are you bothering Noah again?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0020
022	Ugh... It's you.
023	Don't take that tone with me, young lady! Whenever I see you, you're being childish and undisciplined. You will never become a praiseworthy witch with an attitude like that!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
024	Whatever you say.
025	I-I'm sorry, professor! She doesn't mean anything by it! I'm always telling her to watch her manners.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0035
026	You're such a good student, Noah. You could learn a lot from her, Emma.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0008
027	I hope you realize just how lucky you are to have such a wonderful honor student as your friend here, missy!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
028	Despite how busy she is with her work as secretary of the student council, she always cleans up the library without being asked, and—
029	Goodness gracious me! Look at this! The bookshelf is a mess! What were you thinking, Emma?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
030	N-no! That wasn't Emma, that was...me.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
031	It's fine, Noah. You don't have to cover for her. Emma, the next time this happens, you'll be writing a letter of apology! Am I understood?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
032	Honest, professor, I'm not trying to cover for her or anything. I was the one who—
033	Oh... She's gone.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
034	Boy, that teacher really doesn't listen to anything anyone says, does she? Not that it really matters.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0029
035	Of course it does! I can't let someone else's reputation be negatively affected because of a misunderstanding! I'll go and fix it.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0015
036	It's fine! It always happens, so it's not a big deal. Besides, we both know that I really am here to bother you.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
037	But...!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
038	Anyway, all of that aside, you want to come eat crepes with me?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
039	Crepes?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
040	I heard about this place at work. Everyone says it's super yummy! I figured that since it's on the way home, we could go together!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
041	Emma, what are you saying? You know that stopping at places on the way home is against school rules!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
042	It's fine! Nobody will find out!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
043	Emma! All of the teachers have their eyes on you! If you keep going like this, you will...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
044	I will...what?
045	W-well...
046	(I guess I'm the only one worrying about Emma's future. I'm such an idiot.)
047	Never mind. Anyway, we have practical magic exercises first thing tomorrow morning, so I'm going to go home and practice.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
048	You better not be late tomorrow, Emma! Your reputation is on the line, after all!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
049	Ack! That's tomorrow?!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0029
050	Don't overdo it at your part-time job.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
051	Okay, thanks! We'll have to have crepes another time!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0034
052	All right...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
053	I guess I'll head home early today, and go practice for tomorrow in the forest nearby.
