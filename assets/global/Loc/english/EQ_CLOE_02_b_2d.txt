001	It looks like everyone escaped safely... Huh? Ahhh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0030
002	What's wrong?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
003	Fluffy! Fluffy is f-f-fraying.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
004	Fluffy...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
005	Yeah, that's this stuffed animal's name. I just made it super cute, and now I have to fix it all over again.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0018
006	C-cute?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
007	Yes, cute! It's really soft, too! Don't you wanna touch it?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
008	Oh, erm... No, thank you. That aside, why are you carrying around a stuffed animal all of a sudden?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0011
009	Well, I was wondering if there was something I could do with all the fur I shed.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
010	Every year, I think to myself that it's such a shame to let all that nice fur go to waste—well, I guess thinking that it's a waste is a little strange, but...
011	Now that I'm vice-captain, I just keep thinking that I have to try even harder!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0003
012	Nina, you've become so strong.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0001
013	I was really happy to become vice-captain, but it was never my goal.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0034
014	I wanted to pour everything I've been feeling into something; to give it form, so that I don't end up acting spoiled and upset Sir Gerald.
015	Ah, so then this stuffed animal is...?
016	That's right! I want to keep growing, after all.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
017	...
018	Oh, it's almost time for group training. Let's go together, Chloe!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
019	I'm sorry. There's something I need to do first.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
020	Oh, okay. If you're sure... Chloe?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
