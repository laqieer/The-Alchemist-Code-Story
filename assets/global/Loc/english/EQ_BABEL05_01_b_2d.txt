001	You weren't half bad back there. I suppose that's only to be expected.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
002	You... You, um...	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
003	Will. Well, that's Mister Will to you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
004	No, uh...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
005	No need to feel shy. We're friends! Call me Will!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_3001
006	No! Could you stop? That's not what I'm asking at all.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
007	Wow... You don't beat around the bush, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_4001
008	Nope.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
009	I love it!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_chara_5001
010	Ugh. Troublemaker, huh? More like troublesome.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
011	Heheh...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
012	Whatever. Thanks, I guess... For saving me back there.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
013	Eh. I'm sure you would've been fine on your own.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
014	Yes, but you saved me a bit of trouble.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
015	Heh. You say that, but you know that you were the one stirring the pot, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
016	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
017	People in this country often forget, but Alchemy is a forbidden art, you know?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
018	Use of Alchemy is restricted to those few who have gained access to it through the proper channels.
019	And these ruins... Do you even know what they are?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
020	No.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
021	What?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
022	I said, no. I have no idea.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
023	That's why I'm here. I wanted to learn more about them.
024	Why?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
025	...
026	I'm...looking for my brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
027	Ah. The one with the same hair color as you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
028	Do you know something about him?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
029	That's not the issue here.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
030	What do you mean?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
031	My purpose here is these ruins.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
032	These ruins...and you, Albea.
033	Wh-what?
034	I think it might be best if you went back to your...tinkering and forgot all about this little research expedition of yours.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
035	For your own safety, you see.
036	You... Are you going to try to kill me like those other people did?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
037	Aw, don't lump me in with boring grumpy-pants like those guys!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0029
038	I'm just saying that you might be better off continuing to...not know.
039	...
040	No.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0039
041	Stubborn, aren't you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
042	All right!
043	What the—?!
044	I'm with that girl on this!
045	H-huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
046	It's impossible to understand something if you don't learn about it! It's pretty cold of you not to share what you know!
047	Who...are you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
048	Me? I'm Mira! Such a great name, don't you think?
049	Mira... How long have you been here?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
050	Huh? What do you mean?
051	I didn't sense your presence at all. It's almost as if you just...appeared out of thin air.
052	Huh? I've been here for a while.
053	Seriously?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
054	Come on, pineapple head! Just tell her what she wants to know! Look at that face! How could you say no to that?!
055	Pineapple...? Tch, I don't have anything to tell her!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
056	Of course you do!
057	About Alchemy! And about what you saw in these ruins!
058	About the Cursed Beasts!
059	What?!
060	Cursed...Beasts?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
061	Y-you know about the Cursed Beasts?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
062	Oh! So they are still around! Eheh!
063	Answer my question, little girl.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
064	What was it that you said? "You might be better off continuing to...not know"?
065	...
066	How about a trade?
067	A trade? For what?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
068	Information, silly!
069	I don't think so.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
070	Why not?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
071	Look, I already told you—	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
072	Listen here, Mira. This Will guy is gonna tell you whatever you want to know.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
073	You don't get to decide that!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
074	Fine. Then kill me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
075	What?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
076	You won't do it, will you? Well, in that case, I'll do as I please.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
077	You'll just have to deal with it.
078	I'm just saying that maybe we should negotiate a little more before you offer up what I know!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
079	Ready? Question number one!
080	Will, please.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0041
081	Look, I'm telling you—	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
082	What time period are we in?
083	I... What?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
084	Has the world ended yet?
085	Um, are you...? What?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
086	Tell me!
087	Was it all...for nothing?
088	For what reason did we go to war with each other?
089	For whom does Alchemy exist?
