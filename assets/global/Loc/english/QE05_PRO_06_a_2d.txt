001	Edgar! Are you okay?!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
002	Y-yeah. Thanks for that, little lady. I couldn't have made it through that without your help.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
003	I can't believe you... Look at this, you're flirting while on the verge of falling on your face!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
004	Yeah, you're all pale! You sure you're all right?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
005	I mean... Yes?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
006	Liar!!!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0012
007	Uh...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
008	All you did was lie around! I saw how you made Fiona do all the work, asking around, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0010
009	Fiona... Seriously, don't you think it's time to give this little guy a tune-up?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
010	Can we move on to more important matters? For example, did you hear anything interesting?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
011	Ugh. Right. So, turns out it's just as you said, robo-wrist!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
012	According to the history books, it disappeared when Wadatsumi was destroyed.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
013	Then...we've run out of leads on where the Mikaboshi might be.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
014	See? I was right!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
015	Are we sure that girl wasn't just trying to study up on historical events?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
016	I don't know if I can believe that. If it was just for research, there would be no need for that much fuss.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
017	That's true...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0042
018	Think about it. After Envylia became one with Northern Pride, things have been suspiciously quiet, but in truth, Envylia itself has disappeared from the history books.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
019	Like we talked about before, even the succession disputes in Lustburg were related to the Sacred Stone, Asmodeus.
020	Then that incident with the dragon in Saga all started with the fuss over Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone, Beelzebub.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
021	That's what the rumors say, at least.
022	In other words, what's happening here in Slothstein...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
023	Can't you see? Those who live on this continent of Babel worship the Sacred Stone, but those Stones are stirring up turmoil in this land.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
024	Oh... I see what you mean.
025	Now, suddenly, there's this girl who's searching for the legendary Mikaboshi and, if our information is correct, the Paladin named Dias is heading in the same direction.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
026	I can't believe that's just a coincidence.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
027	Huh...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0029
028	I only really got one useful thing out of all that time spent staring at history books.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
029	What is it?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
030	It's an old legend about the Sacred Stones that says...that the Stones can somehow communicate with each other. With the state of the world as it is, they're probably reaching out to each other right now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
031	What?!
032	If the Mikaboshi really has reappeared in this world...and if that girl gets her hands on it...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
033	I can't just sit idly by and wait to see what happens.
034	What's your plan? You gonna chase that girl? Go all the way to Gluttony Foss?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0044
035	Nah. Even if I try that, it's not really going to get me anywhere.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
036	Then what are you thinking?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
037	You're... Oh. You're thinking to go back to the beginning and pick up whatever clues you can find.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
038	Yes. There's got to be something we missed that will lead us to where we need to be!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
