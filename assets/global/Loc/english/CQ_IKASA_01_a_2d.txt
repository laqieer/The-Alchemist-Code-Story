001	Haaaaaah!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0001
002	Just a little bit further and I'll reach the ruins...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
003	Hopefully there won't be any trouble...
004	Though things should be alright, as it's easier to handle things by myself...
005	After joining the Holy Guard, it was quickly apparent that it wasn't what I was meant for.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
006	"What is your purpose as part of the Holy Guard?" "What are you willing to defend?" I just don't have the motivation.
007	But after leaving Wadatsumi I couldn't think of what to do. So my purpose was to become that little girl's dream.
008	It wasn't especially a bad place to be. I just couldn't find my purpose.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0021
009	Is it right for me to be here? But then again, I don't know what I really want to do.
010	In any case, Button isn't here with me.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0020
011	Being apart from her makes me feel empty, though I knew that would happen.
012	Ikasa, wait!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
013	Captain Cadanova. Why are you out here?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
014	I heard you were on your own. I just happened to be free and thought I could give a helping hand.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
015	You're heading to the ruins of the base which used alchemy unlawfully, right?
016	Yes. To scout and see if there are any remnants.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
017	I see. Do you not want me to come with you?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
018	I would never say such a thing to the person who helped me to join the Holy Guard.
019	Then there isn't an issue.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0037
020	I heard that you've become much stronger, so I'm eager to see you in action. Let's go!
021	(Ever since I was recruited, the captain's watched over me, which is flattering... But why?)
022	What's wrong, Ikasa? Something the matter?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
023	Oh...uh... Nothing.
024	We're close to the ruins. We'd better hurry before it gets dark.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
025	I'm sorry. I'll go faster.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
