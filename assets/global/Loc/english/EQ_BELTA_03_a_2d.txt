001	(Those are definitely Wratharis soldiers. Judging by their numbers, it doesn’t look like this is their main army...)
002	Hey, how’d it go?
003	They don’t notice us. They’re just carelessly training students.
004	Now is the time to attack. We don’t need our country’s permission. Invading Envylia will only lead to good fortune for Wratharis.
005	Then we’ll carry out our plan tonight. If we can weaken their forces even a little, it should make our country happy.
006	This won’t be like all those other little skirmishes... This will pave the way for a full-blown invasion!
007	(A night attack? To try to chip away at our forces while our guard is down?)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
008	(What should I do? It’s not a good idea to act on my own, but...if it’s to prevent a surprise attack from Wratharis...)
009	(I should be able to get a little closer!)
010	Oh! There you are, Sharon!	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
011	Whoa! Idiot! Stop! Shh! Shh!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0026
012	Ahahaha! Your face is bright red. So you have a cute side too.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
013	Be quiet! It’ll be for nothing if they spot us!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
014	Sorry, sorry! ...I see. You saw some Wratharis soldiers and went after them.
015	...I apologize for acting on my own in the middle of training. However, I didn’t want to lose sight of them.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0035
016	But you could’ve at least told me. I wish you would’ve said something. I’m your instructor after all...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0016
017	...
018	It doesn’t look large-scale at first glance, but you know that you can’t take on this many soldiers on your own, right?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
019	I came here to figure that out.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_1039
020	That’s not for you to decide. Our first priority should be calling for reinforcements. We can’t take on this many soldiers on our own.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0012
021	...I can attack them myself. They’re not at all prepared right now.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
022	...As your instructor, I can’t allow that.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0015
023	I know I’m not that reliable, and I haven’t taught you anything yet, but...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
024	I can still stop you from doing something reckless.
025	...
026	You can’t just rush into these things. Why are you so impatient, Sharon?
027	I’m not impatient... I just have something I need to do.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
028	Anyway, there are no reinforcements. The only ones nearby are other trainees like myself and a small number of Royal Knights... There is no one that can properly fight.
029	...There’s the orchestral band.
030	Do you think they can use their instruments as weapons? Of course not. All they can do is make sounds.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
031	That would just be noisy It would hurt my ears.
032	You may feel that way, Sharon, but “sounds” can do many things.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
033	Well, they’re completely useless on the battlefield.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0013
034	Just listen. You don’t have to approve of me, but...there’s something you still don’t know.
035	It’s something you should know though. Before standing on the battlefield.
036	...
037	...I’ve always loved the sound that cannons made. So much so that I became a gunner. There’s a lot of depth to the sound of a cannon.
038	Sounds can convey things that words can’t.
039	Sometimes it is mournful for those who were lost in battle... Sometimes it is tense when warning of an enemy raid...
040	And the signal gun after a victory is the sound of “I’m home.”
041	It signifies that the people on the battlefield will make it home safely. I’ve always loved that sound.
042	I became a gunner because I wanted to make that sound. Isn’t the idea of announcing “I’m home” for everyone so lovely?
043	My gunnery teacher always said that cannons can do a lot more than just hurt people.
044	...Also, “sounds” are what saved me. When I see you, I’m reminded of my younger self.
045	...I have no idea what you’re trying to say.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
046	“Sounds” can change people’s feelings.
047	“Sounds” were probably Envylia’s salvation.
048	...That’s why I think it’s also the duty of Envylia’s knights to protect “sounds.”
049	“Sounds” can also provide energy. The citizens of Envylia look forward to the orchestral band’s “sounds.”
050	I believe that protecting these sounds is connected to protecting the country.
051	These past few years, we have had many small skirmishes with Wratharis. The orchestral band was founded in order to help clear away some of those worries.
052	They can help set our citizens’ minds at ease by helping them enjoy “sounds.”
053	So the orchestral band...is also fighting for Envylia.
054	Listen. You’re not fighting alone. Everyone has their own thoughts about it, but they still stand on the battlefield to protect what they love.
055	What?! What use is making sounds?! This is a battlefield!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
056	You can’t hurt anyone...or even resolve yourself to hurting anyone with that. It’s useless on the battlefield. ...Right?!
057	...Sharon.
058	Sounds have nothing to do with killing enemies. Swords and skill are the only things that matter!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0040
059	...Please get out of my way. I have to attack the Wratharis soldiers before they’re ready to fight.
060	I’m going to slice open the future with this Greatsword...just like she did!
061	Sharon? Don’t do anything rash!
062	I don’t want to hear your words! They just hurt my ears! ...You don’t understand anything about me!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0015
063	Sharon!
064	Everyone...please notice...!
