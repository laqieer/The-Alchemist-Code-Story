115	Found you!
116	...
117	Look at you... You're half-merged with the forest already... Even after your death, you are protecting us.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0027
118	O Great Nidhogg, please... I humbly request your mercy...
119	"I beseech the supreme...! Here in this holy land touched by death, removed from the stagnant world of man..."	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
120	The Reincarnation Ritual requires Nidhogg's vast magil to reawaken Sephiron... The resurrection ceremony...
121	This originally wasn't meant to be performed on a person's body, but...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
122	The person to be reincarnated. An offering of the flesh and blood of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg.
001	All right. Everything is ready now.
002	...
003	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
004	"We of Suga receive the guidance of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!"
005	"Please lead us to the blessings of the Tree of Life, Mother of All."
006	"Here lies the open gate. Great Sephiron, the pinnacle of compassion, and we her servants, pillars of obedience."
007	"The decimum sephirah and the twelve journeys, give the breath of life once more..."
008	This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
009	This is where my dreams always take me...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
010	Ugh... The wound on my chest...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
011	Wound? Ah, yes... Sinner Julia attacked me. Then...is this the afterlife?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
012	That depends on you.
013	Who's that? This mirage has a different sort of presence than the one who usually appears in my dreams...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
014	Yes, you're correct. This is nothing more than a vision woven by your heart.
015	Hey, wake up... That's not quite right, is it? If this is a dream like said...
016	You're...me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
017	Or perhaps, you are me.
018	You may think of me as your mirror image, born from the fluctuation of your very being after your corruption.
019	My heart... You mean to say, that you are my sin. You are the darkness in my heart?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
020	Hmm, I wonder? I'm not sure if people can so easily separate what's in their heart into what is dark and what is light.
021	That...makes sense...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
022	But I assume there is some meaning to you being here. Firstly, I'm still alive, right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
023	Of course. Why else would everyone be fighting so hard for you?
024	Fighting...? That's right, there's still things I must do! I must help Emmel, save everyone in the region...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	But...why?
026	Why?! That's a ridiculous question. Of course I want to save my family and my village.
027	That is true. If things were normal...but you are not normal.
028	There is a secret resting within you. One that you have not shared with even a single soul.
029	A...secret...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
030	Yes, a secret. And as long as you hold it locked away, you cannot be reincarnated.
031	To return, there is a price to be paid. That price is to lay bare all the secrets one has been holding inside.
032	But I don't know what that is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
033	Is that really true? Don't you think it's strange?
034	You want to protect your family and your village. But if that's all you want, what need is there to change the world?
035	That's because...
036	You don't have to be afraid. You're the only one here. Have confidence.
037	It's because I... Because I...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
038	I think this world is a horrible place.
039	Living under the constant threat of the Cursed Beasts, the sins of your neighbors, even the fear that destruction may come the next day...
040	No matter where you turn, this world is a cruel place. It feeds on sacrifice and gluttony.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
041	Where is the justice? Where is the correct path? No matter how I studied, I could never find the answer.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
042	In that case, it must be the world that is wrong. This world has gone mad. At some point, that's what I started to believe.
123	I see. Perhaps that is true. If it is... So what?
043	So... Then we must break this world to make it anew. We must defeat the Cursed Beasts to clear the way for tomorrow.
044	So that's why you started to exterminate the Cursed Beasts.
045	That's right. You're right. This is my own selfishness... But...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
046	But?
047	After leaving my village and traveling to many lands, I realized how foolish I am.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
048	The people I met were all making the best of what they could in life!
049	They feared the Beasts and loathed sin, but they stood fast and held on to the belief that the next day would come.
050	I shut myself away from everyone, but they were the ones with the strength to face the future; with the conviction to claw and struggle their way through each day.
051	They did that even though they ought to feel angry at their lot!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
124	It was seeing those people try their best every day that became a kind of light to me.
052	I want to affirm those people. I want to support their will to live like that. That is why I'm on this journey... That's why I created Alchemy!
053	I can't afford for things to end like this. It can't end like this.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
054	This is what I want for all the people who've believed in me. I must change this selfishness of mine into the hope for tomorrow!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
055	That's right. For all the people of this world... For all my trusted friends and comrades...
056	I'll put my life on the line for this world. Especially Emmel... My light!
057	Ah... So you accept the weight of your own sin, folding it into your dreams of the future.
058	That's right. So—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
125	This is...the Godwolf Asena? The avatar of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
126	But how? Nidhogg should already be gone...
127	You're right. The Guardian Dragon is already dead and gone. Those great wings have long fallen to the ground.
128	That said...
129	There is another priestess. She performed the Reincarnation Ritual using the remains of the Guardian Dragon as a catalyst.
130	That means that it and you will become one.
131	The Godwolf and I will become one...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
132	Yes. This "reincarnation" is the fusion of two lives into one. The creation of a new future...
133	This is what the ceremony was originally.
134	Raaaaaaaaarrr!!	VO_shadowasena.shadowasena_battle_0021
059	What's this...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
060	You gave a spectacular answer, Nimul. Striving to become worthy enough to create a new way of the world is a beautiful reason. I wholeheartedly support that choice.
061	Go forth and attack, beloved child. Allow me to rest until the end of time.
062	Please...wait. You can't be Sephi—
063	Oh...
064	Oh! Nimul! You're awake!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
065	Eu...lalia? Where...am I?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
066	The Reincarnation Ritual drove the corruption out from your body! I'm so glad it worked...
135	Ah... I guess there's quite a lot to catch you up on. But for now, it's fine.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
136	You have the time now. The Godwolf crossed over into the ritual...
137	That soul was deeply engrained in the Gula Belt and connected to Sephiron.
138	I...see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
067	Oh, and your friends are in the desert now.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
068	I know. I heard everything...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
069	Huh?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
070	I heard everything. I heard you speaking of putting your lives on the line...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
071	Sephiron. You granted me your grace, and thanks to that I'm able to stand here now...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
072	Yes... The Forest of Suga has been revived! The corruption is disappearing!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
151	This is the great Sephiron... The Gula Belt itself, its power connected to the chief of Sephira?!
073	"Your blessings that reside within me, carried alongside the quadrantal Matters; with these, a new pact is formed with this land!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
074	"O slumbering spirits of this place! O benevolent protectors of humankind and nature! Hear my voice and answer!"
075	"Come forth, the new guardian of this region!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
076	Eulalia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
077	Y-yeah!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0004
078	I'd like to ask for your help again.
079	Yeah! Leave it to me!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
080	Good. Let's go. Please, Godwolf!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
081	Huh? Eeeek?!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0026
082	Urrrrgh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
083	Of course. They're wound up now. If I were on my own, perhaps I would be a little more worried.
084	However...
085	Unfortunately, this will be our victory. We have the numbers, and we will crush you.
086	Waginau—!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
087	Stay back! Focus on protecting the villagers!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0014
088	But...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
089	I know!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
090	(It's only getting worse and worse... How can we turn this around?)	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0031
091	Adaleigh...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
092	Ah... Sorry, Waginau! My hands are full over here!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0035
093	Aw, shoot! They figured out that the Engineer Soldier is limited to this area and started focusing their attacks there!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
094	Even monsters can be corrupted... I've never heard of such a thing! Look up, they're flying again!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
095	I know already! I'm turning Libra around! The defenses on the port side have thinned!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
096	Urgh!
097	So you've finally exhausted your strength. You were quite a strong opponent, so I will personally dispatch you.
098	Is this...the end?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
099	Reinforcements? But you all were on your last legs...
100	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
101	Wait, that technique is...?!
102	Finally, an opening!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
103	Ack...!
104	"Those without form, come forth from the sea of the void!"
105	Tsk, they shot them down. But—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
106	Sorry for keeping you all waiting.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
107	Heh. Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, same as always.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
108	My apologies. But for now, there's work to do.
139	Eulalia, can you get that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
140	I've got it!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
141	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
142	"From nothing comes infinity, and from infinity arises infinite light!"
143	Augh!? Urghh!
144	Gah-gahhhh?!
145	Purifying that wide an area all at once...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0044
146	That's right... She was said to be a priestess at Emmel's level.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
147	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony..."	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
148	That technique... He's finally back!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
149	It looks like it. I'm relieved that the ritual was completed safely.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
150	Heeeey, Nimul! We're good over here!
109	You were corrupted by Beelzebub and yet now... Ah...
110	It seems like you all are much more of a threat than I thought.
111	So what now?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
112	I kill you. Just as my sin commands me.
113	I see... Then I will brush that sin away.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0037
114	Nonsense!
