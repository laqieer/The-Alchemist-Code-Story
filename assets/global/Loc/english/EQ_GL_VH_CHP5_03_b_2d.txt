001	Ugh...!
002	(My arm...)
003	I got you now!
004	Gwaagh!
005	That was close. You all right?
006	I suppose this makes us even, does it not?
007	You're in pretty bad shape.
008	Too much has happened.
009	Is the Professor in?
010	Yeah. Everyone is. I'll take you to them.
011	What?! Zheng Yi's entire house has been arrested?
012	Damn Goetia and their lackeys! Are they satisfied only with blood?
013	They were imprisoned, from what little information I could glean from a few drunken guards.
014	As for my lord and my sister... I do not know where they have been taken.
015	Knowing Li Wang, he will not hesitate to torture them if need be.
016	What about the Core? If they get it up and running...
017	Rest assured my lord prepared for the possibility that such information might fall into the hands of his enemies.
018	It will not be such a simple matter for them to reactivate the Core.
019	That's a silver lining, at least...
020	(First Roxanne, and now Zheng Yi... No, this can't go on.)
021	(Soren and the rest can keep running, but I won't.)
022	(Not when Roxanne is still...)
023	Siegfried?
024	It's good to see you again, Shion.
025	But there are things I want to look into. It's better that I go at it alone.
026	The others need you.
027	I'll be there. I promise.
028	...Very well. Take care, Siegfried.
029	Shion watches as Siegfried's retreating form blends with the snow-touched trees in the distance.
030	I hope you understand the path you walk, my friend.
031	I must confess, I didn't quite imagine coming back to such a turn of events.
032	But after what happened in Greed Dike and Goetia's increasing aggression, I do not find myself surprised.
033	Looks like Goetia will stop at nothing to restart the Construct project.
034	If we can't stop them, we can at least try to beat them to the punch.
035	You mentioned Zheng Yi had failsafe measures for the defunct Core?
036	Yes. It was to ensure that if anyone ever got a hold of the Core, there would still be a backup measure to prevent it from functioning as intended.
037	It was partly a stroke of luck he chose to implement such a system, and partly the genius of the design.
038	You must have thought of it as well, Soren.
039	That's one thing to be grateful for, I suppose...
040	I can confirm that, Master!
041	You were never one to leave things to chance.
042	What else do you know about Atropos?
043	Mm... Well, she was created to lead the Constructs.
044	So she looked really different.
045	Right...those golem-looking things.
046	Pardon me, but I cannot help but notice how...human you are. Forgive my lack of a better word.
047	Master intended it! And it helps me put people at ease!
048	Fufu... That is true.
049	Considering Goetia's immense power, it won't be long before they make something of this Core.
050	Eira...help Big Bro! And La...Laky...
051	Um...Lucky Sis?
052	Ahaha! I like that name!
053	Ehehe...
054	Well, then I believe we should chart our course of action sooner rather than later.
055	Time is of the essence, after all.
056	But before that... Has anyone seen Siegfried?
057	Ah. Yes, about that...
