001	Well then...today's plan...	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
002	Good day!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
003	Hi, soldier! Good day to you too!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
004	I heard recently you're feeling kind of down.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
005	Yeah, well...a little.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_c
006	Come on man. You're a monster but you have the ability to talk. Take advantage and go off on a rant.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
007	It means a lot to hear you say that.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_b
008	But it's just you, you know? You're the only Lizardman that can talk.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
009	I know, but...it seems to be the effect of the Alchemia.	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
010	Well, do you speak with humans as well?
011	Nah, can't do that! Man! That's asking a lot!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0020
012	But don't you hear about how they're always saying, "You should talk with us!"	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
013	Nah, man! Can't do that!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
014	I mean, when you used to be human, if a Lizardman suddenly tried to start a conversation with you, you'd either kill it or run away, right?	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0003
015	Ah...
016	See?	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0001
017	You know...sorry. If you want I'll get you something on the way home.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0035
018	Nah, I'm really okay!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
019	All right, let's go!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
020	Let's!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0002
021	(But, maybe someday...my voice might reach...no...nothing...)	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_b
