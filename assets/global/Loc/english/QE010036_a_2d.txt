001	I can't believe he actually defeated that monster! What incredible luck!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0022
002	Huff...huff..! Here are my results. You will now acknowledge my power, won't you?
003	I'll praise your strength, but you'll never be accepted in the Holy Guard.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0039
004	What? Why?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0022
005	Dias, you are greatly swayed by your impulses.
006	That behaviour is in exact opposition of what is required from the Holy Guard.
007	The behaviour that is required from the Holy Guard?
008	As I have told you...
009	Such concepts as patience, justice, and building extensive self-control are thoroughly taught and incorporated into them from when they are babies.
010	Paladins are not swayed by their impulses.
011	Only with such discipline can one manage to comply with the Alchemist Code stated in the Magna Code.
012	Alchemist Code?
013	It's the law prohibiting any destructive or selfish use of Alchemy.
014	The power of Alchemy is mighty. Therefore, unchecked negative emotions such as hatred, rage, and fear can lead to an all-out Alchemy war.
015	Are you telling me that Paladins practice complete self-control?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
016	Indeed. It comes from training the mind and body to cultivate self-discipline. Additionally, they continue to refine their lives with broad knowledge and insight.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
017	It is because of this that they are referred to as the Justice of the continent.
018	If you surrender to your impulses, you will eventually be consumed by the mighty power of Alchemy.
019	This art is forbidden because of the countless people who have used it for selfish purposes and were consumed by its power.
020	Those who lack the willpower to control their Alchemy will never be acknowledged by us.
021	...! 
022	Lord Gabirond, the Blue Flame Guard are encamped in the southwest grounds. Would you like to pay a visit?
023	What?! Such an unexpected route to take...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0022
024	It goes against common sense. We will not pay a visit; we hurry ahead.
025	Logi...
