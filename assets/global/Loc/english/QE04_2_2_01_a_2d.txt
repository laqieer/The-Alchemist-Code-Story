001	... ...
002	Do you mean that...the Wind Matter is inside her body?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
003	Wait...is that the same as Voda carrying the Water Matter inside of her?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
004	Worthy individuals can carry Matter inside their body so as to prevent any evil from touching it.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
005	However...even a Sprite has a limitation to how long they can sustain this task. My limit is twelve hours.
006	Was this girl blinded...so as to block her senses and prevent any evil from touching the Matter?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
007	Yes. From generation to generation, one member of my family has had their eyes crushed at birth.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
008	After all, even after it has lost its power, it is difficult to sustain the Wind Matter within one's body.
009	So that's why they call you a "vessel"...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
010	Yes.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
011	Until the day that the power of the wind is revived, I will protect the Matter. That is my duty as a descendant of the Alize people.
012	Fuu boy, the truth has been made apparent to me. Why don't you explain the rest to me with your own words?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0002
013	What the...? What is that?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
014	Glurrrrrp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_b
015	Is that the cry of the...Jam?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
016	The village is under attack!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
017	We must save them...ugh...aghh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
018	Ack! I underestimated the power of Beelzebub!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
019	Alia, I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise to you. I'm truly...sorry.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0019
020	I should've saved you that night, even if it meant breaking the law. The future cycle...for the good of Saga!
021	Agh...haaahhhh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0025
022	Tina?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
023	Are you okay? I'll get you some water...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0001
024	...Thank you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
025	Did you have another vision, Tina?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
026	Another vision... Hey, Tina, hang in there.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
027	...Fuu, I received another revelation of destruction.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
028	What is the future cycle?
029	In my vision, right before you lost your life...you said, "Alia, I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise to you."
030	What...?! How do you know about that?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
031	Your promise with Alia? I see...so that's what you've been so stubborn about protecting. I should've expected something like that from you, Fuu boy.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
032	Glurrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0004
033	...Fuu, please, tell us about it later. Right now...we must protect this village!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
