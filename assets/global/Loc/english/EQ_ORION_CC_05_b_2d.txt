001	Ngh... Hurgh! Ghah... Looks like Mammon...won't protect me after all.	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0022
002	You won't be going on any of those globe-trotting journeys you've so longed for...and I won't be taking the world for my own. Fate is not...on either of our sides.
003	So... What are you waiting for? Aren't you going to finish me off?	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0019
004	...Why...?
005	Maybe...you reminded me of a little brother I couldn't save.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
006	...
061	...! The necklace I bought! I thought you got rid of it...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0025
007	It seems a belled collar suits me more than you after all, little kitten.
008	No. You're the Thunder Wolf. I truly believed that with your strength, Mammon would accept you. It was never supposed to be like this.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0016
009	Langhao... I hope you hate me for not being able to save you.
010	I don't. And you can still save me. If you see me as a wolf, then you must become a lion and take your prize. Finish me off. Please.
014	Prove to all those who called you a kitten that you are a lion at heart, and you stand to eat the world. Show them what you're made of! It would be the ultimate justice.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
016	...
017	Yes. That's good. A lion doesn't talk back; he just consumes. And should you ever mourn my death...	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
018	Just know that you are the king of the lions, and you hold within you the power to destroy this world that killed me.
021	I will. I'll tear it all down. The people... The lands... The Sacred Stones... Even the gods themselves. I will consume it all until nothing remains.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0004
022	Be sure you don't look back when you do. You're a...rebel king now...
023	Strong, to the very end...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
026	...
027	Nngh!
028	And that's how I consumed the Thunder Wolf, and took the throne for myself.
029	Some were displeased with the way things turned out, but this is a land where might makes right, and no one could deny my might. So in the end...I was accepted, without much contest.
030	Now the next in line for the throne, I didn't give in, even in the face of Mammon's unfathomable power.
031	Perhaps tired of waiting for me, the Sacred Stone Mammon even incorporated itself into my own flesh and blood, as if bowing in reverence.
032	Bound to Mammon both metaphorically and literally, and granted all the powers that come with such an arrangement—along with the seat of the empire—I was given a new title:
033	The Lion Monarch.
034	I had taken the position of successor, taken the throne, and next on the agenda was the continent itself.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
035	All for the sake of consuming everything in this world.
036	I fought so hard to become strong, only to learn I was being manipulated all along...
037	I was just barely accepted by Mammon, but I couldn't keep it under control. I couldn't keep it...satisfied.
040	I will conquer it all. Nations. People. And...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
041	The Sacred Stones, as well.
042	I will do what you could not. I will reach the heights you could never quite attain.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
060	And if I can't... If I'm consumed, instead...all the better.
043	You, too, are my flesh and blood.
045	So just keep on watching. There's a lot left to see.
046	Preparations for our march are complete. Oh... Having a rare think, are we?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
047	I was just reminiscing about the past, hard as it may be to believe.
048	Feeling a bit wistful, eh?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
049	It would be hard not to. We are about to rend the equilibrium of the world asunder, after all.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
050	No worries. Worse comes to worst, we make use of the sleeping Sacred Stone Mammon inside of you. We have nothing to fear.
051	The curse of this land, and the Sacred Stones... I'll overturn it all.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
052	Once this attack is underway, I will consume the world. I hope to meet some powerful foes along the way, though, to get my blood boiling once more.
053	(Even if I do, however, I'm sure none of them will understand.)
054	(Up until now, all I've done is lose everything that's dear to me... But now, it will all serve to feed me!)
055	Now, let us begin our march. Our target is Envylia, and Lustburg beyond!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0038
056	The powerful rule this world, and we will show them Greed Dike's true power!
057	Proud soldiers of Greed Dike, fight and claim victory! Nothing can stand in our way!
058	Now, hunt your prey like the proud lion! Tear across the heavens like thunder!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
059	March for your Lion Monarch!
