001	Gaaah!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0022
002	This is the epitome of ferocity! It astounds me how well this smaller force is matching the enemy's larger numbers!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
003	These powerful Paladins under Lord Waginau's command are achieving incredible results! Yet...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
004	Their numbers will eventually overwhelm us! Lord Waginau! What will we do when that happens?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0004
005	This should be ample display of our strength. Fall back, then rush past their flanks and enter the harbor!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
006	We are going to turn our backs to them?! Will they not pursue?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
007	The enemy is retreating! Shall we pursue, sir?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
008	Fool! Do not chase them! Urgh, I never thought the Holy Guard would get involved!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0015
009	How could so few do so much damage?! Is this the power of Alchemy?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0016
010	They...aren't chasing us?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
011	Lady Teona, you may be a capable fighter, but I take it that tactics are not your forte.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
012	The enemy was ambushed, then shown a clear difference in strength.
013	Even a mediocre commander would not force their soldiers to give chase when their ranks are in disarray.
014	This should buy us some time. We must get to the Liberation Army to combine our strength!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
015	Huh. I didn't expect to learn so much on this excursion.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
016	Is it important that we meet with the Liberation Army now?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
017	It is. Though we Paladins of the Holy Guard have the advantage of strength, we alone cannot control the battlefield.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
018	To ensure the defense of the harbor, it will be necessary to work in concert with the Liberation Army.
