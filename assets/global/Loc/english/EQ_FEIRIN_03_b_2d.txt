001	I've stayed longer in this city than I'd expected to.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
002	It's sad that I won't be able to eat those sweets anymore. However regrettable as it is, I have already received a request for my next job. I will hurry and depart.
003	... ...
004	Work as it may be, I wonder what path she will choose.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
005	That day, after work, she seemed to be pondering this with an odd expression on her face.
006	Well, the answer will emerge. That's the truth. Just like that was the case for me.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
007	And so, I've decided to tag along with you, Reimei.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
008	Fayrene?! Since when have you...wait, what do you mean you'll tag along with me?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
009	It's not just that. What happened to choosing between becoming a Pipa performer and the underground world!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
010	Mmm. Well, it started to become a hassle to think about it. After all, the answer will emerge eventually, right?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0031
011	What! I know I said that, but what I meant...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
012	More importantly!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0003
013	Wh-what?	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
014	When we were sitting together eating sweets and when we ran into each other while working, at first I thought, 'Why?'
015	Then I began to realize that running into each other so many times over this short period of time hasn't been by chance; it's got to be our destiny!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
016	What are you even saying?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
017	At first, I was in a bad mood and tried to push you away, but you're really cool, you know, Reimei?
018	I have no complaints about you being my lover!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
019	You seem to be complimenting me, but at the same time, I somehow feel like you're looking down on me...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
020	On top of that, the way you move so fluidly when you're working as an assassin! It made me totally fall for you!
021	Is that the kind of stuff that's going through your mind?! Wow, your innocent look really had me fooled there.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
022	Plus, since you're a famous assassin you must be making good money!
023	Heheh. I love money! If I have money, I can drink lots of alcohol!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0008
024	...You're not even trying to hide your true nature, are you?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
025	That's because you're special, Reimei♪ With other people, I'm the same way that I've always been.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0037
026	I thought you were a more decent person, but now my head is starting to hurt...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0020
027	Honestly. I feel foolish for trying to be all serious with you when you were suffering just now.
028	I'm being serious right now as well. That's why I've decided to follow you.	VO_feirin.feirin_chara_1009
029	Yeah. What did you mean by that?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
030	Well, seeing the way you live, Reimei, I feel like it's the closest thing to the answer that I've been looking for. Besides, you're my man of destiny!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0031
031	Destiny? Seriously...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
032	From now and forever♪	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
033	You're trouble. I don't want you to follow me. Besides, I...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
034	What? Do you have a lover?!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0025
035	No, I don't but...I don't need to be talking about this with you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_1047
036	Hey, that's mean! No, but that doesn't even matter!
037	Enough. I'm leaving. I have work to do.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
038	I'll help, you know?	VO_feirin.feirin_chara_1009
039	There's no need for that. Also, stop suddenly putting up a front.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0040
040	You're so demanding.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0030
041	I'll focus on performing, thus distracting the target, allowing you to finish the job.
042	That way I can focus solely on my performance and your work will improve as well. We'll be the perfect duo.
043	... ...
044	Ahahah.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0023
045	That's right. You must have work that's solely for you.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
046	Ack... Well, when you put it like that...after I finish my current job, I've been told to return to Greed Dike...	VO_feirin.feirin_battle_0019
047	Then we will be taking separate roads, thus making any duo between us impossible.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
048	Yes. Reimei, can you wait until I take my own path and live solely as a Pipa player?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0025
049	Even after you gave me that passionate lecture of yours...	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0018
050	I told you that I didn't intend to lecture you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
051	Aww...come on...	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0020
052	Sigh... Do as you please then.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0021
053	Yay!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0009
054	Let the chips fall where they may...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0020
055	Heheh. But, Reimei, just know that what you told me...	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
056	I'll find the answer to it. Those words truly saved me.
057	They made me very happy.
058	Thank you, Reimei.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0034
059	Did you say something?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
060	No, nothing!
061	Hey, first of all, how about we go somewhere? Ideally, a town with lots of nice bars!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0003
062	Ahahaha!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0008
