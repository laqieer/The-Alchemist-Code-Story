001	I lost my family twice.
002	Both times, the Holy Guard stole them from me.
003	...
004	(The first time, I lost my family and my home.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
005	(And the second time...)
006	Did you save me?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
007	I did. You've been through much, but you can rest easy now. Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
008	My name's Spica. Um, what's yours?	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
009	Zahar.
010	(I couldn't save him. I lost the dark sun who lit my path—Lord Zahar.)	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
011	(And yet...)
012	Of course, part of me did resent you deeply for killing Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
013	But more significantly, I felt gratitude towards you two.
014	Huh? Gratitude?
015	I always continued adoring Lord Zahar, and I didn't want to see his further deterioration.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
016	You two fulfilled that earnest wish of mine.
017	...
018	I feel like you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering.
019	Kanon! I'm sure you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering!
020	Please use your powers to build a world where people don't get lost in sorrow like I did!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0041
021	Whoaaaaaaa!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
022	Spica!
023	(The Holy Guard robbed me of many things I held dear.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
024	(Yet in the end...)
025	(They were the ones who saved me.)
026	Excalibur is meant for saving people.
027	It's not meant for meaninglessly hurting people.
028	Kanon!
029	Spica, please! Head to Northern Pride!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
030	Greed Dike's army is making its way there as we speak!
031	Kanon is in danger! Please, Spica! Lend Kanon your strength!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
032	...
033	Lord Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
034	I will go. I will join the Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.
035	(Is this my way of rebelling against you—against the wills of the family I spent so long with?)
036	No...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
037	(Shusei.)
038	(The Final Battle Armament of the Shadow Messiah. The vow we failed to uphold.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
039	(Lord Zahar—no. Letitia. Corvus. Ila. Even Silma, waiting for me in the forest...)
040	(Having left all of you—and the Shadow Messiah—behind, I don't think I have the right to do this.)
041	(Yet in spite of that—no, because of that, I will go.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
042	(I didn't understand what Lord Zahar was leaving me with at the time.)
043	(What is this will that connects to the future? I have to find out what he meant.)
044	(And I believe that this is something only I can do.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
045	(It might not be in exactly the way we intended, but now I...)
046	I want to uphold our vow.
047	It's time for a trip down memory lane.
048	Aaaaargh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0028_c
049	You'll pay for this, Shadow Messiah!
050	Tch! We don't have time for this right now!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
051	Hmph. In a hurry, are we? Well, corrupt dogs of the Holy Order...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
052	If you wish to run away with your tails between your legs, we won't stop you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0005
053	Urgh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0026
054	Huzzaaaaah!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0032
055	I will not let you harm Lord Zahar!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0015
056	Wh-what the—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
057	Huzzah!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0002
058	Aaaaaghh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0026
059	Hmph.
060	Th-this... isn't... over! Huzzaaah!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0008
061	Ngh!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
062	Spica!
063	(I won't be able to get out of the way in time!)	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
064	Huh?!
065	Nrgh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
066	Come on, Spica. You should know better by now.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
067	Sorry, Corvus...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
068	Get up, Spica. The weak will be left behind.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
069	Um...
070	Are you okay, Spica?!
071	Y-yes... I'm fine.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
072	Hey! Get it together, you two! Huzzah!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
073	Aaaargh!
074	Nnnrghh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0008
075	Aaaaaahh!
076	It's not over yet.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
077	I know, I know! Come on, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
078	R-right!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
079	Hmph.
080	Lord Zahar! You were right!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
081	So you found them?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
082	Yes. There were a large amount of Philosopher's Stones in the basement.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
083	Hmm...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0044
084	Guess this must be a research facility of some kind.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
085	There are traces of blood... and the hair or fur of some kind of animal.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
086	They were experimenting on animals, then.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
087	Oh no...
088	Disgusting!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
089	How could they?! I wanna give 'em a piece of my mind!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
090	Hey! Pack up these Philosopher's Stones. We're taking them back with us.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
091	Yes, sir!
092	Huh? What's this?
093	Hm?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
094	It's some sort of black... stone. I suppose it's just a stray rock.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
095	Show it to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
096	Yes, my lord!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0002
097	Hmm...
098	Is it valuable? Looks like a regular rock to me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
099	What do you think, Letitia?
100	Oh, my. I haven't seen one of these in ever so long.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0006
101	What? A rock?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
102	Hee hee.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
103	Hah. I knew it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
104	Knew what?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
105	Huzzaaah!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
106	Tch.
107	Huh?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
108	You move too much.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
109	No way!
110	This is how it's done.	VO_niggle.niggle_battle_0001
111	Wh—?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
112	Ow!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
113	Dang it!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
114	Hmph.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
115	Why can't I beat you?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
116	Perhaps someday you will—I wonder how long that will take? Weeks? Months? Years?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0007
117	Nrgh! Lemme try again!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
118	If you must.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
119	Hm?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
120	...
121	Hey! Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
122	Silma...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
123	What's the matter? You okay?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
124	Yeah. I'm fine.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
125	You're not still thinking about what Lord Zahar said earlier, are you?
126	I...
127	Get up, Spica. The weak will be left behind.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
128	A bit.
129	Don't let it get you down! That's just his way of encouraging you!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
130	B-but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0031
131	You've just gotta keep at it! Use the full force of your love for Lord Zahar to get stronger and stronger!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
132	L-love? I-I don't... It's nothing like that.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
133	I just want to be useful to him.
134	I know, I know! Love is complicated.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
135	I told you, I don't—!
136	That's it! I've got it!
137	I'm going to get strong so you don't have to!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
138	H-huh? What do you mean, Silma?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
139	Hah! Hrgh! Huzzah!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
140	Hmph.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
141	Argh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
142	Tch...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
143	Hey! Hey, Corvus!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0001
144	What's this? Are you going to challenge me now?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
145	That's right! I'm here to avenge Ila!
146	Hey! I'm not dead!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
147	Huzzaaah!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0004
148	Nope.
149	Ouch!	VO_syrma.syrma _battle_0019
150	Really, now...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
151	Aw... He got me.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
152	...
153	(Spica's been quiet ever since we got back that day.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
154	Hey—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0003
155	Um...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
156	...
157	(It's okay... The darkness inside me has nothing to fear. I'm not losing sight of my goal.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
158	(I know who I am. I'm Lord Zahar's advisor, nothing more.)
159	Actually, never mind.
160	O-okay.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
161	(Whatever's going on with those two, it's not like I need to worry about it. I'm not their keeper.)
162	Hm.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
163	(Still...)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
164	(The members of the Shadow Messiah need to be strong if we're going to achieve our ambitions.)
165	(That would make this something I need to do for Lord Zahar, to help make our ambitions a reality.)
166	Spica.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
167	Y-yes?
168	I was thinking—
169	Sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
170	What is it?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
171	Lady Letitia has asked me to go hunting today. I'll be heading out shortly.
172	It's that time already, huh? Time flies...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
173	Yes, sir. I'll take my leave then.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0002
174	Hmm...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
175	(A hunt... I could use this.)
176	Wait.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
177	Yes, sir?
178	I'll do the hunting today. You stay here.
179	A-are you sure, sir?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
180	Yes—but I won't be going alone.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
181	Ila, Silma, Spica... You're coming with me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
182	H-huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
183	We're going hunting.
184	What?!
185	Hunting?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
186	Um...
187	...
188	Eep...
189	...
190	Wow! Down in one hit!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0046
191	Now it's your turn.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
192	All right! Ready or not, here I come! Come out, come out, wherever you are!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
193	...
194	Um... Corvus?
195	What is it? You'd better get a move on if you want to eat tonight.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
196	Well, um... Spica and I used to live in the forest, so...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
197	We can't help but see animals as our friends, and it just wouldn't feel right to hunt your friends, you know?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
198	Then you don't mind going hungry?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
199	Ngh...
200	...
201	Well?
202	Nnngh! I'm sorry, forest critters! I'm sorry, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0035
203	Huzzah!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0001
204	Do you think I'm cruel, Spica?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
205	No.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
206	I understand. I eat meat, too. To survive.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
207	Exactly. That's all it is. You have to eat to survive.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
208	And you're going to need to survive if you want to help Lord Zahar.
209	Yes... I know.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
210	...
211	Hello there, Mister Rabbit...
212	...
213	Ngh...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
214	I'm sorry, Mister Rabbit!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
215	Tch.
216	I'm so sorry!
217	Groooaaaahh!	VO_MwolfBig.MwolfBig_battle_0019
218	Eek!
219	Huh?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
220	What was that?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
221	There's something in the forest!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
222	Ooh! Something we can hunt?!
223	S-something doesn't feel right.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
224	Spica?
225	Watch out! It's coming this way!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
226	Wh—?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
227	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_MwolfBig.MwolfBig_battle_0028_a
228	A mythical beast!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0026
229	What?! No way! In this forest?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
230	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr...	VO_MwolfBig.MwolfBig_battle_0019
231	Look sharp! It's comin'!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
232	Get ready!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
233	Wait—we're going to attack it?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
234	Of course we are! We're fighting for survival here!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
235	I-I...!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
