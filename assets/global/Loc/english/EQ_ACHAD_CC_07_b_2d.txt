001	Now you will talk.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0010
002	Oho! Will I, now?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0012
003	Why did you save me from the final battlefield?
004	I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
005	Then how do you explain the claw marks I found on my skin? They were unmistakably yours!	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0019
006	Nonsense! You must be mistaken.
007	Then why were you waiting for me here?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
008	You could've taken Veda's power for yourself well before I arrived!
009	What can I say? I'm a gentleman!
010	What did you mean by what you said that day? "Your poor, oppressed little soul was just yearning to be unleashed!"	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0022
011	"Follow me, Amu!" "Aren't we both the villains of this play?" "Remember our first encounter? Did it not feel like destiny? It did to me!"
012	Are you quoting little old me?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
013	All this time, you've just been projecting your emotions onto me! You're the one who's suppressing what he really feels!
014	"You do love your fellow Templars, don't you?" "Then die in their arms!" "If you love them so much, then why aren't you prepared to die by their hands?!"
015	All because you didn't die with your mother!	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0022
016	Ngh!
017	You couldn't accept your mother's death! You couldn't accept that you still loved her, despite everything she put you through! You couldn't accept what you did!	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0019
018	Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
019	That's why you've been seeking out the most dramatic death imaginable! All so you can finally please your mother!
020	Don't talk to me about my mama!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0032
021	Even so, you were still afraid of dying!
022	Say what you like, but you and I are the same! Neither of us has anyone left! We're all alone!
023	Take my hand.
024	All right.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
025	You might have taken my eye, but I can still see just fine.
026	Wh-what?!
027	That mark on your left eye!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0026
028	Bionic Eye Unseen!
029	A circle pierced by a cross...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0042
030	It's the same as the mark Sol had on his forehead!
031	It's time, Nero.
032	Right!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
033	A d-dark...sun?!
034	I will grant you the end you seek.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0032
035	I...!
036	Big Bang!
037	You wish to create a sun?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
038	Once plucked, flowers wilt and wither away. Of course, that is what makes them so beautiful.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
039	I understand that your intention is to pluck the flowers whose seeds you have sown at the very moment when their beliefs bear fruit. However, it seems to me that Sol is ripe for the picking.
040	Hmm. Yes. Do you know, just last week I found a seven-colored blossom! I was terribly disappointed to see it wilt only a few days later. It was a real rarity.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
041	Such a shame... If only I'd been able to show it off to the world!
042	I can understand that. Whenever I stumble across an incredible play, I can't help but spread the word to everyone I meet.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0038
043	That, my friend, is why I desire to find a way of plucking a blossoming flower without causing it to wilt.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
044	Interesting... Would you then replant the seeds, leaving behind a whole patch of them so that future generations could enjoy the same scene?
045	I would indeed!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0006
046	That could work with dried flowers.
047	Precisely! I will leave behind a bouquet of dried flowers, entangled with my roots.
048	The moment those seeds are planted will be the same moment in which my beliefs will come to fruition.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
049	You mean...?
050	Yes! In that moment, I will blossom into bloom! I'll take the pruning shears to my own foliage! And you will be there to enjoy the show!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0023
051	We have a lot in common, don't we?
052	My commandment is Unyielding. I refuse to bend to the will of another.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
053	You wish to die in the spotlight as well, don't you?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
054	Sol. He...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
055	Huh?
056	He is sealed within that eye of yours.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
057	Wh-what?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0025
058	He died, but he remains as a fragment of Alchemia.
059	H-how is that possible?
060	Your prosthetic eye maintains your lifeforce by accumulating the Alchemia of dimensional power in the vicinity.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0038
061	Drei used this property to seal Sol's remains on an alchemical level within your eye.
062	At present, no method of reviving someone from such a state exists. We wouldn't even be able to remove his remains from where they are sealed.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0042
063	Drei sowed the seeds that could create a sun. As for whether they will bear fruit...only God knows the answer to that.
064	Oh!
065	At the end of the day, it probably comes down to how hard you're willing to work.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
066	I-I...!
067	Good news, huh?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0037
068	Regardless of what you call yourself, you're more than just a jester.
069	Can you be honest with me, for once? What was it you wanted in all this?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
070	...
071	Jesters are employed to serve rulers.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
072	I only wanted to join the Templars.
073	I only wanted to make friends.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
074	I only wanted to be with others like me. People with the same powers and the same social standing. People who had made the same mistakes. People who were just as inhuman as I was.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0022
075	Is that all? You picked the worst possible way to go about it.
076	I know.
077	But even so...	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0002
078	Yes?
079	You are one of us. You are a Templar.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0007
281	I-I...!
282	You're our ne'er-do-well Number Six.
080	Haha. I'll take it.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0003
081	I'm just telling you what Sol would have. He always brought light to people like us, who have nowhere else to go.
082	If only we had met on a different stage...we might have actually gotten to fight side by side.
083	Maybe.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0031
283	Ooh! Don't look now, but mama's watching us!
284	...
084	Mama? Are you listening? I made some friends!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
085	We all costarred in a play!
285	If only you could have seen it, Mama... Oh, how I wish I could introduce you to them!
286	Then allow me to do one final thing for you.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0003
287	Oh?
288	A curtain call for the Templars.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
289	Ooh!
290	Eins, the First, the one who started it all.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0004
291	Zwei, the Second, who fought with everything she had, right up until her dying breath. Drei, the Third, who never once disappointed.
292	Vier, the Fourth, who helped us dream pleasant dreams. Füry, the Fifth, whose prayers were always full of kindness. Sieba, the Seventh, whose resolve knew no bounds.
293	Neun, the Ninth, who gave us our most precious commandment. Zehn, the Tenth, who gave our group its soul.
294	Acht, the Eighth, who ate us out of house and home. Sol was our Number Zero, who carried all of us on his shoulders.
295	Y-you've left out Zechs, the Number Six!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
296	I hadn't forgotten. Zechs, the Sixth, who played his part as he saw fit, and made the most daring cameo of all.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0007
297	Hahahaha.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
298	You played the role of our greatest villain.
299	Then I guess I fit right in. The Templars are a pretty evil-looking bunch when you line them all up.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
300	Let's give them a warm round of applause.
301	*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* *Clap*
302	*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* *Clap*
086	Please...keep watching...until the curtain falls.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
303	I will.
304	Ma...ma...
305	I'm here.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0004
087	Th-thank...you.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0042
088	...
089	Sorry, Sol.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0042
090	I'm running on empty.
091	Acht!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
092	Nngh...	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0019
093	Someone's holding me in their arms.
094	There's something familiar about these arms. They feel just like the ones that used to hold me when I was kept hungry and starved.
095	Acht. Can you hear me? I want to thank you.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
096	H-huh?
097	Meeting you and the other Templars has helped me regain fragments of my memories.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
098	That never would have been possible without your sacrifices: memory, perception of color, sleep, healing, faith, the joy and taste of food...and your arms, Acht.
099	Above all else, it was your blood that restored my memories. Or, to be more precise...the blood of something that lingers within you.
100	Wh-what do you mean?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0029
101	You're so kind, Acht.
102	B-Bianca!
103	You were abandoned by the world, but you could never bring yourself to throw anything away.
104	You're amazing.
105	You even held on to that cute dress. It still looks good on you, Amu.
106	I-is it...really you?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0022
107	I'm proud of you. You've been so brave.
108	I-it is you! H-how is this possible?!	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0020
109	Shh. It's going to be all right.
110	B-but I... I thought you died!
111	I invited her here.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
112	H-huh?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0025
113	Nero... I suppose this is the first time we've met first to face.
114	Even though you're my other half.
115	Wh-what? I don't understand!
116	Let's just say I helped make it possible, and leave it at that.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0010
117	As I watched you climb Veda, I recognized something...familiar in you. So I did what I do best: used clairvoyance to show me the world!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0004
118	Familiar? Familiar how?
119	Listen to me, Acht. If you had not elected to climb the tower, I never would have learned of Bianca's existence.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
120	You only have yourself to thank for this reunion. It's all the result of your hard work and perseverance.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
121	I...did this? Me?
122	Not alone. Every single climb attempted by the Templars contributed to this outcome.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
123	You mean we...did this together?
124	Yes. Everything you went through meant something.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
125	Bianca... Who are you really?
126	Bianca is a name meaning white.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
127	...
128	And Nero is a name meaning black.
129	That...doesn't tell me much.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0002
130	We are two halves of a whole. Light and darkness. I am Nero Ouroboros.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
131	Ouroboros?
132	We were the skin shed by Ouroboros, the Primordial Serpent, when she elected to take on a human form.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
133	Together, we are Mystic Ouroboros.
134	But when we are apart, I am Bianca Ouroboros. Nero's counterpart.
135	In the impact of being shed from our mother, Nero was separated from her memories. I am the form those memories took on.
136	I alone retained her memories from the time of creation...
137	As well as Ouroboros's capacity for Eternal Recurrence.
138	Does that mean you're ageless and...immortal?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0031
306	Something like that. However, unlike Nero, I do not possess the ability to bestow power, and I can no longer take on my draconic form.
307	Furthermore, my combat-related abilities, unused for so long, have entered a dormant state. It is difficult to wield them while maintaining this human form, you see.
139	However, over the course of my long journey to find myself, I did learn one thing.
140	Our mother, Ouroboros, can detect soul bonds, and lead those who are strong of will down the path to power.
141	Naturally, there are many people who cannot hope to obtain such powers.
142	In other words, those who would turn their back on their truth...
143	Will never receive Ouroboros's boon. It makes perfect sense to me. Such powers would be dangerous in their hands.
144	However, I cannot help but root for those who have lost their soul bonds and desperately seek to regain them.
145	I always find myself wishing to see them fight against their lot in life.
146	...!
147	I feel the same way.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
148	Even I don't know why we were born with this contrary impulse to go against our mother, Ouroboros.
149	I don't know any more than you do. Perhaps it's necessary in order to maintain balance in this world... Or perhaps we are simply a pair of eternally troubled teens.
150	At the end of the day, all I can say is that it was you, Acht, who gave rise to this possibility.
151	M-me?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
152	I wandered for a long time before I found you, in one of the darkest pits of the world. You were an inspiration to me even then! You had been trampled and suppressed, yet you fought with strength and dignity.
153	I wanted to support your struggle however I could.
308	I couldn't give you much, but I could give you my blood.
154	Time and time again, her blood helped you recover from wounds that would otherwise have been fatal.
155	My blood couldn't enhance your lifeforce, grant you eternal youth, or make you immortal...but it did make it a little harder for you to die.
156	I like to think I made the right call.
157	Anyway... Congratulations on climbing Veda.
158	B-Bianca, I...!
159	Listen well. The source of our power lies here.
160	I still do not know what form our power takes, so I could not have told you before.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0016
161	And I am incapable of granting power to anyone, so there was nothing I could do to help.
162	Yet now that we have been reunited, we can bestow our combined power upon someone for the first time.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
163	The kind of power that the Templars have always dreamed of?
164	Yes. Between us we possess one of the Sources of Alchemy.
165	The foundation of the dimensional powers you and your friends came to wield.
166	What we can offer is the power of absolute destruction.
167	D-destruction!
168	We would need to take the entire world as compensation. It would be sent away to another dimension, leaving a blank slate in its place, so that a new era could begin.
169	Th-the entire world...!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
170	Yes, the price is high. But think what you could gain by resetting the world! You could lead a new and better life.
171	It'd be a hard reset, so to speak, except that it would be centered around a single individual. Around you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0045
172	I...
173	Is that really all we can do?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
174	Hm?
175	Nero...?
176	What about the sort of human power that Sol wished for? Or the power of revival that Zehn yearned for?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0043
177	In a sense, starting anew covers all those things, doesn't it?
178	Be honest with me, Acht. And with yourself.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
179	Acht? Is this not what you were hoping for?
180	I-I...
181	Acht?
182	Acht.
183	Do you seek power?
184	I...
185	I-I...	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
186	Come to think of it, the reason you called yourself the sun...
187	Was probably because you were afraid of being alone.
188	You gathered friends and comrades to your side to pick a fight with the world at large, not realizing until it was too late that you'd chosen the loneliest path there is.
189	Similarly, I'm sure the reason you created the commandments...
190	Was because you could feel your willpower slipping through your fingers.
191	Unbreakable. Unyielding. Determined. Uncompromising. Harmony. Honesty. Memory. Unforgivable. Unrestrained. Disillusioned and distasteful. These are our commandments. If I had to add another, it would be...Dissatisfied.
192	No. This isn't what I want.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0016
193	The only one left to uphold them is me.
194	I'm dissatisfied with this.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0017
195	I am all alone. I can feel my willpower slipping through my fingers. Therefore...
196	I've decided on a new commandment.
197	Commandment Number Twelve: Dissatisfied. Never grow complacent. Not even in the midst of sadness, misery, or regret.
198	Even if you fill your belly in the morning, it will be empty again by nightfall.
199	By the same token, no matter how full of sadness you find yourself, you will heal one day.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0018
200	Whatever you are going through, you can make it your strength. You can use it to help you grow..
201	Thank you for the meal.
202	You haven't even eaten anything yet, squirt.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
203	Sol and I haven't taken our culinary trip around the world yet.
204	It's far too soon for me to call it quits.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0008
205	But Acht...
206	Haven't you ever thought about throwing everything away and starting over from scratch?
207	I don't see what's wrong with that. If you're tired of this world, why not destroy it and let it begin anew?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0005
208	Some things will never be possible, no matter how hard you work towards them.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
209	This could be your only chance to undo Sol's death.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
210	As for that dream you shared...
211	If you restart the world, you might just be lucky enough to make it happen.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
212	...
213	Leading a life where I always win does sound appealing.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0031
214	Doesn't it just?
215	Losing hurts, in more ways than one.
216	Even so...my choice is clear.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
217	Once, I lived because of the blood I drank.
218	Since then, I've encountered more than my fare share of failures and losses.
219	However, it's because of those losses that I met Sol and he gave me an eyepatch.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0007
220	...
221	So I have to keep fighting.
222	I will fight against this world, and the reality of Sol's loss.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_battle_0019
223	I will bring him back, no matter what it takes. I will never stop searching for a way to restore him.
224	This is the power that Sol sought all along.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
225	The strength to fight the odds and turn the world around.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0005
226	You've become quite eloquent, Acht.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
227	I don't want to use the power you are offering me right now. I want to save it.
228	Are you certain? Without this power, nothing will change.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0043
229	I want to see what I can achieve with my own power first.
230	You might think that's a waste of effort, but...	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0016
231	...
232	To me, it's a battle worth fighting.
233	Interesting... In other words, you choose life, with all its ups and downs.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
234	There's a word for people like you: fearless.
235	Will you deride my desperate struggle?
236	No. Not at all.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0039
237	All I see is strength.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
238	Acht.
239	Yes?	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0004
240	I have witnessed the strength of your bonds. I trust in your fighting spirit.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0007
241	Will you show us what your strength can achieve, fearless one? Even in the face of inevitable truth, life, and death?
242	I wish you luck on your glorious journey.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0037
243	I pray you find an end to the villainous path hitherto walked.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0005
244	May you find the ultimate power you seek.
245	Sol.
246	From the very first day your light reached me, my path was set.
247	You two really are polar opposites.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
248	I will use the light you shone upon me to illuminate Lost Blue.
249	You are the one who will reflect Sol's light.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
250	I will always trace the path of the sun.
251	For I am Lost Blue's moon.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0001
252	I will not rest until I've found you again, Sol.
253	A new beginning needs a new name. Since I always follow after you, I took the "L" from Sol. And since I am the last remaining Templar of the old order, I will be the first of the new. Number one. Una.
254	Therefore, my new name shall be...Luna.
255	The name Acht will live on in the skies above, alongside those of my fallen companions.
256	I will always...l-light...your way.
257	Like the moon, I will shine on in the darkness, even in the absence of the sun.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0005
258	M-my light...will always...be with you.
259	My struggle will continue, through both victory and loss, just like the phases of the moon.
260	And, just like the moon, I will be watching over you.
261	Come on.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0006
262	I'm afraid this last part only happens in my dreams.
263	Follow me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
264	You held out your hand to me again.
265	You're hungry, aren't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
266	And I seized it with both of mine.
267	I'm starved!	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0004
268	Together, we joined the end of the cue, beneath blue skies that extend as far as the eye can see.
269	Are you still in? Even if it's boiling hot or pouring rain?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
270	I'd join you in a blizzard, Sol. You can count on me.	VO_acht_acht-c.acht_sys_0038
271	Good. Sounds like we're on, no matter the weather.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
272	It's a silly little fantasy, but it's all I have. I hope it made you smile.
