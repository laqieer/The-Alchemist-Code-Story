001	Ouro—what...?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
002	Now this is a peculiar fate. To think that one such as you would desire strength...	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
003	What is peculiar about wanting to become stronger?
004	I doubt that is your true desire.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
005	What?! It is only natural to want to have the strength to save those in need!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
006	I suppose you would be unaware. I should have figured someone like you would be this way.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
007	Someone...like me?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
008	You will find out soon enough. So, why do you seek strength?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0004
009	The eyes house your soul, and your soul resides in the humdrum of the everyday.
010	Oh?
011	Those are Celis's words. She embraced me as a mother would her child, and taught me these words.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
012	To protect the normalcy of the every day is to protect one's soul itself. Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.
013	I wish to protect the normal daily lives of all of Wadatsumi, not just my own. And yet...
014	As I am now, I can't even protect one small life in front of me! I can't do anything!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
015	So, yes, I desire power! I need the strength to stand against the cruelty I see before me!
016	Interesting.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
017	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
018	I cannot tell if this passion I see is yours, or if your true self is showing itself from behind the veil.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
019	It may even be the product of that overlapping that occurred when you were born, but...
020	This must be the fate wrought by that one and their sin upon the sleeping land...	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
021	I would say this is the perfect stage for you to shine. I will see this through to the end.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
022	What are you talking about?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
023	I will not make a contract with you, yet it is not insignificant that we crossed paths here.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
024	I can at least assist you in unleashing your latent powers.
025	I have no idea what it is you are talking about, but if it is going to help me save that little girl, then...do it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
026	I will accept nothing less!
027	Now then... Show me how your actions will affect that one's slumber!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
028	You, molded by the land of sin... Show me how you will struggle against your own destiny!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
029	!!!
030	Ngh... What was I...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
031	Grrraahgh!
032	I'm...back?! But this is when I—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
033	No! I will not give up! I will save that little girl!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
034	I must have the strength to save the lives of those before me!
035	"Look."
036	"This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."
037	"I still believe."
038	"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"
039	(Such a warm voice. Different from the ones I usually hear.)	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
040	(I can feel it. A warm power surging within me.)
041	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
042	Wh-what the hell is that?! Did I say that?! Did I summon that?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
043	Gragh! Gnnnngh!
044	M-Mom?!
045	Run! While I have it bound!
046	N-no! I can't just leave Mom here!
047	Trust me, I wish I could save her too! But that's just not possible!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
048	No! I'm not leaving Mom! I'm not going!
049	Do you think your mother would want to see you dead? Think of how she would feel if it was her own hands that killed you!
050	That's...!
051	Wouldn't she wish for you to be alive and well, no matter what?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
052	Mom...! Mom!!!
053	Hurry!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
