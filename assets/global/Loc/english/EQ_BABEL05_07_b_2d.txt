001	...
002	...
003	The ruins are in ruins, Corpse has run off... A fine mess this is, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
004	Chance Encounter lasts only for an instant.
005	They went back to their own time.
006	Then I guess I missed my chance to thank them.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
007	Who knows? You might have the opportunity again one day.
008	Oh yeah?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
009	If you live long enough.
010	It'd be nice to run into them again.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
011	Yeah...
012	I think so, too.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
013	Urgh... I used up too much power. I have to go home.
014	Home...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
015	Back to the world in which I belong.
016	She is a traveler, after all.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
017	You're...traveling?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0001
018	Yep. There was something I needed to learn.
019	Did you find out the answer to your first question?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
020	I did.
021	It was worth the trip.
022	Glad to hear it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
023	Albea.
024	Y-yes?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
025	I agree with you.
026	About what?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
027	I won't give up, see?
028	O-okay...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
029	Uh-oh! Now I really I need to get back!
030	Bye-bye!
031	In the end, she left without telling us who she really is or where she's from.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
032	We missed our chance to thank her, too.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
033	Maybe one day, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1016
034	...
035	Albea...
036	I'm all right.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
037	It's just... There's no closure.
038	...
039	Here. You can have this back.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
040	The joker card I gave you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
041	Nobody likes being left behind, after all.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
042	Keep it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
043	But...
044	I have one, too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
045	Another joker?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
046	When we were playing Old Maid, I removed it from the deck and forgot to put it back.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
047	...
048	Baggage from a long journey...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
049	Baggage...?
050	It gets too heavy if you're always dragging it along with you.
051	Especially for people like you who just keep on adding to the load.
052	The only thing for it is to pick it up and carry it.
053	Carry it?
054	I'll help you along. I'll take my share.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
055	You have a home to get back to, right?
056	I don't have any memories worth dragging along with me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
057	No problem. I'll share mine with you while we play cards. I've got a lot of stories about him, let me tell you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0020
058	About...Magnus?
059	Yeah.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
060	About the things he did?
061	Yep.
062	You'll tell me all about what he liked and what he hated? All about his life?
063	All of it.
064	I'll finally get to...see my brother?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
065	In a sense.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
066	Hah... Hahahah...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0008
067	What's up with you?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
068	You'll help me sort out all of these messed up feelings?
069	Yeah... Something like that.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
070	We...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
071	Hmm?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
072	Do you really think that we can carve out a proper life for ourselves now?
073	Today, I saw the line that shouldn't be crossed.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
074	And Magnus... He took away everything that would have been waiting for us on the other side of that line.
075	Corpse's attention, the dark side of Alchemy, and the sin that comes with it... He took it all for himself in one sweep.
076	Man, he really did it this time. He swept the whole dang table.
077	He even made off with my fear of being taken out as I sleep at night.
078	He was a masterful gambler to the very end, your brother.
079	I wouldn't have had him any other way.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
080	Mister Will...?
081	Just Will is fine.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
082	Hmph. Why did you have to make such a fuss about it before, then?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
083	Who else is gonna call me Will now that he's gone?
084	No more feigning ignorance.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
085	I won't leave you alone anymore.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
086	Good.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
087	What a pleasant surprise to meet you here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
088	Justice, justice, justice... That's all anyone ever talks about.
089	How boring. "The future of this world"? Who cares!
090	How presumptuous of people to think that anything they do matters in the grand scheme of time!
091	In the future...
092	I found people who were living their present...
093	People who fought for others.
094	No matter the era...
095	Even if malice should infest Alchemy, and the systems that govern it should rot...
096	I want to keep on living.
097	And that's why...
098	I'm gonna keep on fighting.
099	For the future of this world.
100	You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent alchemist.
101	I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud.
102	You must do your best to be a sister who can make him just as proud.
103	This coat...
104	My mother made it for me when I was little, for me to grow into. It's based on my brother's uniform.
105	When I grow up, I'm going to wear this for sure!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0004
106	I'm going to fix all of my brother's machines, too.	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0005
107	Then I'm going to open up a shop!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0006
108	From cups to clock tower bells; it'll be a mechanic's repair shop, where anything can be fixed!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0007
109	I'm back!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0008
110	[Thank you so much for your continued patronage.]
111	[I apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your patience.]
112	[I am delighted to inform you that, as of today, I am once more open for business.]
113	[Signed: Albea—proprietor of repair shop Magbea]
