001	See? I didn't need any help!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
002	You have fantastic skills in driving and battle... However.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0046
003	Huh?
004	Nnrgh!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0021
005	My projections based on the data available to me was not incorrect.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
006	I-I still don't owe you anything!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0016
007	Repairs complete. Moving to the next phase.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0032
008	Hmm? There appears to be some problem with the engine.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
009	Huh? I can't release the acceleration! Crap! This is bad, really bad!
010	Calm down. Keep your balance and don't let go of the handles.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
011	I appears that your cooling valve is malfunctioning. I'll ride alongside you and repair it.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
012	You can do that?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
013	"Acta, non verba."
014	Huh?
015	It means "action before words". This is a prototype I made.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
016	What?! You're kidding, right?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0026
017	I'm Reagan, maker of this prototype never meant to go on the market. How's that introduction?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
018	Permission to disassemble your transmission?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
019	Ugh, fine! Just fix it, please!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0004
020	Understood. Calculating time until repair...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0032
021	Pheeeew... What a relief.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
022	Guess your stubbornness saved me in the end. Thanks.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0033
023	I determined that your Alchemia bike was failing when I saw it before.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
024	What? You chased me down all that way to tell me that?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
025	Correct. I can't let a broken machine out of my sight like that. Furthermore, it's something I made.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
026	I see... Like me, you also hold a special fondness for your machines.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
027	Hey. Why don't you just ask what you wanted to ask me? I'll answer anything.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
028	All right. Initially, it was your Alchemia bike that I was interested in.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
029	However, after seeing your driving skill I shifted my interest to you, yourself.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0007
030	Huh? Me?
031	The components I created certainly have their faults.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0022
032	I tried used elements of ancient components to create the base design, but ultimately judged the whole project too impractical to actually use.
033	You must possess uncanny focus and precision in your work to be able to make use of it. For future mechanizations, I want to consult with you.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
034	Well... I mean, if there's something I can do to help, I don't mind. In that case, first...	VO_charis.charis_sys_0037
035	Wow! He's really got some skill!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0023
036	The maintenance you did on my bike really stabilized it!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0024
037	I hypothesize that the people able to use that bike are now very limited, but...	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
038	You mean, as long as I'm the one riding this, it should be fine?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
039	Incredible. I almost even think you could really fly on this...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0046
040	Hey, so... Yes?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
041	Yes. My machine has been properly restored.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0007
042	Hehe... I guess you aren't a complete stranger. You are the creator that truly moved me.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
043	It's not good to judge someone on appearance or rumors. You've got to get to know them personally!
044	If you were truly moved by my design, perhaps you can give mechanization of yourself further consideration? I need your measurements: height, weight, three sizes...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
045	Ahem... I'll gotta go. The horizon is calling me!
046	Wait a moment! Why are you fleeing?
047	Huh?!
048	I recall that you made a promise to assist me in my research.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
049	But you didn't say anything about doing anything to me!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0030
050	What the heck do my weight and three sizes have to do with anything?
051	What else would it be for but to bestow you with a mechanical body with the ideal proportions?	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
052	Anyhow, no means no! I'm still an innocent girl, you know!
053	An innocent girl? Data involving gender is completely unnecessary.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
054	Huh. Wait...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0025
055	No means no!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0027
