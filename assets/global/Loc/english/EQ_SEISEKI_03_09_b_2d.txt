001	Heheh. So you still can't find it within yourself to forgive me for the destruction of Wadatsumi and for burying that savior priestess.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
002	Watch it!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
003	However, by removing such trivialities, you can now finally obtain true power! I will show you what true ambition is!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
004	Shut up! I will never ask for power from the likes of you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
005	I will hold steadfast to my justice! I will not let the reputation of the Holy Guard be tarnished by evil!
006	Aghh!
007	Hold steadfast to your justice? The reputation of the Holy Guard? What strange things to say!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
008	Do you honestly believe that the Holy Guard is an order that pursues true justice?
009	If so, you are an idiot!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0008
010	Wh-what are you talking about?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
011	Fine. I will expose to you the truth behind that justice you bind yourself to.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0037
012	Who are you?
013	Nice to meet you. Or have we met before?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
014	My name is Waginau. I am one who preaches the teachings of the Holy Church of Babel.
015	The Holy Church? You speak lies!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
016	There is no way that one who disrupts the peace of the continent could swindle the Holy Church...!
017	Heheh. Can you say that even after seeing this?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
018	What?! The emblem of the Holy Church?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
019	As you are well aware of, only those who serve within the inner circle of the Holy Church are allowed to wear the emblem.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
020	That means that only the Lord Commander, the leader of the 7 Regiments can have an audience.
021	Lies! That's impossible!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
022	Heheh. If you don't believe me then you should ask someone. Maybe you could ask Lord Commander Zain.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
023	No...it can't be...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
024	Do you understand now? Even the Holy Order acknowledges me. They believe my ambitions are justice.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
025	The appearance of conflict is nothing more than a triviality. All of it is for the sake of ambition. Power and justice are nothing more than part of the process.
026	...!
027	Hehe...Yes. Think carefully about whether or not you want to maintain your own justice. In fact, think about whether that justice itself has any value at all.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
028	Hm?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
029	What's the matter, Waginau?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0048
030	It's nothing. A small matter came up so please tell me about the final conclusion once we get back.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
031	All right. But the Gluttony soldiers may show up here eventually. We don't have time to be taking it easy.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0038
032	I am aware of that.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
