001	Come on. Seriously! Where is she?! I've searched all over town!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
002	Her skill with the spear...I want to see it again. Besides, until I find out what her name is, it'll keep eating at me.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
003	...Hm? That girl in front of the flower shop...!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
004	Heheh... What beautiful flowers.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0008
005	I knew it! It's her! Who knew she could wear such a soft expression on her face?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
006	...Snap out of it. Now isn't the time to admire her!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
007	Hey! Do you remember me?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1003
008	...You.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
009	Oh... You were giving off a completely different vibe from the other day, so I wasn't even sure if it really was you.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
010	...What do you want?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0012
011	There's a lot I want to ask you about, but first, I have a request for you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
012	I want you to bout with me again.
013	Your skill with the spear is amazing, but I'm something of a sore loser. Please, let me fight you once more.
014	... ...
015	My honor as a gladiator is on the line. As absurd as my request is, I wish for you to indulge me. Please...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
016	Even if we were to fight again, I'm sure the result would be the same.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
017	What...?! How can I know unless I try?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0012
018	... ...
019	Are you going to remain silent again? In that case, I have an idea.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0030
020	...An idea?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0016
021	I will present you with this special cheesecake made from the freshest of cheese! It's one of my favorite sweets!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
022	... ...
023	Hmph... Is this still not enough? In that case, I'll buy you whatever food you want! I'll take you to my favorite restaurant!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
024	That's not the point...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
025	You still won't grant me my wish? I guess that speaks of my inability.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
026	That's still not the point...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0039
027	In that case, please train me until I am worthy to fight against you! Will you fight me then?!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
028	Your proposals are all over the place...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0017
029	I don't care! I will do whatever I can to fight you...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
030	There she is! It's her! She really has come to this city!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0024
031	Heheheh. If we defeat you, we'll become famous! Sorry, but we're gonna have to take you out!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0008
032	... ...
033	Hey, what are you guys doing?! I was talking to her first!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0012
034	Shut up, girl! Just because you're the only female gladiator here, don't let it get to your head! Stand back unless you want to get hurt!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
035	Hey...! That swordsmanship of yours is quite impressive, but...I have my own reasons for standing my ground here.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
036	If you're going to get in my way, I'll have to take all of you out!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0015
037	Aghhh...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0027
038	That's quite the arm you've got on you, but it's far inadequate to defeat me. Are you all right over there?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
039	...I'm fine.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0007
040	Right. Of course. I'm in no position to be worrying about you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0030
041	No, but...you helped me. Um...th-thank...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0039
042	That being said, I'm impressed how many people are targeting you. You really are an incredible person!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0008
043	Please! Let me train with you until I'm ready to take you on!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
044	... ...
045	Sigh... Fine. I won't be able to rest until I repay the debt I owe you for helping me anyway.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
046	The sweets you gave me can serve as your tuition fee.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
047	But...whether or not I'll fight you again will be determined after that.
048	Re-really? Yaay!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0023
049	...Well, all that commotion seems to have caused a troublesome crowd to gather, so we'll have to make it out alive first.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
