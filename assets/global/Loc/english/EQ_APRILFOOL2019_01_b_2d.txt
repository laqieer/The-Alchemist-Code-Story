001	Argh! I am not Headstrong Dias!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
002	Dias, there's been something wrong with father lately.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
003	What?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
004	Zeke found us, and so we were able to grow up in such a loving environment.
005	But lately, I've been hearing strange voices coming from his room. They sound like the squeals of a groupie to me.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
006	No... That's not possible!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
007	It's true! Father even has an idol poster up in his room!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
008	He must have become one of them!
009	Don't be foolish! This is Zeke Crowley, the hero of Envylia we are talking about! He wouldn't dare stoop so low as to become an idol groupie!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0012
010	Logi... I'm scared to go home.
011	I can still hear him in my head... Father, cheering for his favorite idol...
012	You've heard it too, haven't you, Dias?! What will become of the Blue Flame Guard's morale?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
013	Silence! These are nothing more than rumors! You know nothing of father!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
014	What're you ranting about, boy? I heard you saved the village from monsters. It appears you've been running around, doing as you please...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
015	Father! Y-you're not some groupie for any idol, are you, Father?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	What?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
017	I heard the cheers coming from your room, Father. Who is Miyu?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
018	From here, we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
019	Don't change the subject, Father!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
020	Come to think of it... Last night, in the camp, I heard father talking in his sleep.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
021	Something about wanting to drip maple syrup onto Miyu's dimples...?
022	So now even father is turning into Headstrong Zeke...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
023	Quit expanding on Headstrong Dias!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
024	Father? Are you a groupie for some idol?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0002
025	From here we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights. Our destination is the Gilrack Ruins beyond that.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0018
026	Father! You keep trying to change the subject!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0013
027	Father! Agatha is giving you a glare full of contempt! Are you okay with that?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
028	Logi, Dias, you join the scouting party. Agatha, you come with me.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
029	Absolutely not!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0040
030	Agatha... You're hurting daddy's feelings.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0022
031	Father! You're not acting like yourself!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0028
