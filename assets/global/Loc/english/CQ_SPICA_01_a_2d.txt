001	(I wonder when I got wounded...)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
002	Well, this has been a waste of time.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
003	My apologies, Sir Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
004	No. It's not your fault, Spica.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
005	All the same, I'll make sure to do a thorough preliminary investigation next time.	VO_spica.spica_event_1005
006	All right. That being said, that noble...who would've thought he was paying the Holy Guard?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
007	The Holy Order is rotten to its core, but the corruption of the nobles is a sight to behold.
008	It's just as you say.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
009	In order to eliminate all of the corruption within this world, I must obtain absolute power!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
010	Absolute power...that none can challenge!
011	(He's going mad...)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
012	(I owe so much to Sir Zahar...I respect and trust him.)
013	(But...)
014	(How long will I be able to stand by his side?)
015	(No! I must not think such thoughts! My dedication to Sir Zahar is absolute!)	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
016	... ...
017	...? Sir Zahar? What's the matter?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
018	Come this way! Step right over here! We've got pieces from all across the world at discount prices!
019	...It looks like a pottery market.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
020	I'll take a look. It'll serve as a welcome distraction.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
021	Understood. Let's go...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
022	There's no need for you to accompany me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
023	What...no! If something were to happen to you... I will accompany you!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
024	How about this over here? It's a celadon pot that originates from Saga!
025	Good sir! Please, behold this—an ancient dish from Wadatsumi! Isn't it impressive?
026	... ...
027	... ...
028	(Who would've thought that I'd get to spend such a quiet and tranquil time with Zahar like this?)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
029	Hmm...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
030	Is something wrong?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
031	There's nothing that I'm drawn to yet, although I didn't have any expectations.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
032	I see.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
033	Come step right up! Come step right up! Oh! Young mister and missus!
034	I have a perfect tea cup set for the two of you! It's quite the masterpiece! Isn't it? What do you think?!
035	Mi-mister and missus...?! How rude!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
036	...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
037	Lord...Zahar?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
038	Merchant, show me that squirrel figurine.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
039	Ah! This over here?! You've got quite the eye, good sir! Here, here, do observe it carefully!
040	Hmph...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
041	Spica, what do you think of this squirrel pottery?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
042	I...don't know too much about pottery.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
043	It doesn't matter. Just tell me what you think.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
044	I think...it's cute.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1003
045	Heh. Cute, huh?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
046	(Oh...did Lord Zahar...just smile?)	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
047	This was made by a master craftsman in Envylia. Hey, merchant.
048	Yes!
049	Where did you obtain this?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0001
050	Ah, a rich noble in Lustburg recently passed away and this was amongst his possessions.
051	I see. It was in Lustburg...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
052	Whoa!
053	?!
054	An arrow?! What is going on?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
055	Bandits! Bandits are here!
056	Bandits...?!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
057	(Just when I was getting to spend time with Lord Zahar!)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0012
058	Now who gave you lot permission to do business here?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
059	Indeed, the craftsmanship is wonderful. The delicacy of colors is quite different when it comes to a master's work...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0046
060	Whoa! Young sir, there are bandits here! Now isn't the time for such leisure!
061	Lord Zahar, what shall we do?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
062	...Merchant.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
063	Yes...?
064	I'll purchase this later. Protect it at all costs.
065	U-understood...hey, hold on! What are you doing?!
066	Spica, let's get rid of these pests.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
067	Understood.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
