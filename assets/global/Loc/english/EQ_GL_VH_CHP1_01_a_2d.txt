001	After a night's rest, Emrys arrived back at the mansion.
002	Time to meet "The Queen".
003	Emrys!
004	The Queen is waiting.
005	Morning, Red. Please lead the way.
006	("Hmm, an underground throne room...")
007	Welcome to my abode, Emrys of Elylon Teg.
008	("How did they know about my clan?")
009	I see that you had gotten my summons.
010	("A child?")
011	How should I address you, "Queen"?
012	Pardon my rudeness. I am Eliza, Queen of the Slothstein Branch.
013	I permit you to address me as Eliza.
014	("Let's play along for now...")
015	It is my pleasure to meet you, Miss...
016	Madam.
017	...
018	Apologies... Madam Eliza...
019	How did your organization get information on me? And why was I called here?
020	Straight to the point, I see.
021	As a reward for your timely arrival, I shall tell you.
022	We had eyes on you ever since you brought your sister to our facility for treatment. Remember?
023	!!!
024	She was suffering from some rare curse that befalls an individual of your clan every generation, yes?
025	I have seen the reports and we have a list of potential suspects that attacked that facility.
026	...
027	My sincerest apologies and gratitude.
028	Emrys bows before Eliza
029	It's because of us that your facility was destroyed by the villain who took my sister.
030	If I had just stayed instead of attending to my duties... Maybe I could have prevented it...
031	I swear on my clan's name that I will avenge your fallen and save my sister!
032	Please stand, Emrys. We are on the same page.
033	My goal is to get even with that "Villian" and to save a patient.
034	We pride ourselves as Goetia's bio-medical field. There is not a patient unsatisfied with our care.
035	However...
036	We lack "Combatants" to be sent out on a search and rescue mission alongside annoying internal affairs like the one you had kindly helped us with.
037	So, I have a proposal for you.
038	Assist me in getting rid of a few "affairs" and I will lend my hand in kind.
039	...I humbly accept your offer Madam Eliza.
040	Excellent...As we will be sending you into dangerous situations, I need to know if you can handle them.
041	Do you need a demonstration?
042	But of course. Albeit what's a little show of power without any real danger?
043	I hope you don't mind. We have really good medical staff here.
044	Won't be needing them.
