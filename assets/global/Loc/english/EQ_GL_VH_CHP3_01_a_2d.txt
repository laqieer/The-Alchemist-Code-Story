001	- Greed Dike, Zheng Yi's Mansion -
002	Sometime before the attack on Roxanne's manor...
003	Good evening, Lord Zheng Yi.
004	...Master Li Wang. An odd time to visit, would you not agree?
005	If it isn't urgent, may I suggest leaving it till the morrow? My servants will be glad to—
006	Tsk tsk. Is this how you treat visitors?
007	I'm here to address some...concerns I had from the last meeting, and I'd rather hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
008	Time is money, as you well know. So let's not dance around the subject.
009	What are you planning to do with Atropos?
010	I beg your pardon?
011	Don't play coy, Lord Zheng Yi. It doesn't suit you.
012	We both know there's only one reason it isn't public information...if you catch my drift.
013	That is quite the accusation, Master Li Wang.
014	No? You mean to tell me you're actually doing this for "the greater good"?
015	Well, it's none of my business what you tell yourself to sleep better at night.
016	Here, I have an offer for you.
017	Li Wang sets down a hefty briefcase on the desk, smirking as he clicks it open.
018	?!
019	...What is the meaning of this?
020	This, AND all the power you'll need in Greed Dike to enact your "grand vision," whatever it is.
021	All I ask is you let me in on it, hmm? A fair exchange, no?
022	Surely you know how much they despise you out there. Oh, they're all smiles in front of you, but it's just teeth.
023	Your little debacle over that failed project all but dropped you from their favor. Altruism doesn't make money, you know.
024	But it doesn't have to be that way. You're a clever man, Lord Zheng Yi. I don't need to spell it out for you.
025	Perhaps not when you had wanted my head on a silver platter.
026	Your...servants left quite the impression. I do not think I need to elaborate.
027	Tch. Petty, aren't we?
028	Assassination, "petty"? Then again, I suppose when the law bends under the weight of gold, anything is possible.
029	You have no right speaking of justice to me when it exists only for you and your ilk.
030	Heh...
031	Hahaha! So that's how it's gonna be, huh?
032	I gave you an easy way out and this is what I get in return.
033	Ah well. I'm sure we both expected this to happen.
034	What are you—
035	Li Wang's men burst into the room and begin rifling through every drawer in sight.
036	What have you done with my guards?
037	Those lazy fools? Probably peacefully napping under a tree somewhere or other.
038	I suggest you stay out of the way if you don't want any...accidents.
039	Or you can help speed things up if you'd just hand over everything you have on the Core.
040	You've gone too far, Li Wang.
041	Tch. I hate dogs who need a good kicking to roll over.
