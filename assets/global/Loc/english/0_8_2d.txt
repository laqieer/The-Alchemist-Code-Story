001	On your first campaign, you managed to defeat Vlad, one of the Deadly Trio.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0001
002	You truly are sons of House Crowley. Outstanding. There's no other way to put it.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0001_02
003	We're unworthy of such praise!	0_8_2d.logi_story0101_0035
004	You do us a great honor!	0_8_2d.dios_story0101_0032
005	Hehe...	0_8_2d.agasa_story0101_0004
006	Your Majesty, they still have much to learn. Such flattering praise will not serve them well.	0_8_2d.zeke_story0101_0001
007	Come now. I'm sure this news will bring great joy to the kingdom.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0002
008	Their almost reckless bravery reminds me of when you were young.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0002_02
009	This further proves they have brilliantly inherited what you, hero of the Wratharis War, have taught them.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0002_03
010	...You are too kind, Your Majesty.	0_8_2d.zeke_story0101_0002
011	Well then, Zeke, what is your take on the report that the Wratharis rebels have begun to use Alchemy?	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0003
012	I believe it is possible. After all, Wratharis was annihilated because they revived Alchemy,	0_8_2d.zeke_story0101_0003
013	even after it was forbidden in the Magna Code set by the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of Babel.	0_8_2d.zeke_story0101_0003_02
014	Their Alchemy was thought to have been eradicated along with the destruction of Wratharis, but they may have secretly passed it on.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0004
015	Hearing this, Logi and Dias exchange nervous glances.
016	In the continent, only the Holy Guard are permitted to wield Alchemy.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0005
017	Gabirond, as that is your area of expertise, how do you see this?	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0005_02
018	It is true that signs of Alchemy still remain within Wratharis.	0_8_2d.gabirondo_story0101_0001
019	If their report is accurate, I say we should pluck the buds as soon as we can.	0_8_2d.gabirondo_story0101_0001_02
020	So, they are training those to wield the forbidden art and eyeing a rebellion.	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0006
021	Most likely.	0_8_2d.gabirondo_story0101_0002
022	Along with Logi and Dias, I will search every corner of Old Wratharis. If we discover any rebels, we will annihilate them immediately.	0_8_2d.gabirondo_story0101_0002_02
023	If there are any traces of Alchemy, according to the Magna Code, the Holy Guard should be summoned to suppress them.	0_8_2d.gabirondo_story0101_0002_03
024	Very well. Zeke, take your children along with the Blue Flame Guard and discover the movements of the rebels!	0_8_2d.patrick_story0101_0007
025	Yes, Your Majesty!	0_8_2d.zeke_story0101_0004
