001	Run. All right, go back to the village.
002	No way I'm letting them escape!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0016
003	...! Wait, you!	VO_freed.freed_sys_0043
004	Don't stop me! I'm gonna kill the wolf! Kill it! Ahahah! I'm going to shred it to pieces!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0013
005	Enough of that! Agh...what strength...someone! Help!	VO_freed.freed_sys_0015
006	Out of my way!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0010
007	Ughh...	VO_freed.freed_battle_0026
008	We're all right. Um, my apologies...for the trouble the child caused.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
009	No. Still, that was quite the frenzy...
010	From when she came to our orphanage, whenever a wolf would appear or howl...or even the mention of one in conversation...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
011	I want to do something to help, but I'm not even sure of what the cause is.
012	I see...
013	Phew...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
014	You seem exhausted. You're quite the looker now.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
015	It was the first time I've been hit in the face.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
016	I have some medicine to prevent bruising. Hold on a second.
017	No, leave it. More importantly, I want to continue our conversation from the afternoon.
018	Oh, right.
019	According to the rumors...the landlord is connected to the Holy Guard.
020	Is that a fact?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
021	I couldn't confirm it, but its credibility is high. Quite a few people lost their lives trying to obtain this information.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0031
022	I see. If that's the truth then I'm sure the landlord will try desperately to conceal it.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0045
023	If Wratharis were to find out about it, it'll be a big deal.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0005
024	If that's the case, there's a danger of me interfering and making matters worse. It might be best if I don't meet with him.	VO_freed.freed_battle_0019
025	I wonder what's so fun about living one's life so fast and dangerous.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0030
026	Heheh. It's the times we live in. Can you hear that? The sound of history driving us forward?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
027	Even if that were the case, I feel like I want to shut my ears and stay buried in bed.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0010
028	With that attitude, you must be suffering a lot in your current position.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0049
029	I...
030	I see. So you're already leaving. I'm sorry I could not be much assistance. Will you be leaving tonight?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
031	Yes. I plan to return to the capital. By the way...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
032	Regarding the ingredients for the Stones...how are they being transported from here?
033	Well, it is being delivered directly to His Majesty...
034	For these past few months, the landlord has even prepared a carriage and escort for their transport.
035	(Just as I thought.)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0045
036	(The landlord is completely involved in the disappearance of the Stones' ingredients.)
037	Oh, that's right! If you'd like, please meet with the children.
038	They would like to thank you for having saved them.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
039	Oh dear. I'm not very good at those things.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0042
040	Lord Freed?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
041	Ah, um, of course.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
042	Lord Freed!
043	Thank you for saving us! I definitely want to become a soldier like you!
044	No, that...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
045	...!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
046	Ah...
047	Blanchett...
048	...!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0042
049	... ...
050	... ...
051	(The Stone is indeed responding. Is it responding to the strength of her Alchemia?)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0027
052	Can I talk with you a little?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
053	Why did you come over here? The other children want to talk with you.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
054	I'm not used to being seen that way. I'm more of the academic type.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
055	Academic?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
056	My work has more to do with academia than actual fighting.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
057	I don't really understand those things. Do you mean you read difficult books?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1003
058	Well, deciphering old texts is part of my work. Also, I help draft policies and gather information.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
059	Yeah, it seems difficult.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
060	It's quite fun when you get used to it. Much more enjoyable than swinging a blade.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0008
061	Um...Mr. Freed?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0031
062	You can just call me Freed. For starters, I'm not as great as everyone says I am. It's more a reflection of my parentage.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
063	My father is a soldier of Wratharis. He's a tough guy. Apparently, before the rise of the Deadly Trio, he was the head of the army.
064	So he's a scary person.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0045
065	Yes. That's why no one would come near me when I was a child.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
066	For other children, it was like I was carrying a bomb.
067	I'm used to it now, but at the time it made me feel very lonely.
068	I'm not scared of you.
069	My father and mother are here with me. The bright red of that day is burned into my vision!
070	(The Stone again... Does it respond with excitement every time she reacts emotionally?)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
071	That's why I'm going to live. No matter how painful it gets, I'm going to live, live, live!
072	With my own hands, with these blades...I'm going to eradicate all the wolves!
073	(Oh...even after she lost everything...her family...her home...she's chosen to live.)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
074	Do you always carry those blades with you?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
075	I got them from my mother... They're more important to me than life itself.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
076	That's why...if I use them to kill all the wolves...all of them...I'm sure I can go back to my home.
077	...I see.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
078	Blanchett.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
079	...?
080	Fold here like this. All right, now can you use your blade to cut here?
081	Folding paper? Why would I...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
082	Here, try it.	VO_freed.freed_chara_1005
083	Just once.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
084	Then spread it like this...see?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0033
085	A paper...rabbit?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
086	It's called folding pictures. What do you think? That's not a bad way to use your blades, is it?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
087	Folding pictures...I didn't know I could use my blades like that.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0045
088	It's not just your blades...I'm sure there are many things you can do. Revenge is only a small part of who you are.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0023
089	Huh...?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
090	Even if your revenge ends, your life will continue. That's why you should start thinking about what happens when it's all over.
091	I'm sure you'll be able to find a different answer.
092	Free...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
093	Oh, that's so cute! Did you make that, Blanc?
094	Um, well...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
095	Wow, that's amazing! It's like magic! Hey, can you make a squirrel?!
096	Um, well...Freed?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
097	I'm sorry. I only know how to cut out a rabbit.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0035
098	Aww...a-are you serious?! Er, squirrel...maybe, if I cut this here...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0026
099	Wow! It's a squirrel! Amazing!
100	Are you not scared of me?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
101	Don't you remember how you protected all of us, Blanc?
102	...!
103	Of course, I was a little surprised, but I know you're like an older sister to me.
104	So thank you, Blanc! You were a little scary but really cool!
105	...I see. I see...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
106	Blanc? Why are you crying?
107	It's nothing. I'm completely fine...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
108	Oh, I'm glad.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0008
109	...Huh?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
110	You're finally here now. You're making new relationships here. Your life of value to others.
111	I'm relieved. Your life is much more radiant than mine.
112	...Freed?
113	Well, I'm gonna go now. Be well, Blanchett.
114	...Is that story true?
115	Yes. As early as tonight, the children are going to be brought from that orphanage to the capital.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
116	They're going to be used as ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone...that abominable Alchemy crystal...
117	Are you telling me the rumor that the royal family of Wratharis is indulging in Alchemy is true?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
118	Yes! In order to stop this abomination, I have been secretly strengthening my ties with the Holy Guard, but...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
119	I never expected them to move so fast.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
120	The Holy Guard still has not received permission to send troops and my personal soldiers stand no chance against the Royal Guard.
121	These past few months, I've tried every means possible to protect the children, but...
122	Indeed, this blood has a strong Alchemia reaction.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0016
123	There is no doubt then that the owner of this blood...the children of the orphanage, are being carried into the capital?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0031
124	Of course. You've witnessed how, even now, Wratharis troops are stationed outside the village.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
125	... ...
126	Please, Captain Zeke! Use your power to save these innocent children!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0041
127	I belong to Envylia. If this occurs within Wratharis territory, it'll start a war.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0001
128	That may be the case. But think of all the lives that'll be lost if you let this abomination occur! The poison of Alchemy will spread like wildfire!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
129	This is to protect the Magna Code...to maintain the stability of the continent. Please think of it that way!
130	I will save the lives of the children. That alone is enough, correct?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0004
131	That is all I ask.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
132	...Very well.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0005
133	...
134	It appears to have gone well.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
135	...?! Y-you scum...there...I've done my part, have I not?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0023
136	Yes, it's enough.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0037
137	Blue Flame Wolf Zeke...he does not need this many men to start a war with Wratharis.
138	Furthermore...in the name of the Holy Guard, I will rule Wratharis under the direct jurisdiction of Northern Pride!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
139	... ...
140	Agh?! Wh-why...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
141	It's natural to dispose of that which is no longer necessary, isn't it?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
142	A pig like you which is motivated by greed has no place bearing the name of the Holy Guard.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
143	In order to bring peace to this continent...you will sink along with Wratharis in the depths of history.
144	...Um.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
145	Oh, what is it this late at night. It's time for children to be in bed, you know?
146	I thought that Freed might be here, so I came to ask.
147	Oh, would you be Blanchett?
148	Yes. Why do you ask?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
149	I was given something to give to you in case you came asking.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0037
150	Huh? A difficult-looking book...and a beautiful stone?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
151	Don't ask me about it. I don't know what it means. If I recall...he said that it was a charm to protect you.
152	That's so mean. He didn't even say a proper goodbye.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0021
153	Was there something you wanted to talk with him about?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0004
154	No, it's not that, but...the last time I met him it was like I felt he was going to disappear...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
155	Besides, I can't read this difficult book...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
156	I'm sure you will meet him again. You know, you could always go directly to his workplace?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
157	Workplace?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
158	He works as the administrator for the National Library. If you're interested, then try to go see him. You can shove that book back in his face while you're at it.
159	The National Library...
160	All right then, back home with you. If you stay up too late, you'll regret...
161	A-an enemy attack! Everyone, hurry and run...agh?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
162	What?!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0025
163	...! The orphanage is in danger!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0042
164	Oh, hey! Wait! It's dangerous to go there now!
165	Lord Freed, preparations for departure have been completed.
166	All right. There's no time to waste. Let's head out immediately.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
167	Understood! Make way for the carriage! We return to the capital!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
168	I'm sorry, Neville. I gave that Stone to the girl.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0035
169	(I wonder why I did that.)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
170	... ...
171	I know. It was because she was dazzling. Hating something, yet trying so hard to live.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
172	If there are children like that...then I am sure a bright future awaits Wratharis.
173	Heh. I'm starting to sound like a withered old man.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0010
174	I wonder if there truly will be a moment for me when I will feel like I'm alive.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
175	Hurraahhh!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0032
176	Agh! Enemy attack! All soldiers, battle stations! Protect Lord Freed!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0026
177	What...?! An attack now?!	VO_freed.freed_sys_0027
178	Don't get in my way!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0001
179	Keep the conflict to a minimum! Promptly secure the carriage and enable its escape!
180	Yes, Captain!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
181	You are Captain Zeke of the Blue Flame Guard. What are you doing here?!	VO_freed.freed_battle_0024
182	I will have you free the children you are trying to take with you!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0013
183	What are you talking about?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
184	(Could this be on the orders of the landlord?! He must be trying to stop me before I can report to His Majesty!)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0042
185	In any case, your use of Envylia's soldiers can be seen as nothing more than a proclamation of war.	VO_freed.freed_battle_0021
186	Huzzah!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0007
187	Agh!	VO_freed.freed_battle_0026
188	(An academic like me is no match for them! I need to persuade them...no...you fool! How can you speak reason to that legendary Zeke on the battlefield?!)
189	Hurrah!
190	Lord Freed, we've received word from the soldiers left in the village! There was some kind of raid!
191	What...?!	VO_freed.freed_sys_0027
192	(Ack! If the landlord is behind all of this...)	VO_freed.freed_battle_0021
193	She...the orphan children are in danger! Hurry! We need to head back to the village!	VO_freed.freed_battle_0020
