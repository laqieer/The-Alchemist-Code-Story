001	Grraaaah! Agraaaahhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0020
002	Haa...haa...! W-we did it!
003	Phew! We made it! Y'know, for a therian, you're not bad!
004	Huh? Um...thanks! Hee hee.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
005	You fought incredibly well.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0037
006	I guess I did! Seeing how strong your commitment to Envylia is... I was reminded of someone who once died to protect me.
007	I remembered how he was fully prepared to put his life on the line for what he believed in, and I realized...	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
008	The very thing that I'm missing is the same thing that both of you have in common.
009	I bet that's what Sir Gerald saw in me too.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
010	Probably. He's not the kind of person to make judgments based on race, after all.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0005
011	If you lack conviction, you will falter—and that often means death. You cannot hope to protect anyone like that.
012	I understand that now. I've also realized that I had no idea what a real fight meant until today.
013	Haha. I bet I'd be in for a tough fight if I went up against you now.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0007
014	Although, I suppose there are still walls you'll have to climb.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0002
015	I might be a therian—but that doesn't matter!
016	Today I learned that if everyone works together to overcome something, no difficulty is too great!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
017	I'm sure that the same can be said for the obstacles I'll face as a therian!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
018	I want to overcome those obstacles, and use my experiences to bridge the walls between us and connect everyone together!
019	I see. So those are your convictions.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0037
020	I don't think Sir Gerald is ready to forgive the therians who abandoned his father even now.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
021	Yet he has still treated me no differently than he would have if I were a human.
022	All he cares about is whether or not I am capable of joining him and the Scarlet Flame Guard on their mission to ensure the joy and laughter of the people.	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
023	That is the kind of person I aspire to be. I want to be able to fight alongside him, with an unshakable iron will, as a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
024	Haha. I like that spark in your eyes, Nina. I expect great things from you.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0023
025	You can count on me!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0038
026	I will protect the joy and happiness of all those around me!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
