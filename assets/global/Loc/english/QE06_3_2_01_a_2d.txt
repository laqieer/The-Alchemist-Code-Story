001	I didn't think we'd see each other again so soon.
002	I'm glad we did. I wanted to know what happened next. And...I have something I'd like to ask you about, too.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
003	...!
004	What is it?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0006
005	No, wait. I don't have time for this right now! I can't... But... I...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
006	There's so much I still want to know! So much I want to ask! Should I...?
007	You'll be fine. You have friends who will protect you.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
008	Azami!
009	Besides...
010	......
011	What? What is it?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
012	It's nothing. Never mind. Shall I continue where we left off, then? Shall I tell you more of the truth of everything?
013	Are you prepared for what you may learn?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
014	This really is the worst possible timing, but...this is something only I can do.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
015	I'll put my faith in my friends, and my captain, and listen to your tales once more.
016	Please, do continue.
017	Very well, then. Let's begin. I will share with you the memories that lie dormant in this land.
018	And with them, I will grant you a glimpse at the root cause of the malice that now envelops it all.
019	Please do!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
