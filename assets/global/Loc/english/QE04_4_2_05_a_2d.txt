001	I've seen it before, in a book I once read! I see... That tattoo...and your purification powers... Don't tell me...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
002	Georgios, we have to treat your wounds right away!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
003	No...it's too late. Beelzebub...has been taken from me yet again.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
004	Why...? Why did you shield me?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
005	I have told you before: the responsibility is mine alone. Therefore, I should be the one to fight it till the bitter end!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0018
006	Is this the end for me? I was to reclaim Beelzebub with these very hands... To be unable to fulfill my clan's duty will be the greatest regret I leave behind!
007	What are you rambling about?! We're not done yet! I will not allow you to die here!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
008	I wanted...to prove...that my clan was strong. I...wanted to fulfill...my clan's mission...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0020
009	I knew it. Your clan is the one Tamis mentioned before... You're a survivor of the Sephira!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
010	The people of Sephira...had the power of purification...and thrived under the Sephiron tree...but in the end, were completely exterminated. You're saying Georgios is a survivor of that clan?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
011	The Sephira were the original guardians of Beelzebub. To that end, you...
012	Yes, we were the keepers of Beelzebub. Its fate was ours to bear. That was our duty. For that sake, I continued to pursue you time after time, and now I...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0042
013	Georgios...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
014	As the last survivor of the Sephira...I swallow my pride...and beg of you... You must re-take Beelzebub in my stead.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0041
015	Don't speak any more, Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
016	Were we exterminated...because we were...weak? Are...we humans...mere insects in the sight...of nature?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0022
017	Nay... I refuse...to believe it! You...must...live on!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
018	What...are you doing?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
019	Haha...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
020	This is—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
021	I have bestowed upon you what little remains of my strength... The power of purification now dwells within the cloth wrapped around your arm.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
022	Georgios!
023	You now have the power to reverse Beelzebub. I regret that I cannot be the one to reclaim it once more, but I entrust that duty to you.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0042
024	Once you defeat it, we may have a chance to meet again... Urgh!
025	Enough. You've said enough, Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
026	Hahaha... So this is what...it's like to have someone you...can trust.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0010
027	I...leave the rest...to you...my strong comrades.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0021
028	Georgios! You can't die yet! Georgios!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
029	Glurrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
030	They just won't give us a break!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
