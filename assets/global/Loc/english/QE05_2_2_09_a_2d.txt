001	Isidore... How is Malta?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
002	The military doctor said that she is fine, physically. It's just that she has not regained consciousness.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
003	Oh...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
004	I will be joining the other troops in battle as part of the rear guard. Take care of Malta for me, will you?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0041
005	Wait! What?! Why are you—?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
006	The Liberation Army stuck their necks out for our people. It would be churlish of me to let them take all of the heat.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
007	Why must it be you? If anyone should stay behind, it should be me! It's my duty to our people as the next Chief of the Sephira!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
008	Kamui, I have always known. I always knew how you and Malta felt about each other... I did. I always...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
009	Isidore?
010	Let me die here. This is my place. The only one who can save Malta's heart is you.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0012
011	Isidore, you don't understand. I have no intention of dying.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
012	Look at you, Isidore. Do you really plan to go to battle in such a battered state? Of the two of us, I have more strength to spare. I will survive.
013	You think I will just believe you?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
014	At the end, Waginau said to me, "This will be a troubled time for the Sephira."	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
015	You are the next in line to be Chief. You have a responsibility to our people to live on and protect them through the coming days.
016	Kamui, but...!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
017	But...I have no right to lead our people. I... Chief Iakov...
018	Look at me, Isidore.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
019	Kamui...?
020	I see that you have been struggling with something all on your own, something heavy. I am sorry that there is no time for me to hear it.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
021	We must live on, Isidore. We must live on, all of us...so that we might one day return to our home.
022	Be strong, Isidore. We will need your strength.
023	I know nothing of leading people. You are the only one the Chief taught to bear such a burden.
024	The journey our people must undertake to outrun our enemies will be long and arduous. I'm sure that our people will need the lessons he taught you.
025	You might be right, however—!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
026	Allow me to fulfill my duty, Isidore. You must lead the Sephira now.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
027	You... Iakov said the same thing.	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
028	I promise you that I will survive and return, Isidore. Let me know when Malta wakes up, okay?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1009
029	What? Kamui! Kamui, wait!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
030	...
031	You don't want to say your goodbyes to Kamui?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
032	Um... It seems like he's kinda busy right now.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
033	A-and I'm sure he'll be fine. He's Kamui.
034	I see...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
035	Well, I guess this is goodbye, then, Hisham. I'll be joining the rear guard as well.
036	Wha—?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
037	No, but y-you're really strong, Teona. You and Kamui, you'll definitely survive and...!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
038	Oh, Hisham...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
039	What's with that?! You're supposed to promise that we'll meet again soon! Even if it's a lie! You can't even give me false comfort?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
040	So many people have already died! So many, and yet more will die today and tomorrow, and...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
041	Nnn... Wh-why...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
042	I-I'm so sorry, Hisham. I'm so sorry that we adults weren't able to create a better world for you. I'm so, so...sorry.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0036
043	No... Why...? This isn't fair!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0019
044	Looks like we're ready. Thank you, everyone.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
045	All of us here are united in one goal: To fight to protect the backs of our fellows! We are here to give them a chance to pave a new world!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0002
046	For many of us here, this will be our very last stand. Perhaps we are the cowards. We shall escape the humiliation of trying to live.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
047	However, take heart in the fact that our sacrifice here means saving the lives of our friends and loved ones!
048	We fight! We fight to live! We must live on, even if not all of us can!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0030
049	Huzzah!!!
050	Kamui... Good luck.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
051	Yes. We cannot afford to fail. We must do what we can to give Malta and the others a chance to escape!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
