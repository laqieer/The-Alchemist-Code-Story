001	Whew! And that's the last of them.
002	Giving Alchemia particles to kids and summoning monsters...
003	What were you thinking?
004	Oh give it a rest, Sieg. It's clear Zheng Yi took the meaning of Halloween too literally.
005	I apologize for the misconception.
006	It seems like I still have much to learn and understand about this world.
007	It's okay, Sir Zheng Yi! We know you had good intentions!
008	The spirit of Halloween is what matters, and you showed us that!
009	...!
010	Such heartfelt gratitude. My feelings mirror yours. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
011	*Sigh* All's well that ends well, I guess.
012	Just don't summon any more monsters, okay?
013	With amends made, Siegfried and friends continue to enjoy the rest of the day's festivities.
014	The town's Halloween spirit ends with an all time high.
015	Happy Halloween everyone!
