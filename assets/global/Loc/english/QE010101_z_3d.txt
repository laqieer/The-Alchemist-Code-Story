001	Dias...
002	He seems to be temporarily blinded by emotions.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
003	I doubt it is anything to be worried about.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
004	...Lord Gabirond.
005	You've heard Dias's words. Does the king also feel the same way?
006	What did he say again? "Using peace to start a rebellion"?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
007	If he thinks that's the case, there's been a grave misunderstanding.
008	We—
009	I was simply ordered to ascertain the true motives behind your actions.
010	If you say that your actions are aimed at bringing peace to our two kingdoms, then I shall tell His Majesty so.
011	...Lord Gabirond.
012	The reports that Dias defeated the Demon on his own...are those true?
013	Indeed. Even the Paladins looked on with astonishment. I suppose nothing less should be expected from a son of yours, Captain Zeke.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
014	You do me too much honor.
015	He still has much to learn. Yet, when did he gain so much power?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
016	Perhaps he meddled further with the forbidden arts... Is that what you are thinking?
017	No... I believe you've given him generous opportunities to learn.
018	I can no longer ask you to sacrifice your time.
019	I believe it is suitable that he return to the Blue Flame Guard.
020	Perhaps he has forgotten his original purpose and is now committed to pursuing power... Is that what you are worried about?
021	No... As I left him in your care, Lord Gabirond, such fears would be unfounded.
022	In any case, our purpose is to serve the well-being of Envylia—nothing more, nothing less.
023	This peace treaty is in service to that purpose. Please relay this to the King.
024	I will certainly tell him so. Please set your mind at ease.
025	Very well. I take my leave.
026	Heheh. Well then...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
