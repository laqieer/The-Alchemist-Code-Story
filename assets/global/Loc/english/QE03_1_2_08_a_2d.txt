001	Eeeeeeeek!!!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0043
002	Hurry...to the underground!
003	Matthew, huh? It's been a long time. Has it been so long that you've forgotten what the insect you just crushed was?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0002
004	...!	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0042
005	That was a man who was turned into an insect by a witch. He was one of our comrades. You know that, don't you?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
006	Even if we are both men...his attempt to hurt children makes him a pest!	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0012
007	Hmph. A pest, huh? That's quite the statement, Matthew.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
008	Matthew!
009	D-don't come. Run!	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0025
010	Don't be silly! We are much more capable of fighting than men!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
011	Well, well...if it isn't the heiress of the Helkovara family.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0007
012	And who are you?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
013	That armor... So the rumors are true.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
014	Alma?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
015	Bugmail—the resistance that has been secretly growing bit by bit.
016	The resistance?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
017	Oh? You seem quite well informed, young lady. Quite so. I am the leader of the Bugmail—Salomo.	VO_salomo.salomo_chara_0001_01
018	Those with weapons name themselves in battle.	VO_salomo.salomo_chara_0001_02
019	Do you understand the meaning of this meritless act?!	VO_salomo.salomo_chara_0001_03
020	Have you resolved yourself?! That man may very well be your father.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
021	He may be your brother, your grandfather, or someone you once had a crush on!
022	All the insects in this country were once men that were transformed by the Curse of Asmodeus!
023	...?!
