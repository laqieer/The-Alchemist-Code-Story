001	Are you who I think you are?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0027
002	All operations completed. Enclosure of the consolidated territory confirmed.
003	The lid had been tightened upon the end days.
004	Allocating all resources to environmental conservation. Activating Ring of Ouroboros. Severing all access to outer world.
005	Wait! Stop!
006	All routes blockaded. All destinies anchored. Activating bypass of destruction through continued circulation of present time.
007	Future survival of dragon species...confirmed feasible. Preservation of species is possible through the continuation of current operations.
008	Isolate the cycle. Devour my tail to transmigrate. Ouroboros ensures a tomorrow much like yesterday.
009	Wha— How?! Ouroboros?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
010	That voice... It's the same as back then!
011	...So, she's connected with the Shell to ensure her survival. It seems contact with Ouroboros as Schmeier envisioned may occur sooner than expected.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0045
012	...
013	Why the long face?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0005
014	I...
015	Zafeiris? Ah, Sia! You have to help her!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
016	Don't worry. She's all right. Thank you for protecting her.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
017	Huh? Oh, good! That's a relief.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
018	But, how did I protect her?
019	No memory, huh? Best not to concern yourself with that right now. Let's just be grateful everybody's okay.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
020	Can you stand, Lil?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
021	Yup!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
022	Claybelle...
023	This is where we part ways. Staying any longer would only cause more trouble for everyone.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0035
024	I understand. Seeing what they're willing to do, it would be unwise indeed for you to stay in one place any longer than you have to.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0022
025	But where will you go next? Don't tell me you're already plotting to raid Ophioneus' stronghold!
026	I thought I'd head toward the Envy Layer—to Melvillei's domain.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0034
027	Ah, the credulously good-natured Melvillei. It's a good thought. Ophioneus' forces aren't likely to set their sights there too soon.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
028	I can write you a formal letter of introduction, to ensure your safe pass—	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0038
029	I'm afraid that won't be necessary.	VO_chahele.chahele_battle_0013
030	Urgh! What?!	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0019
031	A high elf... One of Ophioneus', I presume! What did you just do to me?!
032	Ack! Gah?!	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0022
033	Oh, my. Number 73 was quite a stout specimen. Who would've imagined it would go down in one hit?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0009
034	I'm just glad it accomplished its mission. I would've hated to see the death of a like-minded dragon amount to nothing!
035	My apologies. I understand you must be furious, but I cannot permit you to take out your rage upon me right now.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0036
036	We are a sort of a colony of beings, so ordinarily my death would be meaningless. But in actuality, when one of us dies, it causes such an irritating noise for the others! So I must respectfully retreat. You understand.
037	Urk!
038	Agh! Th-this magil...!	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0025
039	Claybelle! Allow me to—
040	Get back! Don't touch me!
041	What?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
042	Don't mind...me! Take my disciples, and...run! Ghhhah?!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0019
043	I see. This confirms it. The illness born in this Stratum...comes from sin. Be it mine, or the humans'... Any sin, from any source...
044	It's our fault. Our failures have brought this about.
045	Claybelle...
046	Do not...try to save me. Touch me, and you too...will be corrupted.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0015
047	Huh? Wh-what's happening?!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
048	Ah... I-I...	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0018
049	...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0018
050	(This magil emanating from Claybelle... I can only imagine the effect it might have on humans and dragons alike...)
051	Lil, take that girl with you and run into town. You must warn the people there.
052	But what about you, Zafeiris?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0039
053	I will...try to stop her.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0002
054	L-let me help!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
055	I'm sorry, but I cannot fight her and protect you at the same time. Claybelle is one of the seven great dragons. She is a dragon who still preserves her primordial form.
056	But you can trust me. You know I'll do everything I can.
057	O-okay... But you have to promise you'll come back to me!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0037
058	Claybelle...
059	Fool. I told you to...run.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0029
060	I can't just leave you like this.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0035
061	There is no way to save me now. This illness infects not the body, but the soul. My magil is contaminated...corrupted.
062	Still!
063	I can't abandon a friend. I won't! Not again. Not anymore.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0040
064	Hmph... Haha. A friend, eh?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0010
065	Then you know what you have to do. Don't hesitate. Kill me. I don't want to harm my disciples, nor any of the other humans.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0017
066	That is the greatest mercy you can give me right now.
067	!!!
068	Ooooooghh!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0028_b
