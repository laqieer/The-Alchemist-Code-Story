001	There!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
002	Oh my, I better watch out.
003	It seems this Invidia knight is rather skilled.
004	Those that don't rely on magil make such troublesome foes. My preparations are wasted on you.
005	Preparations? Are you the one who messed up the magil in this place?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
006	It is simply one of Satna's specialties.
007	Don't you think it's so very convenient? What an elegant way to render normally powerful foes powerless.
008	So how come you get to have an unlimited supply of magil, huh?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
009	And how come you're using Space-Time Manipulation?! Only the two of us and our teacher should be able to use that!
010	Every art has its roots in another, young lady.
011	And so too was Space-Time Manipulation once developed for a specific purpose.
012	Time Travel. The ability to travel into the past or future. The ability to alter past regrets and undo unforeseen threats at their root.
013	There once was a magic user who desired that power, even before the Cursed Beasts appeared.
014	...You're making it sound like that was you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
015	...
016	Ah well... Playtime is over.
017	Nnrgh?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
018	Aaargh!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
019	He's...compressing the magil in the atmosphere?	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
020	Do you get it now? This the power of a Space-Time Manipulator who controls a Cursed Beast.
021	Who...controls a—?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
022	Dear Satna is happy to do my bidding... Well, I suppose they get a little wild sometimes, but that's pets for you.
023	Rest assured, pursuers. I didn't come here to kill you.
024	There's just a small matter I must attend to.
025	Huh?! Hold up! What kinda pervert touches a girl after rendering her motionless?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
026	You're going to give people the wrong idea. The two of you could be my great-grandchildren.
027	Whatever you're thinking about is none of my business. Hmm, here we go.
028	You're taking Libra?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
029	Well, I needed this. I am ever so grateful that you delivered it right to me.
030	Is that why you lured us here? To this place where neither magic nor Spiritbonding is effective?	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
031	Aren't you a smart boy. 50 points for you.
032	Oops. Looks like that cranky child just woke up. Seriously, I wonder if Icona ever had to deal with such an unruly beast.
033	Ah well, parting is such a sweet sorrow, but I fear that we must.
034	W...ait...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
035	Well then, I bid you adieu. Try not to die out here. In fact, it's probably for the best if you just leave if you can manage it.
036	After all, the Ira Belt will perish shortly.
037	Quence of the Infinite Serpent... A man that possesses both great skill and the power of the Cursed Beast.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
038	He's going to be more trouble than expected.
039	Ah, right, Andechs! Are you okay?!
040	Ngh...nnhg....	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
041	He's terribly wounded! Please, Emmel, Eulalia! You have to help him!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
042	I'm on it!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
043	...I don't get it...
044	I was fighting against all of you, and yet you...
045	I was your enemy...
046	First King Arius, now you too... Why would you...for me...
047	Why...?
