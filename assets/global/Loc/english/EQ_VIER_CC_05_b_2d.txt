001	Silently... Just like all the rest...
002	In this frozen time, there are none to hear the sounds of chilled wind, the snow crunching underfoot, or the screams.
003	Let sleep come!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
004	The insects swarm around the beds of the high elves.
005	Quietly and comfortably, until the end...!
006	In their sleep, the high elves will go on to be fodder for the hungry bugs.
007	One set of footfalls. One cry, raised in the silence.
008	Unable to scream, they will but lie there as their eyeballs are gouged out and chewed up.
009	Please...stop...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
010	The sound of crunching bones, of innards being ripped out... Of flesh chewed and blood sucked out...
011	Please! Stop! I don't want to hear it!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0019
012	Eardrums shredded...
013	Ugh...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
014	Sh-sh-she's d-dead...
015	I-I-I-I killed her! She s-said she wanted to sleep, so...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0019
016	B-But...! Oh no... I'm... I'm so, so s-sorry...! I'm sorry!
017	"Yet the sinners would be transformed by the blood, Alchemia, and souls of the high elves they killed, marking their bodies with the evil deed they had done. Even their descendants were cursed to carry that mark."	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
018	The rot of lies and sin becomes a wound so deep no cosmetics or perfume can conceal it.
019	"The sin of betraying their people carried forevermore."
020	Not even magical incense or illusion could completely hide the rot of body and soul inflicted upon the dark elves with dark alchemy.
021	"Then will you stay by my side, always?"	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
022	Deceived...
023	"Always."	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
024	Forced to sleep forever, trapped in an unwanted dream fulfilled.
025	"Are you sure? Always is a long time."
026	She was always so polite, always looking up to me...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
027	"As sure as can be. Always."	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
028	It's...just...me...
029	"Then will you join me in my bed tonight?"	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0003
030	What kind of tutor...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0019
031	"I wish to have no more nightmares."	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
032	"But if I must have nightmares, I will not be afraid if you are with me."
033	"Throw off the chains."
034	"For whom does the King of Darkness rise? For whom does the King of Darkness fight?"
035	"If the King of Darkness should appear before the dreamless sleep of eons runs its course..."	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
036	"The Blade of Promise must be wielded unto the end."
037	Only then were you able to enjoy true sleep...
038	Such sweet dreams...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
039	I wonder if I can sleep. Where might I...?
