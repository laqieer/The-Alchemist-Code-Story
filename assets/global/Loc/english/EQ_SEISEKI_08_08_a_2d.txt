001	Reinforcements! What are you doing?! Please, hurry this way!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
002	Don't be stupid! This is more important! Hey, hang in there!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
003	...! Oh...is this the Blue Flame Guard?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
004	Did you come here from the castle?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0022
005	Ugh...M-Monzein...?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0024
006	Dilga!!! You...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
007	Don't speak to him! He's in a dangerous state!
008	!!!
009	I-I'm okay... Th-they...took me out...O-Orion...and his immortal...soldiers...	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0042
010	Ca...Captain Jared...has already passed away. M-most of the Blue Flame Guard...was destroyed...
011	And the king?! Is the Sacred Stone safe?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
012	I-I'm not sure... When I came around...I found myself lying here.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0018
013	I-I feel so...ashamed! I-if something were to happen...to the king...I...I...!!!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0022
014	...Dilga.
015	Captain Monzein!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
016	Shut up. Shut up for now. First give me an update on the internal situation.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
017	N-no, it's not that! Please look at the grand staircase! It's the Greed Dike army!	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
018	Wh-what the...? Look how many of them there are!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
019	We don't even compare to their numbers! They have five...no around ten times as many men as we do!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
020	Look! At the head of the army...! It's Waginau and...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
021	The Lion Monarch...Orion!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
022	So this is where they were! There's no doubt that they're here to take Leviathan from the king!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
023	But...how do they plan to do it? It's hard to imagine that they'll just walk away.
024	People of Envylia, listen well! I now have a message to deliver from the King of Envylia!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
025	A message...?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
026	O-oh...! Your Majesty!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0026
027	What a relief! He's safe!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0009
028	People, there's no need to make such noise. The battle is now over.
029	The battle is over? What is he talking about?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
030	After having engaged in a long dialogue, I have reached a conclusion. We, the Kingdom of Envylia, will now become a vassal of Greed Dike!
031	What...?!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0025
032	Envylia is voluntarily swearing allegiance to Greed Dike?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0022
033	I'm sure some of you may be confused. However...all of this is for the future of Envylia!
034	As the era of warfare approaches...if we bond ourselves with Greed Dike, we have nothing to be afraid of!
035	Their mighty army will promise us peace beyond that which we now possess!
036	B-but...does that mean we will now fall under Greed Dike rule?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
037	But think about it! The Greed Dike army, which is said to be the strongest of this world...they're gonna protect us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
038	Maybe now those thieves of Wratharis, who've been the root of our troubles, will lay off a little.
039	Huh...?! Don't you realize that your country is being taken away from you?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
040	Ack! I don't want to hear that from you lot who are just visiting!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
041	Even when it comes to the Guard, it's not like they're always here to save us. We're the ones that are always being placed in harm's way!
042	Depending on how you look at it, we may be even safer than we are now, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0006
043	What kind of nonsense are you spewing! Dilga!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
044	I-I find it hard to believe...that His Majesty would make such a decision like that.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0027
045	But...if it's the words of the king...then it is the will of Envylia.
046	Are you serious?! Even you're gonna go along with all this nonsense?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
047	But...	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0028
048	What are you hesitating about?! There's no way something like this can be tolerated!
049	W-wait! What are you gonna do?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
050	What do you think I'm gonna do! I'm gonna go rescue the king from Orion's grasp!
051	Do you think I'm gonna remain silent when the country is being lost like this?!
052	B-but...who is asking for that?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
053	What...?
054	I mean...the king aside, even the villagers don't seem to be opposing the proclamation!	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
055	If the Kingdom of Envylia itself is seeking to align themselves with Greed Dike...
056	Do we, the Holy Guard, have any right to prevent it from happening?!
057	Well...
058	Everyone, don't be deceived! Those aren't the words of your king!
059	What the...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
060	Over there! That boy...!
061	Who are you? Stand down, boy...you are in the presence of the king!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
062	I'm not a boy! I'm Bud...Bud Crowley! I am a proud Knight of the Blue Flame!
063	B-Bud...?! That idiot!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0027
064	Who is he?
065	H-he's a young knight that belongs to the Blue Flame Guard!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0019
066	He is currently assigned to protecting the king...ugh...a-at this rate...!
067	Enough! There's nothing you can do about your wounds. Rest over there for now.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
068	Please, wait! Captain Monzein...I can't let you go as well!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
069	You... Are you telling me that you want me to stand back and watch them kill the boy?!
070	If you were to make a move now, how would you get around their massive military force?!	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
071	If the 2nd Regiment is completely destroyed...when reinforcements arrive, we would clearly be at a disadvantage!
072	If we miss our chance to counterattack, we would pretty much be guaranteeing Greed Dike's victory!
073	But...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
074	Until Captain Yauras and the others arrive, we shouldn't move!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
075	If the Holy Guard cannot save Envylia, then who can?!
076	All of this is for the sake of Envylia's future! Please...endure it for now!
077	Uck...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
078	B-Bud...! Don't be an idiot! You'll be killed!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0043
079	Captain Dilga! No...I won't stand down!
080	I am a Knight of the Blue Flame! It is my honor and duty to save the king!
081	To...to save the king? What do you mean?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0025
082	I can tell... There is no way that His Majesty, who loves his people deeply, would ever make such a proclamation!
083	I'm sure they are using their magic and forcing him to speak!
084	Forcing him?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
085	Hmph. What nonsense. Please, Your Majesty...do not let him bother you. Continue.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
086	Very well. My people...!
087	Emperor Orion who stands before you now...has promised to do everything in his power to protect Envylia!
088	His extraordinary commitment has struck a chord in my heart!
089	This decision...I am certain...will lead to a bright future for all of us.
090	I...will not only accept Emperor Orion's offer...but would also like to present him with a gift as a sign of gratitude!
091	...What is he going to do?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
092	The Sacred Stone Leviathan...which has long been passed down among the royal lineage of Envylia...
093	As a sign of my gratitude, I would like to present it to Emperor Orion...
094	What...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
095	N-no...! Your Majesty...that is going too far!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0027
096	Leviathan is a Sacred Stone that harbors deep jealousy.
097	If it were to fall into the hands of someone other than its rightful owner, it would bring about disaster.
098	Thus, we will now hold a ceremony to transfer its ownership to Emperor Orion!
099	People of Envylia, pay attention and welcome this historical moment!
100	This is all for the sake of Envylia's future!
101	My people, rejoice! This moment will bring about true enlightenment for Envylia!
102	Ack! It's all a lie! Everyone...don't be fooled!
103	Hmph. Do you intend on disturbing this sacred ritual? It looks like we have a rebel on our hands. Take care of him.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
104	Uck...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
105	...! No! Captain Monzein!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0015
106	Argh! Are the reinforcements still not here?!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
107	B-Bud! Stop! Sh-sheathe your sword!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0042
108	Sheathe my sword? You've got to be kidding me. If now is not the time to risk our lives...then when?
109	What...?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0025
110	I am a knight! The path that I open before me with my sword is the one I am destined to take!
111	If were to spend a lifetime bending my will to the tune of others...then I would prefer to sacrifice my life for something I believe in!
112	...!
113	...Do it.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
114	Bu...Bud!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0027
115	Ack...?! If you're gonna attack then attack!!!
116	Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
117	?!
118	That's...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
119	Ack! I thought it would end up like this...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
120	"If now is not the time to risk our lives...then when?" You say?
121	Huh...?
122	You have a naive code of chivalry...but it's not bad. Here they come.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
123	...!
