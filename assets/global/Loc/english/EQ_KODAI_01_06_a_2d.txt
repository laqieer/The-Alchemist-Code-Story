001	Here we are! This is Claybelle's mansion.
002	Wow! It's so big!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0024
003	Well, it does house a whole research facility. If you try to learn and perfect all forms of magic, old and new, from every corner of the world, you're inevitably going to need some storage space.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0007
004	Why do you have to butt in? Can't you let me explain all this? I'd do it in fewer words, you know.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0016
005	Oh, please. That's just how Teach would say it, and you know she's gonna parrot all of that before you have a chance to get a word in edgewise.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0004
006	She's always on about how her research is going nowhere, and how she needs more materials and space.
007	So, Lil, I don't know how much of that you understood, but Claybelle is a big magic and human enthusiast.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0031
008	I just wish she would be more considerate to those of us who have to clean up after her!
009	Hu...man? E-enthu...?
010	Humans. Like us. Beings rescued from another world.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
011	I've been told we're more numerous and diverse in the other Stratums, but that's neither here nor there. Well... I guess it's there, but it's certainly not here.
012	That's right. We're witches. And as a witch, it's my duty to protect this land and live out my life here; nowhere else. And I'm proud to do so!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0006
013	Home is where you make it, to put it simply. Besides, it takes the power of dragons to move from one Stratum to another.
014	Feeble little humans like us aren't exactly able to ask the dragons for help whenever we'd like. Those who travel to and fro are pretty special beings.
015	Travel...is special?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0031
016	Schmeier wanted me...to be special?
017	There you two are!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
018	Here we are, indeed. We're back, Claybelle!
019	Hey there, Teach. Hope you made some good progress on your research today! Can't wait to hear all about it.
020	Please, Quence! Are you trying to kill me?! I need my rest for the mountain of work still ahead!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0012
021	Making excuses, huh? Like a kid who forgot her homework. I take it today hasn't been all too productive yet?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
022	Hahaha! Read the room, Quence, you numbskull! She doesn't want to talk shop right now.
023	Who are you calling a numbskull, you numbskull?!
024	So, you're Claybelle?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0002
025	Quence. Ambrosia. Who is this child?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
026	That is the question, isn't it?
027	She's lost. I caught sight of her just outside town.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0004
028	Interesting. What's your name, girl?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
029	Oh, um...
030	Hmm? You were so happy to give your name earlier.
031	Uhm... I was told that I should be very proper when introducing myself to another dragon...that I need to make sure they know I've come in peace.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0003
032	It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, dragon of a bygone age. My name is Lil.
033	I am the child of Schmeier, the recorder of the passage of time, and Zafeiris, the Guardian Dragon.
034	Oh! And I'm also a friend of Sia's, here!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
035	Th-that's not something you need to tell everybody when you introduce yourself, okay?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0026
036	Hmm...
037	Claybelle?
038	Oh, uh, it's nothing. Haha...	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
039	Hahahaha! It's just... The sheer absurdity of it all! It's like someone's playing a practical joke on me.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0023
040	That trickster, Zafeiris! He should have told me he'd developed a sense of humor!
041	Schmeier and Zafeiris' child? Hahaha! I would have never!
042	Educating Ouroboros, and a human family structure... And they choose to go about it all by playing house?! Bwahahahaha!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0044
043	But sure, this would absolutely make for something better than the dragons that exist today!	VO_clabul.clabul_voice_0017
044	Wh-what are you talking about? I'm very confused.
045	How about we continue this inside, Claybelle? It's kinda chilly out here!
046	Ah, right! Of course! You are a most welcome guest in my home until they come for you.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0037
047	She seems fun.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
048	She...does. Which has me feeling a bit uneasy, since she's usually a lot gloomier. Did you say something funny?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0031
049	I can hear you, Ambrosia. Now get your butts in here, pronto!
050	Y-yes, ma'am! Let's go, Lil.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_battle_0022
051	Okey-doke!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
052	Are you sure? You've always told us that you don't have the time or energy to deal with trouble like this.
053	You say that now? After you've brought her all the way here?! Hmph! But really, this may be just the catalyst I need. I'll gladly stand against Ophioneus, given the circumstances.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0007
054	We have yet to discover a means of combating the corruption, though.
055	There'll be time for that later...somehow. Besides, how could I not get involved? I had no idea the Ouroboros project was this...dramatic!
056	Doesn't take much to redirect your focus, does it? You sure you're not part cat?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
057	Another quip like that and you'll be able to decide for yourself, after you get a first-hand look at my claws! Now help me swat some of the flies in here before we begin, will you, Quence?
058	Haaaa... Yeah, all right. Let's hunt some vermin.
059	Why don't you come on out, vermin? You nameless dragons...or should I say, dragons who've abandoned their names?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0001
060	Impressive work sensing us, Claybelle, purest saint of the seven great dragons.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0030
061	Don't ever call me that! It's been far too long, and I can't help but cringe when I hear it now!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0029
062	Huh. Didn't know you had such an edgy...title?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0044
063	And you'd do well to forget it, unless you want to wind up a pile of ash on my floor for Ambrosia to sweep up.
064	How scary! What say you focus that ash-making rage on our interlopers instead, hmm? I'll be more than happy to score a few points on these jokers myself.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0027
065	You dare oppose us?!	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0025
066	Of course we do! You think anyone here is just going to sit idly by and let you mess everything up?!	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0001
067	Ack! S-so this is the power of a great dragon...	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_battle_0021
068	Coming into my domain, and causing harm to my people? I'll see you repent for this from the farthest corners of hell itself!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0028_a
