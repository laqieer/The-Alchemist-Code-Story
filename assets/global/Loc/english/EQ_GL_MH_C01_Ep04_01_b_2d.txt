001	There it is. Still as homely as I remembered it.
002	A humble house at the fringes of the city sits contentedly atop a gentle hill. The cobblestone road is quaint and lovingly worn.
003	Teacher replies to my correspondence sporadically, so I assumed she was doing fine... but I do still feel bad for not coming to visit sooner.
004	At least you remembered to write... Teach is going to give me an earful.
005	It's so pretty here... and calm.
006	Meep!
007	Haha. You like it here too, huh?
008	Oh, how cute! This is your little friend?
009	His name is Chip. He was the one who found the children in the sewers of Slothstein.
010	Don't you two make an adorable pair?
011	Huh. That sounds familiar. Didn't Teacher use to tease us—
012	Nothing of the sort! Teach just likes to ramble, you know how it is!
013	L-let's not keep her waiting.
014	...huh?
015	Did I say something wrong?
