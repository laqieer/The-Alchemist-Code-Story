001	(Shoot, if we fight too hard here, the flower bed will get churned up.)	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
002	(Mielikki must think the same, she can't use any of her stronger spells. Not that our opponents seem to care...)
003	HYAHH!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0004
004	Flamel!
005	You two were taking your time to return, so I thought to come check your progress.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
006	It seems horticulture has become the least of your worries. Who is this lot?
007	I don't know, they showed up out of nowhere!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0003
008	Damn, reinforcements? Now that he's seen us, we have no choice. Silence him.
009	Urgh, their numbers are certainly no laughing matter...	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
010	Ah! Flamel, look out!
011	Augh...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0022
012	Celliers?!
013	F-Flamel, are you all right...?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
014	I'm fine, but you! That wound!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
015	Forgive me... My mission was to protect you two, and I have failed you. Leave the rest to me.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0036
016	You curs are not from these lands. Denizens of Gluttony, I wager?
017	...Do not think you can operate unchecked within Lustburg's borders. I, mage of the court, shall be your opponent.
018	A Court Mage? Out here in the sticks? Damn it all... Retreat, men!
019	Ah, hey! Stop stomping on my flowers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0012
020	Shut it, pipsqueak!
021	Mielikki! Your flower bed...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0020
022	...Celliers?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0006
023	The blooms she raised with care... All because those people came after me...!
024	This is... This is all my fault. All my fault!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
025	Ah, AHH, AHHHHHH!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0019
026	Wh-what the heck?! The flower bed's changing into crystal...
027	AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0028
028	...Huh, so that's the trick!
029	Celliers! Calm down, Celliers!
030	Wha? M-Mielikki... I...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
031	(Oh no, Mielikki's flowers... I have to stop this, I—!)
032	Celliers...!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
033	(Mielikki looks so sad, and it's all my fault... All because I'm a monster, with monstruous powers.)
034	I'm sorry... Mielikki...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
