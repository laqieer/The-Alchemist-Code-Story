001	No matter how many times you fight me, the results will always be the same. You can't beat me!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
002	Huff...huff...! I don't need to beat you! I...just want to change you!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
003	Why go to such lengths?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
004	Why...? What do you think?! You're family!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
005	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
006	Our family is connected by an unbreakable bond! That's why I want to stop this meaningless conflict!
007	I want to stop my brother from walking down the wrong path!
008	You're so pure...a real straight arrow.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
009	Seeing your purity hurts me.
010	Dias...
011	But, I want you to stay that way...always.
012	Dias, where are you trying to go?
013	I'm not sure...but I know that it's not a good place!
014	Don't go, Dias! Come back!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
015	Agh...! Logi, have you gone back to the Door of Truth?	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
016	Huh?
017	If the Door of Truth appears before you again...do not accept another contract!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
018	Wh-what are you saying, Dias?! Wait...did you go back to the Door of Truth?!
019	I've passed the point of no return! I've taken a different path from the rest of you!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
020	Listen... You mustn't come down my path!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
021	I'll shoulder all the burden; I'll change the world! You...just stay on your path!
022	Wait, Dias!
023	I'll go with you! Don't try to go alone!
024	Logi...goodbye...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
025	Dias!!!
026	Agh?!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0022
027	Di-Di...as...	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
