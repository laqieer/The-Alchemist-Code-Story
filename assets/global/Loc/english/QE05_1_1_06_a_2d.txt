001	I see, memory loss. That must be difficult for you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
002	Erm, yes.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
003	Alright! I will help you reclaim your memory!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
004	I've lived in this city since I was born, so I have plenty of connections.
005	R-really?! Thank you Ms. Teona!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
006	Leave it to me! Then—and just to be clear, my help isn't contingent on this or anything—but I expect another match with you, Kam—	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
007	No.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0040
008	You won that fight, Teona. Is it not unseemly for you to continue challenging me?
009	I have my pride as a gladiator.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
010	You let me win that match, didn't you?
011	If so, I did not intend it.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
012	No, I am sure of it. Call it intuition, but you had some means of defeating me.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
013	It seemed to me that you held yourself back for some particular reason.
014	You make too much of me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0016
015	I have fought many capable warriors in my time.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
016	Though they all had their own particular strengths, they had one thing in common.
017	Their aura.
018	Their...aura?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
019	Well, it's like...a sense of them interrupting or anticipating my moves, or—	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
020	Whatever! There's just something about them!
021	Did Kamui have that too?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0044
022	Hisham.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
023	Uh...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
024	Yes. Right before that last clash, I sensed something about to change the course of our match.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
025	I still haven't overcome that sensation, and I refuse to call myself the true Champion until I do.
026	I see. So it's a matter of pride.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0044
027	I'm glad you understand!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
028	Yes, and I refuse.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
029	W-wait, what?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
030	I have other things to attend to while I am here. I appreciate your assistance with Hisham's situation, but...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
031	I am not his guardian. We are little more than passengers heading in the same direction.
032	I can help along the way, but I cannot see him through to the end.
033	Even though you seem so invested in his well-being?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
034	It is difficult not to care for one who is going through what I, myself, have experienced.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
035	Wha—?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
036	I, too, have lost my home.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
037	Does that mean...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
038	It was a natural disaster in my case. The sand swallowed everything.
039	I had distant relatives that took me in and I live in their village now, but I can understand what Hisham is going through.
040	I see. I am sorry to hear that.
041	Kamui, you're...the same as me?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0022
042	So, um, Master Kamui?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
043	Yes?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
044	A letter was sent here for you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
045	Ah, thank you.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
046	I have business to tend to. Teona, if it is not too much to ask, I would appreciate if you could watch Hisham for a while.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
047	Huh? Uh, sure.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
048	Forgive me. I will return before nightfall.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
049	He's gone...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
050	Yeah...
051	Oh, and don't worry. I promise I will help look into your past, okay?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
052	We can look for your parents together!
053	No, it's fine. I doubt they'll be in this city.
054	Hisham?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
055	I just know somehow. This place just doesn't sound right.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
056	Sound...right?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
057	I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
058	Ceclidis is currently busy organizing troops to subdue the southern forces.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
059	It should now be possible to see the King in secret.
060	All right then. Lead me there.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
061	Kamui. It is good to see you.
062	I am honored to be granted an audience with you, King Narol.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
063	There is no need for such formalities.
064	There is nobody else here but us, two men troubled by the same problem.
065	You are too kind.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
066	I, Kamui of the Sephira, have come to answer your request to purify Beelzebub.
067	As I suspected, the seals holding Beelzebub and its preemptive curse are weakening.
068	Exactly. After being sealed, it seemed little more than a mere stone, but recently it has begun faintly emitting light from time to time.
069	If the seal is broken... I do not wish to even try to imagine the horrors it may bring.
070	The Sacred Stone is this country's symbol. In addition, Beelzebub is deeply tied to the Alchemia of this land.
071	If this civil war lingers on and the anguish of the people continues to grow, even Sephiron may not be able to maintain her seal.
072	All of this has come of my failure to be worthy of my position. Not only that, but I have brought hardship to my people.
073	For now, let us purify Beelzebub. The stone, please.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
074	Mmm...
075	"I beseech the supreme..."	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_0001
076	It seems the purifying energy alone is not enough to purify the stone.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
077	What is this?!
078	Stay back, Your Highness! That is the manifestation of Beelzebub's power!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
079	In other words, the avatar of the preemptive curse!
