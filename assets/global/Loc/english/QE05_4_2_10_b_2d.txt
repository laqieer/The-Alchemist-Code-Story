002	General Georgios, we have finished our preparations.
003	Then the time to march is upon us!
004	Listen up! Our goal for today is to divert and delay the enemy! Some might say that it is inglorious work—well, I call it an honorable task! We must not let the enemy know our true purpose!
005	Our duty today is to show the forces of Gluttony how desperately outmatched they are by making them chase their own tails!
006	Are you up for the challenge?!
007	Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!
008	The rest is up to you, Protector. I expect you to get us through this.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
