001	Something's not right. Vivi's taking too long.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0020
002	Was that a gunshot from inside the building?!
003	Wait! Where do you think you're going?! You were told to stand by! Don't go taking action on your own!
004	Shut up! I'm not gonna stand around and do nothing!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0017
005	Vivi can handle herself! Our job is to secure an escape route for her!
006	You're not wrong. That's why you should stay here and do just that.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
007	I'm just a feeble, gunslinging mercenary-for-hire. You don't really need my help here.
008	Hey. Hey! That idiot, he really went in!
009	Found her! There she is! Don't let her go near the armory!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
010	They somehow knew we were coming...
011	Huzzaaaaaah!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0032
012	Urgh! Who...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
013	Hugo?! What are you doing?! Who said you can leave your post?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0025
014	Well you shouldn't have taken so long!
015	Hey, don't go blaming this on me!
016	You think I'm just gonna stay put while we get further and further off schedule because one member of the team got into a gunfight all alone? Of course I'm gonna take some kind of initiative!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0016
017	Don't you sling logic at me! You don't have the face of someone who can think logically! You scary, squint-eyed jerk!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0029
018	What kind of a face is that supposed to be?! What's with your fangs, anyway?! You trying to look like a wolf or something?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0012
019	They're not just some pair of dog fangs! My prominent, vampiric canines are one of my many charm points! Regardless, don't go selfishly acting on impulses and screwing up my plans!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0015
020	I mean, I know you're a compassionate person and all, but...	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
021	Wh-what's with you all of a sudden?
022	Oh, please. I know you feign aggression to hide your social anxiety. It's really vexing, actually.
023	I'm not as compassionate as you may think. It's no lie that I shot one of your comrades.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0029
024	I don't dislike you, you know.
025	What...?!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0027
026	You've got a bad mouth on you, and you're definitely rude...but you're thoughtful, compassionate, and above all, competent.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
027	Quit saying that! I'm not a compassionate person!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0017
028	If you weren't, you wouldn't have come to help me. Why can't you just take that as truth?
029	Are you scared to accept your true colors?
030	I...!
031	You're such a meddler. I just... I don't look the part, you know?	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0022
032	Dang it, look... We got too carried away with bickering and got ourselves surrounded.
033	There were way more armories here than expected. I did finish setting the bombs, though.
034	They caught me just as I was getting to a safe distance to detonate from.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0036
035	Where exactly did you set the bombs?
036	There's one over there. That should set off the others, but its just out of range for my guns.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0039
037	...
038	I know!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0026
039	I just had VIVI-dly cool idea.
040	Th-that's my thing! You can't say that!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
041	Can it. I was just quicker than you. Anyway, I can hit it from here.	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0017
042	Buy me some time. You can do that, can't you?
043	Ha! Who do you think you're talking to?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0032
044	Keep shooting! Keep them at a distance from the armory! Reinforcements are on their way!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
045	What's taking you so long?! You better not be taking a little tea break!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
046	Don't rush me! It takes time to pour a proper cup of tea! Shut up and wait!	VO_hugo.hugo_sys_0004
