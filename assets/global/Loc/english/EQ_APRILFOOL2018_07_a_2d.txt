001	W-we'll take on...the Greed soldiers.	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
002	Kid...you save...the king.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
003	Whoa, this is getting intense!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0027
004	Captain Monzein, you're the bomb!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
005	M-my burning soul! Now is the time...to show your radiance!!! I'm not just some decoration!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
006	Ughh...!!! Ugggh...!!! Agghhhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
007	His aura is certainly outstanding, but isn't it too late for this?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
008	This is awesome! You're amazing! I wanna try that, too!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
009	So if I just like, do this pose, put a little power into it, add a little of that shouting... Ugh...agghhhhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
010	...Huh? It didn't work?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
011	Numaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
012	Koooohh...	VO_Kurokishi.kurokishi_battle_0019
013	Mandra, mandra!	VO_Mmandragora.Mmandragora_battle_0019
014	Why are a Metal Ratty, a Black Knight, and a Sleep Mandragora calling out to me?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
015	I feel strange. It's like I'm floating in a dream...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
016	This is no dream, though I understand somewhat why you might think so.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
017	Huh?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0027
018	Wh-where am I?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
019	This is the Door of Truth, where souls are judged.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0008
020	—?!
021	What, has shock stolen your voice again? Should you not have grown used to this already?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
022	This is the third time I have called upon you.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0030
023	Wh-what is happening?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
024	Has the shock has erased all your pertinent memories of yourself and what you wished?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0025
025	No matter. I have seen all that you have done as one who wished for untold possibilities and a new role in this world!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
026	R-right. Cool... Cool, cool, cool...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0020
027	Your actions were very admirable, despite having lost sight of yourself and your desires. I have but one final question.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
028	Can you continue to live as a soldier, as you so wished? Or do you desire to return to your old life?
029	My...old life?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
030	Producer, I found it! The bug was here! The emergency DLC worked!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0046
031	Odd. A malfunction in the Door of Truth? Irregularities have happened before, but this latest case is of a particularly strange nature.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
032	Well, I suppose this is fitting for the Last Judgment.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
033	We found you, Ouroboros!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0027
034	It was just like you said, Designer. There aren't many others who could manage to do something like this.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0030
035	Y-you're the people who called me a bug!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
036	Let's see how strong your resolve is! May you guide them to your unwavering Truth!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0010
037	I'm not sure what you mean, but I'm not the type to run from a fight!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
