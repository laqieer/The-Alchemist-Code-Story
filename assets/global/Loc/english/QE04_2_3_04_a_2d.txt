001	Well then...the question is how will we deal with Tehre.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1005
002	Wait, Fuu. Before that, there's something I need to tell you	VO_voda.voda_sys_0014
003	What is it?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0006
004	You saved me back there. If it weren't for you, I would've likely lost my life.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0034
005	You have my gratitude. Thank you.
006	What's gotten into you all of a sudden? There's no need to thank me.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
007	So...will you join forces with me?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0002
008	There's no need to bother putting it into words.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0030
009	Words can be important at times like this. Besides, we have youngsters here with us as well. So, what do you say?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
010	Fuu...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
011	Fine. I will indeed join forces with you. Let's protect Saga together.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
012	Thank you, Fuu!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0034
013	I told you there's no need to thank me.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_1047
014	The situation still hasn't changed. Don't let your guard down.
015	Well, at least now we can be certain that Tehre and the Gluttony army's goal...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
016	...is to get their hands on the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.
017	Indeed. That blasted Tehre, what is he thinking?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
018	Well, when it comes to that brat, he could very well be under the deception of Gluttony.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
019	I agree. For better or worse, he's an honest kid. There's a possibility that they're exploiting him. That being said, he's a tough one to talk sense into.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
020	Really?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
021	Perhaps it has something to do with him being the youngest of the Sprite Trio. He's got quite the imagination and tends to run headlong into things... Now that I think about it, he's always been that way.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
022	Hm. From my perspective, you're still practically a child as well.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
023	Um...Voda, are you...that much older than Fuu?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
024	I am. I am the oldest out of the Sprite Trio.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
025	Whoa! I can't tell at all. Actually, there was something I wanted to ask you.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
026	What is it?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0006
027	From listening to your stories...it's been quite a long time since the Wind Sprite Alia died, hasn't it?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
028	It's been about...let's say, 100 years.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
029	And even back then both of you and, um, Tehre were Sprites, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
030	I was thinking that all of you...well, you've lived for a super long time. Does everyone in Saga live as long as you do?
031	...Bwahahahah!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0012
032	How funny. Right, of course, a foreigner wouldn't know about it.
033	In order to serve as a Sprite, you must be appointed before drinking the blood of the Beast Leoferes.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
034	It is not very common for one with enough power to be selected as a Sprite to appear. When they do, by drinking the Leoferes' blood, they are promised longevity.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
035	Ah. I see.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0044
036	During the Lion Monarch's Charge, Tehre had just been appointed Earth Sprite.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
037	Now that I think about it, it was Tehre who had the hardest time accepting Alia's death.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
038	After all, there was a time when he was greatly fond of Alia.
039	His grudge against me was equally as great. Perhaps there was a weakness in his heart that the Gluttony army was able to exploit.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
040	Then...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
041	Indeed. It'll be quite a task to pull Tehre away from the Gluttony army and bring him back to our side.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
