001	This is the end of the Holy Guard!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
002	I will take your lives as penance for stopping me, the Lion Monarch, from fulfilling my destiny! Divine Thunder Apocalypse!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0032
003	Justice is on our side! Let's go, Kanon!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
004	Yes! We will protect the future of the world! Shining Holy Judgment!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
005	Go, Kudan! Take advantage of the strength you've gained by sacrificing all you once held dear!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
006	Of course! Orion, I will show you that the one who will lead the charge into the future is me! Therefore, I have a responsibility to stop you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
007	Dead the End!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
008	Emmel... Please help me give these heroes whatever support they need! Rising Sun!!!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
009	Th-they're matching my strength?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0019
010	E-even with the three of us, we can't gain an advantage over him?! Even though he didn't manage to resurrect Nimul?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
011	He's stronger than I could have imagined! If we can't somehow break through...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0022
012	Now you see. With or without Nimul, not one of you will survive this battle!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
013	This is impossible! How can he still have strength to spare?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
014	I will admit that I am a little impressed that peons such as yourselves managed to get this far. However, this is as far as you will ever get!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
015	Th-this is bad!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0018
016	I-I still...have one last trick up my sleeve. What follows is up to you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
017	Don't tell me...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
018	Grraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
019	What?! You—!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0019
020	Kudan, stop! The darkness will consume you!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0011
021	It doesn't matter! If we don't stop him here, then... Gnrk... Grahhhhhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
022	Urgh! I didn't expect you...to have this kind of strength remaining.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0042
023	So close! If only we had just had a little more strength!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
024	W-we do...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
025	What?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
026	We have that strength. S-since we've already come this far, it's time for me to use my final trump card.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
027	Kanon?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0022
028	A-armies from the other countries are already making their way here.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
029	If we can just bring Orion down, then Greed Dike's chain of command will collapse and we should be able to take them out.
030	We need to focus on what we can do now. We must put everything on the line to defeat Orion!
031	You're sure?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
032	Yes. I will do anything to save this world.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
033	You have come far from the clumsy new Paladin who joined our ranks. Now, you are a splendid Lord Commander.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
034	Wh-who do you think you are, to look down on me?! The Lion Monarch will not be made a fool after coming this far!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0013
035	He's certainly not going to make this easy for us.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
036	Don't be so difficult, Nimul! I have done all of this for you!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
037	Burning Seal!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
038	What the—?!
039	I'm not like you. I am no chosen one.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
040	Her strength is different from before?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0027
041	Unlike you, I was never given a distinction like being a Vessel of Reincarnation or anything like that. I'm not that special. My role in this world is not one of revolution or destiny.
042	However...I cannot just give up. There is no excuse for me to lay down my sword when my duty is to stand up for the people of this world!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
043	Wh-what are you doing?! Nimul, why?! Why have you abandoned me?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0017
044	I understand that there are those who have suffered because of the hand fate has dealt them.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
045	It makes sense to me that you want to end that cycle of pain.
046	However, the answer is not to believe that all humankind is worthless, as you do!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
047	You...!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0023
048	We cannot build the future based on the unhappiness of the past!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
049	The future will not be decided by you, nor by alchemists from the past, no matter how powerful! Even if they are weak, even if they are few...
050	The future of this world must be built upon the hopes of those who live in this time!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
051	Ngh... Arrrrrgghhhh! Huzzaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0020
052	I will not let you! Huzzaaahhhh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
053	Nnghhhhh... Gwa...gwaaaaaah!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
054	Ngh... Nnnnnnrrrrgghhh!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0042
055	This attack...is the world's answer to you, who looks down on mankind's will!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
056	Ngh... Hrrgh!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0023
057	Brave Innocence!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
058	Argh!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0026
059	Ngh... Grrrrrrarggghhh!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0024
060	This c-can't...be...! The Lion Monarch won't be beaten by the likes of you!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0022
061	It is mere humans like us who must open up the path to the future!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
062	Ngh... Hrgh! Wh-why?! Nimul! Why don't you...help...m—Aaaaaaaaaaaarrgggghhhhhhh!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0019
063	You...f-fools. I-I was chosen...by fate. The...Lion Monarch...will not meet his end...like this!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0027
064	Haaa... Haaa... Ngh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
065	Kanon, you did well. That was an excellent attack.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
066	It probably wasn't just me...or just us.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
067	What?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
068	At the end, Excalibur let off some dazzling light.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
069	It was like...Emmel's soul had nowhere to go, so it rested inside Excalibur for a moment.
070	I...see.
071	Then, i-in the end, it was Emmel...who brought my ideals...to naught.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0019
072	No. It was the will of all mankind that called upon Emmel's soul.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
073	Your ambitions were thwarted by the will of all the people in the world.
074	Ngh... If only you...had been born in another time.	VO_orione.orione_battle_0019
075	Time is irrelevant. So long as mankind's justice lives on, your ambitions will not be allowed to succeed.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
076	You've...both grown...to be such fine knights. I'm so...glad.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
077	Zain, your body is...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
078	Nimul's resurrection has been thwarted. Emmel's power is fading from existence.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
079	The rest...is up to you... Th-those of you who still live in this world.
080	Huh?
081	O-our mission was purely...to stop Nimul's resurrection. That power which defies human understanding.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
082	From here on out...it is up to those of you who will live in the future...to define what justice truly is.
083	Z-Zain... I understand now.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
084	Captain Kudan?!
085	Your generation...desires a peaceful...future for mankind...m-more strongly than anyone I've known. I can now...truly...rest in peace.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
086	Lord Zain!
087	I am proud...to have lived in the same age as you two. I leave...the f-future of mankind...in your capable hands.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0010
088	Lord Zain!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
089	You understood me...more than I realized. Forgive me for being so short-sighted. I'm in your debt, Zain.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
090	Captain Kudan...
091	And now... This is the last stand.
092	Ready, Kanon? Let's settle this once and for all!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
093	Ah!
