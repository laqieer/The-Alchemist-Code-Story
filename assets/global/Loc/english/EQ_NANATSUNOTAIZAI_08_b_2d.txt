001	It's still early in the morning. Escanor's Sunshine is not yet at full strength. Not only that...
002	An army of Albions enhanced with this world's power... It can't be helped...
003	What are you analyzing so calmly for?! How about giving us a hand here?!
004	Merlin...!
005	There is nothing to worry about. She has a plan, I'm sure.

007	I trust her the same way you trust Meliodas.
008	Escanor...
009	So what if you trust each other! It makes no difference now!
010	Meliodas is not here, and you all will die. That is all.

012	Tch! This is getting old.
013	?!
014	I will force reality upon you and show you the futility of your faith and trust!
015	Weep before the cruelty of reality!
