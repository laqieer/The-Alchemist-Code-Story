002	…
003	Tamba…Kaede…?
004	Koga…
005	…What are you doing? Put Kaede down!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
006	This doesn't concern you.
007	The hell it doesn't!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0013
008	I can do with her as I please.
009	Why…Why are you doing this to your sister?
010	…
011	…Put her down!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
012	Hmph…It's taking some getting used to.
013	It doesn't matter--your fate is sealed.
014	I should, at least, give you my thanks. You did a fine job.
015	…That swordsmanship…those mannerisms… You're not Tamba, are you?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
016	…
017	Allow me to offer these parting words before you die: I am the one who controls the king's vessel. You may call me--
018	The Demon King.
019	Demon King...?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
020	Tamba was much too kind to become king. Although he was a vessel, he did not possess the attributes of a king.
021	…What do you mean?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
022	Betrayed by the one he trusted... You see, despair is the key to unlocking a demon's true potential.
023	…!
024	A mixedblood that has abandoned human emotions and is prepared to be a demon--That is what one needs to be king.
025	Now I see why your swordsmanship is different. You've taken over Tamba's body in some twisted scheme.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0021
026	Oh?
027	…You've got some nerve--toying with Tamba like some plaything…!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
028	Isn't that right? Discarnate Power!
029	Hmph…So you saw through my little ruse?
030	What happened... What did you do to Tamba!?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0022
031	It is as you said--I took over his body. Where his consciousness went is anybody's guess.
032	We have no need for a feckless ruler. It is I who shall reign over all of Wadatsumi…using this body as my vessel…
033	You're despicable--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
034	You are the one who drove Tamba into despair--ushering in the birth of the king... For that, I thank you.
035	With everything going off without a hitch, I couldn't afford to miss my golden opportunity.
036	...
037	…………
038	!!!!!!
039	………… !!!
040	The moment of awakening... That was my only chance. For a brief moment, Tamba lost consciousness, and the "vessel" was empty… That's when I snuck in.
041	...It was nothing more than a gamble…but it payed off.
042	You'll pay for this!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0022
043	It was you who sowed the seeds of his despair. Have you already forgotten your role as a Demon Hunter?
044	...! How could you know that?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
045	That's not your concern.
046	…!	VO_kouga.kouga_battle_0022
047	I can see you hesitating... Hmm. So, you put chakra in the food… How quaint.
048	What would you know?
049	I'll get Tamba back. And I'll put a stop to your scheme! Mark my words!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
050	Demons and humans were finally starting to come together. I'm not going to let you hold us back!
051	The peace we made was a lie. Everything was orchestrated for this moment. We used you.
052	I don't give a damn!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
053	I not going to allow you to diminish our accomplishments... I swore to both Tamba and Kaede.
054	This peace is not a lie! I will defeat you and get Tamba back!
055	Tamba…? Koga...?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
056	…Kaede...!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
057	…Imagine that. You're still alive…
058	…!
059	…! Ko…ga…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0026
060	……………
061	…Foolish humans. You baffle me.
062	…Shut...up…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0022
063	…What…is this…?
064	…What's going on! Ahhhh!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0028
065	…Kae...dae...
066	…! Koga...!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
067	…Koga…why...!
068	…Heh... I promised Tamba...I'd take care of you…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
069	…I wish could've protected your brother, too…but I didn't have the strength. I'm sorry…Kaede.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0035
070	What are you saying--
071	...! Is that not…my brother…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0020
072	Correct.
073	…This presence...no way…the Discarnate Power...! Why…why are you doing this!?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0021
074	Everything is as I planned.
075	…I don't believe it!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0022
076	…Don't cry, Kaede.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
077	...I'm not crying.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
078	This is no time to rest your eyes. Everyone is waiting to try your food.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
079	...Heh... You're right... Kaede...where are you? ...Are you there...?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
080	I'm right here…! Stay strong, Koga... ! You can't leave me! I won't forgive you!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
081	Ah…it's no use… I don't have the strength to pick up a knife...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
082	…! Koga..! You can't be selfish...
083	Be the crazy fool that I know--with your lofty ideals--reach for the stars!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
084	Don't say it's no use! Don't give up, you crazy fool!
085	...You know me…I'm as crazy as they come. Ah... I wanted you to taste my food, one more time...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
086	No! This is when you're supposed to say…
087	"Eat first, then the we'll talk." Right!?
088	I haven't told you that magic word. So…don't leave me!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
089	...I'm sorry...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0035
090	Stop apologizing! You're making it sound like… Like--
091	…Don't get so worked up… I can't have you rampage before I…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
092	…! Dummy… You foolish, foolish man!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
093	…It's alright. Even if I die…it's not the end…
094	…Our lives…will always be connected…
095	…Koga…
096	…Thanks for everything, Kaede.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0034
097	Koga…Koga!!!
098	He's gone… Humans are such fragile creatures, aren't they? Now then…
099	…!!!
100	We can't allow a good meal to go to waste. That wouldn't do. What do humans say at a time like this?
101	…Ah, yes…"Let us give thanks for this meal!"
102	!!!---!!!!!!!!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0025
103	There's no use fighting it. You, too, will die soon.
104	…I won't forgive you… You killed him!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
105	…Why are you so upset? He's just a lump of flesh now. What could be more joyous than to be someone's nourishment?
106	Don't tell me you're going to let the death of your companion go to waste?
107	…Go to waste?
108	Precisely. Humans are always blathering about the circle of life, aren't they?
109	…What would you know about life?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
110	The beauty of life is that we are all connected through our time on this earth. Koga taught me that...
111	I pity you! You will never understand the magnitude of that lesson!
112	…?
113	….
114	…! Urf... Ugh…!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
115	…What are you--
116	…Blechhhh… Urffff!!!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
117	...I give thanks for this meal...!
118	…………Urp………………	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
119	…Urr…Ur…Uhrr…
120	You ate…a human...!?
121	…Urr…Urrrrrrrrr!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0019
122	…If it ever looks like I'm about to die, will you devour me?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
123	But...eating connects lives. If I die without achieving anything ...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
124	I want to be connected to you.
125	…Why…did you kill him... Why…did you take him away from me... I...	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
126	I just wanted to live a normal life!
127	Koga's life… His spirit... I will carry it with me!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
128	…Thank you for the meal…!	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0007
129	…Is this...!
130	Ah… Koga…you may have been a fool...but I was the biggest fool of all…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
131	Because...I just realized…
132	I took for granted your cooking.
133	I took for granted your face.
134	I took for granted our time together.
135	Now that it's all gone, I finally realized. I was...happy!!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
136	Now that it's too late…
137	I realized everything you cooked for me was…delicious!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
138	I'm sorry I never told you.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0035
139	But…I won't let it end like this!
140	You think you can defeat me? You, who have abandoned your race... You stand no chance against me in this form…
141	It doesn't matter…!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
142	Can't you see that it's futile?
143	…It's not futile. I will avenge Koga's death by defeating you…and return my brother.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0039
144	And…I will ensure peace! That is what I must do--for Koga's sake!
145	...I see. You've regained your demon strength by devouring him.
146	However, it is not enough.
147	It's time for you to die. I have no use for you now that you're no longer a demon. In my kingdom--
148	There is no place for your kind.
149	…Human or demon…it doesn't matter.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
150	Koga fought to create a society where nobody had to steal to survive. That was his vision.
151	One cannot live without taking.
152	…You stole my brother's body, you stole Koga from me… What more do you want!?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
153	This country.
154	…
155	I won't let you take anymore!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0030
156	…!
157	…Here it comes!
158	What--
159	I don't have to be me... if I can protect the future that Koga dreamed of.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
160	I don't care if I'm someone else…as long as my brother comes back.
161	What…is this power!?
162	My brother was in despair…because he risked believing... I want to make him believe again--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
163	That humans are worthy of his trust!
164	Ridiculous...!
165	And, yes…that it's okay to dream big.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
166	Koga taught me that...!
174	…!?
175	I told you--no more… I won't let you take any...more…	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0019
167	...? She fell asleep... No, this is…
168	…*Growl*
169	!?
170	*Roar*
171	... Gah! What…is this…
172	*ROAR*
173	…!
