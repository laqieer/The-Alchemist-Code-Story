001	So this is the power of the Rainbow Cacao... I've heard the stories but this is a lot more than I expected it to be. You could be in big trouble if you don't use it properly.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
002	Yeah, it sure is dangerous. It's like the literal definition of "the look in their eyes changing." It's pretty rough.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
003	Well, yeah, aside from Brown Cacao, all other colors of Rainbow Cacao have been banned in the general market.
004	Putting aside the Purple Cacao's charm effect for now, the other cacao also have different effects that can affect both human and monster alike.
005	Even this cacao we're bringing along is strictly regulated by the country since it's used as materials for magic.
006	I see... That certainly seems like the safest option.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
007	I don't really like when they put restrictions on everything though.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
008	But it's the best option for maintaining order. The proper measures for potential issues are the only way to keep complete anarchy at bay.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
009	...
010	But, you know, Rainbow Cacao is still being sold in secret.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0002
011	What?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
012	I also heard that the price for it jumps around Valentine's Day.
013	According to my sources, Rainbow Cacao is called Dark Cacao!
014	Dark Cacao!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
015	Wow, that sounds awful!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0029
016	But how are they doing it? All magic materials sold in Lustburg are strictly regulated.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
017	There are always people who will find loopholes and exploit them.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
018	Then they need to tighten the reins. Maybe something like assigning each Rainbow Cacao a serial number and each country keeping a registry of them.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
019	Actually, if each country were to regulate Valentine's Day and everything with it, it could deal a huge blow to any illegal cacao trade!
020	I think that's going a bit too far. It's more of a morality problem we're facing.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
021	But something that shouldn't be available to the general public is being sold on the black market. Doesn't that indicate that the regulations are too lax?
022	There's a limit to how much you can trust an individual's moral code. Sometimes you have to make difficult decisions to protect the peace, you know?
023	Leafah has a point. Her logic is sound.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
024	W-wait, y-you're agreeing with me?
025	However, I cannot agree to such draconian methods that would bring everyone down on Valentine's Day.
026	I...rather enjoy Valentine's Day.
027	W-wait, really?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
028	...
029	...Let's take a break. I'll scout the perimeter.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
030	...
031	Suzuka's angry, isn't she.
032	Seems like it.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
033	Yup.
034	Sh-she is, isn't she! She's upset!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
035	Arghhh! How did this happen?! I was trying so hard not to make things worse!
036	It was probably when you suggested micromanaging Valentine's Day. Suzuka really loves Valentine's.
037	I didn't realize... I had no idea that she loved it that much...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0044
038	B-but it's just a day where you just give chocolates to people, right? What's so special about that?
039	To Suzuka, Valentine's Day is more than just "a day where you give chocolates to people."	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
040	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
041	Well, last year was mine and Suzuka's first Valentine's.
042	And, well, we had a fight. Actually, it was more of a duel.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
043	A duel?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
044	We both had things that we wouldn't back down on, so we fought. We both went all out because we refused to understand each other...	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
045	She was such a pain in the butt!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0023
046	You don't seem that upset, though.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
047	Speaking of which, we had our own fight on Valentine's, didn't we?
048	Ah... We did.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
049	You two as well?!
050	What is the meaning of this... I thought it was supposed to be a day you give chocolate to someone you have romantic feelings for!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
051	Well, that's not wrong either. But at the same time, it's not just that.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
052	At least for Suzuka and I, we have the memory of our fight, our feelings and emotions laid bare.
053	And then of taking those feelings that are hard to put into words, melting them into chocolates, and enjoying them together. Sharing something beyond words.
054	At least that's what I think Valentine's is. Chocolates are just a pretext.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
055	A pretext? Nothing like that was ever written in any of the books I've read.	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
056	I see. So there are various ways to enjoy Valentine's Day. Kind of like different ways of thinking and values...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
057	Yet here I am, imposing my own morals and values on others... I do apologize.
058	No problem. Now, go make Suzuka understand that.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
059	Y-you're right! I have to go apologize... I'll be back!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
060	...
061	S-Suzuka! A-about earlier!
062	Knave!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
063	Wh-what?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
