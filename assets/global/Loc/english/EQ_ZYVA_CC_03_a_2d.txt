001	I can see colors.
002	You are a poet, then?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
003	Ahahah! And you are an idiot!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
004	Yes, yes. Concentrate, if you please. One, two, three...
005	Ahh! W-wait, wait!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
006	I was being serious, you know! I can see colors. Kind of like auras. Sometimes they're faint, sometimes they're really vivid.
007	Walk in a straight line. Your center of gravity should be tipped slightly forward, so that you glide smoothly across the floor. Now, one, two, three...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
008	Hey! Giudecca! Don't you believe me? It's true!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
009	Un, deux, trois...
010	You're still counting! Aaaahhh!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0026
011	We must do something about that ungainly stride of yours as soon as possible.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0006
012	Just let me walk how I want!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
013	You are lacking refinement.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
014	Shut it!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0013
015	What did I just tell you?
016	Shut up! I'm sick of you. You're a stupid idiot! A loopy loon! Beh!
017	You are far from dazzling yet.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
018	Ugh...
019	Iris... I wonder if this color perception of yours is a form of synesthesia.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
020	What the hell is that?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0006
021	You mustn't talk so roughly. Try something like this: "What exactly is that, sir?"	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
022	Wh-what's that, actually, um...sir?
023	Really? You couldn't manage to string a simple sentence together?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
024	Urghh! I'm so sick of this!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0029
025	Synesthesia is a unique sensory condition which causes one to perceive the Alchemia emitted by voices, personalities, figures, and so on as colors. It is incredibly rare.
026	Sometimes the colors change depending on the person's mood... I like it. It's kinda interesting, and pretty to look at.
027	What color am I?
028	Same as my old man.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0010
029	You mustn't like me very much, then. Also, do not make me repeat myself. You must mind your speech.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
030	Sir Giudecca, you are very the same hue as the pile of human excrement that was my father.
031	Can you identify lies and forgeries by color as well?
032	It's not some kinda all-powerful superpower. Parts of me get mixed in as well, complicating things...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0031
033	There're plenty of things I can't see. Things that are buried deep inside, complex emotions and intent—not all evil is blatant, y'know.
034	That's how I ended up like this.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
035	A real mess...
036	Reporting on Iris' training.
037	I don't recall asking you to do that.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
038	You are going to need more fighting power if you are to make it through the Mystic Tower Veda, yes?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
039	That doesn't mean I'm taking on just any old street rat.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
040	We've got a samurai on board now.
041	I heard that you were spurned by the king of Lost Blue.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
042	It's not the first time. Kings, like cats, are fickle beasts.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
043	I assure you that I am going to succeed here.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
044	I don't want to be subjected to every minor detail of your training routine.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
045	It will be a long and gradual process that will yield appropriately steadfast results.
046	Are those twin blades of yours merely ornamental?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
047	Yeah! They are!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
048	So, first and foremost they are for show. Two specialized weapons, whose surreal, slashing movements confound the eye.
049	Even hopelessly outnumbered, the angle of the range of your control will be expansive, and the breadth of your tactics will be wide.
050	Two is stronger than one! Everyone knows that!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0010
051	Huh?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
052	On the contrary, dual-wielded blades are only half as powerful as a two-handed weapon.
053	Wha—?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_battle_0019
054	The weight of your blades is too much for your fragile frame. They carry your movements, when it ought to be the other way around.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
055	You...!
056	Strike firm and true. Pierce one of the body's vital points with a single hit.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
057	C'mere...!
058	If one of your blades is stopped, you must immediately strike with the other.
059	Aaaaaargh!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0026
060	There is much you will need to learn if you are to survive in Lost Blue and carry out your assassination missions.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
061	Your skill with those blades is perhaps most important of all. They cannot afford to be crude, even if your demeanor can. You will need to master the use of each of your arms; that is surely our greatest problem to surmount.
062	All right, already! I get it!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
063	However, you ought to know that there is charm in discipline, in technique. Ceaseless, cutting slashes, a graceful sword dance; the elegant, rolling movements of the body as it deflects attacks, the flash left in your blades' wake...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
064	Yes, romance abounds.
065	Huh? What's romance got to do with anything?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0006
066	Once we are done, you will be dazzling.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
067	...
068	Assuming I have not misjudged you, that is.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
069	You know what? I'm starting to get excited about all this.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
070	She is scrubbing up nicely, and surprisingly quickly, too. I expect she was an excellent thief.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
071	You're not really a good example for her to follow, are you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
072	How rude.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
073	Used to dealing with sprightly types, are we?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
074	Very much so. I had to deal with many of the royal line when I was in the Imperial Elite Guard. Hence why I know a thing or two about etiquette and comportment...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
075	In addition to combat training.
076	Combat training?
077	The kind that works every muscle in the human body to a fine point.
078	I almost feel sorry for the poor girl.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
079	Heh. She's very good at stealing things, you know.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
080	This is the first thing I ever stole.
081	A bottle?
082	Just look at all the gems inside it!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
083	I didn't know you fancied such trifles.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
084	H-hey! What're you trying to say?! I never said anything like that!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0009
085	(Hm. I enjoy this...)
086	I was just a little girl, you know, living with a band of thieves. They found out I'd pinched this from our loot stash, but I begged my old man to let me keep it, and he did.
087	Hmm...do I detect amber?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0045
088	Aren't they pretty? They were my greatest treasure. They always gleamed like pure gold to me.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
089	Not anymore?
090	Well...they still do.
091	Dad! I want this! It's all gold and sparkly!
092	Just like your eyes!
093	I can't help but stare at them. It's sort of...part of my daily routine.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
094	Hmm...
095	Wh-what the heck?! Why're you so close?!
096	Because I chose to move closer.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
097	What're you lookin' at?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
098	It's very sad, isn't it?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
099	Would you be so kind as to go on an errand for me?
100	It's time for a history lesson.
101	Boo--!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
102	Regarding the decline of Wratharis.
103	Who gives a stuff about that?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
104	The coincidence of the nation's defeat at the Battle of Gilrack and the fall of the Shadow Messiah led to a loss in national power that continues even today.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
105	Internally, they delve into the forbidden arts...
106	While externally, they continue to lose control over the soldiers within their borders.
107	Sounds like they deserve it.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
108	The following order has arrived from Greed Dike: "Having repeatedly committed such injustices as to be unpardonable in the eyes of the Holy Order of Babel, the Wratharis Guard is to be quietly annihilated."
109	Pfft. Pathetic.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0010
110	Of course, it is very likely that one of Greed Dike's motivations for this is to get on Northern Pride's good side, but be that as it may...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
111	We have already obtained the troops' patrol routes and shifts. You ought to be able to assassinate your targets even without memorizing their faces.
112	I would also like to have you take care of this for me.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0041
113	A-alone?!
114	Not only did the Wratharis Guard collude with a band of thieves from the region, but we have learned that they also embezzled a Wratharian national treasure that was originally stolen by those thieves.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
115	What?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
116	Naturally, they have since wiped out those thieves in order to erase all evidence of their crimes.
117	They were a small band, these thieves, who called themselves the Golden Wolves.
118	You don't think you're giving her a bit much to deal with?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
119	I am merely watering a seed so that it may grow.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
120	I'm the one who gave you that assassination job in the first place.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
121	Wratharis is in the middle of fighting a war on its borders. If they capture her, she'll probably be executed on the spot.
122	You would prefer that I be the one to meet the headsman's axe?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
123	Yep.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
124	Not even a split second of hesitation! You really are too much.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
125	What about that lengthy process you were so proud of?
126	This is necessary for selection. Of her powers, her personage...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
127	I believe you're doing something similar, yes?
128	...
129	Besides...
130	...
131	(I'm gonna steal it back!)
132	I want her to lift the weight she carries off of her shoulders.
133	Assassination just...isn't my style.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0031
134	Come, now. Sparkle dazzlingly for me.
135	What the—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
136	Aaaaaaaaaargghhhhh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0028_c
137	Who are you?! Do you not know what it means to assault Wratharis soldiers?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0028
138	Don't you remember me?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0001
139	What are you talking about?!
140	Not ringing any bells? Okay... How about the Golden Wolves?
141	Tch. There are more bands of thieves out there than there are warts on a toad. Like I can remember 'em all!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
142	True...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
143	It's not like I remember any of your faces either.
144	Kill her! Slit her throat!
145	Give it to me. I want...your head.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
