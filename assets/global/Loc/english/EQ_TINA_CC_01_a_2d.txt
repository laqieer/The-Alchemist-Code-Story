001	...
002	I did it... Did you see, Father?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	I leave...Saga...in your hands.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0018
004	I'll...always be...watching over you.
005	Father, I swear to protect the land where you lay in rest. Father...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
006	I kept my promise, Father.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
007	We suffered heavy losses, but we overcame our tribal differences. All of Saga is walking together, hand in hand, toward a bright future.
008	I will lead the Toxotes tribe in your stead, Father. I will serve my duties well.
009	So please, watch over me, Father.
010	...
011	That's right, I'm the Chief now. It's what I must do.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
012	...
013	What...I must do.
014	(It's because of me that Mocca...)	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
015	(I have to do something. No... There's a part of me that just wants to do something.)
016	(But...I can't. I have my duties as Chief.)
017	(Then...am I supposed to just leave Mocca to her fate?)
018	I just...!
019	Father... What should I do?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
020	To cure Mocca of her curse...I'd have to leave Saga.
021	Then...even with the four Matters combined, Mocca's curse can't be lifted?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
022	That is correct. The corruption within her has progressed rapidly. It may be able to slow its progression, but it will not cure her.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
023	Isn't there anything that can be done?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
024	You will find no cure for her in Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
025	That can't be true!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
026	Do not despair. I said you will not find a cure for her in Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
027	The cloth wrapped around Mocca's arm... The power imbued within it should slow the curse's progression.
028	If a Sephira like Georgios could be found, then we may be able to cure her.
029	Is that true?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
030	But you have your duties as Chief, Tina. Who will take on those duties for you?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
031	I...!
032	This is my problem. I have no intention of dragging Tina into this.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
033	Mocca...
034	I see...but Mocca, do you intend to leave Tamis behind as well?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
035	Tamis will eventually become the next Wind Sprite, but she is still young. Does she not need you by her side?
036	Well...
037	I do not mean to threaten you with these words. I simply want to see your conviction.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
038	Be sure you think things through before you act. No matter what path you choose to take, I will be by your side.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
039	My conviction...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
040	Father... What should I do?
041	I leave Saga in your hands.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_1009
042	Father...!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
043	I will come again. I promise I will have an answer to report by then.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
044	(Lezario's reparations seem to be going well.)	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
045	It's Tina! Tina!
046	Hey, Tina! The adults were all saying you're the one who saved Saga!
047	It wasn't all me, you know? I couldn't have done it without everyone's help.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
048	Really? But we can still feel safe with you around, right?
049	That's what everybody is saying! Tina, they're calling you the hero of Toxotes... No, of Saga!
050	I don't think that's true.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
051	But I believe it! I know that as long as you're here, you'll save us, no matter what!
052	As long as I'm here, huh?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
053	The Jam! The Jam are at the village gate!
054	Get the women and children out of here! Head toward the forest at the far end of the village!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
055	Keep your distance from them! I'll take care of the Jam!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
