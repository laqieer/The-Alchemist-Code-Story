001	(They're all somebody's friend. Somebody's pupil. Somebody's…)	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0019
002	(How can anyone of them rest in peace? How?!)
003	The enemy is just one Wratharis soldier! Take her out! Then we can claim victory!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0012
004	(I'm sure Priscilla's pupils and friends are among these troops…)	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
005	(There must even be family members who grieve at the sight of those silent corpses.)
006	Ugh, ah!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0023
007	Tell us your name so that you won't be another nameless casualty!
008	(I won't kill "friends." And I can't kill anyone whose name I know…)	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
009	(Is this the person I am? Is this the person I must learn to love?)
010	What's with the flowers? This isn't the time to be playing dress up.
011	Agh! *Pant* *Pant*	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0021
012	Any last words?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
013	…！
014	Silence doesn’t mean the end. The will to live burns from within.
015	Still, no one can escape fate. Not even me--
016	The same words echo in my mind whenever I take a life--be it flower or foe.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
017	"The day will come when I, too, am buried in the soil."
018	…
019	Will I end up deep within the darkness of earth?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
020	Forever silent. Without ever having blossomed. Without ever letting my voice be heard.
021	I used to think I was ready to lay down my life.
022	…Perhaps someday--when the war is over.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0006
023	(If that day ever comes.)
024	But not today.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0039
025	Huh?
026	I'm not ready to say my final goodbyes.	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0005
027	What are you waiting for! Hurry up and kill her!
028	B-But she…!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
029	(The silhouette of a friend sending me off...)
030	(If I can meet the one I love, I'd gladly fall in battle.)	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
031	(As long as we're by each other's side, I'd glady welcome death...)
032	(But right now, I want to live. You taught me that.)
033	A flower in bloom is a thing of fleeting beauty. Eventually its petals fall…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
034	So goes life. That's why I must live fully in the here and now!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0009
035	She has wings...of petals!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
036	Even if I end up being hated, there are those I want to protect.
037	I've got to become stronger if I want to prove myself.
038	Only then can I face that special someone.
039	The reason I love gardenias isn't because their beauty is fleeting…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
040	It's because they're flowers of mourning, isn't it?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
041	I love them simply because of their beauty and fragrance.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
042	One day, I hope I can tell someone gardenias are not for mourning.
043	They mean so much more to me than that.
044	You mocked my flowers earlier, didn't you?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
045	S-So what if I did?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
046	The red flower I adorn myself with--the poppy--has many meanings.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
047	I wanted to choose my words carefully before I spoke in order to do it justice.
048	If so, just spit it out already. What does the little poppy have to say?
049	The poppy cannot know how long it lives, but it will never be truly alive unless it blossoms.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
050	Breathe deeply--this could be your last.
051	I am Lamia, knight of Wratharis. If you think you can put me in the ground--
052	If you think you can extinguish my divine fire, you are gravely mistaken!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0030
