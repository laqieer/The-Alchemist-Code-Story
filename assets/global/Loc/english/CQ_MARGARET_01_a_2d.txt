001	Good morning, Lizzy! Oh, my! Did you cut your hair?	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_1030
002	Ah, hello, Margaret. No, I haven't cut my hair recently.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
003	Really?! You look wonderful, as always!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
004	Hm? Thanks.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
005	Tada! Here are the ingredients for today's tinctures! A lineup of the best-selling products in my store!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
006	Oh, Margaret. You don't need to trouble yourself like this every day, you know.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
007	L-Lizzy! Why are you so disturbed all of a sudden?!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_1030
008	I assume you mean distant? You have been very helpful, but it really isn't right for me to receive all of this for free every day.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
009	Love is free! And unconditional!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
010	W-well, that may be true, but—	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0020
011	I-if it's not enough to repay my debt to you, I'll pay for the rest with my b-body! You can experiment on me any time you like!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
012	No!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0039
013	Come on, bring on the reagents! I'm in perfect condition for someone my age!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0038
014	You sell rare ingredients that simply cannot be obtained elsewhere. What would your customers do if something happened to you?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
015	I can't argue with that! Oh, but...I was excited to help out!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0029
016	The amount of ingredients you provide has been decreasing as of late, too. I worry about your business, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
017	Ungh...nngh...gah! Ack! Why am I coughing? I'm perfectly healthy!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_0022
018	(I haven't been getting many customers lately, for some reason.)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
019	Could it be that sickness that was going around a few years back? You got it then too, didn't you?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
020	Oh! That! I remember!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
021	It's becoming a problem again, in a village not too far from here. That's likely why you haven't been getting as many customers.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
022	Oh!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0044
023	How strange that it started up again after so many years.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
024	There has also been an increase in the number of thugs targeting the weak and sickly on the roads as of late, which has only added to my worries. Hm...? Margaret?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
025	Uwaaarrrrggghhhh! Who the heck are you?! You're crazy strong!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
026	I am Little Miss Margaret, the oh so lovely merchant! Please come and do business with me again!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1001
027	(I can see the villagers! They're in bad shape. My cures are going to sell like hotcakes! Lizzy will be so pleased!)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
028	Heehee...heeheehee...heeheeheehee! Wait for me, my darling Lizzy!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1006
