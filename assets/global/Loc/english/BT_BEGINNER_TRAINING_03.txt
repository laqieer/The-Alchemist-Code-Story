007	Check the estimated damage of the two units, Gunner and Samurai, and defeat the enemy in the most efficient manner.
008	Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!

010	It will be up to how you command your units to determine whether you can defeat them.
011	Hehehe, I appreciate your gratitude, but I would really love to have some pudding instead.
012	If you are ever in need of more wisdom, feel free to visit.
