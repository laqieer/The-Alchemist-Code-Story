001	That's when Setsuna saved me.
002	Whoa! That's so cool!
003	I think the way Macherie saved me after I collapsed right after that is a lot cooler, personally.
004	That was only possible because you saved me first, Setsuna.
005	You're so awesome, Setsuna! You're not even scared of a giant monster bird!
006	That's not true at all.
007	Do you think I can protect my sister if I become as strong as you?
008	Jayme...
009	Yeah. As long as you make sure to train hard, huh?
010	I promise I'm gonna be so strong that you won't ever have to worry, Sis!
011	Hmhm. Thank you, Jayme.
012	Strong enough that you'll never have to worry...
013	Setsuna...?
014	It's nothing. Anyway, shouldn't you be going soon, Macherie?
015	Oh my! Look at the time! I need to get to the shrine!
016	Don't be in too much of a rush. Be careful.
017	I'm fine. I may not be able to see, but I still know where I'm going.
018	Thank you for looking out for me, Setsuna. Hmhm...
019	What is it?
020	Well, it's just that I'm always the one looking after Jayme, so it feels a little strange to be the one being told to be careful.
021	Oh... Do the other villagers not worry for you? I mean, considering how special you are.
022	No, not really. I usually just go to the nearby desert on my own.
023	It helps me with my shrine maiden apprenticeship. I'm still a simple novice.
024	I see... Well, don't let me keep you.
025	Right! I should head out! Please watch over Jayme while I'm gone.
026	Of course.
027	I'm going now, Jayme. You listen to Setsuna, okay?
028	Okay! See you later, Sis!
029	These two are so strong. It's their powerful bond that keeps them strong, and so...bright.
030	But I know.
031	I know that coarse, abrasive taste of failing to protect someone important to me. That despair, like sinking into the darkest abyss...
