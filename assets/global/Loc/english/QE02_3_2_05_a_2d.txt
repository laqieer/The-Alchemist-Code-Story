001	So you're also...seeking the Sacred Stone.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
002	I've heard rumors that it was at the Beckrams. I approached them in order to find its whereabouts.
003	But...you couldn't find it there?
004	I couldn't. They're working up a frenzy in order to find you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
005	This made me think that you must be aware of its location.
006	If you tell me where it is, I'll release you immediately. Where is the Sacred Stone?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
007	Why are you looking for Belphegor?
008	I have no intention of telling you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
009	I cannot give you an answer no matter how much you ask.
010	I don't know anything about the Sacred Stone.
011	I'm sorry but just take your answer at face value. There must be a reason why the Beckrams are chasing you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
012	It's the truth!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
013	Don't you think that I wish I had answers as to why things have ended up this way?!
014	You don't seem to be lying.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0016
015	But...there's something that connects to the whereabouts of the Sacred Stone if you don't realize it yourself.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0017
016	Do you know about the Door of Truth?
017	The Door of Truth...?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
018	Aye, it's the place with something spinning around that gives you power.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
019	...How do you know about it?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0016
020	I went with Edgar, aye! Fiona hasn't been there yet!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
021	Are you talking about the strange world that you saw when you fell off the cliff?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
022	Edgar, huh? Looks like I'll have to have another conversation with him.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0018
023	I want to talk with you a little as well. Would that be all right, you chivalrous little knight?
024	Aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0025
