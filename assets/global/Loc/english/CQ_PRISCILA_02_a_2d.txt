001	(She's strong...and fast. No one has ever been able to dodge my lance so easily. I don't think she's even breaking a sweat. Still...)
002	Intriguing. I sense something from your lance.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0002
003	Reluctance, and yet also...excitement.
004	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhh!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0032
005	Impressive. Yet...lacking.	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0016
006	Ungh!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0022
007	Give it up. You will only hurt yourself if you attempt to stand. I put a little extra force behind that hit.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0014
008	Let us end this battle.
009	No...!
010	(So this is how I die... Felled on the battlefield, just like my father was. It happened so easily, too.)
011	(Somehow, I feel like this is what I have been searching for all this time. What a strange person I am...)
012	...
013	Are you not going to strike?
014	That flower that you carry. I don't mind killing you, but...if I do, the flower will be crushed.
015	Flower...? Oh. This? Lamia's favorite flower...	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
016	You... You're the one from Envylia that Lamia talked about? I never imagined that we might meet in a place like this.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
017	Is it my fate to be forever bound by the ties of pupil and teacher?
018	Come... Let us relocate.	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0015
019	What?
020	This will do.
021	What is happening?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0025
022	I find my curiosity piqued on two counts. Firstly, regarding your relationship with Lamia, and secondly...	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0007
023	About the warring contradiction that exists within you.
024	What did you say?!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0026
025	Like a cycle that never ends...the conflict that exists within you is reflected in your lance...and within myself, as well.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0030
026	Within...you?
027	I find myself...resenting battle.
028	What?! Then why do you fight?
029	I fight...to end battle.
030	You...who has been named the Ruinmaker?
031	That name... I am resigned to it.
032	I accept it. Some who hear it are struck dumb with fear, and abandon their weapons and the battle in response. So regardless of whether I harbor doubts about my opponent...	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
033	I must fight, or else the battles will never end.
034	That’s...!
035	I seem to have said too much.
036	Let us end this, along with that dilemma lying unresolved in your heart.
037	(I cannot defeat her like this. I... I must... Why...do I fight?)
038	Do not weep, daughter. The battlefield is a place for death. Still, we must fight to protect that which means most to us. I leave Envylia...to you.
039	I remember now... My contradiction was born that day, when my father entrusted me with this duty.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0007
040	I am ready to face you, Theresa. I, too, have something I must do, even if it means that I must face the Ruinmaker to accomplish it!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0015
041	Come, then. Show me what you've got, Priscilla!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0037
