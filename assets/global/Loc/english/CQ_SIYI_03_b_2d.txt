001	It's no use. This is over.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
002	Y-You won't listen?!	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0022
003	Hmm... I thought you were some spineless child, but you got sand.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
004	I won't back down. I came all this way for everyone else.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0017
005	I used my map to come all this way with everyone to find The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure!
006	The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0025
007	...?
008	Hey, isn't that from The Adventures of Joe Vandelle?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
009	What? Oh, um... Y-Yes...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
010	This cave is from those stories?
011	Y-Yes. I've always wanted to find this place, so I researched a great deal. I'm sure I'm right.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
012	I see...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0044
013	That story about a treasure no one has ever recovered... It's hidden in a dank cave like this?
014	Hahaha! I see! That's how it is!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0008
015	...?
016	You're a special one. You don't think of stories as just stories, but you go looking for the treasure yourself!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
017	You're a toughie. How about you come with us?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0045
018	Huh?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
019	Gormalas!
020	Ah, you're here. Excellent timing.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
021	Step back from Su Yi!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0013
022	Hold on. Don't you care to hear her response?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0014
023	A response?
024	Indeed. What do you think? I would really put smarts like yours to use.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0005
025	I won't come. I'm... a pirate of the Xiao Shenmei crew.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0040
026	I see. Well, if you're not interested, I can't fix that. Here you go.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
027	Is it all right, Captain? You're just giving back the map?
028	Yes, yes. I don't need this treasure. It's yours if you want it.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0004
029	What?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
030	But next time we meet, it'll be as pirates. Don't expect mercy.
031	And until then, put some meat on those bones! Eat a sandwich!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
032	O-Okay...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
033	(Oof, he was scary... I'm still shaking.)
034	(So that's the pirate Gormalas.)
035	Su Yi, are you okay?!
036	Are you hurt?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0012
037	N-No, I'm fine.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
038	I'm sorry, Su Yi! We pursued the monsters, but a cave in kept us from getting back quickly.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0036
039	We managed to clear the rocks and get back, but... I'm sorry. We put you in danger leaving you alone.
040	It must've been terrifying. I'm truly sorry.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0020
041	Shenmei... Liu Shen...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
042	Thank you for being concerned about me, but I'm okay.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0034
043	I'm okay because I'm a pirate, too!
044	This is the deepest recess of the cave. If there's a treasure, it's here.
045	Hey, you two! Look! Look!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0046
046	Oh my! There're so many flowers! Their petals are shimmering!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0046
047	They are... It's almost like starlight.
048	The World's Most Fragile and Precious Treasure... It makes sense now.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0045
049	I've heard of this. There are flowers that can only bloom in the soil and climate of deep caves.
050	It's the alchemy of earth, where petals sparkle as bright as jewels.
051	But they can only thrive in this environment. Once they're taken outside, they wither and die.
052	So as stories have been passed down, this beautiful sight has become the treasure of legend.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
053	Seems so. No wonder Gormalas lost interest. You can't take this with you.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
054	No... I don't think he lost interest.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
055	What do you mean?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
056	He even remembered the title of the book! I'm sure he was grateful to find this.
057	That makes sense.
058	This is The World's Most Precious Treasure that Joe spoke of.
059	How lovely...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0007
060	Thanks to Su Yi, we've found this amazing treasure!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
061	I'm sorry it's not a treasure we can take with us, Shenmei.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
062	What're you talking about? We'll carry this with us in our hearts!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_event_1006
063	This is priceless! There are few treasures as great as this!
064	Oh, Shenmei...
065	But there are even more treasures that await us!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
066	With Su Yi's maps, we can go anywhere.
067	...! We can go anywhere...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
068	(My maps really did help the others out. In that way, I too...)
069	(I may not be strong, but by doing what I'm good at, I can pull my own weight like everyone else.)
070	Absolutely! I'll do my best!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0037
