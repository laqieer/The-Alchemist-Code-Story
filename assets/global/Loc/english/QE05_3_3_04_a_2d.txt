001	Sir Dias! We have no intention of fighting with you.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
002	Then answer me. What is your objective? Why have you come here? What exactly do you know?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
003	You really think that we would tell you?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
004	You have a point. I know that no amount of coercion could force you to sell out your comrades.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
005	That is simply the kind of knights you are.
006	However, you would be surprised to know that it only takes a slight shift in scenario for people to change. Let us take that woman over there, for example.
007	Ah!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0042
008	If you do not tell me where Logi is, her life is forfeit. What would you do if I said that?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
009	Y-you...! What are you—?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
010	Resistance is futile. You do not have the capacity to take me on, to face the Captain of the Holy Guard.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
011	Come, give me the information I seek. So long as you do that, no one will need to be harmed.
012	Nngh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
013	You're soft.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
014	Wh—?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
015	Urrggghhhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
016	That is not how Corpse operates, Dias Elysion.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
017	We only need let one would-be-informant live. There is no reason to spare the others.
018	You...! Why are you here?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
019	Waginau has given the order to silence all who would interfere with our original mission.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
020	Our...original mission? What do you mean?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
021	It is not something that you need to know.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
022	Ngh! We are under attack! Protect the perimeter! We are in the middle of a city! We must do what we can to keep damage to a minimum!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
023	Lady Marie, over here! You should be a little safer inside the guild!
024	Th-thank you!	VO_mary.mary_battle_0019
025	Aaaarrrrggghhh! N-no!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
026	Those who are injured should retreat immediately! Evacuation will be carried out by reinforcements!
027	They're using Alchemy in the dang city! It's like they don't care about destroying the area at all!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
028	Nnggh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0020
029	What are you doing, Dias Elysion? Surely you do not intend to turn your back on the Holy Guard?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
030	That would be such a waste. Oh, yes. A waste of all the blood that you have spilled up until this point.
031	Tch! I never intended to join your ranks. Stay the hell out of my way!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0003
032	You...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
033	Urrggghh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0020
034	Then this is where it ends, Elysion. Dying with your former comrades ought to be an honor.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
035	Hmph. It's been a while since I've been to the desert... I didn't realize there was a show on. What's all this?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
036	Wha—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0020
037	Geez, can't even take a holiday in peace anymore. This desert is the home away from home for my comrades. I'm not about to let you outsiders just do as you please.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
038	Huh?! Who the hell are you?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
039	You're the Blue Tongues, right? How long are you gonna keep standing there with your tails between your legs? Get your butts back into formation and stop their attack!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
040	If you don't, you'll lose everything. You won't be able to protect diddly-squat!
041	H-huh?! Yes, um... Yes, sir! All right, team, let's bring it together! We're going to crush every last one of them!
042	Get into formation! The enemy may be strong, but we have the numbers! Let's overwhelm their few with our many!
043	Hmph. Not bad. I guess I'll join in for once, too.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
044	G-Georgios...?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
045	Is that you, Marie?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
046	Are you all right? I heard that you had disappeared from Saga, and I thought...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0044
047	You're such a worry wart, you know that? You really think I'd go dying so easily?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
048	N-no! Of course not! I... I'm happy to see you again, Georgios!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0018
049	All right, so... What're you gonna do?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
050	Hmm...
051	Are you going to fight me here? Or are you going to change sides? I don't really care which, but...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0001
052	It doesn't look like that sword in your hand likes what they're doing.
053	Hmph. You don't need to tell me that. I follow my own brand of justice!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
054	Grrrrnnnnggghhhh!
055	I have a goal of my own, and right now, you're standing in my way!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0005
056	You're an interesting one, I'll give you that. I especially like how you don't understand your own duty. That really hits the spot!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0013
057	Now it's starting to look like you're the ones who are at a bit of a disadvantage, isn't it? What are you gonna do about that, huh?
058	There! That's the Gluttony Foss border!
059	What are we going to do? We can hardly declare ourselves a merchant caravan with these numbers!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
060	We will just have to push through! I am counting on you!
