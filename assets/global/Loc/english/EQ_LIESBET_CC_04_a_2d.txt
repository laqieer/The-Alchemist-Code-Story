001	Whoa, a little late, but I just realized how cold it is...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0027
002	Ohh...Well, it's a given since we were playing on the ice for so long. Plus, there are a lot of trees around here so it makes it colder.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
003	This is where Liz comes in!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
004	Huh? Eeeek?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
005	Heheheh! Your baby-like skin is warm! Ah, such bliss!	VO_alma.alma_chara_1011
006	He-hey! You're cold! And stop acting like I'm younger than you! Eeek...you're so cooold!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0028
007	(I wonder if Liz is warm...)	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0044
008	You know how you should snuggle up together if you get lost in the mountains? Here, Rebecca, come closer!	VO_alma.alma_chara_1001
009	Well, it makes sense.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
010	Rebecca?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
011	Not...so...tight...! Oh...but I'm feeling warmer.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
012	More importantly, what're we gonna do from here? We've progressed so far in cloudy weather, but there are no flowers blooming.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
013	Hmm. I think it'll be fine. See. At least they have signs.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
014	Huh? Oh, you're right!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
015	This sign looks a little old, but it means that people have come here, and we might actually be pretty close.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
016	You're an optimist as ever.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
017	Um..."Look into the ice. The reflection shows those beyond flesh and blood who think of you."	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
018	"If you love the ones reflected in return, you will find a token of your love ahead. If not, you cannot proceed."
019	This has come out of the blue. The ones before this were completely different. This one's like the kind that appears at the final location of a tourist spot.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
020	Hmm. In other words, this ice is a mirror to show how both of you feel?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
021	No way?! If that's true, that's amazing! I wanna take each and every one of our classmates here!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0024
022	That's a scary thought...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
023	Wh-wh-what should I do?! I-it's going to show the person I like!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
024	... ...
025	... ...
026	Hey, Liz? Just putting this out there, but...um...you wouldn't happen to—	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
027	Did you think I didn't know about it? It's that Holy Guard, isn't it?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
028	Whaaaat?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
029	In other words, if Dias appears then this ice is real! Come on, Liz, look into it!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
030	Whaaa! I'm the test subject?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_2007
031	I'm looking from the side angle, so I can only see the two of you.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
032	I'm the same. I can only see the two of you. What about you...Liz? What do you see?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
033	...! Oh no...! What should I do?! I don't see Dias!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
034	Ah, I knew it was just ice. No way there'd be magic here.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
035	I-I can also only see the two of you as well. Oh dear... What are we gonna do about it? I don't think we can get the Stub Rule...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
036	...?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
037	Liz, isn't this weird? You're standing directly on top of the ice, right? Where's your reflection?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
038	Huh...what?! A-am I not appearing?! What's this! Am I dead?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
039	Calm down, Liz. But it's strange...why doesn't the person looking see their own reflection? Wait...could this be real?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
040	Could we be the people that Liz loves and could Liz be who we love too?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
041	...!
042	I-it's true that it doesn't necessarily say someone of the opposite sex...and maybe it includes friendship as love?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
043	Ah...you're probably right! Oh...but that's a little sad...Dias...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
044	Well, you just met him and you can never be too sure with love at first sight.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
045	You can take your time and slowly deepen your feelings towards each other, right? Like you did with me.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
046	Rebecca...! Thanks...both of you for always thinking of me.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
047	Well, we are best friends, aren't we?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
048	A-and I'm the class chairperson, so it's natural for me to have my classmates on my mind!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
049	As coy as always. But I guess we cleared the test, didn't we?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
050	I think it's all right! My feelings for both of you are real as well! I think it's okay! I think we can get there!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
