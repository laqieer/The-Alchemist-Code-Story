001	You're suggesting we split our forces into two? Don't you think it unwise for us to cut our strength in half before attempting to slay a dragon?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0012
002	Not if we are to protect Saga. Several measures need to be taken in order to ensure its survival. Destroying the core is the first.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
003	This, I leave to you, Tina, Rega, Lisbeth, and Georgios. Mocca, you will go with them and take command.
004	Such few numbers? What will we be doing in the meantime?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
005	We will be activating the Matter in Tamis' body. Restoring the Wind Matter should be our utmost priority.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
006	What...?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
007	I see. It has long been said that the four Matter exist to seal away the dragon. This is your backup plan...in case we're unable to defeat the beast, isn't it?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0045
008	Wow... Is that what the Matter were designed to do?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0001
009	The dragon is mentioned in an ancient legend within Saga. It is said to be a living incarnation of nature's fury. As long as we coexist in harmony with nature, it will not reveal itself.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
010	However, should we humans dare decide to betray the will of nature, even for a moment...the dragon shall emerge to annihilate us all.
011	Moreover, as proof of its desire to coexist with humanity, nature created the entity we call Matter.
012	Then they're not just stones imbued with the power of purification... They're not just there for the sole purpose of suppressing Beelzebub.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0044
013	No, the people of Sephira, too, had the same power...but ever since they were exterminated...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
014	The four Matter have been the only entities capable of purifying and containing Beelzebub.
015	The Sephiran people, and Matter too, flourished beneath the great tree of life, Sephiron. Building roots among Mother Nature has granted them access to the power of purification.
016	But now...the Wind Matter lies dormant. Don't tell me...you intend to awaken it by force!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
017	We will rejuvenate the Wind Matter by infusing Tamis with the various powers in all of us.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
018	The wind within is yet a small breeze...but we will nourish it with water, warm it with fire, and shape it with earth.
019	If we funnel each of the elements using a circulation of wind, we can create a perpetual cycle that will restore the Wind Matter to its original state. This is the only method remaining to us.
020	Wagering all we have on awakening the dormant Wind Matter is the best option available to us right now.
021	You're going to infuse all of your Matter into her?! Do you have any idea how taxing that'll be on her body?! It's far too risky!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
022	Then tell me, do you have a better plan? Even if we manage to destroy the dragon, there still remains the problem of sealing Beelzebub.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
023	Our objective remains the same. We shall restore the Wind Matter to its original state.
024	I have been prepared from the very beginning to give my body up to revive the Wind Matter. Let me do this!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0038
025	But—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
026	Mocca, I'll be fine. If I can be of help to you, then all the more reason why I should do this. I mean, it's not like I can fight by your side or anything...	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
027	I've always envied the fact that Tina can.
028	For once...I'm the only one who can do this. So, please Mocca, allow me to help.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
029	Tamis!	VO_moca.moca_battle_1028
030	Then it's decided. We'll retrieve the Matter from each of the temples, then infuse their power into Tamis.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
031	Meanwhile, you will go and defeat the ancient dragon. If all goes accordingly, we'll reclaim Beelzebub and seal the dragon once and for all.
032	...!
033	Furthermore, when Tamis receives all of our Matter, the Ouija will be released, enabling her to use it.
034	If you can't take the dragon down, then leave it to us. We'll show you the true power of the Sprite Trio.
035	...!
036	Whether you agree or not, this is our best course of action. Now then, prepare to move out—hm... Looks like we have company.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
037	Glurp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0007
038	We'll rendezvous after we've visited each of the temples. Time is of the essence! Let's make swift work of them and be on our way!
