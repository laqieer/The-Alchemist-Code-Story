001	There are people who are icky-sticky and those who are sparkly-shiny. And I'm a black and white bear. Heh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
002	The icky-stickies, for some reason, try to smother the sparkly-shinys.
003	That's why I keep losing places I can sleep.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
004	Hyaahhh!!!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0032
005	Ugh... You're always so noisy when you fight!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
006	You do realize we are on the run, don't you?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
007	I know.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
008	Then why draw so much attention?
009	We just need to pummel anyone they throw at us. Easy.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0010
010	I don't hate this. I like fighting with Glizzy. I can fight as I please.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
011	What?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
012	Glizzy is good at coordinating. I'm comfortable fighting with you. Comfortable and fun. Get it?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0005
013	No, I really don't.
014	You're quite adept at coordinating with others in combat. It's very comforting to have you fight alongside me.
015	I've been told something similar before, though.
016	Mmm? Glizzy, what are you thinking about? Old friends?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
017	Something like that.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0005
018	Hey... I'm Glizzy's partner now! Remember?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
019	Sure, but this isn't a competition.
020	What about you, Glizzy? Is it not fun fighting next to me?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
021	Not sure. I'm not exactly used to fighting at the side of someone like you.
022	Why say things like that?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
023	It's just difficult fighting with you. I mean, I do admire your prowess...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
024	Heheh! Of course you do! I'm good at pummeling!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
025	It's just that... You draw so much attention.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
026	So you hate fighting next to me?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
027	No, I don't.
028	Rawr! I'm hungry! I want something heartier! Glizzyyyy!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
029	Hey! Calm down! Don't yell my name! I've told you we never know who's listening!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
030	Do you regret letting Chief go?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
031	I wasn't surprised how things went. It wasn't hard to figure out how he would scheme to protect himself. He needed someone to pin the blame on.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
032	I don't mind being on the run like this if it means that Ishuna and the others get to keep their place to belong.
033	Do you regret what we did?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
034	I don't want to be icky-sticky. I don't want to smother the sparkly-shinys.
035	That's right. So we should try not to draw so much attention that we smother them.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0005
036	Glizzy worries too much. We haven't been attacked by Wratharis in a while. Even if they come, we can take them easy.
037	That's not the point. But still, you're right. We haven't seen assassins from Wratharis lately.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
038	Did they get tired of getting beat up?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
039	If that was the case, they could just send more powerful assassins. It seems more likely they can no longer afford to pay us any attention.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
040	Have you heard? Wratharis invaded Envylia.
041	What?!
042	They did?! Guess Wratharis really didn't like Envylia declaring independence. Wonder who'll win?
043	Envylia, clearly. Just between us, I heard Wratharis has been messin' around with Alchemy.
044	Oh, damn. So now they've made an enemy of the world.
045	...
046	This is good! Eat some, Glizzy!
047	Oh, uh... Yeah...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
048	So... Freed was killed.
049	He was. Slaughtered by the Blue Flame Blood Wolf.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
050	I never thought a knight of Envylia would kill a soldier of Wratharis within Wratharis.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0022
051	I told you war was coming. So, now it is time for this secret weapon to be deployed.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0030
052	I will fight as a knight for the things important to me. I only hope you will do the same and not leave any regrets to mourn later.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
053	I...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0018
054	...
055	Is your old partner in Wratharis?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
056	Huh?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0025
057	If Unicorn Knights... No... If Ishuna is in trouble, I'd want to help.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
058	(It was the first place I was able to smile after losing Rina.)
059	(This black and white bear made me part of this world again... And I didn't mind that.)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0007
060	All I can do is fight. So, even though I don't know how...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
061	We should help Glizzy's old partner.
062	But...I simply can't bring myself to fight for a country. Not like Anastasia.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
063	Because it's not clean?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
064	Countries and organizations are inherently dirty. I can't fight for those things, even at her side.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
065	Just fight for her, then.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
066	Besides, Glizzy stayed with me. So I'll go where you'll go.
067	Don't you hate the icky-stickies?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
068	If it's for my pillow...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
069	Wouldn't I become icky-sticky for getting you involved?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
070	Glizzy. It is my idea. I'm doing this because I want to do this for Glizzy.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
071	All right. Let's go help Ishuna.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
072	Glizzy?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
073	That's what I desire.
074	Eeeek!!!
075	Stop it! Get your dirty hands off of my family!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
076	I won't let you sully the one thing I care about! My family!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
077	Let's see how long you can keep that spirit up. Hehehe.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
078	...!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0022
079	This is why.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
080	I hate this world because there are so many of you who believe you have the right to do whatever you want with women and children!
081	Agh! You...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
082	Nasty icky-stickies. I'm gonna pummel you all!	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0014
083	Glanz?! Rochelle?! Wh-why?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
084	You one of them too? Very well then, we'll play with you too!
