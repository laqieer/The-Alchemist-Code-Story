001	For Beelzebub to be betrayed by his own priestess...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0001
002	People...are such baffling creatures...
003	It is for that reason the future is packed with limitless potential.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
004	What are you on about? You will come to regret this...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_c
005	What...?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
006	Of the pillars tied to this world, three have failed in their duty. It is too late to escape from its collapse...
007	Its collapse...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
008	Look to the sky... You will see the answer to your question.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0002
009	What? It just disappeared! Does this mean...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
010	It must. Nimul must have...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
011	Jeez, that dolt likes to take his time...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
012	We've...done it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
013	Commander, is this...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
014	Yes! Nimul has defeated Beelzebub!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
015	Let's confirm our losses and get started purifying the area around the village!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
016	It's from now that the real work starts! It will be no laughing matter to restore these lands that the Cursed Beasts have rampaged through!
017	Ah...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
018	Hmm? What is it? Are the injuries that grave?
019	No, sir. It's not that. It's... Uh...
020	Stop being so vague. How many times have I told you, you must keep your reports accurate and concise.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
021	Um, I'm sorry, it's just...the sky...
022	The...sky?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
023	What is that?!
024	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
025	...
026	She's fine. She just needs rest.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
027	I...see. What a relief. Truly...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
028	It's all thanks to you, Julia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
029	...
030	You're such a hopeless man...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0030
031	That may be so. However...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
032	I'm glad to see you again. It might be selfish, but that's how I truly feel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
033	Do you think everything is fine now just because you've gained a little self-awareness? Seriously...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
034	This has forced me to remember all of the suffering of the woman I once was.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0010
035	But...that really has nothing to do with me anymore.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0006
036	I feel almost...cleansed. After all, this me despises you all.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0008
037	Haha, I see. That's too bad.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
038	It's not over, Nimul.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
039	I know.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
040	If we don't purify Beelzebub's core, then we'll be right back where we started.
041	This time, I will completely destroy that Cursed Beast myself!
042	"My corporeal form shall be the key! My ego shall reach the great plains, and overturn the cosmic principles!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
043	"No longer do you bear any corruption. Forget that you ever opposed us."
044	"Be laid to rest, our sin!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
045	...!
046	(It responded! I'm sure I just felt the sinful magil being pulled from the core of the Cursed Beast...)
047	I think that should do it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
048	Did it work?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
049	Wait, Nimul! I'm hearing some strange voices...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0018
050	Huh? No, that light can't be...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
051	The pillar has been cleansed of sin, has it? It is a very, very clear display of your loathing for the way of the world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
052	But it's been quite interesting. I suppose I will take responsibility for this blunder. What...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
053	The day you will receive your comeuppance for what you have done is nigh. Whether or not you accept it...
054	I will find my way into this place. It is inevitable.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
055	That light just now...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
056	Hmm? The voices went away...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
057	Where did the core go? Nimul, what...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
058	Ah... It looks like we've still a long way to go to finding the truth of this world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	(Perhaps beyond that Gate filled with eternal light lay the secrets of the Cursed Beasts...)
060	(I get the feeling that is the case, at least.)
061	That was spectacular. I certainly hadn't expected to see a Cursed Beast sealed away so magnificently.
062	...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
063	(I was too focused on performing the technique. Where did that man come from...?)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
064	Who are you?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
065	Apologies. I did not mean to startle you.
066	Unfortunately, I have my own situation to consider.
067	I asked, who are you?
068	Ah... I had hoped to have everyone here before I gave my self-introduction...
069	But I suppose it's not so important. I'll just tell you what I'm called.
070	I am Ignacio. I am an agent attached to an organization called the Infinite Serpent.
071	The Infinite... So that makes you an ally of Icona and Zafeiris.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
072	Oops! Now you've really put your guard up! This is why I didn't wanted to say this...
073	Have you come here to get revenge for your comrade?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
074	Ha! A splendid joke. No, no, I am not here for anything of the sort. I'm no hero.
075	Then why...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
076	Hm... Well, it's sort of a "The sky is falling! The end of the world is near!" kind of thing.
077	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
078	(Come to think of it, Zafeiris did say something like that...)
079	Huh?! An earthquake... This is absurd! We don't get these in Gula Belt Region!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
080	What's that?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
081	The sky... There's a crack in the Cosmic Egg?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
082	Well, how wonderful. It seems we're all on the same page now. That, my friends, is why I'm here.
083	Now that you understand the situation, I have a proposal for you.
084	Work with us, Pursuers of Truth.
085	The world has begun to change into a form I never imagined with remarkable speed.
086	The anomaly that occurred in the Gula Belt Region, the so-called agent from the Infinite Serpents...
087	...And the threat posed by the existence of the Cursed Beasts. We still did not understand the truth behind it all.
