001	The Woods of Mystical Nights... I hadn't expected to come here again.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0050
002	Lord Gabirond, we've received information from the nearby villagers! They've sighted large numbers of Old Wratharis's ranks in the vicinity!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0004
003	Dias, your idea may not have been altogether wrong.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0018
004	I'll go!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
005	Dias!
006	Wait, Bertrand, there's something I wish to speak with you about.
007	What is it?
008	Stop misleading him with unnecessary advice. If you continue to distract him, I'll have you removed from the Guard.
009	Do as you please.
010	What?!
011	Whatever happens to me, I'll honor Captain Zeke's code of chivalry, even if it means my removal from the Guard.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0004
012	Tsk! Does a mere knight really wish to point his blade at me?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
