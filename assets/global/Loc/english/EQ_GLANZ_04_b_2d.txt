001	Grrraaaagh!!!	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0007
002	Wh-what the hell?! Nobody told us there would be this kind of resistance in Wratharis!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
003	Ishuna...
004	...
005	Why did you come back? You betrayed us...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
006	You sold the Unicorn Knights out, didn't you?
007	What are you talking about?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
008	Don't play dumb!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
009	Why else would a small group of bandits like us be targeted so relentlessly?! Someone had to have sold us out!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
010	It had to have been you! There isn't anybody else that had information on us to leak!
011	I...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
012	Unicorn Knights was where we belonged! Why did it have to...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0018
013	This is all my fault... Where is the Chief?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
014	I don't know. We lost him, we kept getting attacked, so we kept running, and...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
015	I should have ended it when I had the chance.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
016	Glizzy...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0018
017	I wanted to cleanse this tainted world. I should have cleansed it.
018	But I wasn't able to protect the place you belong, so I entrusted it to him.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
019	We were being hounded as well. So, I thought we could shoulder all the blame.
020	I...don't understand. What are you saying?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
021	Stop right there!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
022	...
023	Go, Ishuna.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
024	What?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
025	We'll take care of this. You need to get out of here.
026	B-but...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0027
027	Just go! Run and live through this.
028	I don't care what you have to do. No matter how uncouth or beastly you have to be... I want you to live.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0041
029	You can hate me if you want. You can hate your chief if you want. Just promise me you won't rush through your life.
030	If the Unicorn Knights is where you belong, then you have to get back to them.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
031	A hero is someone who can steal a whole country, right?
032	Glanz...
033	Steal back the fate that others want to decide for you!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
034	Live, Ishuna. I promise we'll keep all of their attention on us this time.
035	...!
036	All right. I'll steal back and secure the Unicorn Knights' future!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
037	You know, Rochelle? I wanted to cleanse this world. I wanted to rid this world of the filth that clings to it.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
038	Then let's cleanse it together. It'll be fun with Glizzy.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
039	Ha. Yes, perhaps it will be.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
