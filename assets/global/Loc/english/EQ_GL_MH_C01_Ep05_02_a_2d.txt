001	Now that we've all settled down, we should look at conducting some reconnaissance in the forests nearby.
002	The behavior of the local wildlife, right?
003	Spot on, my dear. If the situation is anything like what we've encountered in Lustburg...
004	Then make no mistake—we are in the right place.
005	Siegfried and the party spread out to observe the forest's creatures.
006	Several hours later, they reconvene in a clearing with their findings.
007	You know... It’s weird of me to say this, because the last couple of assignments all had to do with dispatching vicious beasts...
008	But this is the least aggressive wildlife I've seen so far!
009	You too, Sieg? The ones I saw weren't anything out of the ordinary, either.
010	That's the way wildlife should be. Cute and docile...
011	Yeah... Same here. All of them seem fine to me.
012	Minerva draws up a small sample of earth and pulls out a small jewel, which glows dully in her hand.
013	Hmm. The concentration of Alchemia particles here is within normal limits.
014	Perhaps this area isn't the same as where my colleague's sample was retrieved.
015	Grr...
016	?!
017	What was—
018	GRAAARRHH!
019	What's with these guys?!
020	They just tore that poor innocent animal apart! I won't forgive this!
021	Count me in!
022	(Guess they really do love animals.)
023	These might just be the ones we're looking for.
