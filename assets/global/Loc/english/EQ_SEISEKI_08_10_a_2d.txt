001	Ughh...!!! Ack...ckk...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
002	Captain!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
003	Agh! Ughh! Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
004	Huff...huff...! S-so much for the immortal soldiers! The-they're no big...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
005	Aghhh...!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
006	Oh? Well, this is an unexpected harvest.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
007	If you take him down then it'll greatly change the tide of this war. Get him!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
008	Ughh!!! Aghh!!! Hu...huzzaaahhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
009	Still resisting, huh? Honestly, he's stronger than even the rumors suggest.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
010	Well now, you're not a very good boy, are you? Try to stay still, will you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
011	Ugh...?! Ug...gh...gh...! I-I can't move!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
012	...Do it.
013	Captain Monzein!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
014	Aghh...!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
015	C-Captain Monzein...? Captain Monzein!!!
016	............
017	Finally. He sure was a handful.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
018	N-no...! Why would you use me...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
019	Heheh. The intent was to reduce the enemy's fighting power...but I hadn't expected it to go this well.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
020	We managed to eliminate one of our obstacles in a way well beyond our expectations. Now it is time for the ritual.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0023
021	Understood! Vier.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
022	Huh...! What? Wh-what is this terrible situation?!
023	The king's consciousness has returned!
024	Your Majesty! Please run away immediately! They are trying to take Leviathan away from you!
025	Wh-what...?!
026	H-hey...is this...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
027	Was the kid right? Was the king being controlled?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
028	Tsk! Vier, what are you doing?! Hurry...	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
029	Enough. To begin with, your plan to move things along peacefully was a mistake.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
030	Then...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
031	Of course. Complete annihilation.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
032	Wh-what...?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
033	N-no! We'll all be killed!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
034	Ack! No...at this rate...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
035	That...smell...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
036	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
037	That...smell. That woman's illusion...originates from this scent...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
038	Captain Monzein...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
039	I-it...looks like...this is where I...get off...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
040	If this is how...it was gonna go down in the end...I-I should've bought...Othima...that meal...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0020
041	...! Wh-what...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
042	Th-their attention is diverted right now...it's your...chance...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
043	W-we'll take on...the Greed soldiers. Kid...you save...the king...
044	Y-you'll take on the soldiers?! In that condition...?
045	I-I...sacrifice my remaining power...t-to this...moment!
046	M-my burning soul! Now is the time...to show your radiance!!!
047	Ughh...!!! Ugggh...!!! Agghhhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
048	What the...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
049	Is that...Monzein?! That man is still alive?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0021
050	Ugh...I see... Yeah, this'll work...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
051	The future of this country is the hands of us three. Don't let your guard down for second.
052	What?! What is this? What is going on?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
053	This is the secret art that is passed down only to the captains of the Holy Guard. Burning Seal!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
054	It can only be used at the final moment of life. It's a technique that allows you to weaponize your remaining life energy.
055	Final moment...?! In other words...
056	Yeah. I've gotta take care of this within a limited amount of time.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
057	H-hold on! What happens...when your power expires?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
058	It'll be all right. My soul that has walked the code of chivalry will not die. After all, I've found those who will carry it on for me.
059	Huh...?
060	I'm talking about you lot. Just knowing that the two of you are here...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0020
061	I can now relish my final battle. Let's go.
062	W-wait, please! Captain Monzein!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
063	Let this be known to the Greed Dike army! We will not let you take one step closer!
064	If you want to lay hands on the citizens of Envylia behind us...you must be prepared to forfeit your life!
065	You should consider me, Monzein...as Envylia's final wall!
066	Oh? I guess if you were to look at it the other way around...would your defeat mean that Envylia has fallen?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
067	If you think you have it in you...then try your best to get past me!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
068	Heheh. I would've expected no less from Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe. What dazzling confidence.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
069	Basheeny...Bud...I leave the fate of this continent in your hands.
070	Witness the greatest battle of this generation! Let this image of me, the Great Thunder Axe, be forever burned into your eyes!
071	What...?! He's taking down the prototypes with a single strike?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
072	Are these supposed to be undead?! They're still warm. Come one, come all!
073	My code of chivalry will not be shattered by the likes of you!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
074	Ack...! Attack!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
075	Huzzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
076	Bud...! Let's go too!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
077	Yeah!
078	I prefer you lot to that smothering muscle-head over there.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
079	?!
080	Well...welcome boys. Let your big sister have some fun with you!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
081	Uck...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
082	Tsk! I'll leave that one to you lot!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
