001	Huzzaaahh!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0001
002	(There are some things I can't handle on my own, but that become possible when we all work together. These three taught me that.)
003	(So I want to help them, too, if I can.)
004	(I want to make sure they get to fulfill their vow to create a peaceful future for the continent!)
005	Grrooooghhh!
006	We brought the Taurus to its knees—but it won't stay down for long. You've got to get to the core!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0032
007	Leave it to me! With this level of firepower, I'll have no trouble making it up there now!	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
008	All right, time to turn the power output on this new mech gear up to max! There's the core—target locked on. Ready, and... Huzzzaaaah!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
009	Just...a bit...further!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
010	Grooogh...
011	Grrooooghhh!
091	Dang it! Guess I didn't hit hard enough.
092	But I'm not going to give up! It's all about trial and error!
093	Again!
012	Crap! I can't dodge that!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
013	Judith! Look out!
014	Arghh!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
015	Basheeny!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
016	Grooorgghhhhh!
017	Hey, Big Horns! Don't go forgetting about us!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
018	Time to knock you down again!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
094	Grooorgghhhhh!
095	Huzzah!
096	If there're any more errors, Judith, let us take care of them!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0038
097	You just focus on the trial part—and don't give up!
098	Huh. That was a pretty cool one-liner.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
099	Don't sound so surprised! I'm a cool guy!
100	You two are awfully chipper. We're fighting for our lives here, y'know!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0012
101	Someone's gotta liven up the mood when Brooding Basheeny's around!
102	Hey! I heard that.
103	Anyway, there's no point freaking out or being all serious in a situation like this. It's not going to make it any easier!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
104	Haha. That's not a bad sentiment. The light of the future shines brightest when there's a smile to welcome it.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
105	Grooorgghhhhh!
106	Hrgh...
019	Bud! Victor! Basheeny! Are you all right?!
020	Don't worry about us—get to the core!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
021	But—!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
022	Don't be afraid. We'll protect you from the Taurus's attacks. All you have to do is jump.
023	Remember: you're not alone in this. We're here to fight with you. So it's going to be okay. Your Mecha Weapon will get us through this!
024	Grooorgghhhhh!
026	Okay... I can do this!	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
027	Grooooooaaarr!
028	Everyone here believes in my Mecha Weapon, so I just have to believe in the future they're going to create!
029	A future where my Mecha Weapon can bring smiles to all the world!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
030	But for that future to be possible... I need to defeat you, here and now!
031	This is it! Huzzaaaah!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
032	Grooooooooooooooorrghhh!
033	Thank you, Judith. We couldn't have defeated the Giant Taurus without your help—or your father's invention.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
034	Maybe, but this new-and-improved mech gear wouldn't have been possible without your help, either!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
035	I was only able to get it to exert that much power because of your input!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
107	You guys helped me see that together we really can create a peaceful future for this world! I believe in that now, from the bottom of my heart.
108	And in a way... I think the Mecha Weapon responded to that.
036	So, really, I should be the one thanking you! Thank you for helping me believe in a better future.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0033
037	Maybe the Mecha Weapon won't even need these new functions anymore.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
038	After all, in the future you have planned, it won't be a weapon anymore. It'll be something fun—something that creates smiles.
039	Aw, isn't this sweet? Those two are so good together!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
040	Sure, but it wasn't always like this, was it?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
041	When he first met Judith, Basheeny was so hung up on being Lord Commander that he lost sight of the things right in front of him.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
042	Don't go sounding all high and mighty! You literally just went through the same thing!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
043	Give me a break, will you? It's hard to shoulder this much responsibility! It's not easy being captain of the Blue Flame Guard, you know!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
044	But I realized that I shouldn't let my position stop me from caring about the world.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
045	Envylia is important to me, but it's not the only nation in the world, and its people aren't the only ones who need protection.
046	Protecting the future of this world means protecting everyone, regardless of where they call home.
047	(If Kagura hadn't given me the push I needed to join this mission, I might not have learned all this until it was too late. I'll have to remember to thank her.)	VO_budd.budd_sys_0007
090	What's that dreamy look for?
048	Huh?! I-I've got no idea what you're talking about!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0012
049	Oh, really? Those red cheeks say otherwise. I bet you were thinking about Kagura! You always look like that when you're thinking about her.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
050	Sh-shut up!
051	Bud! Victor! You're not arguing again, are you?
052	Uhh...
053	Pfft. Hahaha! I swear, you three are the weirdest friends I've ever met!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0008
054	But don't get me wrong—I think it's great! 'Cause when the three of you team up, you can help so many people!	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
055	Hmm...
056	Hey... Basheeny? This is just an idea, but...do you think the Holy Guard would help me research the Mecha Gear?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
057	What?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
058	There's no telling when another threat like the Giant Taurus will show itself in Babel.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
059	Like you mentioned before, for all we know, something even stronger could show up one day.
060	I don't think I could deal with that alone, and I don't think the Mecha Weapon would be powerful enough either.
061	But if we all work together to improve the Mecha Weapon, I truly believe that it could make all the difference!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0006
062	Judith...
063	To be honest, I didn't think a collaboration like that would be possible at first. There are plenty of people in the Holy Guard who don't think the Mecha Weapon should even exist.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
064	Some people even consider it a cursed...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
065	But...I believe in that possibility now. Because I trust you, Basheeny.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
066	Are you sure? I haven't fulfilled my vow to bring peace to the world yet. And...I still haven't made good on my promise to you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
067	Listen... I haven't forgiven the Holy Guard for killing my father.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
109	But you're willing to shoulder all the hatred and bitterness I feel on their behalf. That means something to me.
068	And seeing you fight to bring peace to the world made me want to help you.
069	So I believe in you, Basheeny. I know you'll keep your promise to me, no matter what.
070	You will, won't you?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
071	Of course.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
072	I plan to use my report detailing our battle with these new Giant Taurus to promote the use of the Mecha Weapon and start clearing away its negative reputation.
073	As for your father...
074	There were a lot of unnatural circumstances surrounding his sentence. I intend to investigate each of these, and see if I can't find out anything. Perhaps there was some sort of mistake.
077	It will take time, but I'm sure I can clear his name, too, eventually.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
078	Thank you. I really appreciate that.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0033
079	But just so you know, it doesn't really matter to me whether my father's name is cleared or not.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
080	O-oh...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
081	Even if we can change the past, it's the here and now that's most important, right?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
082	That's why I want to try and find an alternative purpose for the Mecha Weapon.
083	Maybe even something like what Victor mentioned the other day.
084	See, he got me thinking... What if I could create a sport that revolved around using mech gear? I could hold tournaments for people to go head-to-head with one another, for fun!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
085	I could even collaborate with the Holy Guard to determine the basic rules. What do you think?
086	You know... That could actually work.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
087	I think it would be wonderful if we could use the results of our collaborative research to find a way to make the Mecha Weapon a symbol of peace.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
088	Exactly! In other words, I don't need to feel pressured anymore. The Mecha Weapon's usefulness will be proven in time.	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
089	Because we're going to make it happen! Together, we'll decide what the Mecha Weapon's function should be, and we'll work together to shape it!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0008
110	Judith...
111	I...
112	I don't wish to pressure you, and I'd understand if you declined, but if I may... I'd like to see your father's journals.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
113	After all, they might contain valuable information that we could use in our upcoming research.
114	Sure! I trust you.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0006
115	Thank you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0033
116	(There must be something in there about the Cursed Beasts.)
117	(Whatever it is... As Lord Commander, it's my duty to know about it.)
118	Hey... I know that look. I hope you're not thinking of tackling anything dangerous on your own.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
119	You worry too much, little frog.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
120	Don't worry. I have no intention of neglecting the vow we swore together.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
121	Good. Don't go forgetting it or anything.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
122	I won't.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
123	(I won't forget. However, I also won't risk exposing you, Bud, Judith, or anyone else to the risks I face going forward.)	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
124	In any case... It's time. Bud, Victor... You know what we're doing. Judith, you're in this too.
125	Oh, so we're actually doing it? Awesome!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0023
126	Okay, fine... It's a bit embarrassing, but...I'll live.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0007
127	Huh? Wh-what're we doing, exactly? Don't keep me in the dark!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
128	Since you've agreed to help us fulfill our vow to protect the world and create a brighter future...
129	I figured it was about time we swore our vows anew—except this time, you'll be joining us, Judith.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
130	The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0008
131	Hey! Not again!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
132	I was gonna say that this time! Tch... Stupid line-stealer.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
133	I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
134	We four shall combine the justice with which we have been entrusted to build a peaceful world. Together, we shall work ever towards ensuring a bright future for Babel!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0032
135	(Kanon trusted me to protect this world. To do so, I will need to learn all I can of the Cursed Beasts and the threat they pose, as well as of the history that was buried.)
136	(This is something I must do, both as Lord Commander, and as the bearer of the sacred sword.)
137	Together we'll work towards forging a Mecha Weapon that can stand up to any threat!
138	Because our goal is to create a future where the my dad's invention is no longer a weapon of mass destruction, but an instrument of fun!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0008
