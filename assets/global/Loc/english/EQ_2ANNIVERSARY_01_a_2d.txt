001	——On a certain day in 2018 (FgG Studios)
002	Let's take a peek at the operations team preparing The Alchemist Code's first ever live event...
003	There is a sense of anticipation as the team discusses what the event should include to make sure the fans have the ultimate experience.
004	This event is really coming together! We're well on our way to finishing our preparations for the exhibitions, cafes, and goods...	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0008
005	Indeed. It's amazing how far we've come! Everyone's worked so hard. I'm sure that the players will appreciate what we've done with this event.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0005
006	——Drama! Strategy!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
007	P-Producer?
008	I've been looking for you two. This event plan is lacking the punch to fully immerse people into the world of The Alchemist's Code!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0002
009	It is? I feel like we've already prepared everything we possibly can, though.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0003
010	What draws people to The Alchemist Code is the drama—and the strategy!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0039
011	The goods, the cafe, and the exhibition will help people better visualize the world we've created, but where are the aspects that feature the strategy element of the game?
012	I see! That's what you meant by "lacking".	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0005
013	Exactly. That said...since this is our first live event, I have absolutely no idea what we could do to highlight the strategy side of the game.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
014	Hm... Our Phantom of the Kill game incorporates a lot of opportunities to interact directly with the players, so it's easier to come up with ideas, but...	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0030
015	We mostly interact with players of The Alchemist's Code through the Nico Nico Live video streaming site, so something like that is the only thing I can really think of.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0031
016	Yeah... What else might we do to feature the strategy elements other than releasing high-difficulty quests?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
017	——Aha! I've got it, Designer!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0023
018	Since we're not sure what the players would enjoy, we ought to use Nico Nico Live to tackle the players head-on!
019	What?!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0025
020	That's... I mean, what...?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0029
021	Designer, you'll be participating, of course.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
022	H-huh?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0025
023	——I see... So you meant that we should stream a Multiplay quest on Nico Nico Live in which we are the enemies that need to be defeated.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0044
024	Oh, man... That's a relief. I get it now.	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0030
025	Yes. I think this is the perfect way to solve our crisis! Use Nico Nico Live as a framework to battle directly with the fans.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
026	"The true boss is...Producer?!" is the kind of thing we're going for, basically.
027	I'll be the ultimate boss challenge! Then in exchange for getting soundly beat by my skills, the players will have a chance to get some fantastic rewards!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0008
028	T-that's quite a plan!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0005
029	We still need some element of humor in all this... Like some kind of Alchemist Code celebrity appearance.
030	Ah... What if we introduce a kind of celebrity summoning ability for your character?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0017
031	I-I don't know...	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0025
032	Hm, I don't know how willing the players will be to attack someone like Artist. Maybe we could have her shield us instead?	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
033	I don’t think the ugly tension of "Will the players attack Artist or not?" is the kind of atmosphere we want to promote at our first event.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0024
034	But not only would she be our shield, she would also play a role that supports the players!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0005
035	I-I see...?	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0045
036	We will unleash a powerful Strike when cornered, but players will be able to borrow Artist's ability to save themselves!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0003
037	What do you think? Isn't that a nice support role for Artist? I think the players will enjoy that.
038	I-I would be honored to take on such a role!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0001
039	Wonderful! I know we can rely on you to give the players the best TAC experience they could hope for!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0041
040	Oh, and Designer ought to take advantage of that function which allows bosses to change form during battle! I mean, we developed it, we might as well use it.
041	And you...can do...that.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_battle_0025
042	..."That"?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0003
043	You know. That thing you do whenever we're on Nico Nico Live. That.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
044	What?! I've told you before, that was a misunderstanding!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0014
045	I-indeed! His looks have no bearing on the kind of wonderful partner he is!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0029
046	Artist... What... What are you...?	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0016
047	Umm... Anyway, what about changing your unit's attack type mid-battle? Like, from a magic type to a physical type!
048	I guess that could work...	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
049	Just me left, then... As the Nico Nico Live streaming progresses, I shall do my utmost to become the most powerful villain!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0006
050	I'll make generous use of Cadanova's ability, Dragon Shift, to make the battle especially difficult for the players!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0008
051	And we'll set it up so players have to borrow Artist's strength to defend themselves...
052	And then, once the players have defeated me...
053	You can reveal your special final combined form "Super Producer" that can give out lots of fantastic prizes!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
054	Heh... Perfect! We have to go all out for our first live event!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
055	No holds barred! Let's make the players work for their win against us!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0003
056	Understood.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0037
057	I'll do my very best!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0008
058	Fantastic! I have faith that the two of you can make this Multiplay quest a wonderfully challenging experience for everyone!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0041
059	So... No pressure.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0006
060	D-don't lose heart, Designer! Let's all do our best to make this into an experience people can't forget! I'll do everything I can as well. You're not alone in this!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0027
061	Right...	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0005
062	Right. It's not often that the chance comes around to play the villain. I'll do my best to make it a battle the players really have to fight through!	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0007
063	I can already tell that this is going to be quite the journey...but I think the end result will be really good. This is inspiring!
064	I completely understand! When the time comes, I'll come at the players as their worst enemy!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0037
065	Wait! Hold on! You're there to help the players for this event! So, on that note... I've got a bunch of work ahead of me. I'm going to go get started on that.	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0014
066	——So, in conclusion, this is the operations team's official challenge!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0007
067	We've done our best to scatter hints throughout this little story! I hope they help!
068	Alchemists, accept our challenge and follow the trail of clues we have left for you to beat The Alchemist Code's operations team at their own game!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0041
069	I'll be there to support you as best I can!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_battle_0015
