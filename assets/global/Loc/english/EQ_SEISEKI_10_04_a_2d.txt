001	Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.
002	Mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_chara_1010
003	I recalled that I'd heard of the Vessel of Reincarnation before.
004	What is that you're holding?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
005	It's a document that Lord Commander Zain entrust to me.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
006	There is unique information in here regarding the station of a Lord Commander and other information that must not be released to the public.
007	The Lord Commander's notes!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0026
008	Does it mention the Vessel of Reincarnation?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0044
009	Yes. The Vessel of Reincarnation concerns Nimul and Emmel.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
010	The legendary siblings who created the Tower of Babel...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
011	Yes. According to history, they were the founders of Alchemy...said to be closest to god.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
012	It's not public knowledge, but it has been said that every few hundreds of years their souls are reincarnated, thus returning to this world.
013	Returning to this world...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
014	The founders of Alchemy...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
015	Yes. At least according to what Lord Commander Zain wrote here.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
016	Apparently, Nimul and Emmel will descend in a Vessel that contains a Sacred Stone within their body.
017	In that case...Lion Monarch Orion really is a Vessel of Reincarnation?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0021
018	At least he fits the criteria...that is if the legend is true.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
019	Well, uh...what exactly happens when that reincarnation takes place.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
020	If the reincarnation occurs, the Tower of Babel will ascend to the heavens... They will transcend the gods...eventually bringing about the end of this world.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
021	That's what's written here. I don't know anything beyond that.
022	The...end of this world...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
023	The Tower of Babel will ascend to the heavens...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
024	That's referring to that Babel Ruins in the center of Northern Pride, right?
025	I've heard that those ruins are the decayed form of the former Tower of Babel.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0045
026	That's why Orion's ultimate destination is Northern Pride.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
027	He wants to gather all the Sacred Stones throughout the world in order destroy its equilibrium. Then, he plans to make his long-awaited march here.
028	I-in other words...if he reaches Greed Dike...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
029	This world will end...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
030	No...there's no guarantee that's the case. Think about it...their reincarnation only occurs once every few hundred years.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0039
031	If it was a certain thing, this world would've have been destroyed long ago.
032	Right...but...what does it mean?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
033	According to the secret history written in this document...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
034	When Nimul's Vessel of Reincarnation appears, it has been said that Emmel's Vessel will appear at the same time.
035	Emmel as well?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
036	Yes. Both Nimul and Emmel...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
037	One of the Alchemists will wield the Alchemy of Might and the other will wield the Alchemy of Compassion.
038	The two forces will be like water and oil. They will slay each other and things will continue as they have always been.
039	So Emmel will stop Nimul then?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0005
040	That means...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0045
041	There is a possibility that there is another individual in this world besides the Lion Monarch Orion who possesses a Sacred Stone within their body!
042	You're right...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_chara_1010
043	The countries where the location of the Sacred Stone have not been made clear are Wratharis...and Slothstein...
044	Even if we were to search both countries for the Vessel of Reincarnation...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
045	I doubt we would find out anything in time for Greed Dike's assault, but...
046	Kazahaya, just in case, send envoys to both countries.
047	Understood!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0006
048	I will report all of this to the Emperor. Suzuka, I'll leave matters here to you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0041
049	Got it!
050	The Lion Monarch Orion seeks to destroy the equilibrium of power in this world and, by doing so, obtain Nimul's power.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
051	It seems like this idea of his is more than a pipedream!
052	Meanwhile...in Saga region. The Serenea Prairie.
053	All of Saga is engulfed in a sinister atmosphere.	VO_caida.caida_chara_1004
054	Something doesn't feel right. Is the Matter in danger again?
055	...Uck...ahh...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0018
056	...!
057	...Ack... To-today is really a troublesome day.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0027
058	I never thought a day like this would come.
059	You're that doctor...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
060	Ye...yes... I...it's been a while...Se-Seida...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0046
061	Are you hurt?! Hang in there!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
062	N-no...it's nothing, really... M-my medicine would work...wonders on this.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_1039
063	Please! Don't move!	VO_caida.caida_chara_1011
064	M-more importantly...you should hurry on ahead.	VO_alexis.alexis_event_1003
065	At this rate...the w-water and w-wind factions will be destroyed...as well.
066	What happened to the earth and fire factions?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
067	Th-they're on the brink of destruction...their lights just about to be...snuffed out.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0027
068	What happened to the Spites?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
069	I-it seems their Matter was removed from their bodies. Their lives have been spared...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0042
070	It appears your advice for them to be prepared...helped them escape the worst outcome.
071	Orion...how could he?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
072	U...uck... Th-that's not exactly...correct.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0018
073	How so...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
074	It...it was a man called Sol, all dressed in black, who attacked.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0006
075	Of the Templars...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
076	I-I'm not really familiar...with the Templars you refer to, but...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
077	It appears that several of Gluttony Foss' armies were destroyed singlehandedly by that man.
078	!!!
079	In...in any case...y-you'd best hurry. That red-headed girl who's also from the Holy Guard appears to have been captured.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0018
080	Kagura?! Ack! Where is Sol right now?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
081	He's either at the water or wind factions...	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
082	The Beast Tamer Melda is...appears to be pursuing him, although...it might be too late now.
083	...!
084	C-come...there's no time to waste. I-I'm going to have my hands full...looking after the...wounded.	VO_alexis.alexis_battle_0019
085	Alexis!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
086	...Sol!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
