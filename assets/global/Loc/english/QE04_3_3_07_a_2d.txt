001	The opening has gotten pretty wide. Let's advance forward in a bit!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0031
002	Rega...please, explain yourself. What is going on?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
003	It's simple. I used the power of the wind to generate a mirage which goaded them into attacking each other!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
004	A mirage...?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
005	Yeah! I don't really understand the details, but...something about the wind changing the density of the air or something...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
006	Anyway, right now, the Gluttony soldiers should be seeing each other as the Jam. On top of that...
007	I used this incantation gear Jackal Over to amplify the Gluttony soldiers emotions of anger!
008	Amplify...their anger?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
009	I see. So you fuel their anger and aggression...while showing them a mirage that plants confusion!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0044
010	Oh! Is that how you survived last time as well?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
011	Yep! It becomes kind of problematic if I have to take everyone out, but, usually, it's simple enough to just confuse them and push your way forward.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
012	There are a lot of ways you can use the power of the wind. Tehre taught me.
013	Tehre said that Alia taught him.
014	Alia?! I never knew there were so many ways to use the power of the wind.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
015	Yes...we still have a lot to learn about how to use it correctly. Changing the density of the air...huh? Hyaaahh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
016	Good job. Just create an image of a large tornado in your mind. Now try and make that tornado bigger and bigger.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0023
017	Like...this?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
018	Yeah! That's the spirit!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0024
019	Amazing! The smallest adjustment can make such a big difference! I can feel the wind stronger than ever!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0046
020	Hmm. I'm still not used to it...but, with enough training, I'm certain I'll be able to master it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
021	Yes. We can become stronger! Thank you, Rega!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
022	You don't have to thank me. I'm sure both of you will pick it up right away! All right, how about we go now?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
023	Agreed! Let's advance forward and make our way to Tehre!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
024	All right. That being said, we're going to be advancing our way through that vast number of soldiers. If we let out guard down, we'll be swallowed up amongst those soldiers.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
025	Even if we get separated, our destination is the same. If we lose sight of each other, let's meet up at Port Nahema!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0039
026	All right. Both of you, let's go! This is the moment of truth! Let's advance forward...and make it through alive!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
