001	Ah…my leg!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0024
002	Gotcha!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0007
003	Eve!	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_0019
004	Are you alright, my pet?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
005	…Oh, Fraise.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0047
006	He's carrying her in his arms like she's a princess! I've never seen this in real life before… Oh, and now he put her down!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0024
007	Rest here, darling. I'll end this quickly.
008	My, my…you think you can defeat all of us at once? You'd have guts to go up against just one of us.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
009	Yes. I must protect the one I love.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
010	A knight's strength knows no limit when it comes to protecting others.
011	Ack…	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0027
012	Sweetie...you were incredible!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
013	Whoa! That was totally different than when he was training… So cool!
014	Y-Yeah! He sure is cool! So, I guess you've fallen for him too, Rach?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
015	Say what?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
016	Well…the truth is I love--
017	Hiyaaaaaah!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0032
018	Oof…C-Curse you… Don't think you can do this and get away with it…	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0024
019	I'll file a formal complaint against Envylia. That'll teach you…
020	…! Wait! You can't! He shouldn't be punished for rescuing me!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0021
021	It's alright, my love.
022	N-No it's not! You killed a witch! This is a big deal…
023	Because of me, you're going to be in for a world of trouble…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
024	It's alright. I didn't kill her.
025	You didn't?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
026	Uhhh…
027	I struck them with the back of my sword. That much I know to do.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
028	Actually, weren't they the ones who struck first?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
029	Oof…	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
030	Fraise didn't strike until after you attacked. Which means he was acting in self-defense.
031	…B-Be quiet! First and foremost, what is a knight of Envylia doing in Lustburg?
032	Outsiders will only create conflict in Lustburg. He's no different…
033	On the contrary!
034	It's--	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0025
035	Chloe!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
036	Sorry I'm late. The application for entering the country as an ambassador for the king was a little confusing.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0035
037	An ambassador for the king?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
038	That man is an official delegate of the nation of Envylia--Here are his papers.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
039	…Thank goodness. They finally let him in…
040	Huh? I don't get it.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
041	I see…a partnership between Envylia and Lustburg…
042	Yes. We'd like to enlist your knight's help in protecting Lustburg.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
043	Aren't the witches able to defend Lustburg on their own?
044	…I asked myself the same question. After all, the witches are quite formidable.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
045	However, they are vulnerable to enemies with an immunity to magic.
046	As my associate mentioned, the knights may be able to help them in a variety of situations.
047	Additionally, if we cooperate with Lustburg, we'll be able to learn about that country's magical technology and wisdom.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
048	As a commander of the Royal Knighthood, I'm constantly searching for better ways to protect Envylia.
049	If we can pull off this alliance, we'll be able to defend our country with high level magic.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
050	…Expanding our capabilities of self-defense.
051	…I see. It's true that our magic pales in comparison to Lustburg's. Your proposal sounds audacious, but also intriguing.
052	Closing our borders won't keep us safe. I believe we'll be safer if we remain open and more accepting.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
053	We all want to protect our country, and we can do that without isolationist policies.
054	That's why I want the people of Lustburg to see the knights of Envylia firsthand.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
055	Hmm…
056	...Do you think it's worth a shot?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0031
057	Well, I confess your idea exudes a certain type of idealism characteristic of students…
058	But I think it's worth a shot.
059	…! Thank you so very much!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
060	And that's what happened.
061	R-Rach! You're incredible! You really took the initiative…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
062	If there was anything I could do, I was gonna do it! Well, there wasn't much of a choice, but…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
063	…I didn't want to give up.
064	I wanted to believe that a person's strength comes from not giving up when things get difficult.
065	A person's strength…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
066	…If he is an emissary for the King of Envylia, then we must treat him with respect.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
067	…Please accept my apologies. We welcome you into our country. I will arrange an audience with the queen.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0036
068	…Excuse me! Please wait!
069	Eve…
070	I'm sorry Fraise, my sweet. I got you caught up in Lustburg's affairs and also got you into big trouble.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0035
071	I don't want you to get mixed up in this any further. So…I've been thinking we should break up.
072	But…but...I…don't want to give up on our relationship. Because…I love you!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
073	Maybe you don't love me anymore because you're with Rach, but…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
074	…Huh?
075	I adore and cherish and love everything about you! So, I don't want to let you go!
076	…
077	Um…Eve, my pet. I think you're overlooking one tiny detail…	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
078	Yeah…it's not like that between us.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0030
079	It's not?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
080	NO WAY!!! But…but Rach, you said how cool Fraise was!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
081	I meant…as a knight! And speaking of which, I think Chloe is the coolest of all!
082	B-But, didn't you lock arms earlier?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
083	That was all a performance! Come, on! Don't be ridiculous! Moa would kill me otherwise!	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_0019
084	…I-I see…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0011
085	So that explains it! Geez, I feel silly. Heh heh… I'm so relieved I'm crying.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
086	…Hahaha. I guess I couldn't give up on Fraise even if I tried. I better work even harder.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
087	I'll train longer and harder so that if witches ever have their eyes on Fraise again, I'll be there to protect him.
088	And I'll keep looking for a way to break the curse! And…and…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
089	…Eve.	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1007
090	Eep…! Fraise…?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
091	…Please. Don't try to do everything on your own.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0041
092	Let me help you find a way to break the curse--and help you with all sorts of other things. I want to protect you, too.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
093	…Please don't cry alone anymore. If I imagine you crying, I can't sit still and my heart feels like it will tear through my chest.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
094	Sweet Fraise…
095	And if one day we succeed in creating a world where you and I can be together--
096	Then I hope…you'll spend your life with me.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
097	…
098	I hate to ask so much of you, but…	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
099	…*Sniffle*...*Sob*	VO_eve.eve_sys_0019
100	!? E-Eve, my pet?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
101	P-Please don't cry! Did I say something I shouldn't--	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0049
102	*Sniffle* No, you didn't. I'm sorry, I can't help it. I'm just…so happy.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
103	In that case…I'm glad. Won't you tell me your response?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0048
104	…Yes! Yes, of course! I want to spend the rest of my life with you! *Sniffle*	VO_eve.eve_sys_0005
105	I was starting to worry they weren't coming back, but…I come here to find this. I better shut my eyes.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
106	Isn't it wonderful?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
107	It sure is!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
108	…I don't get why girls love this kinda stuff. I can't take it…	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
109	…Well, at least he's back to his normal self.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
110	I'm really…happy. People's emotions are really powerful, aren't they?
111	…Right, mom?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
112	Afterwards, they both met with the queen as emissaries of the King of Envylia.
113	"It may be difficult for us to join forces immediately, so let us start by getting to know one another…"
114	"I hope we can work together to build a brighter future." In response to Envylia's invitation--
115	The queen said, "If this alliance will increase our safety and prevent hostilities, I see no reason to refuse."
116	And so, Lustburg's closed-border policy for national defense was quietly pared down.
117	Now, the lovebirds can prove their love to one another! Hooray! Hooray!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0008
118	…I can't write that…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0030
119	Hey! Why are you so into my report?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
120	Who wouldn't be--with all those shenanigans?
121	This is the price you pay for all those unexcused absences! Consider yourself lucky.	VO_mor.mor_battle_1029
122	*Groan* At this rate, I might as well write down every little detail and do a special report.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0029
123	If I document all of my latest extracurricular activities, I bet people would love it!
124	Wooooow…I'm sooooo happy for you.
125	Moa…are you mad at me?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
126	Why should I be?
127	I mean, if you would've told me, I would've joined you--	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
128	…Fiddlesticks! I wanted to help Eve, too!
129	I said I'm sorry! I just did what I felt I had to do. I didn't expect it to blow up like this…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0035
130	Besides, if you had been there, things might not have gone as smoothly. International relations are complicated.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
131	Phooey…I guess you're right.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
132	…By the way, Rachel, Eve has looked really happy ever since.
133	Seeing her smile makes me happy, too… So, I wanted to say, "Thank you!"	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
134	My only regret is having missed the scene where they confess their love to each other…
135	…You know, I just realized it, but you and Eve have a similar smile.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
136	We do?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
137	Uh-huh. It's like you can tell you are cousins, or something.
138	…I like your smile, Moa. It cheers me up.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
139	Yeah, right… *Giggle*	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
140	That's why I'm SUPER relieved everything worked out!
141	…Yeah, you did a great job tricking me, but...it's alright.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
142	…Okay! Time for me to get serious!
143	Whoa! What's gotten into you?
144	Today is the first day of the rest of our lives! The world is our oyster!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
145	Just the thought of it gets me pumped! We could discover a way to break the curse…
146	Or begin an apprenticeship under a knight. Doesn't that make you feel excited?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
147	That's what you want to do when we finish school? Don't you want to be a witch?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
148	Just because we graduate the School of Magic doesn’t mean we have to become witches, right? Look at Eve!
149	That's true.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
150	And then there's Chloe--that female knight from Envylia. She's SO cool!
151	I want to be the type of person that forges their own path through life--like my role models!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
152	Lustburg needs more women like that. Don't you think?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
