002	Just a bit more...so don't give up yet, Toritoh.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0003
003	Of course not. I came this far. I'm not going to just give up now.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
004	Give in to me, proud ones.
005	What the—?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
006	If you refuse to give in, then I shall take all that you are!

015	Are you okay, Lakina?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
016	Yes, somehow.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
017	What do we do? At this rate, we'll—	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0029
018	It's all right. I still have a trick up my sleeve.
019	Lakina?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0025
020	My life is but a petty price in exchange...! I'll stake it willingly! Huzzzahhhh!!!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_battle_0001
021	Heh heh. I am a Captain of the Holy Guard...after all.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
022	Watch this. Burn it to your memory! This is my trump card!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0002
023	Burning Seal!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0032
