001	Agh... Impossible...
002	Heh, I learned these skills directly from a Saga soothsayer! If you want some more, I can make a serious effort this time.
003	Wha—? Aaaaahh!
004	Phew...
005	Impressive. So you said you were an apprentice to a famed soothsayer of Saga?
006	Yeah. You heard me, huh?
007	Training with her was tough and ruthless. But thanks to her, I'm much more powerful than before.
008	Oh, she acts tough with her apprentices? Hard to imagine considering how lenient she is with her own personal appearance.
009	What was that?
010	Oh, nothing. Tell me, why did you choose to be said soothsayer's apprentice?
011	Well... That's sort of a long story.
012	Are you not here to visit your mother? Now is the perfect time to share all the details of your time away.
013	That's one way to see it, I guess. All right, fine.
014	After Mother died of illness, that man took me in.
015	But because I had no talent for the military, I was nothing more than an unwanted responsibility to him.
016	He barely even looked at me. Others of the household would only speak to me if they had an errand for me to take care of.
017	Then one day, a soothsayer came to our house. She took one look at me and said—
018	This one's overflowing with Alchemia. It would be such a waste to have him live in seclusion here.
019	Come with me, boy. I'll make sure you gain full control over your powers. Don't you want to be stronger?
020	I was so glad. It was the first time since Mother's death that I felt acknowledged.
021	I wanted to grow stronger. So, for the first time in my life, I told him what I wanted.
022	Well, actually it was more like I made a request. Okay, I begged him to let me be her apprentice.
023	Master even put in a good word for me. He allowed my apprenticeship, but on one condition.
024	And what was that condition?
025	That once I was strong enough to graduate, I would return to Wratharis and use my powers to benefit him and this country.
026	Oh my...
027	That's why I have to go back to him.
028	...
029	Earlier you said you've never thought of stones having meanings, yes?
030	Hm? Yeah...
031	I would like to presume your mother knew the meaning of this stone.
032	An onyx can be a lucky charm. It's often given to children to ward off evil.
033	...
034	And as I've said before, it represents encounters and farewells...
035	I would like to believe your mother wanted you to have wonderful encounters, even after having to say farewell to her.
036	And that her hopes were manifested in the form of the soothsayer finding you.
037	...
038	She must've been lovely.
039	...Yeah, she was.
040	...
041	Hm?
042	Is this the one? This is that noble's grave?
043	Oh yeah, I saw with my own eyes the jewels and treasure being buried with the body.
044	Let's dig it out quick! Not like anybody can spend all that in hell!
045	Wh-what are they...?!
046	How despicable.
047	They tread upon the resting souls of the dead, insulting the loved ones left behind, for the sole purpose of enriching their purses. How wretched!
048	Wretched indeed. I can't let them get away with this in front of my mother!
