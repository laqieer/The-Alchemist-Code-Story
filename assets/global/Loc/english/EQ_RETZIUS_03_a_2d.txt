001	... ...
002	Hey, newcomer! Pay attention! I'm gonna explain the strategy now!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
003	...Oh, right! Sorry!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
004	Listen. Recently, these thieves have been taking extreme measures. We can't predict exactly how they'll act. There may very well be casualties.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
005	However, we do this in order to maintain order in the desert. This mission is nothing more than the prelude, but it is an integral part of our strategy to annihilate these thieves!
006	...!
007	Newcomer, are you listening properly?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
008	Y-yes! I am!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
009	You'd better be. I won't be held responsible for your death. I'm sure the thieves will come at us with everything they've got.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
010	Yes. You really are amazing, bro.
011	Huh?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
012	This is the first time I've experienced what it feels like to risk my life in order to carry out a mission.
013	It's frightening. Yet, he carried out his mission with such calmness.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_1019
014	What's that? Who are you talking about?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
015	My bro.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0007
016	The person you are looking for...is in the desert.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0004
017	Yeah...that's a given. What I want to find out are his exact whereabouts.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
018	There is no need for haste. Stars that are drawn to each other are fated to meet.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
019	But I wanna meet the guy as soon as possible!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
020	The stars say that it is not yet time for your paths to cross. I see. In search of this star...Retzius, you must become a mercenary.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0031
021	A mercenary? Why would I need to do that?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
022	If you were to meet him now, do you think he would make you his disciple?	VO_deneb.deneb_event_1006
023	...Well, I'll beg him until he does!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
024	It is better for you to, instead, polish your strength. More than frantically pursuing him, this the surer option.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
025	Will that really lead to me meeting him again?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0030
026	The stars do not speak more than they must. Of course, whether or not you wish to believe them...is solely up to you.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
027	A mercenary, huh? Now that I think about it, he did mention something about being "hired"!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
028	I do not know how it will take place, but I am certain you will meet him again. The stars guarantee this.
029	So it's the stars who guarantee this, not you, Deneb.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0030
030	My job is only to listen to the voice of the stars.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
031	The stars will guide your way, Retzius. May they bless your journey.
032	Thanks a lot! Once I meet him again, I promise to give you a full report, Deneb!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0033
033	Thank you. However, the thought alone is enough.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0033
034	Here, our stars have met. Someday, I am certain they will cross paths again.
035	All right... Once again, though, thank you so much for everything.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0037
036	That's why...I've gotta meet that bro at all costs! For the sake of fulfilling my promise to Deneb as well!
037	I don't really get it, but just try not to die, newcomer. We begin soon.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
038	I'm going to change. I'm going to become a man that he'll acknowledge.	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0021
039	All right then, our strategy begins! Hurry into formation!
040	I will do whatever I can to make my first mission a success! I believe that each move I make will take me closer to him!	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0011
