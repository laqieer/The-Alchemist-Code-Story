001	There!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
002	Seida, behind you!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0011
003	Ahhh!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
004	Seida, get down!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
005	Seida, are you alright?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
006	I'm fine.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
007	Good.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
008	Mission accomplished. We are victorious!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0008
009	Getting so excited about suppressing the resistance... He really isn't efficient at all.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
010	Lord Zain, thank you for your assistance.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
011	I did nothing. It is Monzein you should thank.	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
012	Mmm... That may be true, but he's so reckless. It really is dangerous.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
013	Yet that fire of his will sustain the Holy Guard. Perhaps it will even help to save the entire world.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
014	I'm sorry, but I simply don't agree. I think that fire of his may even bring danger down upon us.
015	He has you, Seida. I believe I have said that you would make a good pair, have I not?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
016	You have fire in you, too. I think the day will come when you will accept one another... Don't you agree, Zain?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
017	Yes. I, for one, feel safer knowing that we have young people like you around.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
018	Thank you, Lord Zain.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
019	All right! You did well, knights! Let's have a drink to celebrate the success of the mission!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0007
020	It's my treat!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0009
021	Not again... Lady Kaya, please say something to him.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0022
022	The Vice-Captain doesn't have the money to treat the knights like this, but he always does anyway.
023	Heheh, but that's just the way he is. It's not such a bad thing.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
024	What are you doing, Seida?! You're coming, too! Today we drink from dusk till dawn!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0014
025	Haa... Well, Lady Kaya, Lord Zain... I suppose I shall take my leave.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
026	Right...
027	Well, that was interesting.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
028	It was. The seedlings are beginning to grow.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
029	That's why I thought it was a fine time for me to retire... What is it?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
030	I was just thinking... This may be a relatively peaceful time, but the Holy Guard is still very much needed.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
031	I did say that I would step down as Captain and investigate by myself.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
032	No. There are things that I must understand as Lord Commander. Let us hurry.	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
