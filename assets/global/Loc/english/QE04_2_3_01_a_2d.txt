001	Are you...Tina?	VO_rega.rega_chara_1005
002	How do you know my name?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
003	Kiki and Adel told me.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
004	You can speak to them?! Who are you...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	You said you were sent on behalf of Tehre. What do you want with us?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0003
006	Well, I come to you today to...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0005
007	Come on then. Quickly, speak up.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0006
008	Ahh. I can't talk like this!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0029
009	I end up stumbling over my words! No more! Enough of that!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0030
010	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
011	Sorry, Voda, Fuu. I'll stop with the formal talk!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0035
012	I'm not quite sure what's going on. What is your purpose here?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
013	Tehre told me to ask you where Beelzebub is. He says, "Either Voda or Fuu should know."	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
014	And what if we refuse to tell you?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0045
015	He says, "Would you rather have your village destroyed or tell me where the Sacred Stone is?"	VO_rega.rega_sys_0031
016	That brat...!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
017	It appears he's aware of our location as well. There's no doubt that he's working together with the Gluttony army.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
018	I don't want to do either, but...I can't allow these ones to lose their home...the Forest of Rukifojio.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
019	...Gurrrr.	VO_kiki_adel.kiki_adel_sys_0004
020	Why are you with Kiki and Adel?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
021	Ever since I was little, I could understand what animals were saying.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
022	They're all my important friends. Tehre just doesn't get it.
023	He tells me not to hang out with Voda's guardian beasts. "You belong to the Tehre faction," he tells me.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0030
024	That doesn't matter. We're all part of Saga. You're right to think the way you do.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
025	But if I don't listen to Tehre, these animals are gonna lose their home.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
026	That's why...sorry! Can you please tell me where the Sacred Stone is?!
027	That thing is dangerous. It's not something we can easily give up.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0040
028	I don't know which of us are at an advantage in this situation, but I'd really prefer not to be part of this!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0021
029	But it's for the sake of my friends! Once I give the signal, the Gluttony soldiers are gonna come charging down at once.	VO_rega.rega_battle_0019
030	If you're not telling me, I'm gonna give the signal right away and they'll destroy this village! Come on! Hurry up and decide!!!
031	No!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0014
032	Oww...! Huh...? Is that wand...floating?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0042
033	A child like you shouldn't have to do something he doesn't want to!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
034	Let's calm down and talk!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
035	If we talk it over, I'm certain that we can work something out! We'll find a way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
036	...!
