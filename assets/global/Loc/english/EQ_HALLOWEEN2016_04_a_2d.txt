002	Hey... I saw something just now.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
003	Eeek. It really is a ghost... Actually, it's more like the Grim Reaper.	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
004	It's not just any ordinary monster. Be careful, Mia.	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0023
005	O-okay.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
006	Something smells strange.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0029
007	Huh? Elizabeth... Have you already figured it out?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
008	Poison? No, it's more like a medicine... Maybe it's a monster who uses a sleep agent?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
009	Oh dear...what should we do, Woody?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0027
010	Oh also... Don't you think we should keep that child under observation?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_battle_0021
011	Are you a doctor?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0025
012	No. Don't get me wrong though. It's not like I just want to observe the child to see what happens to it.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
013	... ...
014	(Mia's really upset again.)
015	Ehem. Anyway, it can't be helped. We have to take out that monster. Let's go, Mia.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
