001	Where are we?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
002	Proceed with caution; I feel the presence of a Cursed Beast!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
003	The Cursed Beast of Pride!
004	...!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0021
005	Ugh! This wind!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
006	Wait, what...? What is this?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0027
007	What's wrong, Eulalia?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
008	I... I feel Emmel's presence from within the Cursed Beast's magil...
009	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
010	(Has she been absorbed into the Beast, like when we fought Beelzebub?!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
011	Emmel! Stay calm! I'll save you!
012	There's no need for that, Nimul.
013	This was all my idea. Lucifer just agreed to help me with it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
014	Em...mel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
015	Why do you look like that? And, this magil...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
016	After I got separated from everyone at Ire Belt, I wound up here, in this time period.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
017	I talked things out with Quence, opened a dialogue with the members of the Infinite Serpent, and killed their leader, Shahel...
018	All so I could get some time with this Cursed Beast.
019	Nimul, I have...consumed Lucifer.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
020	...What?
021	It was much easier for me to do what I set out to once he'd acknowledged my will—once he'd accepted me.
022	What are you saying, Emmel...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
023	I'm saying that...I'm going to be the one to save this world.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
024	But not through the Ceremony of Creation. I'm going to use myself as a Vessel.
025	Emmel...
026	Who are you?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0003
027	I can't have you interrupting their conversation. They're deciding the fate of the world right now. No one else need be part of that discussion.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0014
028	On the contrary, the weight of this decision is all the more reason to interject!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
029	Then you leave me little choice but to cut you off by force!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0010
030	Eulalia!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
031	I can handle this! Please just take care of Emmel!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
032	Understood!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
033	Emmel... Are you planning to seal all the Cursed Beasts within your body, as a Vessel of Purification?
034	Yes, that's right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
035	You have to know that's impossible! You may have the last Sephira engraved upon you, but—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
036	Even if my soul is protected from corruption, my body—and by extension, my mortal existence—will not be. I know.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
037	I am the Vessel of Purification, after all.
038	Then, why...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
039	Let me answer that with another question, Nimul. How do you plan to save this world?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
040	Through Alchemy. If everyone in world had the protection of Alchemy, there would be no further need to fear the corruption.
041	Alchemy isn't like Spiritbonding. You don't have to be chosen, or have the Sephira carved into you. As long as you have the knowledge and understand the techniques, literally anyone can use it!
042	And just how long would it take for that knowledge and those techniques to propagate to everyone, across all the Belt Regions, hmm? How long until everyone can actually use Alchemy?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
043	Well...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
044	Your heart's in the right place, but you're far too naive. If we did things your way, the whole world would be lost to corruption before the people had a chance to be saved.
045	I'll protect everyone until they can protect themselves! I just need to make use of this power, and—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
046	Access to Invidia Belt confirmed.
047	Access to Ire Belt confirmed.
048	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
049	What...?
050	Do you know how I was able to block your Alchemy just now, Nimul? Despite my power being what it is?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
051	I...
052	I suspect you've realized it by now. If you let that power inside you build up too much, it will destroy you from within.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
053	That's why you've been so careful with it. You've been metering it out carefully so it wouldn't exceed your physical limitations.
054	But what of the people you supposedly want to pass that power on to? Do you think they'll be able to do the same?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
055	Do you think they could live with the constant fear of being ruined by the power inside them? Do you think they could accept that risk and continue living normal lives?
056	From the people I've observed in the various Belt Regions, I do! Most of them are already living with similarly grave risks as it is!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
057	And there are just as many people dying to those risks, every day...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
058	You are simply being too optimistic, Nimul. Not everyone can live like you. Not everyone has that kind of strength...that kind of self-discipline.
059	Deep down, I think you know I'm right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
060	Even when we were looking after Gula Belt, there were so many people who simply couldn't handle the struggle...
061	I remember. Believe me, I do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
062	But people are resilient, on the whole. The point is simply to give them the chance to stand up to these hardships, rather than deciding for them that they won't be able.
063	You can't entrust the weight of the future to idealistic beliefs and faith in your fellow man, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
064	Let me save the seven Belt Regions. Let me be the one to save this world.
065	I'll fulfill the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg's prayers by sacrificing my life as the Vessel of Purification, as I've always been prepared to do.
066	Lucifer understands. He's accepted me. As long as he and I combine our attributes as Cursed Beast and Vessel respectively, we can seal all seven cores—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
067	And what would that accomplish?! Things would be no different than they have been!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
068	I've sworn to change this world for the better, not maintain the status quo!
069	And you will! But it doesn't have to be right now, does it? These things take time. And I can give you that time!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
070	Emmel, you don't—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
071	No, you don't. You don't have to worry. You'll have all the time you need. I know you will.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
072	That's not what I'm—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
073	Grrrooooooaarrhh!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0021
074	Urgh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
075	Nimul, the Beast—Lucifer—is making its move!
076	I'm so sorry, Eulalia. Please take care of Nimu—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
077	Emmel, please! Can't you see how impulsive this is?! Don't you know how unfair this is?!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0018
078	...I can. And I do.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
079	Well, if you're not backing down, then I won't either!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0032
080	Don't be so sure about that!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0004
081	What?! This girl is skilled in a surprisingly large variety of magil for someone of her stature!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
082	My stature?! You're one to talk, shorty!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
083	I'm still growing, I'll have you know!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
084	And you know I'm older than you, right? I pretty much have to be! So why don't you respect your elders?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
085	You're older than me? Really?!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0017
086	Ooh, you're so stubborn! Just like Emmel!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
087	What? Am I really stubborn?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
088	Emmel!
089	Sleep for now, Nimul. When you awake, everything will be over.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
