003	U-ughh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
004	Bertrand! Why do you stop me?!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
005	Enough, Dias! The battle is already over! There is no need to deliver the death blow!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0001
006	Idiot! Are you willing to disobey your orders? I'm sorry, but I have no time to play—
007	I said, enough!!!
008	...!
009	On the battlefield of the Dawn of Wrath, where Wratharis was destroyed, your real sister was killed, wasn't she?
010	Stop it!
011	The reason you rush to rescue Agatha is so that the same tragedy will not be repeated.
012	Most likely, the foundation of your heart is layered with the desire for revenge against the man who killed your sister.
013	Shut up! I told you to stop it!
014	Just listen!
015	Don't you see, Dias? What you're trying to do now is exactly what that man did.
016	!!!
017	Stand still, Dias. Do you want to stand shoulder to shoulder with a coward who would kill a little child?
018	Do you think Agatha or your sister would be proud of a brother like that?
019	...!
020	For whom are you trying to change this world? Perhaps you should take the time to contemplate that.
