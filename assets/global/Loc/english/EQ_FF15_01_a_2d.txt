001	(There's no one left that I can trust to have my back. I wonder how father must have felt when he was called a traitor.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
002	(Father... Why do I keep thinking about him now? I made the right choice. I'm certain of it.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
003	(Yet why do I feel so lost?)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0022
004	(Enough. I must continue onward until I can create a world where Agatha can be happy!)
005	...What do you want?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
006	It seems there's been an incident near the borders of Slothstein and Northern Pride.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
007	My report mentions the appearance of unfamiliar monsters and warriors. There are also disturbing rumors surrounding Slothstein's Sacred Stone.
008	So...you want me to go and investigate it.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
009	It appears that the disturbance was caused by another world's response to Alchemia. It's the Holy Guard's duty to rectify such matters.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
010	...Fine. I'm sure you're planning on sending someone along to keep an eye on me, but I'll go alone.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
011	Very well then. I expect good tidings.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0037
012	(According to the report, it should be around here...)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
013	Dude, wasn't that pretty weird?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1001
014	Huh? Not as far as I can tell...	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
015	Indeed. Something seems odd.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
016	Where are we?!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0026
017	The reception here is terrible. I can't get a signal.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0018
018	What's going on?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_1017
019	...This may be a trap by the empire.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
020	What're we gonna do?!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0028
021	We'll just have to try and find other people.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0011
022	Looks like someone's found us.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0020
023	(Who are they....?!)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
