001	Hmph. I have no recollection of having invited you here. How about you show yourself?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
002	Um...are you talking about me?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
003	Who else would I be talking to...Captain Othima of the 6th Regiment?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0016
004	Seriously? Were you a dog in your previous life? How did you smell me out?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
005	You managed to evade the strict guard of Greed Dike and penetrate this castle.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
006	Honestly, I'm impressed by your abilities.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
007	Not really. I wanted to go about things in a clever manner, but the Special Forces ended up finding me. They really meant business.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
008	Are you telling me that you fought against the Special Forces, the most elite armed forces in all of Babel?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
009	Did I go a little too far? Sorry. You seem frozen in place.<br><br>	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
010	It...appears that I underestimated you slightly.	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
011	More importantly...what is an elder of the Holy Order sneaking around here for?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
012	If those of the Council were to find out, I wonder what their reaction would be.
013	You seem to be making dangerous assumptions. Just to be clear, I am here to observe. There's nothing suspicious about my actions.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
014	Oh come on...save the excuses. I've heard plenty enough already from Seida and Monzein.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
015	Hmph. Aren't you the one that's in a more compromising position?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
016	You're a captain in the Holy Guard who has infiltrated Greed Dike without permission.
017	Furthermore, if you were to have engaged in battle with Greed Dike soldiers, it would be quite the problem.<br><br>	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
018	Are you saying that it'll become a foreign affair? Seriously...you gotta be kidding me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
019	What do you mean?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
020	You lot are the ones who abetted Captain Kudanstein, correct?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0017
021	You really pulled one off, didn't you? Now that the Lord Commander is dead, it's a little too late to be talking about foreign affairs.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
022	Well, that's not a very polite thing to say.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
023	...?
024	What are you talking about? I'd prefer you if you didn't start making outlandish accusations.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
025	Th-the Lion Monarch...Orion!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
026	Emperor Orion...what are you doing here?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
027	Heheh. I would be hard-pressed not to formally greet the wise and famous Captain Othima.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
028	Well, I'll be... So you know about me?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
029	Of course. However, I'm very sorry, but we're quite busy at the moment. Unless you have a pressing matter, I would like to ask that you step aside.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
030	No...I still haven't addressed why I'm here. I came here to declare war.
031	Declare war...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
032	Regardless of appearances, I am actually pretty worked up right now. After all, Commander Zain saved my life.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
033	That being said, it doesn't sit very well with me if you lot get ahead of yourselves and start plotting something.
034	What do you want to say?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
035	This isn't really my type of thing, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
036	Try crossing the line again...I'll kill you. Understood?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0013
037	Y-you, scum!!! How dare you speak to Emperor Orion like that!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0013
038	Oops. Best if you don't move. After all, I could light your emperor on fire right now if I wanted to.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0014
039	As a fellow magic-user, you know what I'm talking about, don't you?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
040	Tsk...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
041	What are you plotting now? It would be in your best interest to spit it out now. Trust me.
042	...Heheh...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
043	What...?
044	Hyahahahahah!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0008
045	Agh?! Wh-what's this?! Pitch-black...magic?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
046	You think you're going to kill me? Do you actually think an incompetent bunch like you are capable of killing me...? Hyahahah!!!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
047	Uck! I-it's strangling me! N-not good!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
048	You're quite the entertaining fellow...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
049	That being said, your overly-entertaining ideas can lead to unforeseen...and perhaps even dangerous results, Waginau.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
050	...Understood.<br><br>	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
051	Phantom soldiers? Is this the power of darkness? I see...you've transmuted them from intense dark powers!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
052	It's time I ask you to take your leave. Attack.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
053	Ack! Moonlit Night!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
054	...!
055	Huff...huff...! Ah, that was dangerous! They almost had me there!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
056	Quite the impressive schemer. It looks like you'll be more trouble than I anticipated. Still...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
057	Huh?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
058	I haven't survived this war-torn world without a little scheming of my own.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
059	Wh-wha...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
060	Scatter, in the name of the Immortal Rose!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0014
061	...!
062	Ca-Captain Yauras...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
063	Honestly. Why are you causing a commotion like this? It's not very proper.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
064	Whoa! You're amazing! And your timing's impeccable! I was in a real tough spot there!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0012
065	Seriously. Try to at least be a little apologetic. Isn't there something you should say after going off and acting on your own?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
066	Huh? ...I love you?
067	...No.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
068	So you're Captain Yauras of the 1st Regiment. I am honored to meet you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
069	I heard that you were seriously wounded by Captain Kudanstein. Has your wound healed?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
070	I profusely apologize for Othima's incredible act of rudeness.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
071	Hey! Captain Yauras?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
072	Owww!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
073	Control yourself! You're in front of the emperor! Hurry up and kneel!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_1002
074	Uck...! Ugh...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
075	You live up to your prestigious reputation, Captain Yauras. Very well-mannered.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
076	That being said, Captain Yauras...does your presence mean that you are here for the same reason as Othima?	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
077	No. Please do not misunderstand my intentions. Othima is just a little confused.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
078	We are here to greet you, Bishop Waginau.
079	Me...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
080	Yes. Currently, the Lord Commander Kanon is making her way to repair the Holy Sword Excalibur.
081	This is the first step towards reviving the Holy Guard.
082	I thought it would best to visit you first, Bishop Waginau, as you were close to the former Lord Commander Zain.
083	What...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
084	Heheh. She's got one over you, Waginau.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
085	Hmph...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
086	Very well. Your business is done here. Take Waginau with you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0045
087	Thank you.
088	Hey...Captain Yauras!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
089	Know your strength. There's not a single chance that we would win in this current situation.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
090	But...we still haven't grasped the whereabouts of Captain Kudan.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
091	Hmph. In tribute to your valor, let me tell you one thing.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
092	Ye-yes!
093	You're looking for Kudanstein...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
094	Apparently, he's headed to the land where Excalibur might be repaired, though I don't know how useful this information will be to you.
095	Huh...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
096	Kudan...is headed to where Kanon and the others are?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0028
