001	Whoa!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
002	All those Jam... Gone. Without even breaking a sweat...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0009
003	I'm here, as well!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0007
004	Glurrrrrp!
005	That power!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
006	I will someday become the Wind Sprite, so you can rest easy knowing that Saga is in our hands.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0038
007	Tamis!
008	I still don't have full control over Matter, but I will master it!
009	Mocca won't be able to leave Saga without worrying unless I do!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0019
010	Total annihilation.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
011	...!
012	Now, Tina... We can finally talk.	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
013	Mocca has told me everything. She's going on a journey to find a cure for her curse.
014	What are you going to do?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
015	I...
016	Like I said before; there is no way that you alone can shoulder the fate of all Saga. Do as you please.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
017	Just know that you did save Saga, so we will lend you whatever help you need.
018	Besides, you are forgetting something very crucial.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
019	Something...crucial?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
020	Yes. You have not saved all of Saga.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
021	What?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
022	Mocca...is a part of Saga.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
093	Until her curse is lifted, you cannot say that your quest is complete.
023	Y-you're right!
024	That's the spirit! But, never forget, Tina...	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
025	You, too, are part of Saga.
026	Mocca is a part of Saga...as much as I am.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
027	Without saving Mocca, you have not yet saved Saga. Can you live on in Saga, knowing that Mocca did not make it?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
028	I wouldn't be able to live like that! I want to live in Saga, hand in hand with Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0039
029	Well, then... The answer is obvious.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
030	Tehre is right. You can leave Saga to us.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
031	You've honored Alia. Saga will soon have its Sprite Quartet again.
032	We must repay you for that honor.
033	I would be relieved if you were by Mocca's side. I'd be able to focus on defending Saga.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
034	We will support the choice you make.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
035	You can leave the Toxotes to me. Know that you've done a deed that moves me to take action.
036	Any objections?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
037	Why...? Why would you all...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
038	We figured you needed a little push to face your own feelings.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
039	Go, Tina... Go and save the piece of Saga that is still under threat.
040	I will get stronger so that Mocca does not have to worry. That's the path I choose.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0001
041	So... Please, walk the path you choose, Tina.
042	I...
043	Is everything here settled already?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
044	Hahahahaha! Too late, Mocca! Saga is safe, even without you! Leave everything to us!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0008
045	Miss Tina...?
046	I...want to go with you, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
047	What?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
048	Please forgive me for leaving Saga, everyone.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0036
049	But I do promise to help Mocca find a cure for her curse...
050	So that I may save all of Saga!
051	Wh-what?! But, Tina... You have your duties as Chief!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
052	I cannot make you take this journey alone. I just don't want you to be alone!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
053	So...I will go with you. That is what I truly want.
054	Tina...
055	Let's go together and find a cure for you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
056	Can we...really?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
057	I can't just leave you to go off by yourself. We are friends, aren't we?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
058	Tina...
059	Let's do this together. Let's see Saga get rebuilt!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
060	Th-thank you, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
061	I'm sure you'll find a cure, Mocca. Come back when you're free of the corruption.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0003
062	Until then...
063	Yeah, I'll be back, Tamis. Until then.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
064	Please take care of Mocca, Tina.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0041
065	You can count on me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
066	I'm so happy for you, Miss Tina.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
067	Thanks Lisbeth. I can face my feelings thanks to you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
068	Won't you come with us, Lisbeth? You'd be a great asset to have.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
069	Thank you, Miss Tina, but I've already chosen another path.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
070	I'm going to stay in Saga.
071	What?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
072	I want to learn how Voda manages her powers. I know that will help me to achieve what I really want to do.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
073	I see, so that's what you meant earlier.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
074	As you can see, there are so many here willing to be there for you.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
075	Go on your journey. You have nothing to worry about.
076	Right! Until the day we return...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
077	Please, take care of Saga!
078	(Father... Please watch over us.)	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
079	(It's difficult for me to leave the land of Saga which I love so much...)
080	(But there is something that I need to do.)
081	(I want to help my friend.)
082	(I will trust in the bonds I've made in Saga, and begin a new journey.)
083	(No matter where I am, my heart will forever be in Saga. I will always feel the winds of Saga.)
084	(This is my home, so please, watch over me, Father.)
085	Badalf!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
086	...
087	I won't see you for a while, but I promise to return!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
088	So keep Saga safe while I'm gone, Badalf!
089	...!
090	Saga, my dearest home, I will sing praises of your deep, green pastures...
091	Until the day I return.
092	I'll be back soon.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
