001	T-take some responsibility!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
002	I'm telling you, Nyx isn't quite at that age yet.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0014
003	Gimme a break...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
004	That's not what I'm saying!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
005	Activating our technique without setting a time or precise coordinates thrust the state of the world into chaos.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
006	Mira and I are from the continent of Babel. Hiiragi's from the...land of Zipangu?
114	Almace and Titania are from a place called Tilhelm...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
007	And I think we're all currently in Babel, judging by the surrounding terrain.
008	This world, though... The places and environs here are different from the ones we know. Maybe we've even come to a different time series.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
009	Of course, this situation was entirely our doing.
010	But we can just remove the indefinite elements and try activating the technique again! I'm sure we'll be able to go home that way.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
011	Indefinite...elements?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
012	Perhaps you are referring to that enormous opponent?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0031
115	Can you explain? When you say you think we'll be able to go home, do you mean...?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0031
116	I shall explain, but later.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0005
013	Neither of our swords were capable of delivering a fatal blow.
014	It was as if there was something blocking our attacks... Some kind of fog or sound barrier.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
015	Tch! We don't have time to sit around talking!
016	Almace... You are wounded. You must rest.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
017	This is nothing.	VO_almace.almace_battle_0022
018	Whatever that thing is... It's definitely a kind of monster.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0001
019	Quick question! What kind of monster?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
020	Well... Back in my world, monsters are the source of all calamity, and it is the duty of kunoichi such as myself to defeat them. It seems to me that the monster who chased me was from my world.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0004
021	You fight those things?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0029
022	Only the kunoichi have the power to take down the monsters. Like it or not, it's something I have to do.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
023	Oh! Hmm... The powers of a kunoichi. So that's why...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
117	Nyx? What're you muttering about?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
118	Nothing. Never mind.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
024	So you believe that creature is from your world?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
025	Yes, but...I've never encountered a monster impervious to so many attacks before.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0018
026	It might not be a monster from my world... Not exactly.
027	...
028	Nyx?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
029	We don't have time to think about this right now.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
119	Can't you hear that?
030	Huh?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
031	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0001
120	I knew it. That thing sure is persistent...and loud.
032	Oh, no!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
033	This is bad! The city...!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
034	Step aside! I'll handle—!	VO_almace.almace_battle_0025
035	Almace, you mustn't! Your wounds haven't healed over yet!	VO_titania.titania_sys_0014
036	So what?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
037	Ah! Time has stopped again!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
121	Mira, did you hear that?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
122	It's giving me a headache!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0043
123	Is that all you have to say?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
124	Is there something else I should be focusing on here?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
125	I guess this works out better anyway... I'm the only guy here, aren't I?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
126	Huh?
038	Haa... Fine. Guess it's up to me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
039	Nyx...? Do you have an idea?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
040	...
041	Um... N-Nyx?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
042	Mira. That was no misunderstanding earlier.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
043	What?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
044	Hiiragi.
045	Y-yes...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0004
046	I love you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
047	...
048	What the...?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
049	I love you, Hiiragi.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
050	Y-you... You... Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
051	From the moment I saw you, I thought you were great.
052	Nyx?! What the hell?! What are you saying?! You're not making any sense!
053	I'm confessing my love.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
054	I can see that! But why?! Why did you stop time for this?! Why are you confessing?! What feelings could you possibly have to confess?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
055	I don't want to hear it. I'm in love, Mira. I've fallen for Hiiragi.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0016
056	Whaaat?!
057	L-l-l-l...
058	I think you might have frozen Hiiragi as well.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0031
059	Seriously, Nyx, what the hell is wrong with you?! Did the long journey do something to your head?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
060	Sorry, sis. Didn't mean to make you jealous.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
061	What the...?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
062	I mean... I've never really looked at you that way before, sis, but...maybe this love I feel for you is something more than brotherly affection?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
063	Nonononononononononononononononononononononononono... No way!
064	I'll straight up disown you! This is... Urgh! B-besides, weren't you just talking about how you're in love with Hiiragi?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
065	I'm just not sure that I can contain this love within myself anymore!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
066	C-contain it! Contain yourself, damnit! I can't believe this... My brother's turned into some kind of space-time-manipulating playboy!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0019
067	H-hey! Vomit up your heart for all I care, but do it later! We need help over here!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0002
127	I am not sure it would be wise for him to regurgitate his vital organs at any stage.
128	It was a figure of speech, Tinnie!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0014
068	Right. My apologies.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0035
069	We need to do something about this monster!	VO_almace.almace_battle_0019
070	Heheh.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
071	You're really brave, aren't you, Almace? I like that about you.
072	Y-you...!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
073	You watch your mouth!
074	My brother is a cheating pervert!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
075	I guess you can't have it all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
076	Tch! You'll be lucky if you don't get my fist in your face!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0015
077	You're so honest. It's...bewitching. It makes me want to do everything and anything I can to make you fall for me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
078	I don't need a disloyal dog like you slavering after me. Go bother one of the other two girls you just confessed to!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0047
129	Is that really for the best?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
130	And why not?! Well, this is neither the time nor the place to be fooling around like this, but what else am I meant to say?! I'm not interested!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0028
131	He's my little brother, for crying out loud!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0043
079	This is no time to be deliberating, you know.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
080	Huh?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
081	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0003
082	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarghh!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
132	My observation and analysis are concluded.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
083	Our Chance Encounter was incomplete, resulting in a mix-up of various elements from various worlds.
084	That enemy was probably something like a by-product of the process.
085	A by-product?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
086	A mass of impure thoughts.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
087	It's embarrassing to admit this, but...
088	It looks like my, er, lovey-doveyness earlier was just that. It's like the Encounter caused all those feelings inside me to just...condense.
089	N-Nyx...?! But you've never showed any signs of...of...of that before!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
090	I guess I must've started feeling that way about you...without even being conscious of it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
091	E-enough! I don't want to hear you talk about this ever again!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
092	That, and... Actually, maybe it was love at first sight.
093	Wh-what?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
094	I-I've got things to take care of! Important things! I don't have time to be fooling around like this!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
095	Besides, why would I want anything to do with you?! Where's your sense of loyalty?! Of devotion!
096	I thought I'd found love, but now I'm not sure who I love, and I feel like I'm losing myself to these feelings!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
097	Nyx... Did you hit your head on the way here or something? You're acting really weird.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
098	It's this love... It's driving me insane. I'm lovesick!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
133	This is bad! This is really, really bad! My brother needs serious help!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0019
134	I'm a love hunter.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
099	If he can resolve his feelings, perhaps we might be able to make some breakthrough here.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0045
100	Fulfill a wish to vanquish it, huh? Maybe that barrier works the same way.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
101	Cause, you know, I'm pretty sure that if you reject me, Mr. Monster will have something to say about it.
102	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0001
103	What a pain in the butt. Looks like it's gonna keep following me until I deal with...whatever this is I'm feeling. Desire? Longing? Curiosity?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
104	If I'm lovesick...then I guess you could call that monster Lovesickness.
105	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0003
106	Whether it was the confused order of the world or of time itself that caused it...
107	Enemies heretofore unknown to the people of this world, and even to Mira and I, began appearing before us, one after the other.
108	Plunging not only the city, but the entire continent, into chaos.
109	This is bad! The city...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_battle_0019
110	This might be a bit of an exaggeration...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
111	But it seems to me that the fate of this continent rests with our love.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
112	L-love...!
113	But you're my brother! My brother!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0043
