001	Wh-what...are they?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0027
002	Humans.
003	What?! Impossible! As Ophioneus explained it, humans are to be the rightful inheritors of our future.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0012
004	Not this writhing mass of... Wait. The quality of the magil within this lot is impressively pure.
005	Not even comparable to what we dragons have at our disposal, of course, but still far superior to the monsters found around these parts.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
006	They had once been criminals guilty of committing grievous sins. Some admitted their crimes, while others denied them. Some begged for forgiveness, while others accepted their fate.
007	And regardless of all that, this is what they all became. Those guilty of sin have deformed into these vile creatures.
008	Is this some special quality of humans? Do they all do this?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
009	Apparently not. I showed one of my trusted students this, and he said nothing like it had ever been seen in the world he came from.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
010	This phenomenon evidently occurs only in those humans who've come to this world specifically, like a contagion spread among them.
011	It's...a disease?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
012	Perhaps not in the literal sense. I have reason to believe our failures in world creation are at the root of this.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0016
013	You're saying the world itself is poisoning the humans?
014	Exactly. Which is why I can't just be sitting on my hands here. I must find a way to cure those who are affected. I need to devise some means of protecting my people from this corruption.
015	But in order to do that, I need time. No matter the cost.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0029
016	Claybelle...
017	So I hope you understand, I haven't a moment to spare helping you with...whatever it is you're dealing with. I have zero interest in Ophioneus' various whims in general.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
018	You should leave, inheritor of the dragons' honor. There is nothing here for you. You'll find only humans, plus a heaping helping of my will to keep them safe.
019	You, who don't even care to understand the humans, much less protect them, have nothing to gain from this place.
020	Fine. You wouldn't mind me looking for Lil in the town, though, would you?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
021	As long as you don't cause any trouble. This is my town. I will not permit any harm being brought upon my people.
022	I understand.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
023	Hmph.
024	Haven't seen his face in so long, I forgot how much he loves to brood.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0030
025	He was genuinely on edge this time around, though. Tormented, even! Ophioneus must really be digging his claws in on something or another. Seems like a royal mess!
026	Now, then, I'd best get back to developing some method of purging this corruption...	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
027	Fallen? Even this far back in time?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
028	This is the first recorded instance of them.
029	This Stratum, which would later become known as Luxuria Belt, represents the very first sin humanity fell to: Lust.
030	As such, it spawned sinful magil sooner than any other region.
031	Though that could be considered a saving grace, of sorts, with Claybelle residing here. She wished to save her humans, and in a sense, she did. She made it in time.
032	She made it? What did she wind up doing?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
033	She was the lynchpin, granting salvation from sin through Cursed Beasts...whether she knew it or not.
034	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
