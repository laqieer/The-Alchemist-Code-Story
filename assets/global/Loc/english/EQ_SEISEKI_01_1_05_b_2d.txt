001	Do you think you can beat me with your meager Alchemy?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
002	A-agh...	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
003	Why do you think I was here in the ruins?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
004	What? W-well...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
005	I'll show you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
006	Ohh! Ah-aaaahhh!
007	Ch-Chloe!!!
008	To store power for the coming battle...
009	...I've been extracting Alchemia Particles from the young Paladins arriving here for their final trial.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
010	Aaaahhhh!!!
011	St-stop!!!
012	Ug...ghh... Captain Vettel...save...me!
013	Did you say...Vettel?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0026
014	Ohhh... Captain Vettel! Captain Cadanova! Help Chloe!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0018
015	Huff...huff...ughh...
016	Are those two here in the ruins?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
017	Huh?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
018	Vettel... That name still makes the wound on my right eye itch.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
019	W-wait! What do you mean by the "coming battle?!" Why are you taking Chloe?!
020	This makes everything simpler. Cadanova and Vettel... If one of the continent's most prestigious knights were to be killed, the Holy Order of Babel would have no choice but to act.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
021	W-wait! Is your plan to start a war against the Holy Order of Babel?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
022	If you do that, you'll destroy the peace in Babel!
023	Tell the Flame Dragon King Cadanova and my nemesis, Vettel, what's happened here. Don't you want to be of some use?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
024	Wa-wait! Let Chloe go! No...! Nooooo!!!
025	I couldn't protect her... I promised! She saved me time and again, and I couldn't even protect her once!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0018
026	Waahhhhh!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0019
