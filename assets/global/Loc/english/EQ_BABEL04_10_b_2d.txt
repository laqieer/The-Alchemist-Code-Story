001	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0004
002	Th-this power...! It's completely different from what she—!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
003	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0032
004	Stop! Leafah, this isn't right! This isn't right at all!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
005	I am not in the wrong!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
006	I am not your enemy! Leafah!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0015
007	I am just! I have done nothing wrong!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0004
008	Nothing!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
009	L-Leafah...?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
010	Ngh?! Aaaaarrrrgghhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
011	Wh-why...? I was so happy!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0043
012	Wh-what was that...energy?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
013	I was so happy to be made general at such a young age.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
014	I thought I was being recognized for my hard work!
015	I thought that I could help people who needed it if I just acted in the name of good!
016	I thought that those who opposed what I called justice were heathens, and evil, and must be taken down!
017	That if I was strong, I would be able to uphold what was right!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
018	Even though my only value was in my ability to learn, I believed that I could become worthy!
019	I believed, and yet... And yet! No one... No one... No one ever—!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
020	Leafah! W-wait! Could this be...?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0020
021	D-Demon's Blood?!
022	But that should only afflict the people of Wadatsumi.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_1028
023	How could the disease have progressed so quickly?! What does this mean?!
024	Aaaarrrrggghhhhhh! Grrrrrrrraaaaaaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0026
025	No! No! No!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
026	Please! Oh please, no! No!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0025
027	I don't know! I don't understand! I've never learned anything!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
028	I don't know anything about countries, or people, or even myself! In this state, I know nothing! Absolutely nothing!
029	Argh...aaaaarrrgggghhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0043
030	This tincture was made from the blood of a demon, procured by the Shiba Senko.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
031	Once injected, it will provide a temporary surge in power, followed by transformation into a demon.
032	Those who are not of Wadatsumi possess no inherent resistance, and will die soon after.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
033	But you will not be alone. Your soldiers will follow you into the abyss.
034	Ngh?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
035	We have prepared an antidote as well—a miracle cure, in fact, using the Demon's Blood within Jin.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
036	If you want to save yourself, you will do as you are told.
037	Arrggghhh?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
038	You will kill the head of the Kagomurasaki Clan. You will kill Yomi.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
039	Aaaaarrrrrrrggggghhhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
040	Leafah! Wait! Leafah, you...!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0022
041	I didn't want to die a child!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
042	I wanted to grow up!
043	I wanted to help so many people, to experience their gratitude, and to make lots of friends!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
044	I wanted to be recognized for my deeds! I wanted to become a worthy adult!
045	I wanted to be on the side of justice!
046	That was all I ever wanted!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0043
047	Aaaarrrgggggghhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0028
048	Ngh...nnnnggggghhhh...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
049	I don't...want to...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
050	I don't want to...be a...demon—ngh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0025
051	...
052	I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
053	Yomi!
054	Leafah...
055	H-help...me!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
056	Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
057	Leafah.
058	We're friends, aren't we?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
059	With one swing of Sumeragi...
060	I will release this sealed blade, passed down in the Kagomurasaki Clan for generations.
061	Sumeragi is a sword for demons, but my sealed sword is for humans.
062	Nnnnngghhh! Urrrrrrrgggghhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
063	I don't want to die! I don't want to turn into a demon!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
064	With this secret technique...
065	Taste the sealed blade, Kagomurasaki...
066	Grrrrraaaaaaaggggggghhhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0025
067	And be gone!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
