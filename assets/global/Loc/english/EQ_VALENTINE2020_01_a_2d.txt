001	Wait, so I have to take this huge load of cacao all the way to Lustburg? You've got to be kidding me.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
002	You have it wrong, Itsuki. You're not just taking it with you, you're protecting it as well. It's a very important mission.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
003	That's even worse!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
004	Well, there's no way around this. Trouble always seems to find the Rainbow Cacao.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
005	Something always happens, almost like clockwork. Oh right, it's your first time with us, Leafah? It would make sense that you wouldn't know.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
006	I know just how dangerous the Rainbow Cacao is. Don't look down on me!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
007	Each color has a different effect, but the Purple Cacao is an especially dangerous substance because it charms monsters and people alike, causing them to lose control of themselves, right?
008	Whoa, you sure know a lot—for a kid.
009	I just look young!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_2006
010	And of course I'd know at least that much. Ever since I became the General of Greed Dike, I've spent my days and nights studying.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
011	The General of Greed Dike...
012	Looking like that?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0006
013	This isn't my usual attire! I was told it wasn't acceptable for Valentine's Day, so I ended up with this!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
014	Anyway! We've all done this Valentine's stuff many times already, so if you need help, just ask.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
015	I'm Noah. Over there's Emma.
016	I'm Itsuki! Nice to meet you.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
017	I am Suzuka.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_chara_1001
018	Suzuka...
019	...
020	Ah!
021	Hm?
022	N-nothing...
023	Hmm?
024	(THE Suzuka?! I didn't even notice because her clothing doesn't seem very Wadatsumi-like at all.)
025	(I've only heard of the stories of that battle, but she was not only a part of it, but lived to tell the tale. An actual Wadatsumi samurai...)
026	(...)
027	We are taught that Wadatsumi is a heretical land, plagued by evil ideas.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
028	Evil ideas?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
029	We are taught that it is a land of fanatical heathenism and savagery, a land where violence is used to encourage adherence to tradition.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
030	It is said that they will happily kill even their own blood for breaking tradition. Just like you are trying to do now.
031	How dare you! You're the savages who are all too happy to turn a blind eye to your past!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0012
032	What did you say?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
033	You took our country from us!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0013
034	?!
035	...
036	Something the matter? Is there something on my face?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
037	Huh?!
038	Ah! Ahem! I-it's nothing!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0011
039	I see. That's good.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
040	U-um...
041	Time is running out. Let us make haste.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
042	Hmm?
043	Something wrong, Emma?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
044	Hmm. Doesn't Suzuka look kind of scary?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
045	Whoa...
046	I'm sure she's just on alert for our mission. We can't let our guard down either.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
047	Uh, I think that it's something else, but...okay.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
048	...
049	I've heard reports of monsters infesting this area. Stay on your toes.
050	Hey Noah, what kind of chocolate do you think would be good this year?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
051	Emma, do you listen to what people say?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
052	Last time I included a single spicy one, remember? So I was thinking this time around I'll put a suuuper sour one in! Wouldn't that be so funny?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
053	Don't you dare!
054	I've prepared lots of red pepper for making chocolates!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0002
055	Your love of spicy food is impressive as always, Itsuki.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
056	Yeah, this time I'm gonna make it even spicier than the last!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
057	Well, it's fine because you actually like it that way, but you, Emma, you cut it out.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
058	Aw, okay.
059	...
060	Oh...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
061	(I'm sure in Suzuka's eyes, I'm probably the last person she wants to get to know, being the General of Greed Dike...)
062	(I was able to befriend Yomi, but a lot of things had to go right for that to happen.)
063	(Nothing I can do about it given the circumstances. However, I can prevent our current situation from getting worse if I'm careful.)	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
064	...
065	What about you, Leafah?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_chara_1005
066	Yeah... Wait, what? Uh, s-sorry. What were we talking about?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
067	We're talking about what kind of chocolates to make for Valentine's Day this year!
068	Make?
069	We were talking about how after we're done with this mission, we're all going to make chocolate for each other!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
070	Geez, didn't I tell everyone that there are monsters everywhere in this area? Yet they act like nothing's wrong...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
071	Don't act like you're not super excited as well, Noah.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
072	I never said I wasn't.
073	Huh? Make chocolate? And what do you mean by giving it to each other?
074	I can't wait as well! The best thing about Valentine's Day is giving the chocolates you made to all of your friends!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
075	I'll make sure to give you some tasty chocolate too, Leafah.
076	Huh? Chocolate for...friends?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
077	You know about Valentine's Day, right?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
078	O-of course I know!
079	It's the day you give chocolate to someone who you have romantic feelings for! Of course I know about that! I read about it in a book!
080	B-but I didn't read anything about chocolate you give to just friends. That wasn't in any book I've read.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
081	W-well, a glorious general such as myself doesn't usually deal with childish traditions such as these...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
082	You say that, but I can tell you really want to be part of this as well, don't you?
083	What?! N-not at all! I never said anything of the sort!
084	I haven't said that I want to give chocolates to Yomi because we're friends! Or that I want to give all my friends chocolates because I like them a lot! Or that I want to be included in that at all!
085	I have not said anything of the sort!
086	Okay, Leafah, calm down. You just said it by the way.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
087	Uwaaaaahhh! You're wrong!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0026
088	I was just wondering what kind of chocolate Yomi would like!
089	...
090	Wh-what?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
091	No, I was just listening to what you said and it made me think—you two really are close.
092	I-is there something wrong with me being friends with her?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
093	No, none at all. I was simply surprised.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
094	I never would have thought that a person from Wadatsumi and a person from Greed Dike could ever have anything resembling a friendship. It is very...surprising.
095	That's...
096	...
097	Oh? It's getting awkward again?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
098	It doesn't look like anyone's upset this time though...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
099	Can you not say that while looking at me?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
100	What!
101	Oh no!
102	Whoa! There's so many of them!	VO_emma.emma_battle_1017
103	Geez, I've been saying that there are a lot of monsters here!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
104	Urgaahhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0019
