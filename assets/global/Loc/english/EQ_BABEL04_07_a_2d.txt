001	In my dream, a voice rings out.
002	The only way you can serve this clan is by putting a child in Yomi.
003	The head of the family can only be succeeded by male heirs. That is our way, our family code.
004	Unfortunately, Yomi is the only child that my wife has given me, and you are nothing but a concubine's spawn.
005	This is the only way to ensure the potency of our family's bloodline.
006	Father, I-I... No... I cannot do that!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0020
007	I am the head of this family! By disobeying my will, you forsake your place in it! If you will not do what I say...
008	Out of my way! The only choice is for me to take this into my own hands!
009	Father! Stop! Please, she is your own daughter!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
010	Daughter? Mine?
011	This here is nothing more than a vessel to carry on the legacy and code of this clan. Do you not see?
012	Yes... A vessel... A cradle!
013	F-father!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
014	I could take care of this myself. It does not matter. It could be any of the Kagomurasaki men I've gathered this day.
015	Yomi must bear a child!
016	Y-you mean to have all of them have their way with her?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0021
017	You've gone mad!
018	This is a despicable, disgusting thing to do! It's...deplorable!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
019	Please! Rethink this!!!
020	Enough! Silence!
021	I feel hands take hold of every part of me.
022	St... Stop!!!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0028
023	That's when my body rises of its own volition, disregarding my will to cower away.
024	Whose memory...is this?
025	That which takes control of my body devours the corruption and hatred that fills the room.
026	It takes my father's blade and wreaks death upon all who are there, including my father.
027	Is this...me? This isn't something I remember, though.
028	Uggrraaah!
029	There I am, howling like a demon.
030	Below me lies my father, wounded and immobile.
031	I raise my blade to end his life.
032	A moment before I bring it down, another blade thrusts through my father's body.
033	I-I apologize, father!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
034	Jin! Urgh! Y-you...!
035	I cannot let my sister kill her own father!	VO_zin.zin_sys_1019
036	Killing your own blood is the worst mortal sin we can commit!
037	I shall carry the shame of that sin!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
038	That which took over my body awakened for only a moment, for my young form is still too frail for it to do its worst.
039	This memory, which belongs to that thing...
040	It fades as I watch my brother slaughter my father and all those who come to his aid.
041	Jin...? What are you doing, brother?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
042	You killed everyone?! Killing your own blood is the worst of all mortal sins! Now I have no choice but to kill you!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0020
043	Prepare yourself!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
044	Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
045	Yomi, wake up! Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
046	J-Jin...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
047	Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
048	Is this...a dream? Is this...real?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
049	It's all real. You still live!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
050	Jin...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
051	Why are you...so hurt?
052	I'm fine. There's nothing to worry about.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
053	...
054	Why...did you kill father?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
055	What...?
056	Why did you commit such a horrible sin? Why did you leave without saying anything?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
057	Why...? Why did you leave me?	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_1028
058	I...
059	It's just as you say.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
060	All of this...was my doing.
061	I...see.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
062	Urgaaaaaaah!
063	The Discarnate Power?! How?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
064	How...dare...you!
065	N-no!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0028
066	It's trying to merge with her to drain more Chakra?!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
067	Urgh... Ugh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0024
068	Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
069	Jin?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
070	Hey, demon, over here.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
071	Take me instead. My life, in place of Yomi's.
072	Stop! No!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
073	Yomi is not the only person here with Kagomurasaki blood. It shouldn't bother you if I play host instead.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
074	What good does it do for you to sacrifice yourself like this?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
075	None of us here have the strength left to fight this monster.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
076	Save one.
077	Wha—?!
078	Jin, wait!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0040
079	Jin?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
080	I want you to be the one to kill me.
081	No... No!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
082	But...	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
083	I... I...!
084	Uuaaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0028
085	Jin?!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
086	It's time, little sister.
087	Jin... I...
088	It is your intention to kill this man, is it not?
089	I...
090	You're right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
091	Yomi, you're...? Sumeragi!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
092	Sumeragi, take my blood and awaken the demonic power within me!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
093	Y-Yomi! Jin is—!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
094	I know.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
095	What?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
096	I saw it all in my dream, but it was a memory, after all.
097	All that hatred dredged up from the distant past...
098	Long have I awaited this moment.
099	Today's meeting, like the blue moon, was fated since the events of those bygone days.
100	And now, we fight.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
