001	Aaaaaargghhhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
002	There's nowhere left to run. Give me back Grraw, now!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0012
003	C-curse you... If I wasn't injured... It's all this mongrel's damn fault!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
004	My reputation as a gladiator is ruined thanks to this bloody devil. I'm gonna have to withdraw from the match in order to recover.
005	I thought these mutts were here to bring us glory, make us look good. If they can't even do that, then they should at least make themselves useful as hide and meat!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
006	Grrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
007	Die!
008	No! Grraw!
009	Watch out!
010	T-Teona!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
011	Hrgh... Huzzzaaaah!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0007
012	Argh! S-so fast...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0020
013	If you cannot acknowledge your opponent as your equal, then you are unworthy of fighting in the Colosseum. You have nothing of worth to offer our audience.
014	Matches aren't meant to be fought alone. A good match, an exciting one, is one fought by two warriors who hold mutual respect for one another.
015	It was my brother who taught me that.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
016	I...!
017	Equals...
018	...
019	(I didn't think I'd ever find myself liking a gladiator, regardless of who they were. They've done nothing but hurt my family...my darlings. No gladiator has ever shown them so much as an ounce of kindness.)	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
020	(Still, I can't help but wonder...)
021	(Have I really been fair? Have I truly been viewing humans and beasts as equals? Perhaps not...)	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
022	Gladiators these days don't show any respect to the beasts and turn their noses up at us trainers. They think everybody else is beneath them!	VO_lotia.lotia_battle_0019
023	(But I don't think I could ever befriend a gladiator. Not after this...)
024	Listen to me, Lotiyah. You must treat those around you equally and with kindness.
025	So long as you do, then surely...you will be able to understand one another.
026	...
027	Zeno...
028	Uff...
029	Grraw?
030	No!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
031	Ungh!	VO_lotia.lotia_battle_0019
032	Lotiyah!
033	L-Lotiyah... Why...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
034	Regardless of one's reasons, no battle should be fought without mutual respect.
035	That is how I train my beasts! As their trainer...and as their family, that is how I raise them.
036	Even if you are their opponent...it is no different.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
037	...
038	Zeno told me once that to you trainers, these beasts you care for and discipline are...family.
039	He also said that...it doesn't matter who you fight. Everyone is important to someone, so you should respect all those you go up against. For that is the duty of a gladiator.
040	...
041	I admired your brother so much. He's the reason I became a gladiator in the first place, you know. I guess I forgot that somewhere along the way.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
042	Grrw...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0021
043	I'm gonna make my peace with him, and with you and yours, in the Colosseum.
044	Fowow!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0001
045	...
046	It seems that he has some sense of honor after all. I, for one, am looking forward to the next match.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
047	Right...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
048	U-um... Thank you so much!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0033
049	I'm still not sure why you helped me, though... No one's ever lifted a finger to do anything for my darlings before!
050	Why, I thought that would be obvious. What kind of friend would I be if I didn't help you when you needed it?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
051	I-I...
052	I see... So that's the kind of person you are.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
053	I'm sorry?
054	(Teona treats those around her equally...and with kindness.)
055	(It doesn't matter that she's a gladiator. I know I can definitely be friends with someone like her. There's no need for me to hold back any longer!)	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
056	(Maybe I can even learn how to be more like her...)
057	By the way, did you know that a new cake shop opened up around here recently?
058	What? Really?! I had no idea!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
059	Heheh. I only heard about it a short while ago myself. I still have to find out the exact location, but when I do, why don't we go together?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
060	I'd love to! Ohh, I've always wanted to do that! Sharing cake with a friend...!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0008
061	You don't know how happy I am to hear that. It's been my dream to go on a cake date with a friend for so long. Heheh!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
