001	That over there, is that...?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0027
002	...!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
003	So it was you, Adaleigh. You've gotten so big.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0009
004	Why? Why are you talking to me as if things are normal?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
005	At least look a little surprised!
006	Well, from where I'm standing, it was an easy guess.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
007	Quence's wish was to return the past, after all.
008	No matter how that turned out, there was a chance that the future you would run into me.
009	This happening was accident, though.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
010	Was it now? So Quence's pitch failed, huh?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0020
011	Well, he was never good at talking. He's a talks a lot, but the important bits never get across.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
012	That's mean. Wasn't he your comrade?
013	It's because he was my ally that I know.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
014	We may have had the same views, but we didn't share the same goal.
015	We were just using each other.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
016	Do you know how I can get back?
017	Well, well, well. You'd still ask me that? Even though we're destined to be enemies in the future?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
018	That...may be true, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
019	Why did I even get sent to this time in the first place? Didn't Quence want to go to a time before the Cursed Beasts were created?
020	Well, I do know the theory behind Space-Time Manipulation.
021	This is just a guess, but the foundation of Quence's spell is in thoughts of the past.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
022	Thoughts?
023	Yes, thoughts. Feelings.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
024	Lingering attachments and regrets from the past. The harder he wish to change the past, the stronger the spell becomes.
025	But if those thoughts suddenly got interrupted...?
026	Something happened and Quence let go of his control over the spell?
027	Yep, or at least, that's what it looked like to me! And that resulted in you all getting pulled into the time periods of your personal, lingering attachments.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
028	So that's the position you're in right now. It may be a hypothesis but I'd bet money on it.
029	Did you want to see me that much, Adaleigh?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
030	Of course I'd want to see my family.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
031	I may be family...but I'm dead and gone, you know.
032	You haven't died yet, though.
033	I might as well be dead. The second you got swept into this time as you are...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0039
034	That's the moment my loss was decided.
035	Congratulations, Adaleigh. You've won our very first sibling squabble!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
036	That so?
037	You're leaving already, Adaleigh?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
038	Yeah...
039	I'm all tired out trying to convince my hard-headed sister.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
040	You really have no interest in changing the future.
041	'Course. Adaleigh, I've already got a plan all set up until my death.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
042	No matter what I choose, where I get tripped up, or how I die, the result stays the same.
043	Because there's no way I, the great genius Icona, haven't made the best decisions!
044	That's why what happened was the optimal result, Adaleigh.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
045	.........	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
046	Ugh, are you crying again? Then, because I'm nice, I'll comfort you all you want.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
047	I'm not gonna cry. I've cried enough as it is.
048	I see. Then, you know what to do now, right?
049	Of course.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
050	I'll keep moving forward no matter what happens, and never give up.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
051	I'll continue to believe there's a bright future ahead and keep going!
052	Good! Then...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
053	I'll see you later, Adaleigh. I'm looking forward to your souvenirs.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
054	I thought I told you that I'm moving forward into the future.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0039
055	I can't keep looking back and trying to return to the past.
056	That's my brother!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
057	Huh? Whoa!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
058	Oh, that voice belongs to...
059	It's you, Nimul!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
060	This is Invidia!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
061	Um...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
062	Isn't that good? You made it all this way without defeating Satna and Leviathan.
063	Yeah. I mean...no?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
064	It's true that I thought I might be able to change things if given the chance.
065	But I also thought that if I did so, my adventure with all of you wouldn't have happened.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
066	Andechs...
067	I really am heartless... Have I disappointed you?
068	Not at all.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
069	After all, I thought the same thing, that I wouldn't want our trip to have never happened.
070	I suppose that makes us failures as knights.
071	Probably. Still...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
072	We have to protect what comes after this.
073	Right!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
074	Huh? Where are we?
075	I don't know...but I'd never be able to make heads or tales of this whole situation with my brain anyway.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
076	Which is why we'll jump in first and think about the rest later!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
077	What?! Ah, w-wait for me!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
078	Haha! Just like I thought! My intuition never lets me down!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0008
079	Oh? This presence is...Nimul's?
080	Ah, but what fun!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
081	Being in the Forest of Suga, my hometown, back before it fell to corruption...
082	It's probably being rebuilt as I speak.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
083	I'll make sure it returns to its former glory one day.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
084	Just as I thought... That is Nimul's voice I'm hearing.
085	I'd better go, then.
086	I'm sorry, Ambrosia, for always making a mess of things.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0036
087	Don't worry about it. I have a lot of free time. Although...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
088	Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0004
089	They just keep on coming! Probably because this place has so many people!
090	Yeah, this is just like when Belphegor ran amok. Was it different for your region?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0030
091	Well, I was the only person left in the Luxuria Belt Region when it happened.
092	Oh, sorry...
093	You saying sorry just makes me more upset about it, you know?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0012
094	Well, I guess it's time to bring out the big guns.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
095	Whoa, is that...a staff?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0025
096	Heh. It's Libra 2.0. I figured it was about the time my idiot apprentices would break the original.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
097	Since I can't charge it with magil or anything, I can only use it to support my Space-Time Manipulation, anyway.
098	"O time! Flow on! Forever and ever!"	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0001
099	Wow!
100	Now, motorcycle man! Drive right into them!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
101	Well, since you invited me so nicely.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
102	I'll send them flying!
103	Now, that just leaves...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
104	Waaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0025
105	Aaaaaaahhhhhh!
106	.........
107	Ow, ow, ow... My control slipped.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0042
108	It was a mistake to leave the coordinates to you, huh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
109	What are you talking about? You were the one who misread the transfer point coordinates!
110	Uh-uh, we prepared a flight spell, remember? You just used too much magil, so it didn't work!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
111	You always have to have the last word, don't you?
112	That's because I'm always—
113	Aaargh!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
114	Ouch!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0043
115	Sheesh, I worried about you two for nothing.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
116	.........
117	.........
118	Ambrosia?!
119	Perish. Perish. Perish!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
120	Tch! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
121	Together! "Thus I am shapeless!"	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
122	Its attacks are so powerful! Without an opening to get close, even if we had Gears of Judgement...!
123	Then, there is no choice but for me to act as a shield so that we may push forward.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
124	No, you can't!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
125	Don't forget, Lord Kubera, that Mammon's corruption can make even dragons fall!
126	If a human were to be hit with it, even you would become a Fallen before you could swing your sword!
127	Ah...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0045
128	So you endeavor to protect yourself as well as the lives of others. Then, this is a surpassingly difficult fight indeed.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0046
129	That's exactly why we can find other ways forward.
130	Oh?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0044
131	I can feel it... The will of my allies, who are fighting just as we are, beyond the gate.
132	(I haven't made it to this point by fighting alone.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
133	I was supported by many people, and met tons of others who helped me grow stronger, and...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
134	Nimul!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
135	Nimul!
136	Nimul!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
137	Nimul!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
138	I can hear them. The seeds of hope are waiting for me behind the gate. Which means...
139	"I extend a hand within myself!"
140	"I am the key! If there is no key to open the Gate, I will surpass time and space! And draw those bonds to me once again!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
141	Cease your useless struggling!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0019
142	Apologies for taking so long, Nimul!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
143	But we made it just in time for the climax! Right?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
144	Daphne. Andechs.
145	My apologies for making you wait, Nimul. I had a wonderful dream, so I am now in rather high spirits.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0007
146	Eulalia!
147	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0020
148	Hehe! If you're talking heavy hitters, I'm here, too!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
149	Adaleigh!
150	And don't forget about little ol' me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
151	Nimul! Leave limiting the Cursed Beast's movements to us!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
152	Lord Kubera...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
153	Understood!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
154	Nngh!
155	With my blade and all of my being!
156	I will slay you here and now, Beast!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0032
157	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
158	What?!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0025
159	The Gear of Judgment...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
160	It...broke!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
161	It is laughable how unprepared you are! You thought that would cut through my sin?! That weak work?	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
162	This is the end result of greed! Fall, Kubera!
163	Heh.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
164	Has your imminent death caused you to go mad?
165	The sword, Taurus, that blacksmith Yna Ku forged is composed of two blades! Which means...
166	I've been waiting for an opening like this!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0001
167	What?!
168	This gear is the mark of my determination! No matter the time or place!
169	The gear forged by my hand will exterminate all evil!
170	Even if it's not strictly true of the now, I swear that one day I will be called a blacksmith who can achieve this!
171	This blade is proof of that!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0007
172	Grrrraaaaaarrrrgghhh?!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0028_b
173	Cursed Beast Mammon has been stripped of sin! Everyone, move out! We must end the dreams of this Cursed Beast here and now!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
174	Now experience the full power of humankind, Mammon!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
