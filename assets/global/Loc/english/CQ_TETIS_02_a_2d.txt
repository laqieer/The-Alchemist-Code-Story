001	Nice! I didn't think you'd be so powerful, Miss! I mean, you look so lovely and genteel!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0044
002	You...are not afraid of me?
003	What? Why would I be?
004	You’re awesome! You can do stuff no one else can!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0046
005	You were so glorious while you were fighting—like something legendary! Like a mermaid or something!
006	Hmhm. You're an interesting one.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0007
007	Thank you for warning me of the danger. Now, if you will excuse me...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
008	Erm... Why are you following me?
009	Huh? What kind of question is that? A disciple should always follow their mistress! Duh!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0025
010	I'm Milis, by the way! Looking forward to learning from you! Uh, what was your name?
011	Disciple...? My name is Tethys, but I certainly have no need for a disciple! In fact, it would be rather more of a burden. Why on earth do you want to be my disciple?
012	I wanna be a lady, just like you! Miss Tethys, you've got a, uh... A kind of gracefulness! I want to learn how to be like that!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
013	Well, I'm sure there are many other people out there who could teach you.
014	No way! It has to...	VO_milis.milis_sys_0004
015	Oh... Heheh! I didn't get to eat my food, so now I'm super hungry!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0011
016	Your food? Are you talking about that monster? You were going to...eat it?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0025
017	Of course! It's delicious!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
018	I apologize. I dropped it into the ocean without even consulting you...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0035
019	No, no, it's fine! You didn't do anything wrong, Miss Tethys! I should have said something earlier!
020	Eheheh...	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
021	Of course! I shall treat you to a meal! It is the least I can do.
022	Afterwards, I truly hope that you will have reconsidered all of this disciple nonsense.
023	Food?! You're going to treat me to food?! Yesss! Let's go!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0009
024	Did you even hear me? I was saying some other rather important⁠—wait!
025	Look at all these restaurants with such delicious looking food! Are there any places that make dishes with water lizards? No? Oh! Meat! I want meat!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0023
026	I-I'm...uncomfortable in such a crowded, dirty place. Why don't we go to one of my favorite restaurants?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
027	Look at that sign! It's got a huge picture of meat on it! It's gotta be good! Let's go there!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
028	What? O-oh, well... I-if you insist...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0025
029	(I suppose since I'm treating her, it would be quite rude of me to insist going elsewhere. Hopefully she will be satisfied with this and then I can go straight home. Alone!)
030	Oh, dear. Perhaps it would have been better to go to the restaurant I suggested. Nothing here looks...sanitary. I am not sure that it’s safe for me to touch anything...	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0022
031	Tethys, aren’t you gonna order anything? This is really yummy! Try it!
032	Erm... No, thank you. I am very grateful for the offer, but I must refuse.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0025
033	Well, well! Do my eyes deceive me, or is that the lady of the sea herself? I've only seen you from far away during ceremonies ‘til now, but you're quite pretty up close, eh!
034	Heh, get over here and pour us a drink, Miss Mermaid! Let's share a drink together!
035	...
036	What's with that attitude? You ignoring me? You think you're better than me, monster girl?
037	Urk! Please, stop this! Let go!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0016
038	Hey! Stop that! How dare you lay your hands on Miss Tethys! Monster?! You clearly don't know anything about how to treat a lady!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0014
039	Huh? And who are you?
040	I’m Milis, and I’m Miss Tethys' disciple! If you wanna mess with her, you’re gonna have to go through me first!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0016
041	Hah! Fine, then! Let's see you try to take me on!
042	Milis! This is terrible! Why has it come to this?!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0030
043	Milis! Are you all right?!
044	Tethys! You didn't have to come out! Just wait inside, I'll be back in a jiffy!
045	I could not do such a thing! All of this is my responsibility, not yours!
046	Now you two are fighting? Ridiculous. I’m gonna sweep the floor with you, no matter how many of you there are!
