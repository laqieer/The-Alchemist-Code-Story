001	I've arrived...how nostalgic. Yet, I can no longer feel such emotions. This is the place I once called home.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
002	The ruins of Wratharis nobleman Gadd Nash's manor...
003	Father, it's time for your medicine.
004	... ...
005	Ah, thank you, Dias. And you too, Yuffie. You too really get along well, don't you?
006	Yeah! Because I need to protect Yuffie!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0045
007	I see. You're still thinking about that village, aren't you?
008	Don't worry. No one will hurt you anymore. Dario and I will protect you.
009	Because you came to that village, father, Yuffie and I weren't separated.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
010	I promise to pay back the debt I owe you for taking me and Yuffie in! That's why I want you to get better quickly, father.
011	...!
012	Thank you, both of you. Ah, the amount of medicine seems to be increasing.
013	Father, can I have a moment? Sir Crowley is here.
014	Oh! Captain Zeke, let him in right away.
015	Understood. Dias, Yuffie, come here. Thanks for bringing the medicine.
016	All I did was carry the medicine that you bought, Dario. You don't need to thank me for that!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0047
017	Dias, you're a good kid. Ah. Need to bring in the guests. Say hello to Lord Crowley.
018	Ni-nice to meet you! My name is Dias. This is my sister, Yuffie.	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
019	...!
020	Yuffie can't speak. Please forgive the rudeness.
021	Don't worry about it. You two have very clever-looking faces. Logi, introduce yourself.	VO_zeke.zeke_event_1012
022	All right!
023	I'm Logi Crowley. Nice to meet you, Dias! Yuffie!
024	Well, we'll take our leave then. We don't want to push father too hard. Please look after him, Lord Crowley.
025	Ah. Gladly.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0037
026	How are you feeling, Lord Gadd?
027	Thank you for coming all this way. I don't think it's anything serious, but my age is my age...and I don't seem to show any sign of healing.
028	If I were to lose you, Lord Gadd, it will have quite the adverse effect on the recovering Envylia.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
029	This may be a cruel wish, but, for the sake of the people, I do wish you live long.
030	Heheh. I never thought I would hear such kind words from the man once feared as the Blood Wolf Zeke.
031	Have no fear. If I were to die, there is still Dario. This land will remain at peace.
032	Dario is young, but he has studied in Northern Pride and he now uses those personal connections to assist in the reconstruction of our country.
033	Captain Zeke, please look after my sons. Never would I wish for a tragedy like the Dawn of Wrath to repeat itself.
034	Lord Gadd...if only all of Wratharis' nobility were such as you are...
035	Lord Crowley...he seems dignified yet kind at the same time.
036	... ...!
037	Oh! The buds are sprouting out, Yuffie! You've been watering them properly, after all. I'm sure they'll blossom into beautiful flowers.	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
038	... ...!
039	I'm really looking forward to it too!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0008
040	(These days of calm... They made me forget how twisted and ugly the world could be.)
041	(Because of my naivety...Yuffie...)
042	Argh! The Holy Guard found us...huh? It's just one of them! Kill him!
043	The regret you have sown here...shall be paid for in the next life!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0007
