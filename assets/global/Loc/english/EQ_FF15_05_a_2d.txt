001	Something strange is going on.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0011
002	What's that?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
003	The Magitek Axemen...there's something about them that's slightly different.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
004	Agreed. I feel it as well. They're a tad stronger than usual.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_1045
005	Those soldiers aren't human.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
006	As you've probably discovered from fighting them, they're cyber soldiers with no human inside them.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0005
007	I've heard that Slothstein has similar cyber soldiers called Alkaroids.
008	Hold on. There are cyber soldiers here as well?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
009	Yeah. On top of that, from what I've heard, there are Demons in Slothstein who operate on Alchemic Energy.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
010	That's all I can tell you.
011	I don't really get it but I'm assuming it's some kind of magic?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0031
012	Well, I guess you could call it that. Anyway, let's head to Slothstein.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
013	(Demons...Alkaroids...Magitek Axemen...)
014	(I wonder if it has something to do with the incidents in Slothstein that Gabirond was talking about.)
015	I don't understand the details, but let's hurry.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0045
016	Dias, you can sit in the passenger seat.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0024
017	...! I'm riding on this?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
018	You don't plan to walk, do you?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
019	No...but...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
020	Hurry up and get in. We're crammed in tight back here.
021	O-okay...	VO_dios.dios_event_1005
022	Woo! The wind feels great!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0046
023	...Yeah.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
024	All right. Say "cheese"!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0003
025	What's that?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
026	Hmm? It's a camera. Wanna see the photos later?	VO_prompt.prompt_chara_1010
027	...?
028	The city is coming into view.
029	...What's with all the smoke?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
030	Whoa! Is that the city?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0044
031	Most likely.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
032	You're not sure? Man. The thought of seeing a new city is getting me all worked up.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0025
033	Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be getting there that easily.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0030
034	These guys again.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0012
