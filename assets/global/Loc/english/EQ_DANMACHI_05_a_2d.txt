001	Harrumph! Taking advantage of Bell's kindness, trying to wrap him around your little finger...	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0016
002	And Bell's only helper being Little Miss Wallen-something?! Don't think I can't see what's going on here!
003	Bell's been speaking rather highly of you since we met him, so I was wondering what kind of goddess you might be. Turns out you're quite the...uhh...spitfire?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
004	Ah, hahaha...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
005	Wait a minute. Goddess, did you say Ais is my only helper?
006	Uh, yeah! That's what that high-and-mighty little diva from earlier said. Were you not listening to her?
007	All she told me was that she summoned "further help" from my world.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0006
008	Whaaat? She's got some nerve, sending you off to fight with such little info!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0030
009	Did she at least tell you there's a minotaur here, and it's growing in strength?
010	So it is a minotaur, then! She didn't tell me that part, specifically, but I did at least know there was a monster here gaining power.
011	Hoo boy. Why am I not surprised?	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0031
012	I pried as much information from her as I could, but I'm betting you just agreed to help the second you heard there were people in trouble!
013	Hahaha. You know me too well, Goddess.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0042
014	Heh. That's how it goes with friends, isn't it?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
015	Looks like you've found yourself some nice companions in this world, too.
016	I have. I already count both Kevin and Ila here as dear friends.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
017	Ugh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
018	Hmm. Short one this time. Where's your usual "I can't stand it"?
019	You're the one I can't stand, remember?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
020	Hahaha...
021	What about you, Wallen-something? Did you hear about any of this when you were brought here?	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0001
022	...
023	Yeeeeah, that's what I thought.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0005
024	Well, defeating a minotaur that's absorbed that much power with a party this small might be kind of a tall order.
025	You know exactly how powerful it is? Did that observer of destiny woman give you that much detail?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
026	Oh, no, I guess I forgot to mention! I got captured by some real sketchy guys earlier, and they had the minotaur with them!
027	What?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0026
028	At first it seemed like they had it under their control, but then it started to go kinda berserk.
029	So we're dealing with an enraged monster from another world that's been feeding on Alchemia?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
030	Oh, yeah, it's on a total rampage of destruction. That place looked like ruins to begin with, but the minotaur made sure nobody'll ever be able to tell what it used to be.
031	The children who weren't able to get away in time... They could be in there!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
032	Goddess, do you happen to remember where those ruins were?	VO_bell.bell_battle_0019
033	Raaaaaarrrgggh!	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0001
034	We'd best wrap this up and be on our way.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
035	Hey! Wait your turn! Rude beast. They're over that way, Bell!
036	Okay! Then let's move out!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0042
037	Right!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
038	What are you people doing here?! ...Ahhh, if it isn't our runaway test subject!
039	Waaah! Bell, those are the guys who captured me!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0042
040	Hahaha! Our lab might be destroyed, but as long as we can get our hands back on the test subject, our power in battle is assured.
041	Grr...	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
042	How dare you!
043	We're putting a stop to your whole operation right now!
