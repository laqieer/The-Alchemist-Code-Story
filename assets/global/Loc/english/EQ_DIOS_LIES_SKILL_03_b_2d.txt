001	GRAAAAAAAUH!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0043
002	We did it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
003	So, the weeds really were the source of its strength. We couldn't have defeated it without your magic, Lisbeth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
004	Hardly! I'd still be stuck dealing with all those weeds if it weren't for you, and the illusion would never have been broken.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
005	It's all thanks to you, Dias!
006	I'm always...being rescued by you.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
007	That's not true.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
008	I've always trusted my own strength and refused the help of others...but working together to accomplish something...isn't half bad.
009	Lisbeth, you made me realize that.
010	Really...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
011	C'mon, we're almost there, right? Once the ice melts, that thing might come back. We had better hurry.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
012	I feel like I'm forgetting something...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
013	Um..."Look into the ice. The reflection shows those beyond flesh and blood who think of you."	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
014	"If you love the ones reflected in return, you will find a token of your love ahead. If not, you cannot proceed."
015	Aaaaaaaaah!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0028
016	What's wrong?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
017	(I completely forgot! There's a signpost where the ice mirror is!)
018	(He's going to know what the mirror does! If... If he sees himself in the mirror when I look into it...)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
019	Oh no!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_2007
020	Uh... Are you okay?
021	(He's going to think I'm a weirdo! I can't let him see how I feel like this!)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
022	I-I'm heading back to the dorm!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
023	Are you sure? We've already made it this far. I thought you said you wanted the flower.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
024	I-I do! B-but...there's something life-or-death that I forgot to do!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
025	I have to go back!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
026	Mm... Well, if you say so...
027	Yes! It's fine now! I'm overjoyed that we got to spend some time together searching for the flower.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
028	That's...good to hear.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
029	(I don't need to look in the mirror, or have a Stub Rules flower to know that these feelings...are real.)
030	(When I see him smile, I remember how I felt the first time I met him. I feel exactly the same now as I did then.)
031	(Just thinking about it makes me feel warm inside.)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
032	(I want to convey all of my feelings. I've got to tell him right away!)
033	I enjoyed our little adventure, too. You have my gratitude, Lisbeth. You've given me something good to remember on my last day here.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0034
034	...
035	(Yuffie...it was just like spending time with you. I was able to feel the same kindness—even for just a moment—that I often felt back then.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0050
036	(However...it's over now. I can never go back.)	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
037	Um, Dias?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
038	Lisbeth, I'll walk you back to the dorm. Don't let your guard down until we're out of the forest.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
039	See ya.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
040	Dias, wait up!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
041	I need to talk to you! It's about the Sacred Stones!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
042	...
043	I'm sure you'll find what I know useful. So, um...
044	Would you meet me at the Venus School of Magic? In the courtyard where we first met?
