001	Huff...huff... She's really...strong.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	There are three of us, but we can't seem to catch her at all.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
003	It's like she's watching us from above...and completely grasps our position.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
004	Seeing things from a bird's eye view is one of the first things you learn when serving as an air defense mage. Lisbeth...how high up can you see from there?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0016
005	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
006	It's true that this country is sick. There's no doubt that the Sacred Stone is the cause.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0002
007	If you know that's the case...then please get out of the way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
008	That being said, even if you were to remove the curse of the Sacred Stone, do you think it would make everyone happy?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0010
009	...?!
010	At night, when I look down at the city...I can see a trickle of small lights.
011	Each of these small lights is a separate life...some happy and some unhappy.
012	There are those in this country who happily coexist with the curse and those who have been crushed by the curse...
013	Lisbeth...all that you are trying to do is to flip the happy and the unhappy.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0002
014	Even if you were to flip this entire country around...it wouldn't make everyone happy.
015	Well...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
016	You'll be able to pull it off, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
017	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
018	Coming up to this point, you've healed a lot of people, right?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
019	Whether it be the court mages, the Bugmail, or the vermin...
020	They were all opponents who you were risking your life to fight against.
021	...?!	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0027
022	When it comes to you, Liz, even if this country's common sense and everyone's position and lifestyle were to be flipped around...
023	You would still reach out to each person and lend them a hand.
024	You even saved me, after having once said terrible things to you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
025	Liz, you're not flexible enough to see things from a bird's eye view.
026	Neither are you clever enough to persuade people with rhetoric.
027	But you try to save everyone who comes into your line of sight. You try to stop any battle that occurs in your path.
028	There is no witch more straightforward than you in all of Lustburg!
029	Alma...Rebecca!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
030	I see. So that's why there were so few casualties during this conflict.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0031
031	Liz is really bad at giving up. She wants to remove the curse of the Sacred Stone, but she doesn't want to fight.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
032	If she has no choice but to fight, she always wants to heal as much as she damages.
033	That kind of stubbornness has moved adults such as the headmistress and Salomo. Do you know why, Captain?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
034	... ...
035	Seeing the witches of the castle, I realized that part of becoming an adult is about giving up.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
036	But, in life, if you give up on something, at that point, it's nothing more than an elaborate process of self-destruction.
037	In Liz's case, she continues to tell those adults who have given up...those people who are slowly dying, to live.
038	She shares her life force with them. She brings these adults back to life who have long remained subdued.
039	...I see. It looks like I chose the wrong opponent.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0045
040	As an adult, I may not be able to stop you. Lisbeth, I understand your resolve now.
041	Then...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
042	That being said, resolve alone can neither save people nor a country. Strength is a necessity.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0016
043	So, show me. Use the power that you've obtained to help others...to defeat my selfishly-obtained power!!!	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0012
