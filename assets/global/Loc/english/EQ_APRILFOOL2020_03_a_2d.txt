001	Well, let's go find this mysterious transfer student, then!
002	Hmhm. You're by far the more mysterious one, if you ask me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
003	(Kaya's teasing me again. Let's see if I can play my cards right this time...)
004	Oh, really? Then are you interested in solving the mystery of this very mysterious transfer student?
005	Hmhm. Just a little.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
006	Perhaps you could start by telling me what you were trying to achieve with that incredibly smooth reply.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
007	(Okay, I lose... Kaya's still better at comebacks.)
008	Kaya's Affection Level Slightly Increased
009	What the—?! For that? How does this system work, anyway?!
010	Excuse me, do you think you could lower your voice?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
011	Now, now. Don't be a spoilsport. Schools are meant to be noisy; it's unsettling when it gets too quiet.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
012	Oh! You're Sharon and Toritoh, right?
013	You know my name? We haven't met before, have we?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
014	Whoops. You're right. I just... heard some rumors about you two. That's all.
015	Rumors? Hah. I suppose there are plenty of people who would talk about me behind my back.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
016	It was all good stuff, I promise! I've been hearing bits and pieces about everyone, because I've been asking around about the transfer student.
017	I mean the other transfer student. I'm a transfer student, myself! I thought it might be nice to have a chat with the guy who came before me.
018	Right... You must be talking about Sol, then.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0045
019	The guy who is even less social than I am? Who barely a soul has seen since he joined the academy? That's the guy you're looking for?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
020	I guess so. I was hoping we could be friends, you know? Isn't there anyone who'd know where he is?
021	Let me think... I suppose Acht might. She's his childhood friend, after all. You can probably find her in the cafeteria.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
022	Wait, Sol and Acht?! Does that mean the Templars exist in this world, too?!
023	...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
024	...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0029
025	Well, that was awkward. Look, I understand the appeal of history more than anyone, but blurting out things like that isn't going to win you any popularity points.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
026	I'm sorry! I just really like the Templars. They were so cool in the event, too. I guess it was a little different from the game, but in a good way, y'know?
027	Event? You have piqued my curiosity... But that will have to wait. We have arrived at our destination. This is TAC Academy's cafeteria.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
028	Thanks, Kaya. Y'know, I'm so glad you were the first person I met in this world.
029	More flattery? It's certainly nice to hear, but all I did was show you the way to the cafeteria.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
030	Kaya's Affection Level Increased
031	Anyway, you don't need to thank me. It's no trouble—although it's really not like me to do this sort of thing at all. I suppose this, too, is fate.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0037
032	Fate, huh? Come to think of it, you don't talk much with the other students, do you?
033	I want to focus on my research. Objectless socialization is simply an inconvenience.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
034	Listen... I want you to promise me something. I'll help you with your research whenever you like, so...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
035	When you need me, just wait for me there.
036	Huh? Where?
037	The place where we first met.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
038	Oh, okay. Sure.
039	Hmhm. It will make it feel more like fate, don't you think?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
040	Huh? Wait a minute... This isn't a cafeteria—it's a bar! There're even bottles of alcohol in plain sight!
041	Alcohol? Don't be ridiculous. This is a school! Come on, focus. Acht's right over there.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_1018
042	Did you need something?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
043	Yeah, um... I'd like to meet Sol—
044	No.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0039
045	Hold on, hear me out. I just want to talk—
046	Not happening.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0040
047	Hmhm. Looks like you're in her bad books already.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
048	What did you expect? You don't just go up to a stranger and ask for a meeting with someone. That's crazy suspicious.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
049	I just want to talk to him, though. Really!
050	At that moment, you hear a loud rumbling noise.
051	Huh? Kaya, did you say something?
052	That wasn't me. Sounds more like someone's hungry.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
053	...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
054	Acht's gone all red and pouty! I think I know whose rumbly tummy that was!
055	I-if you give me something to eat... I'll consider letting you meet Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
056	So, now we're scavenging for food... Any ideas?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
057	Maybe some apples?
058	Apples? That's a pretty definitive answer, but why apples?	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_1018
059	I'm not really sure why, but I used to go looking for apples a lot... It felt like I could never get enough.
060	Why can't I remember? I'm sure there was a good reason for it... Anyway, the point is you can never have too many apples!
061	I have no idea what you're talking about, but at least we have a clear goal.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
062	Right. Let's go find some apples!
