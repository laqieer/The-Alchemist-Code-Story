001	Spick-and-span, kaboom, kablam!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0023
002	Are you, er, polishing your cannon again, Bertha?
003	It's gotta be perfect! After all, today's the Artillery Regiment's public performance! I really hope everyone enjoys it!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
004	Enthusiastic as ever, I see. Still, you mustn't let your preparations get in the way of your duties.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
005	Well, you've come a long way as a knight. I'm sure you'll do fine; just don't get carried away.
006	...
007	(As a knight, huh...)
008	(I might be prepared to fire my cannon on someone in order to protect someone else, but still...)
009	(That's how I know I'm not ready. I've got a long way to go.)	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
010	(If I want to protect more people, I've got to keep improving my skills as a gunner. I'm just not good enough yet.)
011	...
012	Hey! Bertha! It's almost time!
013	R-right! Oh, no! For right now, I'd better focus on the performance!
014	...
015	Whoa! Hearing that cannon fire up close really clears out your ears, eh?
016	They're doing a mock battle next! I can't wait!
017	Yay! It looks like everyone is enjoying themselves!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
018	You... You're the girl who was firing that cannon up there, aren't you?	VO_chao.chao_sys_0003
019	Huh? Oh! Yes! That's right. I'm Bertha of the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
020	The name's Chao. I came to watch your knights perform, you see.
021	I noticed that you lacked a certain element of...professionalism.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0001
022	H-huh?! Really?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0020
023	To be clear, your aim is precise and your handling of the cannon is smooth and able. However, you put too much force into your every action.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0005
024	Oh...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0018
025	On the battlefield, a delay of even a fraction of a second can change the course of an entire war. You're small, so perhaps you ought to consider how your size affects your movements?
026	S-small? Aw...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0029
027	Perhaps it is the fact that you wield a weapon so much larger than yourself that it causes you to subconsciously use unnecessary force.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0004
028	W-well, this time we used a powerful cannon to make the show more fun for the people watching, but...
029	You noticed all that detail, huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0003
030	Hmph. Please! It is elementary for one such as I.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0010
031	(He sure has sharp eyes. Who is this guy?)
032	At any rate, I suppose I should acknowledge how impressive it is that one of your...diminutive stature can so adeptly handle a cannon of that size.
033	S-stop calling me small! You're only a tiny bit taller than me anyway!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0012
034	You don't see me using a cannon, do you? Besides, I am not short. I am merely still growing.
035	So am I! Who are you, anyway?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0016
036	Curious, are we? Fear not, I shall tell you.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0038
037	Huh?
038	During the mock battle, you will do exactly as I say. Then you will see, and know all there is to know.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0007
039	What? But... I mean...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
040	Ah, I see. You do not trust me, I take it?	VO_chao.chao_sys_0003
041	It's not that I don't trust you, exactly... You just kinda came out of nowhere. Now you're expecting me to follow your commands? Seems kinda...fishy.
042	Besides, you're just some kid.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0012
043	Indeed? Then that means you had all your shortcomings pointed out to you by a mere child, doesn't it?	VO_chao.chao_sys_0010
044	Ngh!
045	Don't believe me then. It's nothing to me if you end up stuck as a worthless, washed-up underling.
046	However, should you decide to do as I say, you will find yourself outperforming your fellow knights... You would make an excellent pawn on the battlefield, you know.
047	I look forward to watching your performance, however subpar it might turn out to be. Farewell for now...	VO_chao.chao_sys_0008
048	H-hey! Hold on a second!
049	Oi! Bertha! What're you standing around chatting for?! You should be preparing for the mock battle!
050	O-oh no! I'll get to that right away!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
