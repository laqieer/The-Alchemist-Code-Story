001	Nyx! Can you hear me?! It's me! Hiiragi!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0018
002	I'm going to tell you the answer to your question!
003	When you asked me if I would be your girlfriend...
004	Even if it was just a lie or an act...I was happy!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
005	That's why I...!
006	But I...!
007	I...!
008	I'm sorry!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0035
009	Way of the Ninja—Shadow Clone! There is no end to them! There are so many, and they are indeed terrifying to behold!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0018
010	All of you must flee! Immediately! The Way of the Ninja is a dreadful thing!
011	Thing is, that's not the only dreadful thing happenin'. Maybe it's all this turmoil turnin' 'em onto us, but now we've got a whole wall of monsters assailin' the village!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0029
012	This is the terror that is the Way of the Ninja!
013	Isn't it?!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0026
014	I-I dunno! Well, there's this pillar of light at the edge of town...	VO_thieff.thieff_sys_0018
015	What?!
016	The ninjas're disappearin' into thin air!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0025
017	But that sounds like...! Way of the Ninja—Camouflage!	VO_thieff.thieff_sys_0026
018	No... That's...!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0039
019	I see.
020	You went to meet your master, didn't you?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0007
021	I will deal with the monsters. Now, all of you must flee! Run!
022	...
023	Having been burdened with the sin of lust, such things as love are impossible for me.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0010
024	Yet, as you continue to fight...
025	I am certain that none of you will be enticed by anything like the darkness which troubles me.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0007
026	Still...I, too, have someone who I would very much like to meet.
027	Gwaaaaaaaaaarrgghhh!
028	I am certain that this isn't lust...	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0031
029	But simply love, plain and simple.
030	To me, love is now a longing of a faded past, a past that I have overcome.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
031	I miss the days I spent with my kunoichi sisters, fighting alongside them in our world... That was the normal me.
052	Hiiragi's heartfelt words cleansed the Ragi-Boo of their corruption.
053	As soon as the greater part of the indefinite elements were removed, Nyx and Mira kick-started the Chance Encounter.
032	I guess I'm dumped, huh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
033	We both know that this is exactly how you planned it.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
034	Well, I was pretty worried. It was touch and go back there.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
035	Were you in on it too, Mira?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
036	I'm just glad I was able to keep it together! It was a close call, though.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
037	I didn't think I'd end up getting swallowed up by the corruption, but thankfully, Hiiragi figured it all out.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
038	He is my little brother, you know? That's why I went along with his plan. All of it was to defeat the Lovesickness.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
039	All kinds of powers and desires got muddled together, preventing us from affecting the creature itself.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
040	We needed to find the owners of each of those powers and desires and have them reveal those qualities for us.
054	First, there was the longing to fall in love. In order to figure out who that desire belonged to, Nyx began confessing his feelings left, right, and center.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
055	Yup. It was pretty obvious who my target would be, though.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
056	Pffft!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0013
057	Then we heard about how this Lovesickness had a lot to do with the kunoichi, which pretty much confirmed things.
058	All that was left was to incite Mira's recklessness, so that I could use her to deepen my relationship with Hiiragi...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
059	That's no way to treat your family!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
060	Then force Almace to display her battle prowess, which the Lovesickness had also inherited...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
061	I ended up being the one to dispel my own recklessness, though.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
062	Longing isn't something you should hold on to forever, you know. Maybe my methods were a little, er, unorthodox, but...
063	Your Hiiragi Harem was more than a little unorthodox!
064	I-I know. It was base and vile of me to even conceptualize it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
065	I hope you're ashamed of yourself!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
066	Can't really praise his methods. At least we know for sure now that Nyx has some recklessness in him, too.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
067	Only sometimes...and maybe that's not such a bad thing.
068	Well, you've definitely provided the perfect example of what not to do!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
069	I'm really sorry, ladies. I've been a naughty boy, toying with you all like this...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
070	Nrgh! Nyx!
071	We have had quite enough of your antics, young man.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0030
041	Love...
042	I'm not going to fall in love. Not after this.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0037
043	Oooooraaahhh!
044	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0003
045	Yomi!
046	Give them their last rites, Hiiragi.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0045
047	Okay. I really do miss my old life.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0005
048	Although my battles never ended, and although I suffered so much pain...
049	If I were unable to return to my normal life...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0018
050	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0003
051	That would be a real nightmare!
