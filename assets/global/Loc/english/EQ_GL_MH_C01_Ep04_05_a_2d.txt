001	Hey, I found a set of stairs. Looks like they go underground.
002	Assuming this is an old tomb... a burial chamber, perhaps?
003	Only one way to find out.
004	Hmm. It's not as ancient as I thought. It smells... sharply sterile.
005	Like spilled chemicals, or some other odd substance.
006	Maybe it has to do with those weird storage tanks over there.
007	And are those... monitor displays?
008	I don't think we're in a tomb, honestly.
009	Wait, what's... that?
010	Roxanne peers over at a small heap of humanoid corpses strewn haphazardly across the floor.
011	Eerily enough, they are completely drained of blood, and are now little more than dried husks.
012	Ugh. How long have these been down here?
013	No idea. I can't tell when they were killed. They're too shriveled.
014	...
015	...Ugh...
016	Soren? Are you all right?
017	My head... hurts...
018	(I've seen this... scene... before. But where? And... why?)
019	Grrrrr...
020	Roxanne! Watch him!
021	I'm on it!
