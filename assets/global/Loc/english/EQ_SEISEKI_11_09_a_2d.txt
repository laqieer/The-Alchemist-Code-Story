001	Huzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0004
002	Urk!
003	Another one down! How's it going over there?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0032
004	We've brought it to a draw! We are doing all we can to stand our ground!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
005	Argh... Hang in there! Captain Othima, Captain Seida, and Captain Kagura should be back here soon!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
006	Understood!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
007	Once the captains have returned, we will be able to flank the enemy!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
008	Then we will be able to turn the tide! We just need to hold out until then!
009	Hmph. A draw. Well...until now, I would say.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
010	?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
011	Ack...?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
012	Hahahahaha! We are the harbingers of your end!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
013	Y-you...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
014	My, my. Long time no see, brat! I'm so delighted to see you that I am practically trembling...with excitement to wipe you out along with all the rest!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
015	No! Be wary, all, and do not engage that man in single combat! We must somehow endure until the captains return!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
016	Ah... Ignorance is bliss, isn't it? For you, not me. You're so pitiful you make me want to retch.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
017	Ignorance...? What are you talking about?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
018	Hahaha, so impatient! Are you sure you want to know? After all, it must be quite disheartening to find out that Othima and Seida will never come to help you.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
019	Huh...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
020	And that...Kagura, was it? Unfortunately she won't be able to make it either. We may have...completely annihilated the lot of them.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
021	See? Isn't that sad? I basically just told you that you're standing on your own graves.
022	N-no... That's impossible! You're just lying to destroy our morale!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0021
023	Oh, really? Sol seemed quite pleased to tell me about how they cried and begged as he tore them apart.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
024	Hahahahahahaha! Welcome to reality, brat!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
025	You...! Huzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
026	Captain Basheeny! Come, knights!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
