001	This way, Madam Soothsayer. You must be exhausted from your long journey. Please, rest.
002	Quite the change in attitude now that you know who I am. What is it you want from me?
003	Very perceptive, Madam Soothsayer. I should have expected nothing less. You see, our village has been plagued by wild beasts.
004	I see, so you want me to rid your village of these beasts. That isn't too unreasonable.
005	What is with all that ruckus, though? Is there some traveling merchant in town?
006	If you can call that peddler a merchant, then sure. She arrived moments before you did.
007	Wow! You have so many shiny things, lady!
008	These are for my work, but I can give you these glass ones if you like. See? Aren't they just as pretty?
009	You will?! Oh, wow! They're so shiny!
010	No fair! I want some!
011	Hahaha! No need to fight. There's plenty more where that came from.
012	Agh!
013	Oh, hello. Aren't you...?
014	I... I-I'm wearing clothes.
015	Well, of course you are! If you were still wandering around naked after everything I said, I would have wrapped you up like a mummy!
016	Please, no. I couldn't stand another one of your lectures. Besides, I just didn't know what constituted good manners back then.
017	It's not really a question of manners...more so a kind of social norm.
018	W-well, as you can see, I've been traveling around other countries and have learned much. I can now interact with anyone without a problem.
019	Heheh, how funny! I didn't expect you two to know each other.
020	I'd say we know each other pretty well. After all, when we first met, I saw more of her than I bargained for...
021	Anyway! Weren't you telling me about some beasts that you need me to take care of?
022	Oh, yes. There is a mine near the village. They seem to be coming from there.
023	A mine, huh? Any idea what caused this?
024	Um, you see... Well, I... All I can say for sure is that many gems can be found around here.
025	Ah... Well now I see why you're here.
026	The best discoveries in life are the ones you make yourself! Besides, now that I know there are problems in the area, I can't just ignore that.
027	And you always personally come out this far, do you?
028	I'm not here to kill time. Whenever there's a problem, I just want to do what I can to investigate and help out.
029	Well, I'll be taking care of the beasts myself, so you can just sit back and stay out of my way.
030	I think not. Exterminating the beasts won't solve the core of the problem.
031	What do you mean it won't solve the problem? Why are you so invested in this, anyway?
032	Unless we solve the root cause, beasts may simply start harassing the village again once we leave.
033	You worry too much. Getting too involved with other people's problems doesn't usually end well.
034	You have to remember that we're outsiders. We shouldn't give them too much hope.
035	You've become quite the pessimist. Did something happen in Saga?
036	Nothing important.
037	It's just that I witnessed a lot of things happen in Saga. I've decided to be a little more...careful.
038	B-beasts! Help!
039	We can talk later, Mirianne. Let's go!
