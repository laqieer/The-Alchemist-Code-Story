MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0003	His unwavering will
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0004	brought about the
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0005	utter devastation of this world.
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0006	The wheel of fate he set in motion,
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0007	even now continues to move the destiny of many.
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0008	Is it...
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0009	dazzling glory that awaits them,
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0010	or ruin steeped in despair?
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0011	That answer rests
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0012	in the unknown future.
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0013	Agh...!
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0014	Where am I?

MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0020	Depending on their reasons, I may lend them a hand.
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0021	Well then...
MEMORY_SABA_TELOP_0022	tell me about your naive dream.
