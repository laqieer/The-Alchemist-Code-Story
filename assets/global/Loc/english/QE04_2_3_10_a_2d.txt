001	Such a thing exists?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
002	It used to be held quite frequently. The Sprite Quartet would gather in one place under the watchful eyes of our people.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
003	By holding it in front of our people, it would eliminate any possibility of cheating and promote real-time interactions.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
004	This law applies to all of Saga, so even that brat Tehre won't be able to dismiss it.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
005	I see!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0024
006	It's called...the Sprite Quartet Discourse!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
007	That would provide a medium for concrete discussion. This shines a little more hope on our situation!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
008	Well, we've never held one since going from a Quartet to a Trio, but it's worth trying.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
009	It may take a while to persuade Tehre, but...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
010	If we convey everything honestly and leave no room for misunderstanding...it could open a new path.
011	Then let's start preparing immediately!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
012	Ah. First, we'll have to send an official messenger to Tehre. Do you think we can ask you, Tina?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
013	Of course!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
014	I'll go with you as well!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
015	Of course, I'm going too!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
016	I'll write the letter of summoning. Would you mind returning with me to Fuu and then heading out from there?	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
017	Not at all! Rest assured that I will successfully complete my mission!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
018	You fill me with confidence. Thank you, Tina and Lisbeth.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
019	Heheh...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
020	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
021	If it weren't for you, I doubt we would've landed on the idea of a Sprite Trio Discourse. Those were some fine ideas you put out there.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0033
022	No, if it weren't for Mocca, I wouldn't have been able to change in the first place. If you should thank anyone, it should be Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
023	Not in the least. I am constantly being rescued by Tina's sense of responsibility.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
024	Ahaha! Come on, you guys!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0008
025	I'm complimenting you. You could just accept it, you know?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
026	I'm simply speaking the truth.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
027	Heheh. That's quite the bond you two share. I expected great things from you two Wind Shamans.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
028	Understood!
029	Well then, let's head back immediately.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
030	Voda! Please...please, help! The village...our village...!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
031	Calm down. What is this presence I feel? What is going on?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
032	Our village was attacked by the Jam! They came so suddenly! Please...please, help!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
033	!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
034	I'm taking Beelzebub! Farewell, Godwolf Asena!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0008
035	Agh...no...! How could this happen...?! Aaaahhh!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0043
036	What's the matter?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
037	Tina...did you "see" something again?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
038	Hurry...we need to hurry! I won't allow it! Such a thing must not be allowed to happen!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
039	Tina! Calm down!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
040	How can I be calm?! Asena...I saw Asena fall at the hands of Georgios!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
041	...Asena?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
042	Let's hurry...before all hope is lost!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
