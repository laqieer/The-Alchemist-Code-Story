001	Haaaaaah!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0032
002	Phew... That takes care of the monsters around here.
003	Good job, Ikasa. You almost single-handedly took down all of them.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
004	Thank you very much.
005	Although I suspected there would be monsters in the area, I didn't expect them to be so aggressive.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
006	Yes. Perhaps they became aggressive due to those subjects...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
007	Subjects...? What do you mean?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
008	It seems you don't know that particular detail. Though it should've been shared with anyone involved...
009	...?
010	Never mind. It's not something to worry about. Let me tell you the details about this mission.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
011	You may have heard, but the people who used this location as their base experimented with alchemy and the strengthening of monsters.
012	All of the test subjects in the ruins were supposed to have been disposed of at the time of this discovery, but it seems that some of them had escaped.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
013	I see... So you are here to help take care of unfinished business.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
014	Well, seems that's what it is.
015	I understand now. Thank you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
016	It's certain that the test subjects are around here.
017	It seems that there are no remnants of the group around here.
018	Right.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
019	But seeing how those monsters acted, the test subjects must be near. We have to take care of things before anyone gets hurt.
020	From now, we won't just be patrolling. We'll also be on a hunting mission. But with your skills, there shouldn't be any problems.
021	Yes.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
022	(To have some test subjects escape... This would be an embarassment for the Holy Guard. But I'm not sure why the captain had to come out here...)
023	(Although...)
024	What's wrong? You look unsure.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
025	Not unsure... Just a little confused.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
026	About what?
027	You know I have the skills to defend myself, so I don't understand why you came along with me...
028	Didn't I say that I was eager to see you in action? And...because I wanted to have a chat with you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
029	A chat?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
030	Yeah. After being recruited, things were busy so we never had a chance to talk.
031	I thought I could hear your answer to that question I asked way back.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
032	There is great aptitude for alchemy and strong power.
033	However, after further examination, there may be danger of her leaning towards darkness. It is unwise to make her a member of the Holy Guard.
034	But, we must make use of her power...
035	(If I'm not allowed, then I'm not allowed... This just feels troublesome now.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
036	(It'll be a bit disappointing, not being able to become a "knight"...)
037	(With the opportunity lost, there's probably nothing else for me...)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
038	Captain Cadanova. What is your opinion?
039	Well...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
040	She has considerable alchemy within her. It would be a wasted opportunity if we didn't do anything.
041	Although...
042	Of course, if I can understand your concerns, so how about this? I'll take care of this newcomer.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
043	..!
044	As the captain of the 4th Regiment, I'll take full responsibility for making sure her power is used correctly.
045	Well, Captain Cadanova. If you're willing to go that far.
046	Then it's decided.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
047	...?
048	And that's how things will be. Welcome, Ikasa.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
049	Thank you...very much.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0034
050	By the way, there was a question I forgot to ask you.
051	What is it?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
052	It was, "when you become a knight, what will you use your power for?"
053	My power...?
054	Your motivation.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
055	...
056	I...
057	You said that there was nothing in particular, right?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
058	Was that my answer...? You seem to remember it clearly.
059	I wouldn't forget it. Especially with someone saying that so honestly.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
060	I took your words seriously, as someone that needed guidance.
061	...
062	I was able to see your skills. It's true that you have power...but that's what scares me.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
063	You have no mercy in taking down enemies. Your powers don't hold you back.
064	Having that power is a double-edged sword. Because you know how to control yourself, you won't lose yourself so easily...
065	However, if you don't have a purpose for your power, one day you may lose control and endanger yourself and those around you.
066	So you want to know what I'd like to use my powers for, as of now.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
067	Yeah. You didn't have a sense of direction then, but how about now?
068	Did you find a purpose after becoming a knight?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
069	Well, not yet...
070	I don't know if I'll find one. I don't think I've changed much since then.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0021
071	I see...
072	I feel sorry, as you've looked after me and hoped for me all this time.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
073	Then why even bother coming to our gates? What made you want to become a knight in the first place?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
074	That is...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
075	...what I aspire to be!
076	I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!
077	...
078	It's just...a child that is really important to me once said to me "I like knights."	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
079	Hmm...
080	I know. It sounds so childish.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
081	Why do you say that? It's a perfectly good reason.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0023
082	Huh?
083	Then, for the sake of that child, you must encourage yourself more.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
084	Really? Is that a purpose?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
085	Why not? It's important as a memory for you, isn't it?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
086	For an important child. That's a great purpose. A knight that stands to protect what is important is a great knight.
087	I see... so that's what it means.
088	(Even if that's right, for me to be a knight...)
089	!!! That monster...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0025
090	There's a test subject branding on it. It came from over there.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
091	Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!!!	VO_familiar.familiar_battle_0028_a
092	This is going to be a tough one. Let me give you a hand. Ikasa, let's go!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
