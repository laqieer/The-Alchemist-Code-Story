001	Looking back on it now...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0022
002	She probably hated me, but she protected me even so.
003	That's why I could withstand any complaint she could throw at me.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
004	If I could reach for her hand now, I would hold on tight and never let go.
005	Will you shuffle the tarot cards for me?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
006	...
007	I'm not good at offering words of consolation. They tend to turn into curses when I do.
008	Good. Now place the cards down here.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
009	Are you afraid to hear the result?
010	Didn't you lose your capacity for fear in exchange for power from the other dimension? No?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0010
011	Your card is Death.
012	When drawn in the upright position, it signifies bad endings and dead bodies.
013	I do wonder what became of her.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
014	Amu, I mean.
015	Sol?	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
016	Being left behind made me feel lonely, and always being on the receiving end of kindness made me feel pathetic.
017	The leader of the Templars. The sun of Lost Blue.
018	Compared to him, I'm...
019	Nothing.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
020	In the end, all I ever did was make you feel indebted to me.
021	I'm just dead weight, aren't I?
022	All you ever do is stare longingly after the things you've lost.
023	I'm the same.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
024	I obsess over my mistakes, and work stubbornly to undo them.
025	In doing so, I believed I could get back the things I'd lost.
026	But I just ended up sinking my teeth into you, deeper and deeper.
027	That's why I drank blood from corpses.
028	The only thing my hands were good for was adding more corpses to the pile.
029	You'd always come running for me.
030	But I was afraid of looking you in the eye.
031	Your smile was so warm, it made my stomach hurt.
032	All I ever do is take up space.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
033	Oh my, what a blessed reunion! The stars must be watching over us today.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0001
034	You!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
035	Does my presence enrage you? Sadden you?
036	Ngh!
037	I'm just here to have a little peek backstage.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0022
038	Wh-what are you planning?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
039	You never change, do you?
040	Even with your eye plucked out and your arms torn off, you still can't speak your mind!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
041	Th-that's not true!
042	You're still just another person's leftovers.
043	N-no...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
044	What difference is there between thoughtless devotion and being kept as livestock?
045	G-give it back!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
046	Surely there's something more important to you than this old thing?
047	Aaaahh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
048	Can't think of what it is? Go on. Try and remember.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
049	Wh-what?!
050	Me, of course! Don't you need me, Mama?
051	I...!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
052	I'm more important to you than that girl, aren't I?
053	Y-you mean...B-Bianca?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
054	Care for me instead.
055	Give them back!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0032
056	Give me back Bianca! Give me back my eye!
057	Hmm, no can do. Not...yet.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
058	Aaaaaaaahh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
059	Is that all you can do? Scream? Really?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0016
060	H-huh?
061	You've grown weak.
062	Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
063	Oho!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0025
064	Sol!
065	I'm here.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
066	The king! The king has arrived! Yes! Haha! All hail the king!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
067	Sol, I'm...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
068	It's fine.
069	S-Sol...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
070	What's "fine"? Is weakness "fine"?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0012
071	It is.
072	She's fine, just the way she is.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
073	Sol!
074	How pitiable.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
075	S-Sol!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
076	Amu.
077	Yes?
078	Follow me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
079	...!
080	Yes!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
081	Oho! Smooth, my liege, very smooth!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
082	Kuro, did you know that cats tend to wander off on their own shortly before they die?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
083	Why do you think that is? I always assumed it was because they didn't want their owners to have to witness their final moments, but apparently that isn't the case.
084	At least, not according to one theory. Some say it's simply because they grow weak, so they seek out a place of refuge, where they won't have to defend themself from harm.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
085	If that's true, then it's not like they want to get away from the people who love them. They just grow so weak, they forget themselves.
086	I meant what I said. About being jealous.
087	When you're born in Lost Blue, from the moment you can walk...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
088	...?
089	You have to constantly fight to survive.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0005
090	And you're good at that, because you're strong. Really, really strong.
091	After all, not being able to do things as well as you used to is very painful.
092	That's why it was hard for me to talk to you about how you felt, after...after you lost what you did.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
093	No.
094	I mean, I benefited from it, didn't I? Everything changed for me overnight.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
095	...
096	But if your arms are to be my strength, then that leaves my hands free to pick a fight with the rest of the world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
097	...!
098	I'm not afraid of anything anymore. If that makes me a madman, then so be it.
099	I will become the sun that Lost Blue needs, no matter what.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
100	Sol!
101	Bianca always told me not to worry, that my teeth didn't hurt her.
102	If you don't want to fight, then I'll provide a bed for you to rest in. If you don't want to stay, that's fine too. You're always free to go.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
103	She always told me that it hurt her more to see me upset.
104	I mean, I'd get it. No one with any sense would want to stay in this mad place.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
105	Still, it wasn't all sad for me. Dead Nine gave me a purpose. That was my happiness.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
106	So, what do you think? I want you to tell me what you want.
107	I was the same way.
108	Sol, you gave me a way forward.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
109	Amu?
110	I couldn't suppress my emotions towards you.
111	...
112	Is hell to be our stage, then?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0012
113	Aren't you just being forced to fight again, Amu? Isn't he just another master, forcing you into the ring?
114	Is there really any difference between nurturing someone and being consumed by them?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
115	"Devotion" does have a nice ring to it, but isn't it just another word for "dependence" or "obsession"?
116	You know what? I'm sick to death of listening to your monologues.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
117	Regrettably, they're all I'm good at. I've never had the pleasure of acting alongside anyone else.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
162	Let me guess, you want me to be your costar?
169	Oh, no, Sol. I simply want to witness more of your noble tyranny in action!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
170	I want you to express yourself through the madness of another massacre! To keep extorting your vassals for every last drop of wealth they have! Then, at the end of the play, I want to see you hang your head in shame, and pretend to lament your misdeeds!
171	...
172	Only humans are capable of such malicious intent.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
173	I won't deny it. I've always been despicable trash.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
174	That's why she always looks so dejected, isn't it? But such a stagnant expression isn't fit for the stage.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0022
164	If only she would look more like my mama! Oh, how I would love to go see a play with my mama! That's why I'm here, you know. To see your play!
165	I can't give you the thrills you're looking for.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
166	Tsk, tsk. Is that any way to treat your loyal audience?
167	Don't worry. I can make it work.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
119	It's time for a costume change.
120	Oh? What's that supposed to mean?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0005
121	Huh?
122	What is it?
123	Do you know how to read tarot cards?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
124	Enjoy the show.
125	Look at the clocktower!
126	The meaning of a card differs depending on whether it is revealed in an upright or reversed position.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
127	For instance, when the Death card is reversed, it signifies a pause or lull in time.
128	It's stopped.
129	It also signifies ascension and rebirth.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
130	Didn't you know? I keep my secret weapon hidden underground.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
131	Wh-what?!
132	I...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
133	I don't mind what you call me. I might be dependent, or obsessed. But that's fine.
134	Where is that voice coming from?!
135	Hell.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
136	All I want...
137	Well, well, well!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0025
138	What a show!
139	Is to be able to share all my meals with Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
140	Haha! Ahahahahahaha! This is what you had up your sleeve?!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0011
141	The foremost authorities in magical engineering are extremely invested in the creation of humanoid weapons. They were pretty keen to request some...under-the-table research data.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
142	How many weapons did you strap to that thing?!
143	It took a huge chunk out of my savings, but I'd say the purchase was worth every cent.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
144	Now this...! This is really something!
145	I'm just happy to do what I can.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
146	Aha!
147	When I was a slave, working hard was the only thing I was free to do. In other words, I was free to grow as strong as I could.
148	Sol is the one who showed me that.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
149	He took my hands in his. He pulled me to my feet.
150	And you're fine with throwing away your humanity, are you?! You would become a weapon for him?!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0042
151	How can you claim to be working hard if you're just relying on machinery?!
152	It takes strength to wield a weapon. To make its power your own.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
153	Hah! Sounds like a last-ditch effort to make her useful!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0039
154	Things might not be perfect.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
155	But we'll make up for that through hard work.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
168	Oh, if only mama could see this! My flesh and blood!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
156	This... This isn't fair! But now I'm really excited! My blood is boiling, but I can't wait to see what happens next!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
157	This is what you call a deus ex machina!
158	Are you ready, Am?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0007
159	I'll follow you to world's end, Sol.
160	This is yours to use, but I'll make sure you never run out of ammo.
161	Arms Storage! READY!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0032
