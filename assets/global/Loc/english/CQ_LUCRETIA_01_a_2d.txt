001	Sigh...	VO_lucretia.lucretia_event_1014
002	(Not again.)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0030
003	Do you understand, Queen Lucretia? For the hundredth time, I must inform you that you are the queen of this country!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
004	It's true that you have accomplished countless military exploits as a knight. However...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
005	It's outrageous for you to advance past the vanguard on your own and leap into the midst of the enemy troops!
006	Please, exercise caution and be aware of your position as queen!
007	Fine, fine. As you've said, I'll be more careful next time.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0016
008	Now, excuse me.
009	Sigh...	VO_lucretia.lucretia_event_1014
010	(Seriously. I positioned myself at the vanguard because I am aware of my position as queen.)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0018
011	Did you receive a scolding again?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0003
012	Lord Gane...it's you, huh?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0006
013	Don't let it get to you. We are all aware of your triumphs on the battlefield, Queen Lucretia.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0020
014	You are the "flower of the battlefield." Your radiance increases the men's morale.
015	It's encouraging to hear that. So...what can I do for you?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0011
016	Ah, I am simply here to help put my warrior queen at ease and give her respite.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0007
017	Would you like some tea? I've obtained some good tea leaves.
018	I appreciate the gesture, but I have business to attend to. Excuse me.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_chara_1003
019	I see. That's unfortunate. On another occasion, then...	VO_gein.gein_sys_0031
020	Sigh...	VO_lucretia.lucretia_event_1014
021	Queen Lucretia! You are very welcome! Please, take your time to look around.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
022	Thank you. I'll do that.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0007
023	(What a beautiful dress...with such glittering colors...)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0009
024	(Oh! This embroidery! And these frills! How adorable...! It's so pretty!)
025	Ohh...such beauty...	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0024
026	Is it to your liking?	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
027	Mm...ahh...it's a stunning dress like always.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0037
028	Much appreciated. By the way, the dress that you purchased the other day...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0034
029	Oh, I'm sorry. I still haven't worn it yet. Still, the soft violet color was very beautiful!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0035
030	Please, no need to excuse yourself. Thanks to your victories in battle, Queen Lucretia, we can live in peace every day.
031	However...one day, the war will be over. I pray from the bottom of my heart that I will be able to see you in a dress then, my queen.
032	Heh. I wonder if anything other than armor would suit me.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0010
033	Absolutely, it would! Make no mistake about it!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
034	Thank you. When the time comes, please make the ultimate dress.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0008
035	Yes. Of course!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0004
036	That's right. I'm in the middle of tailoring a few new dresses. I think you'd like them.
037	I see! I'm looking forward to them!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0044
038	(Well then...I guess I should return soon. Looking at the dresses make me lose track of time.)
039	Oh? Queen Lucretia... Were you secretly out shopping?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0001
040	Hm? Oh, you again... What's the matter?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0006
041	No...I just happened to be passing by.	VO_gein.gein_event_1001
042	(Passing by? I feel like he was waiting for me. What a curious person.)	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0031
043	A clothes shop...	VO_gein.gein_sys_0044
044	If you wish to wear dresses, then you should summon a tailor to the castle.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0031
045	After all, you are the queen. That much should be expected...
046	Sigh... It's true that I come from royalty, but I am also a knight.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_event_1014
047	During this time of war, I have no time to be dressing up when I must be protecting my people!
048	Besides, I cannot summon a tailor to the castle.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0018
049	Why?	VO_gein.gein_sys_0031
050	The other day, you called me the "flower of the battlefield," didn't you?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0001
051	Yes, indeed, I did. I was not flattering you. Those were my honest words.	VO_gein.gein_sys_0037
052	Queen Lucretia, when you participate in battle, the morale of the soldiers is completely different. You inspire us all.
053	I don't necessarily consider myself to be a flower, but I do wish to protect my country and my soldiers.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
054	If I were to call a tailor to the castle, all my varlets would be overjoyed. They would make me wear one dress after another—none of which would catch my interest.
055	Eventually, they would stop me from showing myself in battle.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0018
056	If that were to happen, it would be the end of your so-called "flower of the battlefield."
057	Would you be all right with that?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0010
058	Hmm...	VO_gein.gein_sys_0005
059	Queen Lucretia! There you are! I'm here to make a report!
060	The enemy troops are approaching in droves! Their first wave is already looming up ahead! Please! We await your presence!
061	You did well to inform me! My horse! I'll join you!	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0009
062	I'll go as well!	VO_gein.gein_battle_0010
