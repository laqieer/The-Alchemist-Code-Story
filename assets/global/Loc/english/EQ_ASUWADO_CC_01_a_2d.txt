001	Even with my furthest recollections, I knew there wasn't equality in this world.
002	Is that child feeling ill? What happened?
003	Probably just drank some dirty water. That's disgusting. She should go around the corner and throw up and not here.
004	Ughhh... Ughhh...
005	As my consciousness was feeling hazy, I thought, "Oh, I'm going to die."
006	I couldn't remember the last time I drank clean water. Because of circumstance, I couldn't even sleep under a home with a roof.
007	Lives aren't lived equally. But why is this how I live...?
008	Yes, death is the only equality and salvation in this cruel world.
009	You've found the truth... Now, come with me.
010	Children. You've faced near death experiences. You cannot live anywhere else. Follow these teachings and only believe the certainty of death.
011	And as long as you heed our teachings, Zalam Gaim will be a place you can come back to—a place you can call home.
012	"What's going on?" I thought to myself. A man with scorching eyes, preaching dubious doctrines. But...
013	Those accursed teachings were the only escape offered to me when I was on the verge of death with nowhere else to go...
014	Get back! Stay away from me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
015	S-scoundrels! Criminals! Who?! Who dared hire Zalam Gaim to assassinate me?!
016	We don't know the identities of our clients. We just complete the missions we're given.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
017	Right. We couldn't tell you even if we wanted to. So why don't you just be a good little target and accept your fate?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
018	Rrg...
019	H-hmph! Do you have any idea why I've come all this way? Any notion at all?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
020	Hmm?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
021	...
022	That's what I thought. All you need to know is that I'm not about to just lie down and die!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
023	Hey—!
024	I'll handle these guys. You go after him, Sakani.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0041
025	Understood!
026	Stop right there!
027	Ugh, persistent little...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
028	Aah! He's got a gun?!
029	Hehe. I thought something like this might happen, so I picked this up just in case.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
030	Urk!
031	Gah! Still more mercenaries?!
032	Looks like the tables have turned, huh? Not even your Najam can save you now. Time to d—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
033	Gaaaah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
034	M-my gun!
035	Even a state-of-the-art weapon means nothing if you can't hold on to it.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
036	Lady Najam!
037	C-curse you all!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
038	Oi, boneheads! Kill them! I'll pay whatever you ask—just get it done!
039	Lady Najam, they look to be quite skilled.
040	Forget it, Sakani. We have only one job here, and it's imperative we complete it as quickly as possible. There's no time for...side projects.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
041	Let's go.
