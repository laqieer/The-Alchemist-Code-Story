001	This should hold for—	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
002	How spectacular! The ancient curse is being purified left and right! Is this the power of the fabled Sephira?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0023
003	The Royal Army?! What are you doing here?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
004	Some of your runners stumbled into the town we had been occupying. They told us many interesting things.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
005	You son of a...! We don't have time to be fighting the likes of you!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0013
006	Do not fret. We have no intention of fighting you today.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
007	I simply wanted to have a few words with you, Isidore, commander of the Sephira warriors.
008	How do you know my name?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
009	Any organization has a weak link or two who will leak such information.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
010	I see. You lot are the pests that have come swarming around the Sacred Stone.
011	Pests! How quaint of you. I am a true patriot lamenting the future of my beloved country.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
012	Twaddle!
013	Dear me, why is it that those who still have the strength to fight never want to listen?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
014	Then I suppose there is nothing for it except to take that strength away, don't you think?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
015	Ack...!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
016	Urgh... After fighting off all the Jam, th-this is...	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
017	Huh, still standing after battling so many of my soldiers.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
018	How regrettable that such a capable warrior is going to lose his life here. What a loss for this country.
019	Quit your blathering!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0017
020	I am complimenting you, my boy. You would fight to death for the woman you love!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
021	A commendable quality for a warrior.
022	What are you talking about?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
023	The resurrection ceremony, was it?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0022
024	!!!
025	Even I did not know the name of the ceremony until recently.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
026	How could you know of it?!
027	My, my. I wonder if you know this, too?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
028	This all-important ritual you stand here defending requires a sacrifice: the life of your beloved fiancé.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
029	The daughter of your Chief, was she not? How cruel of him to raise her, only to sacrifice her in the end!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0009
030	Lies! You're lying! Chief Iakov would never!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0013
031	You really know nothing? Disappointing. You're not worth my time.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0030
032	Run back to your village, Sephira warrior. Go see the truth for yourself.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0040
033	Unless, of course, you choose to die here. I find that acceptable as well.
034	Bastard! Have you not insulted me enough?!
035	Commander! It would be wise to retreat for now. The warriors are exhausted from the battle with the Jam.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
036	We do not have the energy to face against an army of this size.
037	Yes... You are right. Everyone, fall back!
038	Good. Now... Let's see how this seed of doubt I have planted works.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
039	General, we have collected a sample from the Jam they were fighting.
040	Good. Take the sample to the Corpse. Something interesting may come of this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
041	Yes, sir!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0001
042	Kamui.	VO_iakof.iakof_favorite_0001
043	Here is your first task as Protector.
044	Take the druidic priestess, my daughter, to the arboreal altar.
045	To the arboreal altar? As a bodyguard?
046	You could say that. The base of the great tree has now become a nest of feral beasts.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0005
047	Getting her to the altar safely will be your first priority.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
048	I understand.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
049	Malta... Are you ready?	VO_iakof.iakof_favorite_0002
050	Yes. I am ready.
051	Very well. Then it is about time for the resurrection ceremony to begin.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0020
052	Until the ritual is completed, not one soul shall be able to come near Sephiron.	VO_iakof.iakof_favorite_1005
053	No matter what hardship you may face, the two of you must overcome the obstacles together, understand?
054	Chief? What do you—?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
055	We understand.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0006
056	Malta? What is going on? What sort of ritual is this resurrection ceremony?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
057	All you need to worry about is reaching the altar. Malta knows all there is to know about the ritual.
058	...
059	(What is happening? Is this the final trial for me to become Protector?)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
060	(A resurrection ceremony? What does Malta have to do with it?)
061	Let's go, Kamui.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0002
062	Y-yes.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
