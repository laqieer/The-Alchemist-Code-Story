001	H-huh? There's not much security at all. Is everyone fighting outside?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
002	And leaving the inner castle and the queen unprotected?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
003	You're right. It's odd.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
004	Aghh! Y-you...Corpse...!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0027
005	...! O-oh now!
006	Y-you...Lisbeth?! Are you telling me that the mages sent to the school have been defeated?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0027
007	Don't move! I'm gonna heal you now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
008	Ack...the queen! I will sacrifice my life—	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
009	?!
010	Wh-what's this...?! Don't do something stupid!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
011	Sh-she vanished?! Where?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
012	... ...
013	Rebecca...?
014	She...transformed herself into magic energy. Most likely, she did it to give power to her fellow mages...
015	What are you talking about? Then...where did she go?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
016	... ...
017	Rebecca?!
018	The witches of Lustburg have a long lifespan because of Asmodeus.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
019	The court mages are all mostly veterans, and they have a lifespan that matches that.
020	She chose...her own end...
021	Where...did she go?
022	People...don't go anywhere, Lisbeth! They vanish!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0023
023	No...no! Why did she...erase her own life?! If you die, there's nothing left!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
024	Liz...
025	If she stayed alive...if only she stayed alive...we could've fixed this!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
026	Even if we get hurt, we can heal; if we mess up, we can start again.
027	No matter how many hundreds of years we live...there is still more joy to experience. But she...she...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
028	Alma? What's the matter?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
029	That mage...didn't she say Corpse at the end?
030	She did say something like that. What about it?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
031	... ...
032	Let's go, Liz. Let's continue forward.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0015
033	Sob...Alma...I...couldn't save her. I couldn't stop her from dying right in front of me!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
034	She made that choice on her own. That's how dedicated she was. Now it's your turn to resolve yourself.
035	Resolve...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
036	Yes, resolve. You need it now.
037	The road you're headed for is a thorny one, Liz...in various ways.
038	In various ways? What are you trying to say?
039	This is just a guess...but I think that Paladin is here in the castle with the queen.
040	...?!
041	What are you talking about?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
042	I don't know the circumstances...but let's just keep going, Liz. If we're going to find out everything, now is our chance.
043	You can save many more lives than those that have died here!
044	...!
045	The court mages are exhausted. What happened here?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0022
046	Let's just heal them for now!
047	Wha...
048	Lisbeth?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
049	Why are all these terrible things happening at once?! This is the third attack on the castle today!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
050	The third?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
051	First you, then the Bugmail, and then the Corpse. Today has been a troublesome day.
052	I never attacked the castle! I just wanted to talk to the queen!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
053	How can I trust you after you tried to infiltrate the castle?! You've threatened this castle and the Queen!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
054	Stop it! You shouldn't be fighting in that condition—	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0015
055	Enough...prepare yourself!
