001	Takoyaki! Get your piping hot Takoyaki here!
002	Made with fresh Octopus, grilled to perfection! It's so juicy and plump, you won't regret it!
003	Give me five! No, wait, ten!
004	Stop pushing, wait your turn!
005	Now now, no need to rush, there's plenty for everyone.
006	Other sis... big...
007	Are you worried about your figure? There are different kinds of allure and you are plenty cute as it is.
008	Eira... clothes strange...
009	What are you saying, you look absolutely adorable in that swimsuit!
010	In fact, it brings out your charm even more.
011	Go on, try attracting some attention. People will come flocking in no time.
012	... ok
013	Um...
014	Hey there lil sis! Are you selling something too?
015	We're a little parched from all that fun in the sun.
016	... cold... fruit?
017	sweet!
018	Oooh, shaved ice topped with fruits? That's perfect for this scorching heat! Give me a bowl!
019	Make mine twice as big!
020	Ok!
021	(Just a moment ago she seemed so meek, and now she's attracting customers by the dozen!)
022	(Eira is such an earnest child, so perhaps this will help develop confidence in herself!)
023	Hmm?
024	What's going on? There seems to be some ruckus back there.
025	Ahhh! Monsters, monsters on the beach!
026	Run, everyone! Run!
027	Monsters? But they never come this far out to shore!
028	They're not mindlessly attacking the beachgoers. Instead they seem to be headed straight for us!
029	Oh no! Our foraging for ingredients must have disturbed them, and now they're drawn to the scent of all this food!
030	Argh, this day just couldn't get any worse!
031	But at least this problem has a straightforward solution. Shion!
032	Of course, you can count on my blade. You two! Protect the rest of the people!
033	...Yes!
034	Hardly a challenge.
