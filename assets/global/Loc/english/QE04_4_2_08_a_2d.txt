001	What did you just say?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
002	I asked you why you chose to lead Gluttony Foss' forces...when they were the ones who destroyed your clan, the Sephira.
003	How...do you know...that?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0001
004	I've done my research. At this rate, the people of Saga will meet the same fate as the Sephira.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
005	Are you saying that they, too, will be swallowed up by Beelzebub one day?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0044
006	Hmph. My reasons are simple. Such a course best allows me to fulfill my clan's duty and obligation to Beelzebub.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
007	That alone eclipses the disgrace of wielding my blade for the country that slaughtered my people.
008	Admirable.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
009	You wish for me to invade Saga? Have you gone mad, Earth Sprite?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
010	It seems our interests are aligned. Wouldn't it be more profitable for us to work alongside one another?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
011	Now that we've lost the Wind Matter, we don't have much time left to come up with a counterstrategy.
012	Moreover, I'd like to see what it would be like to call Georgios the Flame-Armed General my ally rather than my enemy.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0041
013	You do realize that my mission is to reclaim Beelzebub, do you not? Don't you care that the stone might fall into the hands of Gluttony Foss?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
014	That was the way of it in the past, after all. I was only ever to watch over it for a short time. My goal, from the very beginning, has been to restore the Wind Matter to its original state.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
015	I will ask you once more. Why don't we form an alliance to further both of our causes?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0002
016	If it will lead me one step closer to my ultimate goal, then I don't see why not!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
017	The pact is sealed. If one of us were to die, then it remains the other's responsibility to honor their mission. What do you think?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
018	Honor the other's mission?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0012
019	If we do nothing about Beelzebub, Saga will be destroyed, but the same is true if the Wind Matter remains dormant.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
020	When the dragon awakens, as the legend states, would Gluttony Foss not face the same calamity?
021	Such a catastrophe would mean that neither of our missions can be fulfilled. Such a fate must be avoided!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
022	Oh, so you too, are a man of conviction, hmm? Very well. However...I have no intention of ever being killed!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
023	Neither do I. I am grateful for this arrangement, though...partner. I expect it shall only prove to benefit both of our end goals.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
024	Where is the Dragonslayer?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
025	It's here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
026	Georgios... I swear to honor my promise to you!
027	Glurrrppp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0007
028	There's just no end to them!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
029	I feel a vibration in the earth. Swallowing Beelzebub must have given it this power.	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
030	What are you saying?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
031	The dragon has turned Beelzebub into its tool. The Jam are a manifestation of this. Normally, creating such abominations would be impossible...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
032	But if using the power of earth to do so, then it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility. Earth has the power to nurture life, you see... A revolting thought. I will be the first to take this beast on!
033	We have to destroy its earth core. I will make my way inside from its chest area. No complaints? Voda? Fuu?
034	No, I leave it to you!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
035	It's about time we begin our counterattack!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
