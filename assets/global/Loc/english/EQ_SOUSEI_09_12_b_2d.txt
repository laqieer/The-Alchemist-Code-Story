001	All right! That should do it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
002	Sorry, Emmel. I didn't mean to rope you into helping me.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0036
003	No, no, I wanted to help. It seemed prudent to test the limits of this power under the current circumstances.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
004	The power you gained from using the cores of the Cursed Beasts, you mean?
005	Yes. I'm not quite up to par with what I managed before, but my powers of purification have definitely been amplified.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
006	I hope it'll be enough for the coming fight.
007	O-oh... I'm sure it will be. You're doing great.
008	Come on, man! Don't back off! Get in there! Say what you gotta say!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
009	Did I just hear Nyx's voice?
010	Umm... No, I-I don't think so? I'll, uh, check.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
011	(Nyx, you idiot! What would you do if she'd heard what you said?!)
012	(Don't you wish she had? Like, you wanna tell her, but you're scared, right? Well, I'm here to provide you with moral support! You should be grateful!)	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
013	(Grateful?! You little—!)
014	Adaleigh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
015	Oh, sorry! Just, thinking of something I...need to do. Nothing to worry about.
016	Um, so...
017	There's actually something I'd like to talk to you about.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
018	Oh?
019	U-um, see, I...uhh...
020	(Do it! If you don't, you could literally die without ever making your feelings known!)	VO_nix.nix_sys_0016
021	Um, so, I... Uh, Emmel, I want to, um...p-p-pro...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
022	Pro?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
023	You're, um, someone...I want to protect. And I'll do anything at all to make sure you're safe. I'll always have your back.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
024	Oh, I see. That's very kind of you to say. Thank you!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
025	Heyoooooo, you done with Libra yet?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
026	Don't rush me! You know I'm not that good with magic.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
027	You think you can get Alchemy into it, using the power from Nimul?
028	Mm, I do. Wait. What does this connect to?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
029	This, I think.
030	Ah... I see. All right! That makes sense. I can work with that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
031	So, Yna, don't you think you should check in with Nimul again before we go?
032	There's no need. We've already discussed everything that needs discussing.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
033	Best not to waste words when there are other things to do.
034	Huh. All right, then.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
035	How about you? Not going to spend any time with Nyx and Adaleigh while you have the chance?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
036	They're busy doing their bromance thing.
037	I'm being respectful of their boy feelings because I'm the best older sister there is.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
038	Ha! Okay.
039	Plus... There was something I wanted to talk to you about.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
040	All right. What's on your mind?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
041	I feel like Benika and I have kind of hit it off recently, you know? Like, we're starting to open up a little more with each other.
042	...Okay. And?
043	Could you tell me more about her? I'd like to know what she was like when you two were growing up.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
044	Hah!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
045	Excellent strike! However...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0044
046	Ack!
047	It may behoove you to rest up a bit more before we leave. I feel like you're still reeling from the last battle.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
048	I know that would be the best thing for me right now.	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
049	But I don't have it in me to rest. I'm much too anxious for what's to come.
050	I can't stop thinking about it. Even you could barely handle those two last time. What chance do I have?
051	Actually, I think you have a greater chance of holding your own here than I ever could.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
052	What? How do you figure?
053	Daphne, your opponent is a Shield Maiden, just like you.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
054	The first of them all, no less!
055	She must loom large in your mind, but don't forget what your king told you.
056	He said that true power reveals itself when it's wielded to protect something. And he spoke those words of the knights of Envy.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
057	She has nothing left to protect. You do. In this, you are rich beyond measure.
058	That's...true.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0005
059	I do have something to protect. A lot of things, in fact.
060	...
061	Huh? Wh-what is it? Why are you staring at me?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
062	This is shaping up to be quite the final battle. I'll see you on the other side, yeah?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
063	Y-yes, of course!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0007
064	...
065	Ignacio. Hey! Ignacio!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
066	Hmph. What do you want?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
067	Are you sure you're on board with all this?
068	With recognizing Nimul as the new leader, you mean? Of course I am. He's rightfully earned the spot, hasn't he?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
069	I've already lost my chance at atonement. All that's left for me now is to follow his lead, and do whatever it is I still can.
070	...Okay. How about this?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
071	After this battle is finished, let's plant a forest. Right here, in this Belt Region.
072	What? What's this now, all of a sudden?
073	I'm just thinking, we can plant a wide forest that stretches across the whole border... Thick enough that no one will want to come in. A place where no one will bother us, and we can live peacefully...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
074	Filled with the sounds of the grass rustling, the wind whistling, the birds singing, and the river burbling. A place where we can build a proper tomb for our father, to honor his memory.
075	You know I won't live to see that forest in its full splendor.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
076	But I'll remember you. And I'll think of you every time I go there.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0007
077	My awkward, bumbling, stubbornly cute little brother who had the gall to grow taller than me.
078	...
079	Whatever you do, even if you take the weight of the whole world onto your shoulders, just remember: I will always be with you. You can count on my support till your very last breath.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
080	Yes... I know I can.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
081	...
082	This brings back memories, doesn't it?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
083	Eulalia? What is it? Did you need something from me?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
084	Need? No. Want? Yes. I want to know what you're hiding. Because you are definitely hiding something, aren't you?
085	Yes, I am.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
086	And you have no intention of telling any of us what it is, do you?
087	There's no need for any of you to know.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
088	I see. That's how you're going to play it, then?
089	You shouldn't make things so difficult for Nimul, you know.
090	That's...not my intention.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
091	I actually intended to stop him before things ever got to this point.
092	I'm just always a little too late at the most crucial moments, it seems.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
093	That's the way of the world. We always try to control our own destinies, even as those destinies slip farther and farther out of our grasp.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
094	That's the eternal struggle.
095	Do you think there's still time to change the future?
096	So long as it remains only what might be, and is not set in stone, I think there is.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
097	Right. Thank you, Eulalia. I'll keep that in mind.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
098	...
099	I wish you the best of luck in stopping Nimul, Waginau.
100	I refuse to believe that defeating Ouroboros is impossible. There must be some path to victory for us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
101	Yet I remain plagued with doubt. Mostly due to what awaits at the end of the battle, if we're successful:
102	Creation...
103	(Once we defeat the god, then begins the real work of building a new world with new rules.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
104	Whose world is it to be? Whose will stands to shape it?
105	(If we're the ones who perform the Ceremony of Creation, then it's going to be our world, with our rules.)
106	To pull any of this off, though, we'll need to take back that tower.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
107	But for the sake of forging a world in which no one ever has to be sad, and no one ever has to suffer...
108	I must persevere. There's too much at stake to fail now!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
109	...
110	Will you not take some time to rest, Nimul?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
111	Waginau?
112	No, I don't need rest. There are far more important things to focus on right now. I'll rest when it's all over.
113	But since you're here, I wanted to ask you about that power you used. It's completely separate from the power of both the Fallen and the dragons. Almost as if...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
114	It was passed along to me in that place where the memories of the dragons still linger.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
115	Oh!
116	There, I saw their history. I saw the past; it was a time when this world was thoroughly bathed in sin.
117	I see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
118	Nimul. Are you certain this is the right path? Are you certain that the world you've been dreaming of truly awaits us at the end of this journey?
119	I believe in that future, yes. With every fiber of my being. But if it turns out I'm wrong...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
120	I hope that you'll stop me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
121	...
122	Of course. Even if it costs me my life.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
123	I didn't expect that this would take as long as it has.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
124	Nor did I.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
125	Hah!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
126	That's what underestimating us gets ya! Haha.
127	I'm loath to admit that we underestimated you indeed. We are more impervious to attack than ever before, but that doesn't make us any faster or more nimble.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
128	Yet it's clear that your own power has run dry. We've run you down, and there's no more fight left for you to give.
129	Tch... Empty, huh? Just my luck.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
130	Do as you will, then. I guess I'm at your mercy.
131	Hmph. Then mercy, I shall grant. I'll make this quick, and see to it you don't suffer.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
132	Wait, Mesarthim.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0015
133	Just leave him. Whatever happens next, he will die. There's no reason to speed the process along. Let him suffer.
134	What an uncharacteristic thing for you to say.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
135	You think so? Look at him. He's clearly baiting us. I'm sure he's got some kind of trap he's waiting to spring as you draw close.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
136	Ah, that does stand to reason.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0005
137	Then I'll just go on ahead. Once I find the others, I'll apprehend them. If you don't want to miss out on the coming battle, you'd best not tarry here.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0037
138	...
139	What? You want something from me?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
140	Are you satisfied with dying like this, in this place?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
141	Heh. What are you on about?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0012
142	Never mind. It was a pointless query.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
143	I'll say.
144	You still alive, Shahel?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
145	Unfortunately, yes, though I suspect not for much longer.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0042
146	Huh. Hmph. Never thought I'd be sharing my last dying breaths with you, of all people.
147	Haha. Someone you've left behind whom you'd rather share this time with?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0008
148	Don't start with me.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0039
149	I really didn't need to be reminded of her.
150	I'm sure you didn't, as she was no doubt on your mind this whole time.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
151	Just die already, would you?!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
152	I could. And it would be a contented death, all things considered. I got to see my children grow up and learn to stand on their own two feet.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
153	I think you're giving them too much credit. That son of yours in particular is the kind of fool who's no doubt going to keep making the same mistakes over and over till the day he dies.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
154	Couldn't the same be said of all humans?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
155	You think that little of us, huh? I'd call you an inhuman monster, but it somehow loses its meaning when directed at someone who isn't actually human.
156	What about you? Are you satisfied? Do you have any regrets?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
157	Huh? Of course I do!
158	But they're not what weigh heaviest on my mind.
159	This is a world in which living equals pain. There's no life without suffering. Everybody's got a raw deal from the day they're born.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
160	But that world is finally coming to an end. It's being remade from scratch, hopefully into something much fairer and nicer for everybody.
161	And the fact is, in that new world, there's just no place for a villain like me. I'm a relic that's better left buried and forgotten.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
162	You always have been one to sort everything into categories. It seems only fitting you've found a category for yourself now as well.
163	Hmph.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
164	Personally, I... I would've quite liked to see the future these humans create. I'm sure it will have many splendors to sample for those afforded the opportunity.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0011
165	Greedy to the end, huh?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0011
166	Shahel. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that despite dying before you, I might yet have the opportunity to observe your final moments.	VO_esai.esai_battle_0019
167	What a beautiful ending to your story. Just as I taught you, you took everything you had at your disposal and spent it on achieving your ends.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
168	I would be a poor teacher if I did not do the same in measuring the true worth of the prospective masters of this impending new world.
169	...Though I suppose my work has never been quite so high-minded. I'm really just a cleaner, who rids humanity of its very worst dregs.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0010
