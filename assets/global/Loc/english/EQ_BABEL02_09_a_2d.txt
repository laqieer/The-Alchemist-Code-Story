001	(I was born into the dark elf aristocracy.)	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
002	(When I was young, our age-old blood feud with the high elves spurred us to challenge them to a war...which we lost.)
003	(As a condition for our surrender and an offering of peace, like a slave, I was given unto the high elves. Then...)	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0018
004	(I met him.)
005	(My eternity.)
006	Our next target will be the cleric of the Holy Order, based in Wratharis.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
007	This man is a former aristocrat of Wratharis. He works in the shadows with the affluential elite of other provinces, all lining their own pockets.
008	However, money isn't the only thing they've stockpiled. They've also managed to acquire a Philosopher's Stone.
009	We're going to ambush him and take the stone for ourselves!
010	Failure is not an option!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
011	As you command.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
012	(What we desire is power... Immense power; enough to make the world tremble before us. Our ultimate goal...)
013	(Is to create a perfectly balanced world.)
014	Ila, our mark will have the Holy Guard protecting him, so don’t be reckless.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
015	Got it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
016	Heh. You’ve grown.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0007
017	What?! Shaddap! I don't like the way you're talkin'.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
018	Don’t slack off on your prep.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
019	Ila!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
020	What do you want, squirt?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
021	I just wanted to tell you to be careful... Come back safely, all right?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0010
022	Course! I'll be seeing ya in a bit.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
023	See you soon!	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
024	...
025	You all right, Sis?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
026	Hmm...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
027	You're looking a little pale.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
028	Don't worry about me; I'm fine. I have to keep fighting until the bitter end for Lord Zahar's sake.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
029	If you say so...
030	(Shadow Messiah... An underground organization led by Zahar, former Holy Guard dude, and Hero among the Knights of Wratharis.)	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
031	(Still don't know what they're after, but it's likely they wanna ambush the former aristocracy of Wratharis or high-ranking Holy Order members to steal their Philosopher's Stone. That's the sort of evil association they are.)
032	(But then, they also have a sense of comradery! I don't get them at all... What the heck are they exactly?!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
033	Coren...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
034	Yes, Corvus? What can I do you for?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
035	This will be your first battle. Show me what an assassin of Wadatsumi can do!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
036	Leave it to me, sir! I won’t let you down!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
037	Good, we’ll be heading out soon.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
038	Sir, yes, sir!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
039	(Corvus... An ex-Paladin and a comrade of Zahar from his days in the Holy Guard... He's the second son of the Leonhart household, a family of renowned assassins who've since given up the trade.)	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
040	(He was the vice-captain of the Knights of Wratharis and continues to be the right hand of Zahar to this day. His role is to keep the rest of the Shadow Messiah in line.)
041	(And last but not least...)
042	Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
043	What's the matter?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
044	...
045	I see... I understand.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
046	(Letitia... A woman whose identity is a total mystery, but who's never far from Zahar's side. Commonly referred to as...)
047	...
048	(Jeepers! Our eyes met! Has she found me out?!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
049	Tch...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
050	(I should stay clear of her, especially if she's worked out my true motives...)
051	(Letitia...also known as the Holy Mother of Darkness. What a cool name!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
052	Who was that?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
053	Who? Oh. Coren? He was once an assassin of Wadatsumi. I thought we could use him, so I recruited him.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
054	I see... You must keep an eye on him.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
055	What? You got a problem with him?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
056	Do your shadows not whisper to you...?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
057	What do you expect them to say?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
058	No, never mind...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
059	I won't, then.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
060	Lord Zahar, all preparations have been completed.
061	Good. Let us be off on our way.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
062	(Vettel, I think I'm gonna need you! Don't leave me hanging here, man!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
063	Ack! Zahar, stop this already!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
064	Hahaha! Try and stop me...if you can!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
065	I shall usher in a new age! A world that craves eternal darkness! As supreme ruler, I shall herald the truth of the world! I will not be stopped by the likes of you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
066	You will never succeed! I won't let you!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
067	Pl-please save me! I'm begging you! Look, I have gold—all this and more!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0019
068	J-just take it and leave m—
069	How pitiful... Did you not understand? Your money holds no sway over us.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
070	Eeeeek!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
071	N-no! Do you know who I am?! I am a cleric of the Holy Order!
072	My power should be enough to—
073	Urgggh...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
074	We shall take the Philosopher's Stone off your hands.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
075	Ngh...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
076	Bah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
077	We have accomplished what we came here for.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
078	Very well. I shall finish you another time, Vettel.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
079	You dare flee, Zahar?!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
080	Be grateful, Vettel. I'm letting you live...until we meet again.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
081	Dangit!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0042
082	Vettel... We failed in protecting the cleric.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
083	Curses! This is what you call justice, Zahar?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
084	...
085	Hey!
086	R...Ren.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
087	Stay strong...Ren.
088	Hey... Has Lord Zahar seemed in a bad mood to you, ever since getting back?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
089	Well, he must get tired just like the rest of us.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
090	Of course.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
091	I'm a little worried. What if I brought out Woody? Do you think Woody would cheer him up?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
092	Um... I don't think that's such a great idea.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0011
093	Lord Zahar...playin' with a plushie... I can't see that ever goin' down!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0029
094	I can't stand it anymore. I'm going to go see if he's okay!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
095	Hey, wait! Sis! Get back here! You're only going to infuriate him!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
096	She's gone, you know...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
097	Spica... You really do love him, don't you?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0008
098	...
099	(How long have I watched over you from the shadows?)
100	(Such anguish... Such sadness... Such uneasiness... All the emotions you try to hide from everyone—I know all about them.)
101	Heheh... Muahahah!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
102	The most beautiful things are also the most beautiful when destroyed. No two exist in this world. I will witness the moment that I destroy its existence.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
103	This is the highest pleasure that has been provided to the chosen. The powerful are the ones who rewrite history!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
104	I will eliminate everything that stands in my way and bring myself closer to perfection!
105	(Even your subtle quirks are no secret to me. Since your escape from that extravagant prison in your youth, you have pressed ever on toward your destiny.)
106	(There's only one thing I haven't told him yet, but I suspect he already knows...)
107	(To become a dark elf is to shorten one's lifespan.)
108	(Furthermore, only half of your lineage is elven... There is simply no telling when your life will draw to a close.)
109	(I know that what you wish to destroy...is not the world itself, but rather...yourself.)
110	(You seek a graceful way of ending your existence... Zahar, you've already come to that realization, but decide to play the fool instead.)
111	(If that is what you desire, I'll play along, too. Your wish to change the world is yet another sliver of the true you, shining through.)
112	(Yes... That guileless promise from long ago...)
113	(A beautiful lie you told for my sake...but a lie which drove you to come this far for me.)
114	(We've been together for almost an eternity, and yet, I have to apologize: I've told you one lie.)
115	(No... My feelings for you have transcended the realm of simple words.)
116	(However, if I were to put them into words...)
117	What is on your mind?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
118	I...need more power.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
119	I do not have the strength to defeat Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard, and the Holy Order... Perhaps I do not have the power to establish an order of darkness.
120	You are the conqueror who shall become the King of Darkness. You must have the strength to bear that burden.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
121	Listen to me, Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0037
122	...
123	You and I were destined to meet. It is my fate to become your strength.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
124	Thank you... My dearest sister.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
125	Just promise me that my death will be quick and painless.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
126	(I offer you my life. I have lived for this moment, and know that this was the reason for us meeting.)
127	However...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
128	Letitia, you were the only one in that prison who would smile at me. You are everything to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
129	(You have no idea how long I have waited for this moment.)
130	(My life will be part of your life. My strength your strength. I will live on forever, inside of you.)
131	(There's no point in saying anything...but even if there isn't...forgive me.)
132	I adore you.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
133	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgh! Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
134	Wha—?! Eeeek! What’s going on...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
135	(Lord Zahar... He... He murdered Letitia!)	VO_spica.spica_sys_1021
136	Lord Za-Zahar...! Wait! Don't go!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
137	(No! This isn't me! I'm loyal at heart! I only live to serve him!)	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
138	(Yet... Yet...!)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0019
139	Letitia... That's not fair at all.
140	(You...get to be with him forever.)
141	I...killed Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
142	What...?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
143	Her powers of alchemy now reside in me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
144	Le...titia...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
145	(I will never forgive you, from now until the end of time.)
146	Are you really going?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
147	But why?! Spica, why do you have to go?!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0019
148	I'm sorry... I cannot stay by his side any longer.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
149	...
150	Lord Zahar must keep moving forward. However, I’m...afraid. I’m not worthy of being by his side.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
151	I’m really...really...sorry.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
152	What are you saying?! I don’t accept this! You hear me?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
153	...
154	Are you really sure, though, Sis?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
155	I am. I know now, I can never be like him.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
156	I felt your ambition beating in my chest. For a hollow blade such as mine, it is just cause.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
157	You called yourself...Zehn? What is it you want from me?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
158	I simply seek one thing: to know the truth behind each swing of my sword. That is the destination of my travels.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
159	(If I follow him, perhaps I could regain that which I have lost to the darkness...)
160	Heh heh... By all means. I, Zahar, will take you with me into the future!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
161	In that case, I offer you my services and vow to wield my sword in your name, until the day I am consumed by darkness.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0037
162	Welcome. Heh heh.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
163	(Since that day, Lord Zahar’s darkness has only grown deeper.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
164	With my power over darkness, I shall cleanse the world by converting its false light into darkness, thus exposing the truth to the world. Therein lies the path to the undistorted truth.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
165	I shall serve you faithfully.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0038
166	(The mine, eh? They're going after the motherload of Philosopher's Stones! Whelp! Now that I've reported it to Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard will stop Zahar in his tracks!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
167	(Still... Can’t quite put my finger on it...but I’m getting a real spooky vibe...)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
168	(Letitia's gone, and core members like Spica and Silma, have disappeared, too. Now, there’s this newbie... Zehn.)
169	(Things have changed drastically around here since I joined the crew. Zahar himself, too...)
170	(That’s it...fear. The only thing I feel around him anymore, is fear. It's a bit of a shocker... Could I...of all people...fear someone?)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
171	(What in the blazes is going on in Shadow Messiah?)
172	Ila! Are you really going to leave?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
173	Do you even need ta ask? 'Course I’m going!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
174	I can't really explain it, but I feel like something bad is about to happen... Look, even Woody thinks so, too! Please, don’t go!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
175	Don't be daft! I'll be back, silly! You just sit tight and wait for me.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
176	...
177	Lord Zahar... What is going on?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
178	There's not a single Philosopher's Stone here!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
179	We've been deceived...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
180	What...?!
181	Arghhh!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
182	L-Lord Zahar!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
183	(Vettel, what's the big idea?! This wasn't the plan!)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
184	You?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
185	Lord Zahar! The mine's about to collapse! Quick, we must escape!	VO_niggle.niggle_battle_0019
186	Full retreat!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
187	So...it was you people after all.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0021
188	Zahar, this is the end for you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
189	Words from a decaying corpse mean naught to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0029
190	Indeed... Words are not needed where you're going!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
191	My path of conquest...will not end here!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
