001	Whooaaa!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
002	This is...seriously amazing...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0044
003	So beautiful...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
004	Th-th-this is it, isn't it?! The Stub Rule flower garden! I think it is, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
005	Yes...there's no doubt it's this flower. But...what's going on here?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
006	To think a flower garden would be here in such a snowy country...even the wind here is a little warm.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
007	There aren't many trees around here, so it's a little bit brighter, but...the warmth of this wind is strange. Is it magic?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
008	But there aren't any witches here, are there? I don't feel any magic...and the ice just now was strange too.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
009	Speaking of strange, isn't that amazing?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
010	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
011	Butterflies?! And so many of them!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
012	The insects that didn't become vermin must have gathered here. So that explains why it's warm.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0044
013	...I get it now.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0045
014	Alma?
015	I understand why the Stub Rule is called the flower of everlasting love in this country.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
016	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
017	By living near the flowers they gave as presents, these men might be trying to hold onto the love they felt while they were human.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
018	That's the real expression of everlasting love.
019	Oh, right! I understand now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
020	The love you gave wasn't self-sacrifice...you left your love in the form of your children and you stay here not to forget that love.
021	I wonder if my father is here as well...
022	He is...I'm sure of it! I won't forget the love I received from my father either!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
023	I'll always remember! So, please, butterflies, give me just one of those flowers!
024	It will be proof of our fathers' love, our mothers' who raised us until now...and the love of our friends.
025	I see. Well, that's quite some adventure, Liz. Thank you for the Stub Rules.	VO_katya.katya_sys_0044
026	Yes! I'll always love you, mom.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
027	Blood is thicker than water. He said that same thing.	VO_katya.katya_sys_0007
028	Right, Dad as well... Oh, Mom! You need to open the shop...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
029	Hm? No...today I'll take the day off. I don't know...today, let's relax together as a family.	VO_katya.katya_sys_0006
030	Mom...
031	Thanks. Liz, thank you for coming to this world...and for being by my side.	VO_katya.katya_sys_0033
032	...Right back at you, Mom!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
033	(It was difficult, but I'm glad I worked hard!)
034	(Dad was able to overcome that difficult journey all on his own without using magic.)
035	(That's how much he loved my mom. He gave his life so that I could live. I'm sure he's watching over me somewhere now.)
036	(I wish I could've met him...I'm sure he was a strong and gentle person.)
037	(I hope that someday I'll have that same strength and power.)
