001	Huff...huff...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	Th-there's no end to them. How many monsters can you summon?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
003	These results come from an unbroken effort of witches throughout the history of Lustburg. With your lack of experience, you are no match for me.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_battle_0016
004	It stings my pride to see just how inferior we are!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
005	Young witches like you probably don't know this...	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0030
006	Why do you think the witches of this country worked so hard to improve their magic?
007	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
008	In the past, the witches of this country sought Asmodeus in the clouds much like you are now. However, they could not reach it.
009	Some rode on brooms to fly, others would hold out wooden sticks in an attempt to pluck the Sacred Stone from the sky, but not one could reach it.
010	Eventually, people decided that the image of a witch on a broom, holding a wand-like stick towards the sky suited us.
011	Magic could not reach Alchemy. We decided never again to repeat our mistake.
012	That is why we continue to improve our magic, in order to obtain a power that can stand against Alchemy.
013	Prepare yourself, Lisbeth Finn Lustburg!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0013
014	This country has suffered under the curse of Alchemy. You must be made to understand the grudge we witches hold and how we oppose it with magic.
