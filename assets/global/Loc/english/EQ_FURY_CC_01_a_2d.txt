001	I believed that the world revolved around me.
002	Blue skies followed me everywhere I went, and I was always there to watch the starry skies fade into daylight.
003	I never imagined I might see this world, my world, crashing down on me.
004	Like a tsunami. Like the earth splitting open and swallowing everything whole.
005	Like a meteor plummeting into the earth.
006	I never could have imagined that inky sky full of stars coming down to crush me.
007	Don't you realize what you're doing?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
008	You're no better than Greed Dike.
009	Hold up a mirror, and I would be swallowed by the curse that lingers, however faintly, inside of me.
010	The country that you are now trying to invade is the same as Wadatsumi was...
011	My gouged wounds fester and destroy me.
012	These people that live in grief are the same as you were once.
013	Yet even as I wallow like this in sentimental remembrance, I feel a chill run down my spine at my own stifling narcissism.
014	The sounds of the world going on as it should were painful to my ears.
015	Just say the magic words.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
016	It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine.
017	These are the magic words. All you have to do is say them. "It doesn't hurt."	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
018	Whenever you are in pain and afraid, put your hands together and say these words with me five times.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
019	One, two, three, four, five.
020	Can you do that, Lady Kagura?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
021	I-it doesn't hurt!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
022	Escort Lady Kagura somewhere safe. I will take care of the rest.
023	Please be safe.
024	Lady Button.
025	Report.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
026	The anti-royal faction's surprise attack has left our troops at a disadvantage.
027	We believe their goal is to use their Chakra-wielding troops and Samurai Summoners to lay siege to Castle Aquila Rubrum.
028	And our allies?
029	Since you said you would be making an appearance, I have taken the liberty of ordering our troops into position and having them open up a path for you through the line of fire.
030	Thank you. You are dismissed.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0033
031	Understood. Fight well!
032	...
033	It's always been like this.
034	How long will the people of Wadatsumi continue to fight amongst themselves?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_battle_0019
035	Cursed Cannon Artillery!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0032
036	Samurai!
037	I will end this. Even if all I can do in this moment is fight, someday I will put a stop to it. Everything I do is for a better future.
038	Our cause is just.
039	I believed that the world revolved around me.
