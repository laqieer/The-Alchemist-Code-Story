001	Huzzah!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0032
002	(I'm outnumbered, but...)	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0019
003	(With Will and Magnus on my side, I can't lose! I just have to hold out a little longer!)
004	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
005	Ngh!
006	Wait... Isn't this...?!
007	That seed you gave me is starting to grow! You've gotta come see!
008	Ooh! Really? Show me!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
009	Wow! It has sprouted, hasn't it? Great work!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0024
010	I was worried it'd never grow down here... It's like a miracle!
116	It's thanks to everyone that this little guy is growing so well! I can't wait to see what kinda flower it'll turn out to be!
011	(I have to protect that flower!)
012	Huzzzaaaaahh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0008
013	Ngh...	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0042
014	You should learn to keep your eye on the enemy, girl. Getting distracted could cost you your life, if you're not careful.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
015	Tch...	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0019
016	(There must be something I can do here! After all, there's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it!)
017	Huh? What's...?
018	(One of the incantation tubes has broken! Water's flowing out of it... I can use this!)	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
019	Enough games! Time to fin—
020	Take that!	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0004
021	Graaargh! Y-you...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
022	These were the first incantation gears I ever made. I installed them in Real Heaven to provide people with water and electricity. To help us survive.
023	Is that a...hose? Hah! What're you planning to do, splash me with water?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
024	Now, I'm going to use this incantation gear to defend my hometown!	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0007
025	Hah! You're bluffing. Water isn't going to save you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
026	Oh, but...it's not just water, you know.
027	What?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
028	After all, if you don't draw the cards of fate yourself, you'll never get anywhere in life!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0032
029	Aaaaaarghh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0028_a
030	Ryui! You okay?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
031	You sure took your time, Magnus! What sort of mentor stands back and lets his apprentice get driven into a corner?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
032	Sorry. I had my hands full.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0035
033	Still, I'm almost surprised you didn't try to finish the job all by yourself.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
034	Why would I? We're in this together, after all.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0004
035	Glad to hear it. Good work wrapping things up here, by the way. It should all be over now. We've got everyone else taking part in the purge restrained.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
036	Already?! How about the townspeople? Are they all right?
037	You can count on Will to make sure of that—it's kind of his field of expertise. Just sit down for a minute. You deserve a little rest.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
038	I have to say, that was a pretty interesting trick you pulled. I never would've thought to use a hose to spray electrified water...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
039	Well, I was the one who installed those incantation gears. That's why I brought this with me—and it was a good thing I did, too.
040	Do you always carry around a hose and insulated gloves?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
041	Like I said before, it's best to be prepared for any situation. At least one of the items is bound to come in handy, and, so long as you have the proper tools, there's nothing you can't handle!
042	Hah. In your case, I don't doubt it.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
043	And so, the purge of Real Heaven came to an end before it had truly begun, and was quietly buried from public sight.
044	I can't believe this! I have to write a statement of regret, and I'm on archive organization duty for weeks!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
045	Good! Now you're officially a troublemaker, just like us. Welcome to the team.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
046	Way I see it, you got off light. You owe Captain Kaya and Othima big time.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
047	As for us, we just happened to be there. Bit of an unfortunate coincidence, really.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0003
048	Which makes it justified self-defense that we got involved. At least, that's the story our beloved captain made the higher-ups swallow. And that's why you're dealing with books and letters instead of, y'know, getting dismissed.
049	The fact that we even need an excuse to protect a town and its people to begin with is hard to swallow, huh? So much for the allies of justice...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
050	I agree.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
051	But that's enough chitchat! Are you two still working on your apology statements?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
052	Hurry up and get them done so you can help me organize these documents!
053	Well, it's a big job, and it ought to be done right. So if anyone's going to take care of it, Ryui, I think it should be you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
054	It's not a job, it's our punishment!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0029
055	Whatever. Anyway, it's not like I have anything to write. As far as I'm concerned, I've got nothing to apologize for.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
056	And why're you asking me for help? I've helped you out enough already, haven't I?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
057	Yeah! Ditto!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
058	Oh, don't start that again!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
059	Hmph.
060	But you're right about one thing... You have helped me out a lot.
061	Which is why...there's something you should know.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
062	What? Did you realize that there're things more important than filling your belly?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
063	Huh?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
064	If so, I've got nothing left to teach you. My work here is done.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
065	Magnus...
066	Are you sure about this?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
067	I am. The town's recovery efforts aren't making much progress, and my incantation gear could make all the difference.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0004
068	I see. Still, I'm sure you could find a way to assist them using your current position.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
069	I thought about that, but then I realized something.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
070	I don't want them to be alone.
071	I want to be an ally of justice for Real Heaven. I want to help them like Magnus and Will helped me.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
072	Oh? And how do you plan to do that?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
073	First, I'm going to create a flower garden.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
074	I know it's a small change, but I really think it will make all the difference in lifting people's spirits.
075	I think that's a wonderful idea.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
076	Thank you. You know...there's no guarantee that something like this won't happen again. And if it did, I would always make the same choice, regardless of what the higher-ups said.
077	I don't want to cause trouble for you or Mister Othima a third time.
078	Captain Othima, you mean.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
079	Oh, right. Though, you know, I think he's stopped correcting me over it.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0036
080	You will be missed.
081	Hee hee. You think so? Oh! By the way, if you ever want to update or mod Antie, come see me anytime!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
082	In fact, my doors will always be open to you, whatever you need! And, for you, all prices are negotiable! Know that you have a friend in Real Heaven, if ever you're in need!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0008
083	I appreciate that. Thank you, Ryui.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
084	No, thank you! For everything.
085	You've changed, Ryui. Or should I say...grown?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
086	I honestly can't thank you enough, Mister Othima. You've done so much for me.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0001
087	So, if ever you're in need of a new client, come see me! I'll be sure to give you a good deal.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
088	And last, but certainly not least: Magnus, Will... Thank you for being my mentors, through thick and thin.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
089	I hope you'll still get your work done, even without me there to remind you.
090	No promises.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0035
091	Really? What are our hard-earned taxes paying for, then? Come on, you know you can get your work done fast enough that you'd have plenty of time to slack off afterwards!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
092	You really are the biggest pair of good-for-nothing lazybones I've ever met! You never take anything seriously, and I honestly don't understand why they keep you around, but...
093	Still, there's no one I'd rather have watch my back when I'm fighting for the justice of the continent.
094	Thank you for helping me protect my hometown...and learn to love it again.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0008
095	Have fun out there.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
096	You'll be a great role model for that town.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0006
097	Haha. I'll do my best to make you proud. Well... See you!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0037
098	Will, Magnus... I'm glad I left her in your care. Make no mistake: You're the ones who put that sunny smile on her face. Give yourselves a pat on the back.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
099	Thanks to you...she's going to do just fine out there.
100	Are you going to miss her?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
101	I dunno about that.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
102	Besides, at the end of the day, she was too good for us.
103	I'm not sure I agree.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
104	Regardless, having watched the two of you over the course of your mentorship, I can honestly say that you have impressed me. You are surprisingly motivated when the cause suits you, yes?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
105	Huh?
106	Haha. I have to say, the way you fought like vigilantes of justice was pretty inspiring.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
107	I'm planning on telling Monzein about it sometime over drinks—he'd get a real kick out of it. You should join us!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
108	Wait a sec... Were you watching us?!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0029
109	Wouldn't you like to know? Keep up the good work, allies of justice. Hmhm.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0041
110	They're not going to let this one go, are they?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
111	You've gotta be kidding me...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
112	Well, whatever. Guess we might as well act the part and get our work done for a change. Wouldn't want to give our friend down in "Heaven" nightmares.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
113	Heheh. If she found out we were slacking off, she'd probably burst in here and demand that we pay her back all the taxes we wasted.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
114	I wouldn't put it past her. But...let's just enjoy tonight. We can start on our backlog of work tomorrow.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
115	So, what're you in the mood for? Blackjack, or poker?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
