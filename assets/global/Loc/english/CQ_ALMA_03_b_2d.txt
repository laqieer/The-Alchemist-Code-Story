001	The insects won't go away! Why?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
002	I was just wondering the same thing!
003	(Could the monsters from earlier have been stung by the insects and that's why they came this way? But that still doesn't explain why the insects are going wild like this...)
004	Agh... Insects don't normally want to attack people, so why is this happening?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
005	They don't want to attack? Based on what? Humans and insects can't communicate with each other...	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
006	Huh?
007	(The insects are trying to chase off the students near the stew pot? Which means...)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
008	Oh!
009	Lisbeth! I think the Vermin might just be hungry!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
010	What?! They're hungry?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	I see. Then let's give them all the leftover stew!
012	Hyup!
013	Wait, what are you doing?! You can't carry a pot while riding a broom!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
014	I'm going to fly up with my Broom Ace and carry the stew to the middle of the forest!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
015	This way we can get the insects away from here without hurting them. Plus, they'll get to eat to their heart's content!
016	That makes sense... Hold up! A new student flying around without approval will only end up with them getting penalties!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0045
017	You're willing to go that far?! They're just insects and you... You could lose a lot!
018	But the insects were once men and...precious to someone.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
019	What?!
020	I want to use my magic to help people!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
021	(Insects were once precious to someone?! I want to help people?!)
022	(This the first time I've heard a witch say anything like that. This is my first time meeting a witch who uses magic for others.)
023	Whoa! This pot is heavy! Still, here I gooooooo!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
024	Heh.
025	Ahahaha, you're doing it! You're drifting all over the place...and you almost hurt yourself there...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0008
026	Ugh, geez! I just can't keep watching this!
027	Alma?!
028	I'll go with you! We can carry the pot together!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0032
029	Oh! Okay! Let's do this!
030	I think this is far enough. Let's set the pot down here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
031	Let's do it! One, two!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
032	Three!
033	Nice! The insects are coming after it! Let's fly, Lisbeth!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
034	Yeah!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
035	We did it! The insects are focused on the stew!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
036	This should put everyone at ease. Huh? My broom is shaking... Whoa!
037	Ah! Lisbeth! Watch out!
038	Ugh... Ouch. Broom Aces sure are hard to handle.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
039	Huh? Where'd Alma go?! Alma?! Where are you?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
040	Ow ow ow... You... You're good with speed, but your balance needs some serious work.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0043
041	You're under me?! I-I'm so sorry, Alma! Are you okay?!
042	Ehehe... Sure, Liz. Can I call you Liz? I think we're friends now.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1011
043	Yeah! Hehehehe!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
044	Alma, Lisbeth! I was wondering where you went. I'm glad you're okay.
045	Your stew made us all feel better! Thank you.
046	Also, sorry for how I acted earlier.
047	Hehe, you did it, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
048	Yup!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
049	Phew, our worries are over! Is Yui okay?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
050	Ungh...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0042
051	Oh yeah, why did the insects only go after you?
052	Wh-why, you say?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0025
053	Hey! Wait a second! What did you just drop right now?!
054	"This is a herb Vermin love to eat and, when heated up, is toxic to the human body and causes stomach pain." We just learned that in class the other day!
055	Wow! Good job remembering that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
056	We just had that class, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
057	R-really?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
058	So it was Yui! You switched out the herbs! And you lied about Alma telling you to do it, didn't you?!
059	Uh...
060	Geez.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
061	No way, why would anyone do that? Oh! Maybe you messed up and grabbed a similar herb?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
062	Lisbeth, are you trying to help me? Or are you trying to make me look stupid?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0013
063	Acting like a good girl won't make you a witch. You'll never make it to the top!
064	What?! That wasn't what I was trying to do...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
065	I can't keep listening to this... Now listen here, you!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0012
066	What?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0012
067	You need to stop looking down on people! What are you even aiming for?!
068	If making it to the top means doing crappy things like this, then I'd rather aim for the bottom.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0003
069	Personally, what I'm aiming for is something beyond the clouds. I think you need to decide what you really want.
070	I thought you all were making a lot of noise. Just what are you all doing?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0016
071	Um...	VO_alma.alma_event_1007
072	Phew, I finished. What about you, Liz?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0022
073	Ergh... I'm terrible at writing assignments.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
074	Reflecting on today's practice and mistakes, formulating a plan for future improvements... This is more like an apology letter than a report.
075	And isn't the thing we should be reflecting about the fact that we used magic?
076	Because we hurt each other through personal feelings and accusations, everyone got a zero for today's practice... The witches with elite aspirations are probably smarting from this...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
077	But the bonds of our class have gotten deeper!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
078	Really? Well, if you say so, Liz. At any rate...
079	If the teacher hadn't shown up in the end, things could've gotten bad. Why did I get so mad like that?! You're the one that should've been mad.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
080	I was more sad than mad, honestly...
081	That's why I was glad when you got mad for me instead!
082	Huh? You were happy about that?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
083	Yes! After all, it means you really think of me as a friend, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
084	In your place, I would have been upset too that someone would being so terrible to my friend!
085	Is that what that was? I see. If it was you that was the target, you'd have let it slide, but because it's a friend...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0045
086	(Because Liz is my friend, I couldn't forgive anything that put such a sad look on her face.)
087	(I always thought getting close to someone was just a way to collect information.)
088	(But having a true friend doesn't sound so bad.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
089	Now that I think about it... Why did you try to protect me when everyone doubted me?
090	Because I never thought for a single second that you'd do something like that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
091	I think that you're a kind person and I was happy when you said you wanted to make a delicious stew with me!
092	Ahaha! Another example of your unique thought process. Is that why you jumped headfirst into trouble like you did?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0008
093	I wouldn't say I jumped in headfirst... Eheheh.
094	Honestly, it's nothing to be laughing over.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
095	But thanks to doing me that, we became friends! I'm so happy!
096	Heh heh... Me too.
097	I've done a lot of things up until now to protect myself.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
098	But watching you, Liz, made me realize that using my power for others might be nice.
099	So I'll do my best to help you if you're ever in trouble and need me to lend you a helping hand.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
100	Alma...
101	Or rather, as your friend, I have to keep an eye on you! I can't leave you to your own devices.
102	No way! Am I that unreliable?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0022
103	Buuut if with you're with me, I can do anything!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
104	You doing reckless things will put me in a bind, you hear?!
105	Ehehe! Well, at least I don't think I'll ever get bored with you around!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
