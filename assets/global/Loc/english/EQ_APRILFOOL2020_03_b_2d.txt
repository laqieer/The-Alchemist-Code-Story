001	Mmgf, umgf... Apples, huh? I suppose you can't be all bad.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
002	It's kinda concerning how easily her views are swayed...
003	Shall I take you to him?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
004	If a container is an object for serving food, does that mean everything that touches food is a container?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
005	Huh? Oh. Hey, Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
006	Acht... You are not such a container.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
007	I think he's talking about the piece of apple stuck to your cheek.
008	Oh! Umgf... Thanks.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
009	As for you... I'd heard someone was looking for me, but I thought they'd be a little more... satisfactory.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
010	Wh-whoa! Could you back it up a bit? You don't need to get right up in my face!
011	You've got some apple on your collar.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
012	Umgf.
013	He ate it?!
014	Level Up!
015	There's that voice again... What happened this time?
016	These apples aren't very good. I'm sure you must still be hungry, Acht.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
017	Yeah, a bit.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0005
018	See? I knew it! When it comes to apples, you can never have enough!
019	Speaking of apples, I believe I heard someone—I can't remember who—say that they were cultivating apples that would really fill you up.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
020	No way! You mean like ones that'll give you even more EXP than Crystal Apples?! Huh...? Crystal... Apples? What're those again? Anyway, Sol—we need to talk.
021	We do?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
022	About?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
023	Well, since we're both transfer students and all, I thought... I thought... What was it? I could've sworn it was something important...
024	Loss... I know the feeling. Sometimes the things that are important to us just... slip away.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
025	Huh? Did I... lose something?
026	I wonder... If one day you suddenly lost all sense of something you once knew, would you be afraid?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
027	I... Huh?
028	Haha. I suppose it's not something I should expect you to understand on the spot. Never mind.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
029	It's only natural that the things we feel are very different; we are two separate entities, after all.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
030	However, know this: So long as we don't forget about the things we've lost, I believe we will always find our way back to them—or them to us.
031	We might miss them for a time, but we can be reunited with them again. Something to keep in mind.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
032	I don't really get it, but... cool. Thanks, Sol. You, too, Acht.
033	You only need to thank Sol. I didn't do anything.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
034	That's not true! You helped!
035	...
036	Which would make you happier? I'm still not sure... I think I'll need to continue my investigation a little longer.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
