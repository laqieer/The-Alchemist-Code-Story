001	The walls seem even more damaged the farther in we go.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0031
002	That rumbling sound we keep hearing is probably these marks being made. At least the place isn't falling apart or anything, though.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0029
003	Seems like some sort of special power is at work here. It should hold the ruins together for now...hopefully.
004	Bell.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
005	What is it, Ila?
006	Thank you. For earlier.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
007	Earlier? Oh, haha, that! I was just moving on impulse.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
008	I don't care why you did it. It just made me...happy?...that you did.	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
009	I don't mean you coming to my rescue! Don't misunderstand me. Just...the fact that you gave those creeps a well-deserved thrashing.
010	That's all. Got it?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
011	Uhhh...
012	That's just Ila's way of showing appreciation—for being as outraged as she was about what those guys were doing.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
013	She doesn't need to thank me, I just did what came naturally to me when I see something awful like that happening.
014	Still, your behavior clearly moved something in Ila's heart.
015	And rightfully so! You were really heroic back there.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0007
016	Yeah, Bell and Ais make quite the duo. Their skill is considerable, and they coordinate their attacks together on the battlefield very well.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
017	There's no enemy we can't beat with Bell on our side.
018	Amazing! Ila's even come around on you.
019	Someone who gains comrades as naturally as you do, Bell, is bound to be remembered as a hero in the end.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
020	Me? A hero? You could say that about Ais, maybe, but certainly not me...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
021	I wouldn't call myself a hero either. I just fight monsters.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0039
022	But put any monster in front of any of us, and we'll take care of it, every time. We're a formidable team.
023	I can't believe I'm actually agreeing with Wallen-whatever about something...	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0016
024	But I also believe in you. All of you.
025	Especially you, Ila. You and Bell seem to have a natural affinity with one another.
026	What? You can't be serious!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
027	Don't misunderstand—I'm only talking about the battlefield, here!
028	And Kevin, you were giving them support the whole time without breaking a sweat.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0005
029	I...don't know how to react, being told that by a goddess. I feel like it'd be rude of me to say it's nothing.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
030	Heheh. I'm glad you were assigned to Bell as a guide, Kevin.
031	It's an honor to hear you say that, Goddess Hestia.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
032	This group could even stand shoulder to shoulder with the adventuring parties who attempt the lower dungeon floors back home.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0004
033	In fact, I'm sure of it! This party could conquer the whole dungeon, given the chance! So get out there, and show me how heroic you all can be!
034	Yes, Goddess!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
035	You can count on us.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0005
036	We will prevail.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
037	Yeah! We got this!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
038	Raaaaaaaaarrrgggh!!!	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0002
039	It's the minotaur!
040	And it's close. Stay on guard, everyone.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
