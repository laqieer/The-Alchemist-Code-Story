001	Come on, Logi! Hurry up!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_favorite_0001
002	Ah! Edgar!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
003	Heh. Sorry. Didn't mean to lose my cool with this jerk.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
004	...
005	What's wrong?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
006	Look at that Tamba guy's face. His expression seems so...pained. It's almost like he's begging someone to save him.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0004
007	I see what you mean. But that doesn't change the part where he's our enemy right now.
008	Yeah. I know.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0016
009	For all your big talk about killing us, you seem to struggle with getting the job done.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
010	I'll kill you all in one fell blow! Just get back here, and you'll see.
011	...!
012	Haaaaaaaaaah!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0032
013	...!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
014	Why are you so eager to die? Humanity is doomed to perish as it is. Do you just want to join them early and get it over with?
015	As long as we're still around, humanity still has a chance. Nothing is inevitable. No future is set in stone.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
016	I simply cannot understand your stubbornness! Just give me the sword, and I'll walk away!
017	I told you, that's not happening.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
018	You just don't know when to quit!
019	Heh, quitting isn't part of my vocabulary. We of the Blade Fox always fight till the bitter end!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
020	And don't you go forgetting about me, either!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
021	You don't even belong here! Why are you throwing your life away for this foreign land?!
022	It's like I said: I fight for my friends. And for myself.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
023	Besides, I'm already plenty involved here! I'd rather die than abandon Wadatsumi now.
024	Fine. Then die.
025	Argh! Hng!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
026	Protect us, Anastasia!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0032
027	?!
028	Over time, I've come to learn of my roots, and those who watch over me.
029	And I don't intend to let even a single person here die until Logi gets his chance to learn the same! Until Logi finds his own destiny.
030	Because while he's busy introspecting, I'm here to act in his stead!
031	I've never seen such a technique. This could complicate matters. However...
032	!!!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
033	It won't be a problem if I kill you first!
034	Agatha! Run!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
035	Uggrraaah!
036	!!!
037	...!
038	Logi!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_favorite_0001
039	Ngh....This technique! It can't be!
040	Sorry for the wait, everyone!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0035
041	Was that...?
042	Yes, that was one of Wadatsumi's Sacred Three. That was the sacred art of Kagutsuchi.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
043	...!
044	It's time we strike back!
