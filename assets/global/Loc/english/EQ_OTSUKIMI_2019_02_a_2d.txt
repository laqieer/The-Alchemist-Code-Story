001	Haaahh!
002	Take this!
003	I didn't know Tamamo was so strong.
004	And Hazel... That firepower, decisive action... Amazing as ever.
005	(But...)
006	Phew! The wolves are gone and we got the silver grass we needed! Yay!
007	I feel a little bad. It was us who barged into their territory. They were just defending themselves.
008	You're right! If you can hear us, we're sorry!
009	Do I have to tell you to not go running off on your own? It can be dangerous out here!
010	Sorry!
011	Hazel...?
012	There's something nostalgic about this place. Reminds me of back then.
013	Hazel...
014	When is "back then"?
015	We worked as partners when we were mercenaries.
016	Hazel offered to team up with me when I was still a novice.
017	I was surprised. At the time, Hazel had already established a name for herself as an expert mercenary.
018	Evelika is well-versed in magical engineering. Plus, she can handle her weapon really well.
019	She's also very agile and perceptive. More so than I.
020	She always notices when I add some toppings to my cheese dogs. Always nagging me like, "You're over-doing it," and "You need to eat more vegetables!"
021	Well, you usually keep your cheese dogs plain. It's easy to notice when you add things to it.
022	When you've started adding toppings, that means you've been eating cheese dogs frequently enough to get bored with it.
023	Now that's what I call perceptive!
024	She's such a mom. People always mention how they can't tell who's older between us.
025	Evelika, you're so thoughtful and caring. I knew I could trust you to cover my back.
026	Hazel...
027	Evelika...
028	Out of the way, out of the way! I'm ridin' here!
029	Caris!
030	Oh, hey! Evelika! Long time no see!
031	I brought you guys something! Special moon-gazing dumplings from Carol!
032	Thanks Caris! But, uh...
033	Wh-what's with that horde of monsters?!
034	Oh, cool! They're stampeding this way!
035	Not sure why, but they just won't get off my tail.
036	Heh, got me worked up though. Made me go super fast!
037	I think you're always going a little too fast.
038	Why are you all so calm?! Why are those monsters so frenzied?!
039	Hmm... I don't know why, but they keep trying to get at these dumplings.
040	They're after the dumplings? Let me see them!
041	There's a letter from Carol. Let's see... "When I started making the dumplings, I realized I was out of flour."
042	So I went shopping for some and this rainbow-colored flour was on sale! Aren't these dumplings so pretty?
043	Rainbow-colored...? Reminds me of the Rainbow Cacao. I think red stood for passion, blue for peace, purple was...
044	Oh, no! If you find a purple dumpling, keep it hidden! It'll excite the monsters and...
045	Look at this! This one's purple! Looks weird, huh?
046	Well, would you look at that.
047	I wonder what flavor it's supposed to be?
048	Aw, come on! What did I just say?!
