001	Ugh...ohhh!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0043
002	Huff...huff...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
003	The queen...is being overpowered?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
004	How...how has this loser...student of magic...come this far?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
005	Even a loser...can defeat a queen! After all, I'm not just fighting for myself!!!
006	What...?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
007	The day I received the power of Alchemy, I realized that fighting for someone...is stronger than anything else!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
008	It was the day that I saw Helga give birth to a child...enduring pain...enduring suffering that might have killed her!
009	... ...!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
010	No matter what kind of witch...whether she be a loser or an elite...
011	They all have the potential to suffer while giving birth to their child! It's the same for all women!
012	That's just a collection of the weak...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0016
013	You may have been despised by everyone.
014	However, even the men who have long been despised in this country...
015	They have loved and have left behind children with those whom they loved...abandoning their fear of being turned into an insect!!!
016	They've simply resigned themselves to that life!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
017	Whether it be a man or woman, even if that person is a loser...!
018	If they are fighting for someone...that alone makes them strong! They are absolutely not weak!
019	Shut up...shut up!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
020	I'll tell you it over and over again! Whether you are a queen or not...it doesn't change anything!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
021	Everyone has the right...to live together happily with others!
022	I told you to shut up! Can't you hear me?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0012
