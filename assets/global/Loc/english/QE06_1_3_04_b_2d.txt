001	Phew...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
002	What are you doing here?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
003	Whoa, geez! Oh, it's you, Captain Tanosuke.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0028
004	You know it's part of your job to rest when you can, right? I mean, I was just about to go take a nap.
005	I-I know, but...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
006	I told you, thinking really isn't one of your strong suits. Don't force yourself to do it too much.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
007	Rude! How many times do I have to hear that?! I mean...it's true, but—
008	Celis makes the best meals, doesn't she?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
009	What? That was an abrupt change of subject.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
010	I just thought it was really good. There's something special about sitting at a table with friends you've fought alongside against certain death. Not to mention the nap afterwards.
011	D-did you eat something funny?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
012	Harsh... Look, all I'm saying is that it doesn't help to overthink things. To overcomplicate matters—	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0012
013	It's a very bad habit we humans have.
014	That is...probably true, but—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
015	Just take good care of what you have in front of you, because that is what you spend your time building.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
016	I... I just can't avoid thinking about the voice and visions that cut into my mind.
017	There's no point in dwelling on things you just don't know anything about. You are you, I am me.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
018	Keep that in mind, or you'll lose sight of it.
019	Captain Tanosuke, you too... The voice...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
020	My name is the Tanosuke, Third Squad Captain of the Blade Fox Corps.
021	I... I am Amane, a member of the Third Squad.
022	Isn't that enough? Even if that isn't all that you are, that's still you.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
023	That's...so right! Thank you, sir. You always know exactly what to say, Captain Tanosuke. Your words are a boon to my heart.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
024	Just your heart, huh?
025	Wha—?! Wh-what do you think you're looking at?!
026	Not much, honestly.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
027	I-I just need a few more years and...and then I'll have—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
028	Just get back to the barracks. You need to rest so you'll be ready when we need your strength.
029	All right. Fine.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
030	Wha—?! An emergency?!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0026
031	Captain Tanosuke, let's go!
