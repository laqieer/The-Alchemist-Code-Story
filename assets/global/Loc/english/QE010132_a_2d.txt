001	Spandau Castle should come into view soon. I hope Zeke managed to penetrate the castle walls.
002	I'm sure dad and the others will be all right. I'm more worried about Dias.
003	You want to stop your brother's descent into darkness. Is that really possible?
004	I already told you! I'm going to save him from continuing down the wrong path!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
005	I understand how you feel, but you heard what he said, didn't you?
006	He clearly has a different mindset to yours. Even if you can physically stop him, I'm not sure you can change his way of thinking.
007	I will not give up!
008	...!
009	He dreams of the same ideal world that we do! If I give up, it's all over! I won't give up!
010	Heh. Right. I forgot your idiocy knows no boundaries.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
011	What?!
012	I'm saying that your exasperating sincerity may be able to remove his darkness.
013	As a beacon of light...
014	You might be able to make him forget about the darkness before he crosses over to the other side.
015	Huh?
016	Come on. There's no time to waste talking! Let's head to Spandau Castle!
017	Y-yeah!
