001	The decorations are coming along nicely. I can't wait to see how they turn out this year! Isn't this exciting, Mei Fang?
002	Yes... I am pleased to see that they are as resplendent as ever. The vivid orange pairs well with the black accents.
003	Wow! Look! They've already put up the jack-o'-lanterns! They're so spooky and cool!
004	All right! Halloween is here, baby! 'Tis the season to party!
005	Whoa!
006	What the—?! Watch where you're going, kid!
007	I-I'm sorry, m-mister...
008	Hold it. You're the one who bumped into the kid. Why aren't you apologizing?
009	Huh? I didn't do anything! Kids shouldn't be wandering around like that, anyway. Oughta be kept on a tight leash...
010	Oh? If you refuse to apologize for your carelessness, that would make you a very bad boy. Before you know it, you'll be the one leashed...and I promise you, you'll learn your manners at my heel.
011	Aaahh! I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean anything by it!
012	Hmph... What the hell was his problem?
013	He will not be the only one. There are many who would use the merrymaking of this occasion as an excuse to commit all manner of misdemeanors.
014	Such as picking pockets. Apparently cutpurses are on the rise, so we have been drafted to patrol the area and keep an eye out for any miscreants. Really, they are asking a bit much of us...
015	I see. Looks like we've been saddled with a lot of responsibility this time around, too.
016	Ohh, how wonderful!
017	How whimsical and mystical the world of Halloween! Today is my day. This event was made for me!
018	The decorations are exquisite. I see we are sticking to our roots with the tried-and-true hues of orange and black. Magnificent! Of course, nothing can beat the combination of red and black, so there is still room for improvement...
019	Don't you think?
020	Uh... Maybe?
021	Why, there's no question! The jack-o'-lanterns would be so much more fetching in red. Yes, they would look so much sweeter in blood red...
022	Now, as for the candy... Of course, candy apples are a must! That deep-red luster is to die for! Heehee...
023	What is the meaning of this? That little imp is going around swapping all of the orange decorations for red ones.
024	Should she be doing that?
025	Of course not!
026	Rosa! That's quite enough!
027	Oh!
028	Halloween is not yours alone to enjoy. Changing the decorations to suit your tastes is simply inexcusable!
029	Goodness... Everyone seems to think that they can just do whatever they please today, but they are sorely mistaken!
030	What's the matter with you? You seem rather out of sorts, Inquisitor.
031	And why wouldn't I be? Have you seen the state of people's morals as of late? Absolutely deplorable!
032	Thanks to those grown men and women who would take advantage of the Halloween Carnival and its theme of trickery to behave poorly, I am forced to be constantly on edge.
033	And yet I find a troublemaker exists among even those who have been tasked with patrolling and maintaining the peace! Unbelievable... I cannot afford to let down my guard for even a second!
034	Well! I get called troublemaker before I even get a hello? Hmph! I was just trying to make Halloween even more wonderful than it is now. Is that such a crime?
035	Perhaps not, but it certainly makes you a troublemaker! I was entrusted with patrol duty to ensure that the standards of this occasion are upheld! Do you understand me?
036	The Halloween colors are orange and black. A red-and-black Halloween cannot be allowed!
037	Orange reminds us of the fall harvest, of the warmth of the sun's rays, and of the fire crackling in the hearth. It has a real and pertinent meaning.
038	Being locked into stereotypes like that is dead boring!
039	Your preferences are entirely irrelevant! We are here to patrol, first and foremost!
040	Pfft. If fire is so important, then why not red? Fire is way closer to red than orange!
041	Hmph. I will not argue for argument's sake!
042	Why don't the both of you calm down? You two are causing a scene. If your intention was to create a spectacle, then you are doing an excellent job of it.
043	Oh, my... My apologies.
044	Naw, don't worry about it. It's great that you're so passionate about the job!
045	So... Looks like it's the four of us on patrol this year, huh?
046	We're not just here to patrol. We've gotta hand out candy to all the kids, too!
047	I see that you are well-informed.
048	Of course I am! I double-checked the job description and prepared everything I would need today well ahead of time!
049	Neica handed out the candy last time, right? Well, I've brought something even better than her magical treats! Heehee...
050	Hm...
051	Really? That's great! Looks like we can leave the candy to Rosa and get on with the patrol, ladies.
052	Indeed. Do as you wish. I do not enjoy entertaining children, so if someone else is willing to take the job, they have my blessing.
053	Fine by me. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and get—
054	Wait just a moment!
055	Huh?
056	You aren't intending to hand out that concoction of yours, are you?
057	Concoction?
058	Hmph.
059	According to Magnus, you've been working on creating a very suspicious-looking concoction since you were assigned to this team.
060	A concoction?! What are you talking about?
061	Well, there have been some weird dark-red fumes coming from Rosa's room. She was meant to be making candy, but...it sure didn't smell like she was.
062	Mia and Hayate got suspicious enough to sneak a peek and found Rosa in some kind of ecstatic trance, brewing this...concoction. Seems to be some kind of super-secret tincture.
063	Those two are really looking forward to Halloween, so I thought I should let you know.
064	I-I appreciate that, I do, but...what in the world could Rosa be planning?
065	Who knows? I sure don't, but apparently Elizabeth has something to do with it.
066	E-Elizabeth?!
067	Halloween always means some kinda trouble and almost all of it is caused by somebody. If that somebody is Elizabeth, you're in for a hell of a ride.
068	Heh...
069	What is it?
070	Nothin'. Nothin' at all. Don't really wanna remind myself of it.
071	Anyway, Rosa is planning something. That much is clear. Best keep your eyes peeled and your guard up.
072	Understood.
073	Well, if you're gonna be there, I suppose there's nothing to worry about. Nothing bad can happen with a fine woman like yourself on guard.
074	F-fine woman?!
075	Wh-why would you say something so frivolous in the middle of a serious discussion about work? Really!
076	Was I being too forward?
077	N-no, not at all! I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement, but—!
078	Ahem...
079	Very well. I accept your request as reasonable and just.
080	Glad to hear it, but don't do it for me. Do it for all the little kiddies who're looking forward to Halloween.
081	('Cause if someone doesn't take care of this, you can bet Mia is gonna volunteer the rest of us to go help out. No thank you.)
082	Be at ease. So long as I am there, those who would disrupt order will be dealt with swiftly and harshly.
083	Still, something will probably happen regardless of what you do.
084	What?
085	After all, Halloween is full of surprises.
086	Hmph...
087	Huh. So that's the deal, huh?
088	All this talk of concoctions and tinctures is giving me a headache. Do you have something to say for yourself, imp?
089	...
090	Rosa?
091	Ohh... Are you talking about what I think you're talking about? Because if you are, you don't need to worry about it anymore.
092	What do you mean, anymore?
093	Numyua!
094	Aahh!
095	Naw, it's you guys! Did you come back to spend Halloween with us this year too?
096	Wh-why are you speaking to them with such fondness?!
097	Numu...numu, numu, numyua!
098	They appear to want something, but I haven't the faintest idea what that might be. Do you have any inkling, Melda?
099	Nope. They're way too excited. I can't make out a word of what they're saying.
100	Oh, well... Guess we'll have to wait until they've calmed down a little bit.
101	Numa, numu, numaa!
