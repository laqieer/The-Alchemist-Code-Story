001	The whole town decked out in Valentine's decorations, and every woman in sight turning to a young girl at heart...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
002	This is the best! Everyone's going to be so much looser with their purse strings; I just know it!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
003	I'm glad you're excited, but remember, we've got a job to do.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
004	She's right. We can't let our guards down, especially not with all the problems surrounding the Rainbow Cacao that have been occurring around here since Valentine's season started.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
005	We have to do our best to keep this contraband in check so everyone will be able to enjoy the holiday safely.
006	Yeah, yeah, I know! Speaking of the Rainbow Cacao, though, where even is it? You were the ones who brought it last time, weren't you?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0037
007	Oh, right. This time, it's—	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
008	Gangway! Comin' through!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0008
009	All right, here you go! This should be all of it.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0004
010	I can't believe you were able to get to Lustburg from the fields so quickly! And with all this cacao in tow, no less... You're amazing, Caris!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0009
011	What are you talking about? It took me forever to get here. I'm not supposed to floor it for delivery jobs, and I gotta tell you, I get really antsy when I can't speed!
012	You were still going quite fast, though...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
013	Right, so, anyway, this is the infamous Rainbow Cacao, huh? Interesting, interesting...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0045
014	This really is some high-quality stuff. I wonder if there's a way I could get permission to sell some of it?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
015	Oh, my, is that really it? I bet I could use it to make medicine. Do you mind if I have a peek as well?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
016	I had no idea you were interested in cacao, Lizzy.	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
017	Hmm? Well, I am a little curious, but... It's just not something ordinary citizens can get their hands on, is it?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
018	Ugh. Yeah, don't remind me. The distribution of Rainbow Cacao is strictly monitored and controlled.
019	Oh, but if it's for you, Lizzy, I can try to make sure some of it gets out there!
020	It would be better if you didn't. The powers that be have exclusive purchasing rights over Rainbow Cacao. It's very much banned from public wholesale.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
021	Aw, c'mon! You know I was just joking.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
022	I should hope so.
023	I'm actually rather surprised you came out here directly to get this stuff.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
024	We tend to feel uneasy until all the Rainbow Cacao is securely in our hands. We've had incidences in the past where deliveries were stolen just before we could retrieve them, you see.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
025	There are still many in town whose...curiosity, shall we say, about these infamous beans is strong enough that they would undoubtedly make such an attempt even now, given the chance.
026	Curiosity, huh?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0044
027	And all this despite the inherent danger. We really must take steps to reinforce our regulations.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0031
028	I, for one, disagree. I think the current laws regarding Rainbow Cacao are far too strict, even as they stand.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0039
029	We can't even distribute it to witches who intend to use it for research!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
030	If we make the rules any stricter, the black market for it will only slip farther underground, making its distribution even harder to monitor than it already is.
031	I grant that that's a possibility, but it's certainly no cause to tempt fate by giving people easy access to such dangerous materials. Surely you can see that!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
032	Whoa, now! This debate is getting a little heated. Let's all take a deep breath and calm down, shall we?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0011
033	Ah... Our apologies. That was most unbecoming of us indeed.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0036
034	Not at all! You're both just trying to look out for the best interests of your citizens. You only came to a head because of how much you care.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
035	Indeed. Although you may disagree on matters of policy, you both argued your stances for the sake of the people. It speaks highly to your characters.
036	For what it's worth, as a merchant myself, I can't say I'm particularly happy about all these regulations. These used to just be run-of-the-mill magical components, after all. Now they're practically taboo!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
037	When the government suddenly forbade all sales of them... Well, let's just say my bottom line had definitely seen better days.
038	It is easy to see why the laws were enacted, though. Rainbow Cacao is potent to the point of being potentially very dangerous.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
039	Especially Purple Cacao. Just a tiny bit of it is strong enough to charm humans and monsters alike, and even the smell of it can get you feeling intoxicated.
040	Really? I didn't realize it was so potent. It's such a shame I can't use any for my medicines.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0045
041	Enough chit-chat. Our job is to guard all of this and make sure nothing bad happens to it, so let's get to guarding, shall we?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
042	Right. We have to make sure Valentine's Day doesn't get waylaid by anything or anyone!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
043	Excuse me for the interruption, but it seems another individual has fallen ill!
044	Another one? And with the same symptoms? Have we confirmed if they've ingested the same thing as the others?
045	Yes. It appears they purchased it from the same vendor, as well.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0005
046	Everyone who's eating stuff from the same place is getting sick? That doesn't sound good!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
047	My, my! What could they have ingested? Perhaps it wasn't food, but medicine...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
048	...
049	Elizabeth. I...don't mean anything by this, but just to be absolutely certain, you wouldn't happen to have anything to do with this incident, would you?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
050	Hmm? What do you mean? How could I?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
051	You know—that stuff you were making yesterday?
052	Ohh, that!
053	You don't have to worry about that. I did make some medicine yesterday, but it wasn't enough to spread around. Rest assured, I had no hand in this!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
054	Good. I'm glad to hear it.
055	Of course Lizzy wouldn't be the one behind it! She would never make anything that would hurt people.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0012
056	(It could certainly have some nasty side effects, though... But that's beside the point!)
057	She only makes medicine to help people. In fact, it was her medicine that brought me back from the brink of death ages ago!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0010
058	Exactly. Yesterday's medicine was an energy booster; nothing more. It does have a tendency to make you sweat chocolate, but that's a small price to pay.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
059	I really don't know how to feel about that... But if Elizabeth's medicine isn't what's causing people to get sick, then what is?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
060	Rainbow Cacao, naturally. Everyone who has fallen ill did so after eating chocolate made from it.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
061	What?! But what of the ban on distribution we were only just speaking of?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
062	As my colleague insinuated, there exists a black market from which one can procure the cacao in secret. Based on our investigations, we believe its base of operations to be somewhere near the border.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
063	Sorry to interrupt again, but I'm afraid things have gone from bad to worse! I've just received word that someone else has become sick as well, in just this short time. We must return immediately!
064	I will have to call our conversation here, it seems, as I must see to these patients. I'm counting on you all to give your best effort in guarding the materials. Do take care!
065	So there's a literal black market, then? Something must be done about that, and soon! Things could easily spiral out of control very quickly if it's left unattended.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
066	I'm happy to look into it. I can do some market research on how to deregulate sales, while I'm there!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
067	Are you really willing to go so far just for Elizabeth's sake?
068	Hehe! Of course! You'd be so happy if I could help do something to relax those distribution laws, wouldn't you, Lizzy?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
069	You really are something else...
070	Besides that, though, I have some personal qualms over how tightly regulated Rainbow Cacao has become. It just...rubs me the wrong way.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
071	I understand that Purple Cacao is dangerous because it can attract monsters, but is it really fair for all the other varieties to be lumped into the same ban? There are so many uses for them!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
072	And so many people who want them. The demand is ever present. And it is, after all, a merchant's job to meet her customers' demands!
073	The court mages even confirmed this, stating curiosity from the general populace as a reason for the increased risk of robbery.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
074	Sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0010
075	I have. And that's why I think it would be best to confirm these illicit sales with my very own eyes! It's my duty as a merchant, you see.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
076	I could sure use some help, though! Perhaps you'd care to join me, Caris? I would so appreciate the assistance!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
077	What? Why me?! We've barely just begun the job we were hired for!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
078	Why don't you ask Elizabeth for help, since you love her so much?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
079	What are you even saying? How could I possibly bother Lizzy with something like this? It's preposterous!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
080	But I'm fair game?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0030
081	Come on! Please? If I really find any Rainbow Cacao at the black market and have to confiscate it, I'll need a way to transport it, after all.
082	Your motorbike would be the perfect thing for that. I bet with how fast you can go, we'd be in and out of there in no time at all!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
083	Fine. You win.
084	You don't have to worry about things here. We'll guard the Rainbow Cacao and hold down the fort while you're gone.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
085	Thanks so much! Lizzy, I'm going to head out for a bit, okay?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0037
086	Are you, now?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
087	Well, why don't I go with you, after all? I'm quite curious about the Rainbow Cacao myself.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
088	Really? You'll come with me?! Hooray! This is going to be so much fun! Let's not waste a moment, then; come on, team!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0009
089	Hoo boy. This...isn't going to be so much fun, isn't it?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
