001	...What's all this commotion?
002	It seems that Lady Schmeier has escaped.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
003	We are mobilizing all soldiers in the castle as we speak.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
004	I see.
005	One of the seven Draconic Pillars... Even within the Dragon Realm, she remains a thorn in my side.
006	I suppose it comes to me to--
007	Don't. If you take action, it will hinder the upkeep of the Dragon Realm.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0014
008	Leave this to me, if you would.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
009	Ignacio...
010	That is indeed the name I was entrusted with. Though I do wish you would call me Yishai when it's the two of us.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0002
011	...
012	You won't?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
013	Very well, Yishai. I shall leave Schmeier to you then.
014	Thank you, Ophioneus... Shahel, come.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0033
015	Yes, Lord Ignacio.
016	...Schmeier, why do you refuse to understand?
017	The shell of this world is too small for humans to survive. Attempting to coexist will only lead to our shared extinction...
018	For a dragon's castle, this place sure has a lot of humans.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
019	That's because Ophioneus was the first dragon to realize the utility of humans.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
020	They lack the strength and vitality of dragons, so they're forced to make up for it with ingenuity and creativity.
021	He decided that's the way things ought to be.
022	He didn't see the forest for the trees, huh?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
023	What? How do you mean?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
024	Nothing, just a bit of optimism. Come on; we're almost there.
025	H-hey, wait!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
026	Look! Right here, there's a hidden passage!
027	Come on, we don't have time for--	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
028	No, I mean, these things are usually connected to the outside, right? This could be a shortcut out of here.
029	Or it could be some sort of maze to throw off intruders.
030	I already know a way out. Let's not risk it just to save a little time.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
031	It'll be fine, come on! Look, there's some sort of room up ahead...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0007
032	Hey, come back!
033	This is--
034	Schmeier, you realize we're still being chased, right? What are you thinking?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
035	There's some sort of strange Magil reaction going on. What is this stone?
036	Did someone hide it here? Or is this just where it goes?
037	This is different from my Magil. Just what is...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
038	Schmeier!
039	...Right, sorry. I'll figure it out later. Let's go!
040	Alright, we finally made it out!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
041	Now if we can just get out of this district--
042	...
043	I'm sorry, but this road is closed.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0014
044	Ugh, this is...
045	Lady Schmeier, I beg you to please return. Leaving now would be ever so inconvenient for us.
046	...Yishai Ignacio.
047	I'm surprised the renowned successor of Ophioneus would come all this way in person.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0003
048	Hahaha, please, you flatter me!	VO_esai.esai_sys_0008
049	But this is as far as you ladies go. The seven dragons of salvation are quite important to us, you see.
050	Now, let us head back to the castle, shall we? Before my trigger finger gets itchy...	VO_esai.esai_sys_0002
051	...Schmeier	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
052	What is it?
053	How strong is this guy?
054	I'd say pretty strong. Well, he's got strength in numbers at least.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
055	And just who are you, exactly? I haven't seen your face around here before. What are you doing helping this woman?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0003
056	What am I doing? Ha!
057	I'm just having some fun.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0023
058	What an amusing little girl.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0010
