001	It's been quite a long time since we entered the forest. Is the treasure still further ahead?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0002
002	H-hmm...I think so. I have the treasure map, so don't worry. Just follow me, Vanekis.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
003	But...isn't this the third time we've passed this way?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0031
004	N-no, that's not possible! I mean, this way is north and that way is south...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
005	Shenmei, the map...aren't you looking at it upside down? Also, north and south are in the opposite direction.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0003
006	Huh?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
007	Hey, Shenmei, how about I lead the way instead? I want to check if the information I purchased is correct.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0002
008	I-in that case, be my guest! ...Sorry, Vanekis.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0020
009	Don't worry about it. But, maybe it would've been better if you brought your crewmates along with us as well.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
010	No! If I did that, it'll just be the same as always!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
011	What do you mean?
012	My crewmates are always nagging me. They tell me not to push myself too hard and that, as their captain, it's dangerous for me to go off on my own.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
013	That's why I want to find this treasure on my own and show off my abilities!
014	I see. But I think I kind of understand how your crewmates feel.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_chara_1014
015	I'm pretty sure that they care about you so much that it worries them sick that something might happen to you.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0002
016	Bu-but...!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0047
017	Be-besides, you've hired me to help you find the treasure anyway.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
018	Hmph... Ne-never mind that! Today, we're going to find the treasure on our own! Let's do this!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
019	Fine, fine. Let's.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0006
