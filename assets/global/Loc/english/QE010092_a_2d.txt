001	A myriad of monsters lay defeated around Dias.
002	The strength of the monsters is increasing! Are they consuming Philosopher's Stones?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
003	There's no doubt this is Sabareta's doing.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
004	He's dangerous. Apparently, he tried to resurrect another Demon separate to the one you defeated.
005	Another Demon?! No...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
006	Do not fear. I heard it was defeated at the hands of Captain Zeke and Logi without incident.
007	Father and Logi defeated a Demon...?! Wait...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
008	...What is the matter? Is there something that bothers you?
009	No...
010	In any case, let's hurry on ahead.
011	...Pick up your pace! We make it over the ridge before evening!
012	As Gabirond roars these orders, the Holy Guard begin their march.
013	However, Dias remains standing as he gazes at his right arm.
014	...Logi, you didn't meddle with the darkness, did you?
