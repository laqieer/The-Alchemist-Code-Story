001	Vettel, we found it!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0001
002	Ah, great. I've overturned him once, but he may be coming back any time now. He's possessed by some kind of terrifying power.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
003	The picture on this document shows the same pattern that Gormalas is wearing...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
004	Go ahead and try reading it.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
005	Ah.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
006	I see...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
007	The loincloth that this tribe wore is similar to the fearless one that Dilga wore last time, but...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
008	The other more vicious loincloth is exactly the same as the one that Gormalas is wearing!
009	When I asked at the library, they said that the white loincloth belonged to the De tribe and the red loincloth belonged to the Go tribe.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
010	That's the same thing to what the old man said!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0045
011	Hmm. The De tribe protects their people with a powerful physique...thus they were called the Tight Tribe...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
012	On the other hand, the Go tribe toughened their body in order strike down their enemy. Thus they were called the Hit Tribe...
013	When the time came for the Festive Battle, the De tribe and the Go tribe fought for control.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
014	It was held when the sea was at its fullest. The ritual commenced at the start of dawn.
015	I wonder what kind of battle it was! I'm really fascinated!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
016	Teona, are you attracted to muscular bodies?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
017	Yes! As a fighter, I'm really interested in the beauty of the well-trained body!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
018	... ...
019	... ...
020	By the way, what was the ritual like? I don't get to see that book at all!	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
021	Apparently, both sides cleansed their loincloths.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
022	Cleansed them how...?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
023	It doesn't say that much.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0035
024	I wonder if there's any more information.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0011
025	Um, I think on page 69...it says what happens afterward.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
026	Let me see...um...the loser will obey the winner and will accept defeat while waiting for the next battle...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
027	So, this place is where each country repeatedly protected their land from the threat of the other country...using loincloths...
028	I guess with Wadatsumi close by, a loincloth culture is a given.	VO_almira.almira_event_1006
029	I-I'm not sure about that...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
030	Wait, there's more! Something strange happened to the Go tribe... Most of them disappeared?!
031	Huh?! Why?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
032	When the next Festive Battle came around, the Go tribe started fighting amongst themselves... They didn't want to wear the loincloth anymore.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
033	I kind of understand where they were coming from.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0011
034	Thus, the De tribe managed to secure the victory of the final battle, without even having to fight. Since then, no battle has been held.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
035	As a result, the De tribe's loincloth ended up being their historical formal wear for men...and was passed down to Wadatsumi...
036	Huh? So, it didn't start at Wadatsumi, it began here!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
037	That's magnificent!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0044
038	I-I feel like there's something wrong with describing it that way.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
039	Maybe the loincloth he's wearing belonged to the chief of the Go tribe...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
040	The grudge of the chief, having not been able to fight in battle, may be possessing Gormalas now and turning him into a demon of revenge.
041	So now comes the crucial question: how do we get rid of the curse?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0044
042	Here he comes again!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
043	We need to protect the tourists!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0032
