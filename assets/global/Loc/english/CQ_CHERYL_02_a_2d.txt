001	Dammit... They're stronger than I thought. It's not worth fighting them...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
002	You lose!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0010
003	So, we're "not worth fighting" you say? Are you taking orders from someone?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
004	Hey, are you alright? Could you tell us what's going on?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
005	Actually...
006	...so what you're saying is that you were in a facility and they were about to do something "scary" so you ran away.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0045
007	Yeah.
008	Those scientists were scary and I had home to go back to. My parents are gone.
009	I was too scared to stay there.
010	So what was it that was scary? What were they going to do?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
011	I...don't know. But the scientists said something about "experimenting."
012	Experimenting...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
013	Sounds very suspicious. Cheryl, what should we do?	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
014	First of all, we need to keep this child safe. We can't just leave a child like this alone around here.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
015	First, let's find the Peacekeepers...
016	Wait! My little sister's still there.
017	Your little sister?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
018	They're going to do experiments. Not me, but on my sister. I have to help her.
019	So you escaped in order to find help and rescue her.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0044
020	Alright. We promise to rescue her. Let's go, Cheryl!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0045
021	Courage! Wait a minute. There are a lot of things to consider.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
022	An inquisitor's job is to find those who violate the Magna Code... At the moment we don't have enough evidence for an inquisitor to investigate.
023	But if we don't move now it might be too late. Let's at least go and have a look.	VO_courage.courage_battle_0019
024	It's against the rules for an inquisitor to act arbitrarily. We would need permission from a superior.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
025	I have a strong will as an inquisitor and it's important for me to follow protocol.
026	Strong authority may lead to violence... But if we follow the rules, all will be fine.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0029
027	Cheryl, I honestly understand what you're saying. But if we hesitate, something worse could happen.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0004
028	You can't let that happen, can you?
029	...
030	Courage. How are you not afraid? You have a gun that is powerful enough to kill...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
031	Powerful enough to take a life away in an instant.
032	Of course I'm afraid. But I have to be cautious when I aim it accordingly.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
033	I would never point my gun in the wrong direction. It's always aimed at the correct target.
034	The correct target...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
035	Hey, Cheryl. I know how important it is to follow the rules...	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
036	But don't you think it's the right thing to do when you see this frightenened little child with your own eyes?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
037	...!
038	Hey, Cheryl. What you say makes sense, and of course it's important to follow the rules.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
039	But if we follow every rule and regulation, we're bound to miss important details along the way.
040	Cheryl. Do not forget where we place our stance on rule violations.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0045
041	(I must find the violators...)	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
042	...
043	But... you are an inquisitor, and not like me who has free will.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
044	I'm going to go alone, so please look after the child, Cheryl. Time to go!	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
045	...
046	(Laws must be followed. If one breaks the rules, one shall be punished...just like them.)<br>	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0029
047	(But...)
048	Are you done with your paperwork, Cheryl? I'm done with mine, so it's time for a break.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
049	Um, no. No yet.
050	Why? You're being a bit too strict on yourself. Aren't you taking too much time doing that?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
051	That's not the case...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
052	...
053	Excuse me. Before you go on break, could you watch this child? There are a few more things I need to finish up.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0035
054	What is with the number of guards? There are way too many to be guarding an orphanage!
055	Ugh... This is not good.	VO_courage.courage_battle_0024
056	Courage!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
057	Cheryl? What the...? Isn't this against protocol for you?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0025
058	That may be true, but...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
059	I can't just watch a little child cry and not do anything about it when I can.
060	My duty as an inquisitor is priority, but I have to use my power for what I believe is right.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
061	Cheryl!
062	An inquisitor? What's the meaning of this? What is an inquisitor doing here...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
063	Why are you panicking? Unless, there's something that you're hiding perhaps?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
064	Ngh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
065	I'm not sure what's going on, actually. I just said, "I want you to meet that child's sister." And then all this ruckus occurs.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0031
066	So, this would be classified as self defense, right?	VO_courage.courage_sys_0002
067	Understoof. I accept your request for a legitimate inquisition.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_1001
068	D-dammit...! Do not let them inside! Do as I say!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
