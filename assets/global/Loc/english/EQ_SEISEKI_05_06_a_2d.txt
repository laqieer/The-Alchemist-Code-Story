001	Argh! Why?! Why doesn't anyone try to understand me?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
002	If I cannot convince Zain...this world could very well be consumed by war!
003	Wait...	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
004	?!
005	Monzein! You came at the perfect time. Help me stop Zain!
006	The Lord Commander is too much for me to handle on my own.
007	Kudan...tell me what happened.
008	All right. We don't have much time, so I'm gonna keep this simple. Zain's true motive is...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0009
009	That's not what I want to talk about. Seida and the others are lying on the ground over there. Were you the one who did that to them?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
010	No, listen! She...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
011	Give me a straight answer. Are you the one who hurt Seida?
012	Yes...it was me.
013	When I warned you at Saga...you made a vow to change your ways.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0021
014	As your fellow knight...as your friend, I believe those words.
015	I understand. When I made that vow, I really had changed my ways. I spoke the truth.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
016	Then why? Why did you sell your soul to the devil?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
017	No! That's a misunderstanding! It's true that I talked to that man Waginau, but...
018	By no means did I open my heart to...?!
019	How unfortunate...Kudan.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
020	Monzein!
021	Back then...when you took a step onto the wrong path, I couldn't stop you. It's all my responsibility!
022	Kudan...I will stop you now! Hurraahhh!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
023	Stop, Monzein! ...Stop!!!
024	We still can't catch up with them! What's going on?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
025	Mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
026	Huh...?
027	What?!
028	I knew it!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
029	It wasn't a trick of the eye.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
030	Aren't you supposed to have equal the amount of power as Zangetsu? What are you doing here?
031	Right back at you. And what would someone like you be doing here?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0010
032	Wh-what?! You know each other, Suzuka?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0027
033	This is Reimei. He makes his livelihood as an assassin.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
034	An assassin...?! You mean a killer?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
035	Yep! His existence became known to me after...
036	...the assassination of Priestess Chihaya's predecessor.
037	His skillful handiwork suggests there are numerous assassinations yet to be discovered and made public.
038	What is such a terrifying killer doing here?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
039	You sound as if you've never gotten your hands dirty before. Heheh. You make me laugh.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0023
040	What do you mean?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
041	It's hard for me to understand why you, who lives by the warrior's code, would team up with this lot.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
042	They're the ones who hired me to assassinate Chihaya, you know?
043	What...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
044	What are you saying?! Don't speak nonsense!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
045	So you're gonna feign ignorance. In that case, we'll see how your body responds!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
