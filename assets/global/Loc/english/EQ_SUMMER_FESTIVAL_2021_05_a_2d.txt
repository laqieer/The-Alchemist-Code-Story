001	This is my second time in the mountains with you guys, since you came after me before.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
002	Oh, yeah? I, uh, guess that's the case...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
003	Sol's not very discriminate about jobs.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0006
004	I thought he was kind of a pain at the time.
005	To be honest, that was my reaction, too.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
006	I thought it was annoying to deal with a knight who clung so strongly to demands.
007	I guess we're the same.
008	...But a knight is no longer needed.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
009	What?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
010	You said it earlier. Füry is so strong she doesn't need a knight anymore.
011	Well...
012	I don't know whether knights are necessary or not, but I think I remember her saying something.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
013	That one knight would be fine.
014	One knight is fine. One knight is what I want.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
015	Button said that...?
016	I see... She's silly like that.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
017	I may not be your favorite knight...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
018	(I wanted you to live, so I made you dirty your hands and forced a life you didn't want upon you.)
019	(Of course, it was necessary. But I made it your only choice. I wanted more for you.)
020	(I felt guilty for the guile with which I acted. That's why I couldn't look after you properly.)
021	(But even then... You still called this knave a knight.)
022	Gah! Why?! These ritual things should be making me stronger. Why isn't it working?!
023	If I could get this right, then we'd have an army of immortals to help us take power!
024	That is a dream destined never to come true.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
025	You?!
026	Too bad, so sad. That ritual doesn't work on immortal soldiers. It doesn't matter if you have extra tools or not.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
027	Just set down the stuff and back away, and we can put this all behind us. Or it seems you prefer the hard way.
028	You guys are really a pain, aren't ya?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0008
029	Why you...
030	I really don't care what you guys were planning on doing. So... Sorry?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
031	I must protect that which my king left to me. Because I am her knight!
