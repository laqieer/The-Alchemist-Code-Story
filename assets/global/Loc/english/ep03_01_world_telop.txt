ep03_01_world_telop_001	From long, long ago, this land belonged to the witches.
ep03_01_world_telop_002	While many witches roam this world, here alone they call home.
ep03_01_world_telop_003	Witches could not love men because it robbed them of their magic.
ep03_01_world_telop_004	One witch fell in love—a forbidden love with a foreign man.
ep03_01_world_telop_005	The greedy witch called upon a Philosopher's Stone.
ep03_01_world_telop_006	I want to be with that man, but I don't want to lose my magic.
ep03_01_world_telop_007	The stone agreed to grant her wish but demanded her vitality in exchange.
ep03_01_world_telop_008	The witch agreed and lived happily ever after with her man.
ep03_01_world_telop_009	Meanwhile, the stone relentlessly devoured the vitality of the men of the land.
ep03_01_world_telop_010	As the men continued to lose their vigor, one of them said to the stone:
ep03_01_world_telop_011	You're not beautiful. You're an ugly stone that makes people unhappy.
ep03_01_world_telop_012	The man brought a large mirror and showed the stone its ugliness.
ep03_01_world_telop_013	Enranged, the stone broke the mirror and fled weeping up into the sky.
ep03_01_world_telop_014	The stone's tears became clouds which froze land of the witches.
ep03_01_world_telop_015	The broken mirror scattered, and its shards continue to reflect the stone's ugliness.
ep03_01_world_telop_016	Any man who peers into one of these shards will see the reflection of an ugly insect.
ep03_01_world_telop_017	Since then and to this day, love between a man and woman will transform the man into an insect.
