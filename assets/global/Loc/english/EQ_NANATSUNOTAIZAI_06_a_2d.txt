001	Hmm... Ancient ruins. This other world is quite interesting.
002	Though I don't enjoy not having a clue where I am.
003	Still... My first time in another world. This could be fun.
004	Huh... It seems I don't have the luxury of indulging, unfortunately.
005	I should clear this out quickly and meet up with Captain.
006	Hey, King?
007	Yeah, Diane?
008	Am I the only one that thinks we're going in circles?
009	What a coincidence. I was about to ask you the same thing.
010	What is going on?! Captain, where are you?!
011	I-I'm sorry, Diane. I think it's because we're in a different world, but I just can't sense anybody's magic.
012	Hey, King?
013	Yeah, Diane?
014	Am I the only one getting a bad feeling about all this?
015	What a coincidence... I was about to ask you the same thing.
016	Ugh! Where is everybody?! Anybody?!
017	Wh-whoa! Watch it! That's a hammer you're swinging around! Stop! Stop!
018	Grrooooooohh!
019	Yo, Cap'n... Is it just me, or is this thing stronger than it was before?
020	Oh, you thought so too? I thought that might be the case.
021	Got any ideas why?
022	Hmm... Maybe because we're in a different world? Maybe it's absorbing some energy or something from this place. That's my best guess.
023	Jeez... Dragged into some trouble again. Let's get this over with and find a way home.
024	We need to find Elizabeth and the others, first.
025	You think the princess is here too?
026	I know she is.
027	Well, we'd better get this over with and go pick her up then.
028	Yeah... Wait for me, Elizabeth!
029	Hm... Still not enough to connect the two worlds again.
030	Though it's another world entirely, the laws of nature seem to be quite similar to that of our own. I'll need to experiment some more.
031	I would appreciate it if you would not interrupt my experiments, though you don't seem to be the reasonable type.
032	No choice but to deal with you now, I suppose.
033	Grrroooooooaahh!
