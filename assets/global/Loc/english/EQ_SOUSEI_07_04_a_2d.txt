001	So, this is the current condition of the Ire Belt.
002	Yes. Even though Satna has been destroyed, the earth has already been consumed by the rain of fire.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
003	Reconstruction will take...a very long time.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0030
004	.........
005	I'm certain that many villagers lost their lives.
006	Do you grieve for the people of this Belt who have died?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0046
007	I'm glad that you are the Invidia Belt's king.
008	Let us live on together, people of Ire. To live on as survivors is the sole way to indemnify the dead.
009	Right...	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
010	But...
011	Where are Lord Nimul and the others? I have been told that this airship is needed to move between the regions.
012	I myself do not know what happened after they were caught in Quence's magic.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0031
013	Only I was left, alone, by the crater.
014	I seriously thought I was going to die.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0030
015	Hm... I am sure they are fine. However...
016	What can we do for them as we are now?
017	There is something that we alone can do.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
018	What?!
019	Lend me your aid so that we may save Nimul and the others!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0041
020	Why was I sent to this time? How can I find the others?
021	I don't have enough information to figure that out. But...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
022	Do I have some idea of what Belt this is?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
023	Something about it reminds me of the Ire Belt.
024	The propensity to seek strength and train oneself... But there are differences, of course.
025	What's the matter? Is this the extent of your strength?
026	At this rate, gaining rank is a far-off dream for you!
027	Grr... I'm not done yet!
028	That's the spirit. You can rest when you're dead! Fight! Train! That's what we live for!
029	The strength to survive is all those in the Ire Belt desire.
030	They want the strength to withstand the harsh environment and encroaching flames of corruption.
031	But they appear to be different somehow.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
032	If they were just training, that sternness wouldn't be necessary. Wait, are they just training in the first place?
033	It looks to me as if they're trying to kill each other.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
034	Hmm... Something's happening.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
035	You all seem to be working hard, my people.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
036	It's Lord Kubera!
037	Why would he visit such a low-rank training ground?
038	Well, all the young people here are almost of age. It might be a good time to pair them up so they can grow as soldiers.
039	No, the time for us to kill each other to grow stronger has passed.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0039
040	The day to take on the Cursed Beast Mammon which—we all have been striving for for generations—is drawing near!
041	Then, that must mean...!
042	First, we need weapons. Stronger, tougher blades.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
043	Start gathering soldiers ready for slaying a dragon.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
044	Yes, sir!
045	You heard him, soldiers! The time of our end, our final trial, is at hand!
046	Those who feel they are ready for this moment, ready your gear and gather over here!
047	Time waits for no one! If you want glory on the battlefield, get ready quickly!
048	Slay a dragon? Their final trial? What are they talking about?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
049	However, with all this going on, security has been so tight that I've been unable to get close. Is it even possible to make my way inside?
050	Hurry! Lagging behind here will result in shame you will never be able to erase as a warrior!
051	Phew...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
052	I am skilled in subterfuge magic. With it, I can hide myself using the surrounding magic. Perhaps that would be useful in this situation.
053	Eulalia is better at this sort of thing than I am, though... Oh!
054	Just as I thought, the magil in this mansion is different from other kinds I've felt before.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
055	What is going on in this mansion?
056	Hm? This presence... Is that you, Nimul?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0025
057	That voice!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
058	So this is where you've been, Bianca!
059	Hmm, I honestly thought you'd come save me sooner.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
060	It couldn't be helped. After I got tossed into this region, I had no idea where I...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
061	Save you...? Do you mean to say you are trapped here?
062	In a manner of speaking. Well, if I put my mind to it, I can probably get out at any time.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
063	But I thought that if I wanted to meet back up with you, waiting here was the best way to do it.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
064	Oh, I see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
065	More importantly!
066	I have a mountain of things I would like to ask you. You seemed willing to talk about how Quence's spell failed and—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
067	How to return to your proper time?
068	That is what I would like to know about the most.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
069	You said that coming here was the quickest way to reunite with Emmel and the others.
070	Mmm, it's still a little early for that.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_battle_0016
071	In this point in time, moving freely through time is the domain of Space-Time Manipulation.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0003
072	So long as you can't use that, trying to meet up with your friends right away will be hopeless.
073	What did you say?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
074	Don't worry. It'll only take ten years.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
075	If that's what you really wish to do, spend ten year's time here. That's the most surefire way.
076	If you do that, you'll return to the time you want.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
077	Is that...all right? Won't the future be affected?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
078	I don't know about that. Space-Time Manipulation is the new possibility you all created.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
079	I obviously can't tell you outcomes that haven't come out.
080	In other words, you deceived me well and good.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
081	I never lied, but wouldn't it be better to spend ten years on a sure thing rather than endlessly wandering the Cosmic Egg forever like you were?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0011
082	That may be true, but—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
083	Keep your voice down. The guards might find you.
084	Tsk!
085	There are other things I would like to ask you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
086	What did you mean when you said this world did not exist before the birth of the Cursed Beasts?
087	You never thought about it? No, with all your traveling, you must have thought it was strange.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
088	These lands separated by the Beasts' power were once one land of seven sins. That layout has changed far too much.
089	I guess...
090	Those seven worlds that you would never have guessed were once the same world... They really weren't the same world at all.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0003
091	What did you just say?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
092	This world—the consolidated territory of those seven sins—was originally a totally different one.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
093	That is, until dragons, who were unwilling to accept the destruction of their world, started to fruitlessly struggle against it long, long ago.
094	Dragons created the Belt regions?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
095	Cursed Beasts are just tools for that end. It was people who started calling them Beasts in the first place.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
096	To compensate for losing their world, they started to draw in tons of things from beyond. Earth, water, plants, animals...
097	And then, you humans were dragged into this world.
098	I see...
099	This conversation is too vast. Nidhogg, Zafeiris, Selsieg... I've met those who called themselves dragons many times.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
100	But I was unaware they had power enough to reshape the world that much.
101	The dragons just created "Gods." Convenient gods that could save them from annihilation.
102	Gods?
103	So you have finally set foot in this domain—you, who will pierce the world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
104	Is that...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
105	But the dragons still went extinct in the end. And the world was handed down to you humans. But it was a world for dragons.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
106	Thus, the law of dragons rules the world.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
107	Which is why it's hard to live here. It must be so difficult and painful for you all.
108	The current world wasn't made for you, after all.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0030
109	It's not our world.
110	So that's why...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
111	All the days spent living in fear of corruption... The tomorrows when we cannot avoid sacrificing someone important to someone else...
112	All because this world isn't designed for us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
113	Well, it's not entirely inhospitable...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
114	But most of it.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
115	...
116	Yet, there is a way.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
117	I told you before. The Cursed Beasts are a tool for reshaping the world.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
118	The anomaly that occurred during your time... The abnormality that happened in the region was caused by that Cursed Beast losing its power.
119	I thought so.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
120	But if you defeat them, obtain them, and follow them...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
121	Your wish is sure to come true.
122	You should be able to destroy the current world and remake it for humans.
123	So how about it, Nimul? We're ready to take you.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
124	Will you join forces with us, Nimul?
125	Us...? Sounds like a devil's bargain... Oh, I see!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
126	You're also an Infinite Serpent, aren't you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
127	Hee hee, you're a perceptive one. But you're a little off.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
128	The Infinite Serpent is me. It's my old name.
129	I suppose I should introduce myself properly. My name is Bianca.
130	Creator of the Infinite Serpent organization, instigator of the fall of the dragon Zafeiris, and the one who spurred your adventure.
131	I am the mutineer of this world.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0011
132	Truly?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
133	I come to ready the troops, only to find this. What are you doing, priestess of Ouroboros?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
134	Thank you, Kubera. I suppose I said a bit too much—just a little.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0033
166	But it couldn't be helped. I've been waiting for so, so, so, sooo long.
167	The time  is nigh for a human like you who bears the right to—	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0008
135	Lord Kubera! You are the leader of this region, right?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
136	This girl and the Infinite Serpent are willing to make any sacrifice to achieve their goals!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
137	If you dance to her tune, this region will surely—
138	I am aware.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
139	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
140	To us, war is the meaning of life. It's instinct. Our pastime. The very breath in our lungs.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
141	The meaning of life...
142	We all want to become stronger.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
143	From the moment we're born. Even as babies, we bleed and sharpen our fangs.
144	Trading even the world itself for strength is not unthinkable for such creatures as we are.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
145	How can you say that?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
146	We seek the honor of being the strongest. There is no room for anyone to argue. None.
147	That is why we live, and that will be why we die.
148	You've never found this way of life...empty?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
149	Never. Just considering such as thing is a waste of our time.
150	The citizens of Greed as I know them are very different from you and yours.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
151	Oh?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0012
152	One man I know wants to make gear for others.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
153	He is the kind of person who works hard to protect and nurture something.
154	Then he is no compatriot of ours.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
155	We wield swords before we carry hoes, and come to know violence before love.
156	We are a pack of bloodthirsty warriors, far from nurturing and protective.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
157	That's... How are those the words of a leader?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
158	You are a guest from a distant land. We do not require your understanding. We only live to sin as we desire.
159	You fiend...
160	We have an intruder! Capture him!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
161	Tch...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
162	This man is an enemy who would hinder our purpose. Exterminate him according to the laws of our people.
163	Yes, sir!
164	I don't know if I have what it takes on my own, but...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
165	I have to try!
