001	We're about to reach the deepest part of the cave. I wonder what we'll find...	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
002	Oh, look! A treasure chest!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
003	Th-There really is one! And it's glistening like gold!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0009
004	Hey, you two! Don't get too close.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0014
005	What? But the treasure chest is right there!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
006	Something feels off. We should be cautious with something so dubious. Just...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0022
007	You're right, Liu Shen. It is best we exhibit prudence.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
008	It seems there is more here than simply a treasure chest.
009	You're here! We've been waiting for you! You're the pirates that awakened the Great One.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
010	What?!
011	Wh-What did you say?! The Great One? What're you talking about?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
012	Don't waste your breath denying it! We already know it was you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
013	We know foolish pirates greedy for treasure awakened the Great One when they raided his resting place.
014	Thanks to you, we know that the teachings of our order were true! And the Great One... He exists!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
015	Pirates hunting for treasure summoned the Great One...
016	...Could it be?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
017	This was once a place where a cult worshipped demons, though now it is a home to octopuses.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
018	Are you aware? Did you know that what was sealed here was a demon?!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
019	Huh?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
020	Graaaaawr!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
021	Th-The remains of that octopus?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
022	That is no octopus! It is the Great One! Through his guidance, you have been brought here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
023	The codes used on the map were developed by our order long ago. That you could decipher them is proof enough!
024	Oh... Do you really think so?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
025	Um, I uh... I just found how to read them in a book.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
026	It's a less known code, so not many people probably know about it...
027	Xiao-Xiao is very studious, so she knew the old symbols used by the old defunct cult. It's impressive.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
028	We're not defunct! We were just waiting for this opportunity! And you fools played right into it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
029	If we can call forth the Great One, you all will grovel before his majesty and splendor!
030	That is why we spread fake treasure maps around to bring you here! Because you know how to awaken him!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
031	Greedy, insolent pirates will always chase after treasure. It was easy!
032	No...!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
033	To manipulate others so selfishly... You are a disappointing lot.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0022
034	Now, tell us the method for awakening the Great One! If you do not...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
035	Of course... They have a magical device for the ritual prepared.
036	Did you notice something?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
037	Yes... While looking around, I found a hole not to be found in nature cut into the cave wall.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
038	Based on the alchemical residue, I'd assumed it was created by a weapon using some kind of magic.
039	Heh heh... Naturally, I have made preparations to deal with you savage marauders!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
040	I approve of being well-prepared, but... Your information is hogwash.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0001
041	The giant monster on the beach that you think is your Great One is nothing more than a giant octopus.
042	Wh-What are you saying?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
043	Huh? But that isn't just an octopus...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
044	Shhh...
045	We're not going to stand here silent while you blather on about whatever you please.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
046	I don't know about your Great One... But I won't let you take advantage of a pirate's love for adventure with fake maps!
047	Prepare yourselves. I'm going to teach you well and good what happens when you cross a real swashbuckler!
