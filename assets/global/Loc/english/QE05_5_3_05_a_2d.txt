001	...
002	Agatha, I know you're worried. We're all worried. I just... I think it's too dangerous for you to be up there. Could you come down?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
003	I'm sorry, Mocca. I don't mean to make you worry, but... I just have this feeling like... Like maybe there's something I can do.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
004	Agatha?
005	There's a voice... I can hear its echoes...deep within my mind.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
006	It's telling me that I already have the power to do it; to fulfill...that wish.
007	What are you talking about?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
008	Wh-what is that? Look!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
009	Now what's happening?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
010	The Jam are emerging from the roots of the withered Sephiron!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
011	What did you say?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
012	What the hell? The ground is shaking!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
013	Move, Logi!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
014	What? Ungh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
015	The Jam? Are they coming out of that hollow? Isn't that where the arboreal altar is supposed to be?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
016	At this rate...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
017	Dias! Gnrk! More of them?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
018	N-no... Logi! Dias!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0021
019	Agatha, get down! How could that power reach us, even here?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
020	Ag...a...tha. That's... That's right. My name is...!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
021	I...am a descendant of the royal family of Wratharis, and I carry a Sacred Stone within me... Satna.
022	Ahhhh! Nooo, I can't... No, father! Father! Logi? Dias?! Why...?!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0029
023	All I ever wanted was for us to be a family! That's all!
024	Enough! I keep losing the people I love, and I'm tired of it!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
025	We've all worked so hard to try to reclaim the happiness we used to share!
026	This can't be how it ends!
027	It just can't be!
028	This...feeling...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
029	It's the same as before... Could this be the power of Satna?
030	Beware the lure of the Stone. It seeks to enter this world via your desires.
031	Still, I... I want to save Logi and Dias.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
032	There must be some way to prevent them from dying. Please, Satna! Lend me your strength!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0043
033	Save us!
034	This light...! Not the Sacred Stone! Agatha, stop!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
035	Hm. I believe this is my...second time...being resurrected with Alchemy.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
036	My axe is as light as a feather in my hand, my body feels almost as buoyant, and this strength welling up within me...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0007
037	Sabareta... Of course that little brat has some dream of restoring Wratharis to its former glory. The forbidden fruit tastes sweetest, as they say...
038	It's unusual for General Vlad the Thunderer to wax poetic, if I do say so myself. Nonetheless, I must add that I would opt for a more profitable venture, if it were me.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1001
039	Oh, Anastasia! I certainly was not expecting to be met with the secret weapon of Wratharis! What an unexpected delight!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0009
040	Make no mistake. I am here only because I was called.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
041	Then I shall leave custody of this one with you. I do think that the front lines seem far more fitting a place for me, myself.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0044
042	Understood.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
043	Glurrrrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0021
044	Hmph.	VO_vlad.vlad_battle_0002
045	Ah.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0005
046	Always with the battlefields... Well, I suppose I might as well introduce myself.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0010
047	I am General Vlad, The Thunderer; one of Wratharis' Deadly Trio!
048	My name is not nearly as well-known, but there was a time that I was called Blossom.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
049	Wh-what...? This is... Agatha, you... You transmuted these Phantoms?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
050	Please, will you lend me your strength?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0041
051	Of course, Miss Agatha! You've become such a lovely young lady!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0009
052	You...know me? Oh, of course... I...really am of Wratharis' royal line, then...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
053	We can talk about all this later. For now, we'd best head for the front.	VO_vlad.vlad_battle_0003
054	Huh?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
055	Hah. Those two are a little excitable at the idea of being out on the battlefield again...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0010
056	If we dally around here too long, they're going to hog all of the glory of battle for themselves!
057	What...?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
058	No! It's too late, we won't—!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
059	How reckless of you, heirs of the Blood Wolf, Zeke.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0030
060	Y-you...! It can't be!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
061	That mastery of ice techniques... You're...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
062	I am General Neville, the Ice Snake. This battlefield is now mine.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0037
063	What are you doing here? And more importantly, why are you willing to help us now?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0022
064	Hmph. Be grateful for the mercy and affection our new master harbors for you.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0030
065	New...master? You can't mean... Not Agatha?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
066	Hmph!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0007
067	Troops, hold fast! No matter how many enemies we may face, there is nothing to fear!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
068	I shall show you what a true battle looks like, when waged by a general who understands tactics!
069	Impossible...! Where did you come from?! Which Alchemist transmuted you?!
070	That voice of hers... We had been waiting for it for so long, and so we answered.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0010
071	We, who carry blood-stained swords and souls twisted with rage... We came in to answer the voice that begged earnestly for our aid.
072	We could not call ourselves knights if we failed to respond to that cry of grief!
073	For that reason, today we come to you, not as the Deadly Trio, but as knights who have set aside their wrath!
074	Phantoms? Kamui, did you...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
075	No, it was not my doing. However, it seems they are here to help us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
076	Indeed.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0005
077	I am General Caesar, the Demon Flame.
078	I was once a knight of Wratharis.
079	We pledged our loyalty to the royal family of Wratharis, and our oath compels us to do what we can for her now!
080	You will regret this!
