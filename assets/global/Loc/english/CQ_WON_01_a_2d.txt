001	Sup, barkeep! How goes the tavern?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0001
002	You again? Hmph. Come as often as you like. I'm not gonna give you a job.
003	Please! I'm begging you here! I'll do anything!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0002
004	My pockets are getting dangerously empty! Just look at them! For the love of the gods, please!
005	Didn't you come here from Greed Dike? I don't have any jobs for outsiders. All right? So just get out of here!
006	Don't be like that! My jack of all trades business is doing terribly! Help a guy out, won't you?!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0041
007	Why, hello! It's been a while! Do you have a job for me, sweetie?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0003
008	Blimey, Strie! You waltz in here after god knows how long, and that's the first thing you ask me, eh? I suppose you had another big loss while gambling?
009	I did! I lost so much money! My purse is light as air!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0048
010	Gwahahaha! You never change, do you? I've got just the thing for you, and the reward is quite a sizeable one, too.
011	Oh! I just knew I could count on you! So? What is this job? Is the client someone I can trust?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0034
012	It's from the mayor of a neighboring village, something for the good of the people there. They're willing to pay this much...
013	Seems like there's been an outbreak of Wildpeckers. They're damaging crops and causing trouble.
014	Really, now? This is quite a large sum indeed... I'm surprised a village mayor could afford it. They must really be in trouble.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0044
015	Hey! Don't cut me out of this! I was here first, wasn't I? I want in!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
016	If you're taking down monsters, I'm your guy! You wouldn't take this jangly gambler over me, surely!
017	Oh, my! You just jumped right in, didn't you? I've never seen you around before. Who are you, exactly?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0001
018	I'm Won, a jack of all trades!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0024
019	He keeps pestering me to give him work, and I keep telling him that I don't have any jobs for a stranger.
020	Come on! You can't do this to me! I've gotta pay my board at the inn—my tab's starting to pile up! Just give me a job! Any job!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0025
021	I've no trust for you yet, outsider.
022	Fine... How about this? You two are going to do this job together. I trust Strie, after all. She's never let me down yet.
023	I don't mind doing this together. So long as you don't get in my way, that is, little boy.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
024	Little boy?! Tch... But I've gotta pay my board before the end of today or I'll be thrown out, so I guess I'm in.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
025	Haa... Having no money sucks! I can't do anything! Tch. Whatever! I'll snatch back my freedom with these fists!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0022
026	Tee hee. Are we all ready? Good! Then we'd best get going.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
027	We're almost there. Those creatures ought to be close by...	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
028	Probably.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0005
029	There! Careful, Won!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0010
030	Yeah, yeah, save your warnings!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
