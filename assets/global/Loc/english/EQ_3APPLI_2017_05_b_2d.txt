001	Ack... Wh-what happened...?!
002	Hey...why do you look like you're in so much pain? What is that monster...behind you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
003	Yuri and the other kunoichis defeated me...sent me to the bottom of the underworld...where I was supposed to sleep permanently...
004	However, there was a voice that whispered in my ear... "Is this how you will end?"
005	That's when I realized...my true desire... At that time Uzushiomaru was already there...
006	The disappointment I was made to taste...the grief, the frustration...!
007	I would share it with every single person in existence!
008	Why? Didn't Yuri and the others give you a peaceful end?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
009	Hahahah! Why would I want a peaceful end...after having obtained power?!
010	With the power I obtained in the underworld, I can finally get revenge on everyone!
011	Lisbeth...there's no convincing this person...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
012	The underworld is an overwhelmingly dark world. The souls who fall there are basked in darkness, distorting them even further...
013	What a poor person... You sought too much power.
014	What...?!
015	I know someone like you.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
016	They sought too much power...and lost the thing that was most important to them.
017	Hahah! There is nothing that is important to me! I only have one wish!
018	I want to cover all the worlds in darkness. I want to fill all humans...no, all living things with negative energy!
019	When I heard of the Sun Keys, I danced for joy.
020	Just by stealing the keys from that wench, I could slam all the worlds into darkness just like I wanted to!
021	... ...
022	Heheh. I got worried when some of the keys were removed...even if it was just a few.
023	But now, I'll take back the key from you...
024	I will remove the light from the all the worlds and plunge everything into darkness!
025	...I won't let you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0014
026	You're quite a strong-willed girl...but I'll soon send you to the underworld as well.
027	It's a world where the dead mourn and not a shred of hope exists...a world that is pitch black!
028	I'll drop you in this world! By doing so, you will be able to experience what I felt!
029	Aghh!!!
030	You're fighting against me right now! Don't aim for them! Aim for me!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
031	Oh? You seem to feel more pain when I attack your friends rather than you... In that case...!
032	Ack... I said don't do that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
033	What an arrogant little girl. That gaze filled with light and hope...with trust for your friends and for the future! Nothing infuriates me more!
034	Heheh. I will send you to your ultimate despair...where not a shred of light exists.
035	Look at this.
036	...Ahh!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
037	How convenient. I've now obtained your Sun Key.
038	No way! I'll get it back right away! Along with the other keys...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
039	Ahahahah! Right away? You don't have such an opportunity anymore... Come at me!
040	Huh?!
041	What?! Sh-she broke the key...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
042	N-no!!!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0020
043	Without the key, you can't control the sun anymore. The sun is now practically gone from that world.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
044	What? Then...there's no longer any sun in Babel?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
045	Ahahaha! What a lovely face...sunken with despair, you little brat!
046	Does that mean...this world is over?
047	Ahahah! Yes! Bye bye, sun; hello, terrible misfortune! An era of death shrouded in darkness will begin!
048	Don't worry! It won't be just this world. I'll make sure all the other worlds follow suit!
049	Ahahahahah!!!
050	No...there's still a solution.
051	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
052	With my remaining strength...I made a temporary barrier. Listen carefully, both of you.
053	Amaterasu...?
054	A solution...?
055	I will become the sun.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
056	What?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
057	Wait...what do you mean?
058	It's true that the Sun Key of Babel has been lost...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
059	However, if I become the new sun...then I can still save this world!
060	Wh-what exactly does that mean?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
061	As the one responsible for the sun...I will use my final solution.
062	Your final solution?!
063	I will unleash all the power of the sun within me...and engulf this place with light.
064	It will purify the Fallen and return the Sun Keys she has to the sun again!
065	You...you can do that?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
066	As for you two...you must take the two that are still not awake back in the pirate ship and leave here!
067	But...if you become the sun...what will happen to you, Amaterasu?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
068	You said it's the final solution. Does that mean...
069	No, you can't! We all came here to save you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
070	If I could...of course I would like to go back with all of you! Especially now that we're all friends...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
071	But, that's why I want to become the sun...in order to save all of you...my friends!
072	This is something that only I can do.
073	!!!
074	Thank you...for responding to my voice...for coming to save me.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0018
075	For becoming my friends.
076	I will continue to shine down on you from the sky of this world...always.
077	N-no...you can't! There must be another way...we can find it...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
078	I don't...have much time left.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
079	But I'm happy. After all, I can become the sun...and give strength to all of you!
080	I love all of you...my friends.
081	No...Amaterasu...how can you...? Sob...why...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
082	The barrier will dissolve soon. This is goodbye...
083	No, Amaterasu! Stop!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
084	Captain!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
085	Aim the boat towards the sea! Save all of our friends!
086	All right. I'll take responsibility and make sure we all get back.
087	Thank you...Captain.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0018
088	We're setting sail, Lisbeth.
089	B-but...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
090	We cannot let our friend's ultimate sacrifice go to waste!
091	...! Sob...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
092	What is this barrier...? You're going to let them escape! I won't let you!
093	Those...are my very words to you!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0001
094	Huh?! You...!!! Ge-get back!
095	We'll go together...you fallen soul...or shall I call you by your true name, Kayako...
096	?! Wh-what...?!
097	Hyaaaahh...!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0032
098	Agggghhhhh!!! Le-let me go!!! My plan of eternal darkness...!!!
099	I am the Sun God Amaterasu!!! I will not surrender to your dark desires!!!
100	...?!
101	Amaterasu!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0026
102	The massive tidal wave generated by the explosion immediately sends all on the pirate ship back to their original world.
103	Good bye...everyone...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
104	Amaterasu...
105	Even if I have been defeated, another will come who will desire to plunge every world into darkness and fill them with despair...
106	!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
107	The intense sunlight engulfs the darkness and rises to the heavens...creating a new sun.
108	The pirate ship safely departs from the Twilight Zone. Yuri and Laevateinn, who had still been in battle with their nightmares, awaken.
109	However, their lost friend would never return.
110	...It's over.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
111	Oh! Look! The sun!!!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_1047
112	Looking up at the sky, they see the sun shining brighter than ever before.
113	So...Amaterasu brought light to this world.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0020
114	It's all over now...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
115	Thank you, everyone. Let's go home.
116	...!
117	Huh? What about her?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
118	Her world has been saved. There's no reason to stay here.
119	But...I want to stay a little longer...	VO_yuri.yuri_chara_1006
120	Yuri, don't you have somewhere to return to?
121	Yes, I do, but...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0018
122	You have a world you need to return to as well, right?
123	So...this is goodbye. I don't feel ready for this.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
124	But the time that I spent with all of you...it wasn't bad...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
125	I feel the same! I'll never forget about everyone I met here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
126	I guess this is the end of the adventure.
127	Maybe someday in some world, we'll have another chance to go on an adventure together...
128	I'll look forward to that day.
129	...Agreed.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
130	Me too, of course!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0004
131	<p_name>...when that day comes...will you wear this hat again?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
132	With all the confusion remaining from this incident...until the other worlds are saved, I don't think I can wear it.
133	Besides...after everything is finished, the person who this hat should be dedicated to...is her...Amaterasu.
134	Yes...you're right...we should send this hat to her.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
135	<p_name> and the others look up at Amaterasu, now transformed into a radiant sun...
136	The pirate boat sails across the glistening sea towards the next world.
137	It travels the worlds...gathering all the Sun Keys...
