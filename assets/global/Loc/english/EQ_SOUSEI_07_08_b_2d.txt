001	Skrrrraaaaarrr!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
002	That was the last of them. As I expected, mindless corruption is no match for me.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
003	You did so well, Luke!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0047
004	Skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
005	You fought by controlling a dragon...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0045
006	You did not rely on your strength alone, but borrowed the power of another more suited to fighting.
007	That is its own strength, one might say. And what lies beyond that is...
008	Lord Kubera...?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
009	It appears the next obstacle has arrived.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
010	Huh? Oh!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
011	Although they may not have will of their own, it seems they can sense what is in the workshop behind us.
012	That a blade able to eradicate their master is being made there.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
013	They can't be allowed to stop my brother's work!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0013
014	Skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
015	Wait. Rushing in without a plan is...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
016	She has gained a curious strength, but she is still unaware of the ways of war.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0030
017	To think that I would babysit a child!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
018	To fight to protect someone. To fight for something I believe in. I see. This is a strength we know nothing of.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0045
019	However, if this strength is necessary, we will obtain it.
020	So that we, the people of Avaritia, will reach higher realms!
021	Hah!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
022	Hmmm. With this technique...this material would be a little brittle.
023	How was this problem solved in previous Gears of Judgment?
024	We used a special resin ore called Sephirium.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
025	It was crafted from the magil of the Cursed Beast of Gluttony.
026	I see. To withstand sin magil, the same sin magil is required.
027	Although, under the circumstances, I do not wish to continue using it. That is why we will use this instead.
028	What is this sword?
029	In the future, humans will attain gear that can defeat the Beasts. This is a prototype of that gear.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
030	Prototype - Dragonslayer.
031	This blade contains the material I spoke of earlier, Sephirium. If we melt it down and reforge it...
032	It could be turned into new gear. That is a good plan.
033	Ready your iron hammer, Yna. We will now begin forging the Gear of Judgement.
034	On it!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0038
035	Fabulous work, Yna.
036	I am amazed at what you've accomplished. With this quality of work, you are ready.
037	From this day forth, you may call yourself Yna Ku.
038	That's... This technique... The me of this time would never be able to...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
039	Even so, so long as you reach this level one day, there will be no issue.
040	Heh. With this, my final duty has come to an end.
041	.........
042	I have grasped the theory behind the Gears of Judgment. All that is left is to achieve that singlular form with our labor and tenacity.
043	Match my breathing, Yna. From here on out, we'll be shortening our lives and shrinking time!
044	Yes, Master!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0038
