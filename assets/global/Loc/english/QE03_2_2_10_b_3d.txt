001	Ufggg!!!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0043
002	Unbelievable!	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0026
003	He-Headmistress...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
004	She won...!!!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0024
005	Huff... huff...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
006	Ack...I can't die here...	VO_eleonora.eleonora_battle_0019
007	My body...it's healing itself...?!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0025
008	I've helped a lot of people in this way until now.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
009	Only a child can surpass and save her parents. Are you still afraid of this power, headmistress?
010	...!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0042
011	Eleonora...I've seen Lisbeth's power. It's far from ominous.
012	I've seen her save a small life with my own eyes.
013	Still, she should not reach for the Sacred Stone.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_battle_0020
014	Please! I don't mean any harm!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
015	I will put an end to the curse of the Sacred Stone. Please teach me how to reach Asmodeus!
016	...I will not tell you.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0039
017	No...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
018	What is there to tell? As I said, no witch has ever reached for and grasped the Sacred Stone.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0040
019	I can't believe that even the headmistress doesn't know.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
020	You cannot reach the Sacred Stone...that's what I was taught growing up.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0037
021	Our curriculum is incorporated in a way that prevents young witches from wanting to seek the cursed Sacred Stone.
022	You mean like some kind of psychological influence or something?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
023	You're as quick-witted as ever, Alma Haas Lustburg.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0030
024	This country's education is approached in a way that prevents us from getting close to the Sacred Stone.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
025	There must be a reason why they've distanced us from Asmodeus other than that it being a dangerous power.
026	If that's so, then we may learn some truth from the person who created the curriculum as well as the school!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
027	Are you talking about...Queen Venus?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
028	As for a clue...there's a lot that only the queen knows. You're going to the Royal Palace, aren't you?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
029	Yep! Although...I might get caught.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
030	How about I lend you hand so that you don't.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
031	We've come this far together already. I'll go with you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
032	Thanks!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
033	Wait.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0003
034	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
035	Wh-what is it?
036	No...it's nothing. Just be careful. Those at the Royal Palace will not be so easily reasoned with as myself.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0039
037	Understood!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
038	So you've entrusted it to that child, huh?
039	Yes. I've entrusted her with the magic of hope that we ancient witches once looked to.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0037
040	That child may have the power to melt the ice of this country.	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0020
