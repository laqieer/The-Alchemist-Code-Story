001	Hyah!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0001
002	Agh...!
003	I won't kill you. There's a mountain full of questions that you'll have to answer for.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
004	Heh... You're not getting anything from me...
005	Ugh!
006	What?! He's biting on poison!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
007	So he'd rather kill himself than give up information. Quite thorough, aren't they?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0020
008	From the timing of it, I guess there's little doubt he was an assassin sent by the forces who are after the Mikaboshi.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
009	Well, that's the only probable explanation. That being said, I didn't expect them to act so quickly.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
010	Ironically, they've confirmed the value of the Mikaboshi.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
011	So...it's a spirit gem containing a massive amount of Alchemia.
012	According to the reports from our investigative unit, the amount of Alchemia included in the Mikaboshi is supposedly comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.
013	I see. That's hard to believe.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
014	If something with that much power were to fall into the hands of someone who already possess a Sacred Stone...the equilibrium of this world will collapse.
015	You did well to report this. You have my gratitude. Go now and rest your body.
016	... ...
017	What's the matter?
018	I don't want to say this, but if only Captain Cadanova were here now...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
019	Heheh. True. I'm sure he would've done a much better job of planning this.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0010
020	I'm sorry. Due to my lack of experience...you might have to get your hands dirty.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0035
021	Don't worry about it. I'm not so pure as to worry about a little dirty work.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
022	Besides...you truly did well. I never once felt you were lacking in experience.
023	You are too kind.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0033
024	Well then...we're up against time. We need to move out as soon as possible.
025	Our aim is to destroy the Mikaboshi.
026	Are you going to change strategies?
027	Yes. This may seem to overturn my earlier order, but I want you to summon all the regiments in order to change our strategy.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
028	Captain...
029	Kudan?
030	I heard what is going on, Lord Commander. It appears something strange is in the works.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
031	As you know, I am here empty-handed. Please give me a mission.
032	No matter how strong the opponent, I promise I will defeat them.
033	No..your orders remain the same. Stay put.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
034	What...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
035	What do you mean?! Are you trying to say that you don't believe in my abilities? In that case, I'll make you recall them right now!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
036	Calm down.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
037	What I mean is that your strength is inconsequential to this strategy.
038	Please don't give me such a blatant excuse. Didn't you say to gather all Paladins and regroup?
039	... ...
040	This is an order. You are not needed this time. Stay back. Insubordination will not be tolerated.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
041	Ack...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
042	Very...well.
043	Heh. It doesn't go the way it used to with Cadanova. I guess I still have a lot to learn.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
