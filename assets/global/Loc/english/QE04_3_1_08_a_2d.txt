001	Hmph. You are far too inadequate to speak of changing the future. Before you make such bombastic claims, I'd suggest spending more time improving your prospects.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
002	Wait, Tehre!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0014
003	...Fuu!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
004	When I returned I couldn't find any of you. Well then, Tehre, do you intend to break the law of Saga?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
005	...This is a summons to the Sprite Trio Discourse. Accept it.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
006	If I don't, will you kill me? Just like you killed Alia!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
007	!!!
008	Hmph! Did you think you could beat me? You've still got a lot to learn!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0001
009	...Hmph.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
010	?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
011	You still had a gun...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
012	That doesn't make me a coward. I worked hard to get to this level of skill.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
013	I am weaker than you, but I am resourceful enough to figure out ways to defeat you.
014	...Tehre.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
015	Alia entrusted Saga to you...and now look at your wretched state!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0017
016	...Don't forget. I still haven't forgiven you for killing Alia!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
017	Tehre, I have no words to respond to that. All I have to say is this: as you know, Saga is in a crisis.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0035
018	Can you not find it within yourself to lend us your strength...Tehre?
019	...Hyah!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0001
020	...Hnnnng!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0043
021	Fuu!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
022	Now is not yet the time.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0039
023	Then what would you have us do?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0021
024	Sit back...and watch me protect Saga without your assistance.	VO_terre.terre_battle_0010
025	You say you wish to protect Saga, yet you have joined forces with the Gluttony army!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0017
026	In order to protect Saga, I would join forces with all that is evil.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
027	I am certain...that is what Alia would've wanted!
