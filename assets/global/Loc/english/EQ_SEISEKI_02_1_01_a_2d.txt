001	Mizuchi, I'm sure he won't give up. He'll use any method he can to find us.
002	If worse comes to worst, save yourself.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
003	Don't worry, Chihaya. I'm sure this cave will be safe!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0007
004	After all, everyone knows this is a nesting ground for monsters!
005	He wouldn't think we'd run away here, would he?
006	Besides, before entering here, I contacted the Holy Guard!
007	Oh, those famous knights?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0044
008	Yes! If he uses Alchemy to harm us, I'm sure the Paladins will act on it.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
009	I'm smart, aren't I?	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0010
010	Heheh. You are.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
011	Besides, you've got me! We'll just have to hold on a little longer until help arrives!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0007
012	Let's go, Vice-Captain Kudan...whoops, I mean newly appointed Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0015
013	...Come.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
014	Hyaaaaaaah!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
015	Whoaaa!
016	A lot of unnecessary moves, as usual, Kanon.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
017	Ack... I'm not giving up yet!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
018	Oh, come on! How long are you gonna do this?! Kanon, do you even know why you're here?	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
019	Of course I do, Kagura!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
020	But I made a promise that I would become stronger! I'm gonna do everything I can to become a first-class knight!
021	A promise? With who?
022	It's a secret!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0023
023	Apparently, it was with the deceased Captain Cadanova.
024	Ack! Why did you tell her, Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0029
025	Because it's irrelevant to our mission; we've no more time for small talk.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
026	Like Kudan said, do you really understand the purpose of our mission?
027	I told you that I do! We're going into that cave hidden up ahead, where...um, what was her name again?
028	...Chihaya.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
029	Right, Chihaya! We're going to find this person called Chihaya and save her!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0011
030	Indeed. According to our information, her pursuer can wield Alchemy.
031	If we make one wrong move, it could cost us her life. This is a dangerous mission, so keep your guard up.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0030
032	Yes, Captain!
033	All right. Let's begin our mission.
034	...We've arrived.
035	So, Chihaya is inside this cave.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0045
036	Yes. However, I've been told that it's a den of monsters in there. As we advance, don't let your guard down.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
037	Wow, it really is filled with monsters! Why did this Chihaya person hide in here out of all places?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0029
038	Who knows? Maybe because she's an amateur?
039	Huh?
040	Her way of thinking is too naive.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
041	Her intentions may have been good, but she failed to consider how her actions could bring about war.
042	Cast aside your personal feelings, Kagura. Your unfiltered emotions will only dull your blade.
043	Oki-doki.
044	Huh? What was that about?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
045	I know you and the Captain were acquaintances from before, but did you also know this Chihaya person?
046	I've never even met her.
047	Oh, I see. You just sounded like you were familiar with her.
048	Anyway, just so you know, Kudan and I aren't just acquaintances.
049	Huh?
050	Heheheh... Just so you know, our relationship isn't that superficial.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0007
051	What's that supposed to mean? You're just childhood friends or something, right?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
052	We're not childhood friends. Our bond goes much deeper♪	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0023
053	Deeper? Wa-wait... Are you saying that you two have that kind of relationship?!
054	Why are you blushing?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
055	W-well...I've never done anything like that yet, so...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
056	Stop speaking nonsense. What do you mean by 'anything like that'?	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
057	Let's stay on subject.
058	Y-yes, Captain!
059	Chihaya is a shrine maiden who is trying to restore the land of her war-torn country. The locals trust her deeply.
060	In the midst of her activities, I heard she was under attack by someone who wields Alchemy.
061	So, she ran away into this cave with a kid called Mizuchi, huh?
062	Apparently, it was this Mizuchi who contacted the Holy Guard.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
063	I think I understand, but then again not really.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
064	Anyway, we just need to rescue this Chihaya and Mizuchi, right?
065	Right.
066	Eeek! What the...?!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
067	No more talk. Focus on fighting.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
