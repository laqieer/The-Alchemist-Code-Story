001	Ugh! Dangit!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
002	Your armor is different from that of the guards in the royal capital. Are you all from the rebel army?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
003	We are no rebels! We are the Liberation Army of the South!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0016
004	Ceclidis, that dog! I never would have thought he'd really convince the Holy Guard to work for him!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
005	Can you not see that this is merely a pretext to give him an excuse to interfere with our domestic affairs?!
006	Hmmm. There seems to have been a misunderstanding.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
007	Our purpose here is to prevent the abuse of Alchemy. We have no intention of interfering with your affairs.
008	You expect us to believe that?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
009	We have completed disarming the rebels, sir!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
010	Good work. Now, all of you may go.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
011	We cannot allow you to have your weapons back, but this should be plenty of food and water.
012	Go back to your camp or quit the war; do as you wish.
013	You're letting us go? What are you playing at?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
014	I told you. We do not intend to get involved with your affairs.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
015	We are scouts and nothing more. We have no interest in involving ourselves in any kind of combat.
016	Really...? We thought you lot were reinforcements for the Royal Army assaulting the harbor.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0021
017	Wait, the Royal Army is assaulting the harbor? Why would they be attacking their own country's center of commerce?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
018	You did not know?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
019	The harbor is under attack by the Third Legion at General Ceclidis' command.
