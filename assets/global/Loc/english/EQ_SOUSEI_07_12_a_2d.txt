001	Great Beast Mammon... I stand before you once again!	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0016
002	Now is the time that the deeds of we, the people of Avaritia, will come to fruition!
003	Even in the midst of destruction, my ambition is still unfulfilled!
004	Show me your power! The power we built!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
005	All that lies between us... Let these days of ceaseless battles satisfy my soul!
006	Foolish.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
007	The people of the Avaritia Belt are this foolish?
008	Do you long for your own destruction to this degree? Are you so filled with despair?
009	Kubera... You, who were born to the Avaritia Belt, the strongest of the humans...	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
010	What you say is true. We humans are foolish. We're weak. Still!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
011	That is why we want power! And strength! And that is why I have finally made my way to this place!
012	My friend Roh Ku and...
013	The new blacksmith Yna Ku have forged this sword, Taurus!
014	And with the aid of his friends from another land...
015	We start to fight for our right to survive here!	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0007
016	...
017	What?	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0001
018	Fight to survive, you say? That is what you people of Avaritia will fight for?
019	Indeed.
020	I am no longer the person I once was.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
021	Those of the Avaritia Belt desire only strength and mastery over violence.
022	That is why we have sacrificed many of our people.
023	However, the priestess of Ouroboros said we would still perish.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
024	Bianca said that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
025	Which means that method was weak. It was far off from the strength we sought.
026	Thus, we who are devoted to strength, who are knees-deep in the sin of greed...
027	We must throw it away without hesitation. We must change our methods without shame.
028	This man, Nimul, is strong. What is the reason behind it? What does he have that we do not?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
029	Saving a dragon fated to die. Preventing a girl from falling to sin. And just now, fearing for the death of soldiers who do not fear death.
030	The will to protect... That will makes him stronger.
031	If that is the case, then I shall emulate it. It is a small price to pay to become stronger.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
032	Lord Kubera! Then, you...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
033	(I still think we differ over a very key point, but this means...!)
034	Stand, Nimul. You will save this place, will you not?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
035	Yes, of course!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
036	Incomprehensible.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0020
037	Living a toughened existence through a self-destructive cycle of cannibalism is supposed to be the purpose of the people of Avaritia.
038	Are you turning your back on that? You would give up the hundreds of trials you went through for an idea that just came to you?	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
039	Incomprehensible. Incomprehensible. Incomprehensible! Is this wavering what intelligence looks like? How far will humans...?
040	Unacceptable. I cannot accept this!
041	You all are unfit to be the generation that follows the dragons! I must destroy you all this instant!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
042	The mass of magil has grown even larger? What is happening?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
043	It is no longer holding back.
044	Pillar Beasts... Cursed Beasts are a system for collecting and sealing the sins of the human world. However, human sins exceed expectations.
045	Sin is produced endlessly, stagnates, and becomes unstoppable. Due to this, Cursed Beasts absorb too much and go mad.
046	If the sin in a region is too insufficient, they will gain a certain amount of intelligence as Mammon has.
047	However, they will eventually turn into simple beasts that only eat sin like those in the other regions.
048	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
049	In other words, we are seeing the reason and commencement of the destruction of this region by its Cursed Beast.
050	Be that as it may, it doesn't change what we must do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
051	We must defeat the cursed beast with our own hands and free this place!
052	Let's head out! We must defeat Cursed Beast Mammon here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
