001	Haaa...haaa... Y-yes! I knew I had it in me!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0047
002	Ghaarrrrgh!
003	Ack! There are more?!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0026
004	Is this how you do it?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0010
005	Gyargh—
006	Huh?
007	Oops. Did I overdo it? Zafeiris is gonna get mad at me.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
008	D-did you...? With one hit?! Wh-wh-who are you?!
009	Me? I'm Lil! What's your name?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
010	M-my name is Ambrosia, if you must know.
011	A-Ambro...siaifyumustno?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0031
012	That's too long! Can I just call you Sia? Is that okay?
013	Huh? Uh... Sure, I guess. You seem a little...slow.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0005
014	Um, yeah, I was born only a little while ago.
015	Schmeier told me dragon bodies develop slowly, so I've gotta grow up before I can move any faster.
016	No, I didn't mean you move slowly, I meant... You know what? Never mind.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0016
017	So, what are you, anyway? That was an incredible amount of magil you brandished there.
018	Magil? You know magil?! You know about the dragons' blood?!
019	S-so you're actually...a dragon, then?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
020	Yep! I am! I'm Schmeier's masterpiece!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0006
021	I feel like we're having two very different conversations right now.
022	Anyway, if you're one of the dragons, you must know Claybelle, right? I presume that's why you've come here.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0030
023	Crei...?
024	N-never mind. I'll just take you to her. Come with me, please.
025	Thanks, Sia!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0007
026	I sense Lil's presence. She must have used her power here.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
027	Against Ophioneus' pursuers, I suppose. Or perhaps...?
028	There seems to be a town ahead. Hopefully that's where I'll find her. I'll feel a lot better once we've been reunited.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
