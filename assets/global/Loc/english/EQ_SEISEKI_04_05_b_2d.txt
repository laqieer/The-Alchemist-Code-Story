001	Commander, have you managed to finish that training of yours?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0002
002	Yes, it was successful. Now we can continue our strategy as planned.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
003	I see. That's good to hear.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0044
004	Soon, the other captains should arrive soon. After everyone has gathered, let's start with specific instructions.
005	Lord Commander, is that you there?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0001
006	...?!
007	Most Reverend Bishop...and all distinguished members of the council.
008	Things seem to be moving along well. Although I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or not.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
009	Indeed...things are going well.
010	I heard that you plan on implementing a large-scale strategy. Is this true?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
011	Yes. Although I will not reveal the details.
012	Very well, very well. I am deeply impressed with your dedication to your duties.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
013	However, do be careful not to take such dedication too far.
014	What do you mean by that?
015	Regardless of the fact that your duty is to enforce justice...by being too dedicated to this cause, you may lower the reputation of the Holy Order itself.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
016	After all, at the end of the day, the enforcement of justice is nothing more than the enforcement of power.
017	Yes. Of course. I understand this.
018	Indeed. Well said. Do continue to dedicate yourself to your duties.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
019	... ...
020	Commander, what was that?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
021	Those are members of the council that were dispatched from the Holy Order and their leader, His Most Reverend Bishop. In reality, their rank corresponds to one higher than ours.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
022	I see. So that's the rumored...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0045
023	Beneath their clean-cut clergy robes, they are lots who hide an eery attachment to the Sacred Stones.
024	I rarely say this. After all, they're a conniving lot who are already aware of our top secret plan.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
025	This may just be wishful thinking...but they don't appear to know the details.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0017
026	Still, it never hurts to be careful.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
027	If they discover that this mission is for the Mikaboshi, they may attempt something.
028	Very true. We must be extremely careful with the leaking of information.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
029	Yes. Also, I hope we can implement the plan without having a single casualty.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
030	Kazahaya, give instructions to each regiment captain. We will implement the strategy as planned. I'll begin the final adjustments with Kagura.
031	Yes, Sir!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
032	I can't believe it... Those two...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
