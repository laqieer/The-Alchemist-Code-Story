001	According to the map it should be… Look!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0031
002	Numa?!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0002
003	We need to drink that medicine… But I have no idea what's in it, so…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0029
004	Don't worry. I'll drink it.
005	Ughhh… That's really bitter…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0006
006	Numa! Numa!
007	I can understand them. They're saying… "Danger, danger! Enemy approaching!"	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0039
008	Huh?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0025
009	Numaaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
010	"Go away, enemy," it said. Huh?!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
011	Cordelia, what do you mean?
012	My guess is that they think we're the enmy!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0042
013	Numaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
014	Waaah!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0043
015	That was close…! But there are more coming from the nest. What do we do?
016	Since they're attacking, we have no choice but to fight back.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0030
017	B-but Blanchett said we shouldn't be harsh against them, so we shouldn't kill them…
018	Not to kill them, but to make them calm down and communicate with them… We need to stop them.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0031
019	Tethys?
020	With my water magic, we can restrain them.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0002
021	Got it! I'll lead them towards the river!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0004
022	Numaaa?!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
