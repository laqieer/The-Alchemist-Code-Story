001	...Impressive knife skills.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
002	I'm a top-class chef, after all.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
003	What's the matter--can't attack? Put up a fight or you're going to die!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
004	…The thing is…if it'll make you feel better, I've got to just take it.
005	…
006	I heard the horrors of what you and Kaede went through… If you don't let this out now, we might never be able to move forward.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
007	So, give me all you got. I can take it. So long as--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
008	You eat more of my cooking, next time!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
009	…
010	…
011	…Tch.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
012	…Huh?
013	That reminds me…Kaede told me what to say in this situation…Ah, yes…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
014	"Thanks for the meal."
015	…!!
016	If you do anything to hurt Kaede, I'll kill you… Do you hear me?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
017	…Loud and clear! I promise I'll take care of her.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
018	Thus, humans and demons were united in peaceful harmony.
019	Not everyone was in agreement, but those voices soon faded.
020	They were too tired of the fighting.
021	And suddenly it seemed like the dark days of the past were a distant memory.
022	Tranquil days followed one after the other.
023	Eventually, Koga and Kaede were wed.
024	Koga still hadn't gotten Kaede to say his food was "delicious."
025	That wasn't a big deal to Kaede though. Since their new married life made her…happy.
026	Koga continued to cook for demons while also honing his skills.
027	Now that they were married, all that was left was to make Kaede say that magic word.
028	"I don't care if it takes me a lifetime--I'm gonna hear you say it!"
029	"Bring it on."
030	It seemed as if their days would be forever spent in idyllic bliss.
031	But the longer there is peace, the more shadows begin to creep in.
032	Their lofty vision had become the norm and conflict was now the exception.
033	Times like these are when "evil" most often appears.
