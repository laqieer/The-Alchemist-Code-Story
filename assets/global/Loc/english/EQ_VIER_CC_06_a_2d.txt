001	Try as I might to block it out...
002	...the cacophony of the feeding insects vibrates endlessly in my head.
003	I cover my ears and yet...
004	I have naught to sell to a dark elf.
005	So you're halfway through your transformation into dark elf, hm? Well? Which of our brethren did you kill? How dare you...
006	Filthy.
007	However much time passes, wherever I go...
008	How do you just go on living like that?
009	Where are your manners? Who is your master?
010	Black ears like antennae, accumulating unwarranted contempt.
011	No matter what I do...
012	Oi. How much?
013	You've got guts, speakin' up. Sorry, there's not enough money in the world...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
014	Geh? Gahahahahaha! You tryin' to make me laugh?!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0007
015	Beset by cruelty on all sides...
016	There's nowhere safe to sleep, no time to dream, and my will ground away to nothing...
017	My life is already out of my hands.
018	Hey, listen.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
019	Welcome...
020	You call this fortune-telling? More like fortune-lying.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
021	I...
022	Nothing you predicted happened. It was so wrong I should have just expected the opposite of everything you said to have happened.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
023	That's the nature of fortune.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
024	So it's on the dot if you get it right, and on the dot if you don't?
025	That's how it works.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
026	Just tell me the truth. I don't appreciate such pitiful scamming.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
027	Even if it's not what you want to hear?
028	Huh. You're selling dreams, are you? I thought you were selling insight into the future.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
029	No one can know the future. No one can know the truth.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
030	There is more happiness to be found in being lied to.
031	That's not the kind of crap I thought I'd ever hear from a fortuneteller.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
032	Then shall I give you a fortune guaranteed to come true?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
033	If you please.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
034	Payment upfront, please.
035	No, but I promise I'll make it worth your while if it's good.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
036	Fine then. Let us begin.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
037	Hoo... The anticipation's got me on my toes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
038	Here is your guaranteed fortune: "Sometime in the future, you will die."
039	That's your play?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
040	It's a human failing to believe you can live on forever, which is why you hold onto dreams of the future.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
041	Yet all that truly awaits in your future...is death.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
042	Don't you have any dreams?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
043	Only of death.
044	Oh, good for you. At least you're consistent...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
045	Speaking of the death that waits in the future is pointless.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
046	That's why I prefer to tell of events that will make you happy in this life. All you need to achieve happiness is to believe me when I say it will happen.
047	The thing is...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
048	I want to know about my death.
049	A philosopher, are you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0016
050	The incredible thing about predictions is that they stick in your head, no matter how it pans out.
051	I suppose that is the way of them.
052	Tell me how I'll die, oracle.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
053	...
054	It's guaranteed to come true, right? The prediction of my impending death.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
055	Are you certain you want to know?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
056	Only if it is the truth.
057	I don't know what...y-you all were counting on...but there is no limit to my power!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
058	Huh?!
059	You could defeat me right now.
060	You have the power to do so, yet you lack the conviction to see your ambitions through.
061	There is only one reason for that.
062	You still cling to your bonds to others.
063	You've never thrown yourself into absolute solitude by cutting all ties you have with those you love.
064	If...your soul is lost...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
065	...!
066	I-I won't be able to...f-follow. P-please, Sol...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
067	...
068	Please... D-don't...leave me. I don't want...to be...alone.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
069	...!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0025
070	Did you see it? My death?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
071	You're...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0003
072	Yes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
073	In time, the sun will set and the stars that surround it will fall.
074	...
075	It's no good... It's the same as before...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
076	Well, did I actually die?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
077	Huh?
078	Did I die properly, along with the others?
079	I'm sorry. It's fragmented. I can't see it clearly.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0035
080	Well, that's hardly worth anything.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
081	It's fine. You don't owe me anything.
082	Hmph. How about this? A fortune for a fortune. Interested?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
083	You're going to read the fortune of a fortuneteller?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0016
084	Payment upfront, please.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
085	You're going to charge me?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
086	It's only fair, don't you think?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
087	Huh...?
088	With this, we'll really be even.
089	Umm...
090	It'll be a reset. I'm offering you a clean slate with me if you let me tell your future.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
091	Ok...
092	I've got it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
093	Well? What awaits me?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
094	Why don't you come with me and mine?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
095	What a rip off. That's neither fortune-telling, nor a prediction.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
096	Just an idea, really. One that will shed light on your past and let you make the most of it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
097	My...past?
098	No human doesn't know that death is coming for them... That is why we try to leave behind legacies and children, write wills, and strive to leave our mark on history.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
099	And me? I care way too much about "those who have gone before" if you get my drift.
100	I've read about the war of the high elves in history books and fiction.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
101	The literature talks of a high elven hero who slew more dark elves than any other; one renowned for their magic, known by the name of Ephylinde.
102	...
103	Apparently their favorite phrase was "killing those who are evil is not an act of evil"...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
104	That...isn't who I am anymore.
105	Why, because you're a dark elf now?
106	You know what sin creates a dark elf, don't you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0016
107	I don't give a damn who you are, high elf or dark elf.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
108	So you'll take just anyone you think is powerful?
109	You're starting to get it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
110	You're very forward.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
111	Well, there aren't that many people out there with real power.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
112	The Veda Templars.
113	Join us and your dream will come true.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
114	You mean...?
115	You'll be able to die, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
116	I am the darkness.
117	You... You were once the light.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
118	Offer your service, and you will receive...a revelation.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
119	...
120	Even if I have been corrupted?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
121	You have no dreams, do you?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
122	Mystic Tower Veda Fringe Dimension
123	That was what she said.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
124	There's nothing to be excited about. I can't see any blooming seeds in her. No hope for the future, nothing to believe in...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0016
125	Stop judging people by their ability to excite you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
126	She's like a shed skin, no substance. No fleeting desires, no base passions... A snow white soul.
127	It's not a bad thing not to have high hopes. You pay more attention to your immediate surroundings.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
128	It's just...insufferably dull.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
129	More importantly, does a person like this even have anything to trade for the power of another dimension?
130	It's distasteful.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
131	That rich, coming from you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
132	You're not wrong.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
133	You...
134	Sorry to keep you waiting.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
135	Are you really? No matter, you're here now. The fourth of us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
136	We're about to see the dead.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
137	What?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
138	This...sweet fragrance...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0027
139	Huh?!
140	We can't move?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
141	It's an illusion... So powerful. It's so persistent!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0025
142	At last, someone with power...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
143	Someone who can put me to sleep.
144	What?!
145	You're saying we're being manipulated by an illusion?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
146	Do I have to walk you through it?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
147	Stop!
148	Bang.
149	Sol's magic bullet?!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0026
150	Well, that was pathetic. You'll never hit the vital points at that rate.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0014
151	Should I make it easier for you? Aim here, for my eardrum. It'll give you a straight shot to my brain. Take me out in one hit.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
152	You're wrong if you think it'll be that easy to get me to do what you want.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
153	Well, it was worth a shot.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0016
154	Nngh!	VO_drei.drei_battle_0019
155	Here, boy. Come.
156	Killjoy. This isn't fair.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0016
157	Sometimes a hardy body is just an inconvenience.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
158	Are you nuts?! Now that you have the power of another dimension, you want to use us to kill you?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
159	Anyone will do. Anyone who will put me to sleep. Man or woman... It doesn't matter to me.
160	Any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog! That's my philosophy!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
161	There's no gender in this world.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
162	Haa... Haa... Well done... Keep it up!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
163	Well, you're certainly more troublesome and interesting than I'd expected. You've got a lot of nerve making us do this.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0013
164	Deceived again...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
165	I'm tired of all this.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
166	Hoping and trying not to hope every time I meet someone.
167	If you're seeking death, you didn't need to wait for anyone.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0018
168	I have nothing against you two. Your timing just happened to be convenient for me.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
169	I'm the one who invited you to join us, so I'm responsible for you! This isn't where you die! You know that!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
170	Stop saying such pathetic things!
171	I'm not here to put on a show. I want to die as a high elven hero.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
172	I am the corruption that must be extinguished. I am a dark elf, guilty of killing my own. I fooled the sun of Lost Blue!
173	This nightmare... I just...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
