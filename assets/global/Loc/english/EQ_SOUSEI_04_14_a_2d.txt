001	The quickening of the Cursed Beast echoes even in here.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
002	The fight between my king and the Pursuers has begun...
003	...
004	I forcibly tried to ruin your brother with corruption, so how...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0030
005	...how can you sleep with such a peaceful expression...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0001
006	I...
007	Left flank! What's your status?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
008	They're putting on the pressure! They've started to split and multiply right on the battlefield!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
009	Is this what made Nimul nervous?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
010	As long as we are in the sanctuary of the Beast, the numbers of the Sinners will keep increasing...
011	But we cannot give in! Nimul and the others are still fighting, too! So there's hope we can see this battle through!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
012	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0002
013	Ahhh! Doesn't it seem like its movements are getting more and more aggressive?	VO_mela.mela_battle_0022
014	Why d'ya have to go and lock on to me like this?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
015	It seems like its gotten more lively since Beelzebub appeared.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
016	But there's an upside to this. Now, we can spend our time just dodging attacks.
017	You say that, but don't forget that I can sense you readying that ultra-super attack!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0010
018	Well, it's not like I enjoy letting it put us on the defensive.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
019	Once the tides turn, I want to be ready to put it down in one!
020	There ya go, Nyx! Sneaky as always!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
021	Would you stop saying things that make me look bad? Oh!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
022	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_a
023	Aw, feeling lonely now that we're not trying as seriously anymore?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
024	Guess we've gotta do it this way... So let's kick it up just a notch!
025	Double shoot! Can't believe I really needed repairs in the middle of a battlefield like this?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
026	Okay, now I'll be able to start fighting again!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
027	...
028	So now...
029	Man, things look to just keep getting worse and worse. I've got to increase the Engineer Soldier's capacity next time...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
030	Oh, this is bad, this is bad!
031	C'mon, Nimul, you've gotta pull through! Before my last trump card falls, at least...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
032	You merged with the Cursed Beast?! To do something like that, your very self would...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
033	Don't underestimate me, human. I am descended from Dragons, who were the originators of magil in this world.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0020
034	Even your ability to give form to spirits is within my capabilities.
035	What... This technique... Spiritbonding?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
036	No. This is a particular technique created by the Dragons that manipulates the way of the world...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0003
037	What you call Spiritbonding is no more than a crude imitation of this.
038	Give up, humans. You just happen to have been unlucky enough to be born into this world as you are...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0020
039	You have no right to say something like—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0013
040	Nimul! If this continues, we'll have no cards left to play in this battle!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
041	I know. But it's not over. We still...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
042	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
043	It's no use. Even the best of your human abilities are far behind what we can do.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0019
044	That might be true... But that only means we have to be a little more clever about how we attack!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0010
045	What?
046	So you've come to destroy the Cursed Beast part of me. However...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0002
047	Eeek!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0025
048	Are you okay, Eulalia?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
049	Y-yeah, but...	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
050	I've never even considered the possibility of a Cursed Beast that could simply brush off purification...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
051	I don't think it's that we can't purify Beelzebub itself, but...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
052	The part that is Zafeiris is repelling our Spiritbonding...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0031
053	Is there no way we can break through?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
054	From the outside, it's impossible. The whole body is defended by Zafeiris's ability; I can't use my purification.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0016
055	Its shell is made up of the voices of sin. If we used the powers of purification from within it, maybe...
056	We need someone to be devoured?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
057	But in that case, they will be affected by the corruption...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0025
058	So we need someone to get inside Beelzebub's body who can avoid the corruption and use their powers of purification?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
059	What a lucky turn of events.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
060	No, there might be another way.
061	What?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
062	If he can neutralize Spiritbonding, maybe Alchemy will do!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
063	I see you prefer to live in the comfort of denial, Pursuers of Gluttony.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0021
064	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
065	Even if you have inherited the protection of Nidhogg, I am still in a category all my own.
066	Do you really believe that piddling amount of magil can stand against one such as I now that I have become a Cursed Beast?	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0003
067	We'll never know unless we try!
068	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
069	He immediately healed himself...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
070	Do you understand now? The level of magil I have dwarfs yours a thousand times over.
071	No matter how much destruction you try to inflict upon me, you'll never reach my core.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0020
072	And...
073	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_a
074	Eeek?!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0025
075	What?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0043
076	Gughh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
077	Now... I think it's time for me to end this.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0019
078	Argh! This isn't over... We won't give in yet...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
079	Huh? Whose voice is that...?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
080	—maybe Alchemy will do!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
081	Nimul? That's right... They're fighting now...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0045
082	...To save this girl. But...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0030
083	Now... I think it's time for me to end this.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0019
084	All that research and effort, but in the end, they're just people... It was all useless. They won't be able to end it.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0010
085	Of course. To attempt to defy the way of the world itself is...
086	Argh! This isn't over...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
087	There's no way that I'll ever give up! I will never!
088	He just never gives up, does he? But without that determination, he could never have gotten this far.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0030
089	It was impossible from the start for an empty imposter like me to overcome an opponent with so much raw passion...
090	But now it's all...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0018
091	Because I have yet another reason I cannot let myself be stopped here!
092	Huh?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
093	Oh, so you still stand, human.	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0002
094	Of...course...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
095	Because I have yet another reason I cannot let myself be stopped here!
096	With my own hands, I took the life of a friend in this Gula Belt...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
097	She was stern and proper, always finding something to scold me about, but...
098	She was good to my sister; her closest friend. She was happy...
099	Yet somehow, I never noticed her true feelings. In my ignorance, I gave her so much suffering...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
100	Still, when she said that she'd never be able to forget my face...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
101	The face of this man whose only redeeming qualities were his adherence to his ideals and his research... Whose tunnel-vision caused him to be unable to understand himself!
102	She told me...that she loved me...
103	She knew what kind of person I am, but she still loved me...
104	So I have no choice but to stand my ground here. I have no choice but to continue to stick to my ideals like the fool that I am!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
105	I will stand strong, like the man she fell in love with. To never change from the man she loved...
106	I will stand and I will fight, even if my opponent is you, the very sin of Gluttony!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
107	I will consume all that Gluttony myself to save this world!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
108	I call upon you, Godwolf!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
109	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_shadowasena.shadowasena_battle_0002
110	You are a fool to think that you can bridge the gap in our power with your trite idealism!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0021
111	So I'll be a fool! Huzzaaaaah!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
112	Is he that stupid?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0030
113	I...suppose he is. Yet...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0007
114	That's why she... That's why we loved him. Emmel...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0010
115	This body of mine is only a hollow phantasm. The pale dream of a ghost... So...
116	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0032
117	(...Even breathing hurts... Of course it does. What else did I expect by using Spiritbonding with a body corrupted by sin?)	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0019
118	But...it's a good pain. The pain means I've decided to live having embraced my feelings... Even if they're her feelings...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0010
119	Farewell, Emmel. Farewell, Nimul. In the end, I wasn't truly a friend to you.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0010
120	But...at least this dream hasn't ended up being such a nightmare...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0008
121	What! What is this?!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_b
122	Preposterous! The sacrificial daughter should have no more power to purify me, but this...	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0019
123	This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
124	This light... Could it be?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
125	What are you doing?! You're not the kind of man who will let a little difficulty stop you, are you?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0003
126	I don't think so!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0001
127	Julia, is that you? You're still...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
128	You're going to save the world, right? This is the best chance you're going to get!
129	She's right! Eulalia, use Sagittarius!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
130	I'm on it!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
131	Gear of judgment, Sagittarius! Under the guidance of Sephiron, please grant me this chance to overcome our sin!
132	"I embrace the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
133	Grrraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_c
134	Got him!
135	The Anti-Curse magic neutralized Beelzebub's core! Now we can beat him!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
136	Graaah! Don't mock me, humans!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0001
