001	Go!
002	You think these peons stand a chance against me?
003	Wait! Please, these people are only being manipulated!
004	Hm. Then I will sever the ties that bind them.
005	Grrrooooogh!
006	Tch...!
007	Escanor... Olga, Corvus...!
008	You're fighting to prove what you believe in, right? Then you can't lose!
009	We shall believe in what you believe in as well.
010	He's coming, isn't he? The one you call Meliodas... The darkness within me believes he will.
011	That's right! We won't lose to this guy!
012	I've never met your Meliodas, but if he's someone you trust, I'll trust in him too, Elizabeth!
013	We'll hold out until he's here!
014	Pathetic...
015	Thank you, everyone...
016	...
017	That's right. No matter what anybody says, I will hold onto my faith in Meliodas!
018	I want to be worthy of his trust in turn!
019	So...!
020	I won't let you hurt anybody else!
021	You little...!
022	I denounce you and your ways!
023	You will see what our faith can do!
