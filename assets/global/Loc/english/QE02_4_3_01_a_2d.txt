001	Twelve minutes left...?! Is the colossal island that carries destruction really going to move?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
002	I see. From the way you speak, it seems like you've also reached that conclusion?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0024
003	I came up with my own answer after reading various clues from the legends and anecdotes that remain.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
004	The legend that the Elester family changed the sea to land overnight...
005	The coat of arms that shows the Elesters taking down the colossal island that carries destruction...
006	The stained glass that depicts the floating island...
007	And the depiction of human figures who seemed to be carrying a shiny object that was bright like the sun.
008	I found countless clues that seemed to hint at unlocking the mystery, but the more I thought about it the less I understood.
009	It all seemed like a load of gibberish.
010	Then... how did you arrive at that conclusion?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
011	The old man's... Mayor Edward's words lead me to it.
012	Edward's words?
013	He told me that the Sacred Stone Belphegor was the anchor to quelling this chaotic land, if it were stolen,	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
014	it would lead to the destruction of this world.
015	The anchor, huh?
016	Anchor originally refers to a weight that is used to prevent a boat from drifting away.
017	The fact that he used that expression...
018	It made me think that it was about preventing something from rising to the surface. Then I remembered...
019	The floating island depicted in the stained glass.
020	Yes. From there, I began to connect the dots.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
021	The floating island was the colossal island that carries destruction.
022	The people carrying the shiny object were the Elesters after having obtained the Belphegor.
023	My theory was that the Sacred Stone was keeping the island tethered down.
024	Hmm...	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
025	He told me that the Sacred Stone Belphegor is the anchor to quell this chaotic land...
026	In other words, the Elesters took down the colossal, floating island that carries destruction.
027	The legend that the Elester family changed the sea to land overnight...
028	This was referring to how Belphegor was used to pull the island that was under the ocean to the surface.
029	When you think of it like that it all comes together.
030	I see.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0045
031	It's a seriously terrifying story.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
032	The more I applied this theory, the more the existence of the island that carries destruction became clear to me.
033	At this point, I have no choice but to admit... all of Redington City is that ancient city that used to float in the sky—
034	A large, ancient fortress that will lead this world to disaster.
035	Exactly. And once the hands on that clock reach zero, its resurrection will be complete.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0007
036	I won't allow that. We'll take Belphegor back from you and utterly destroy your plan!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
037	The entire Redington City is the colossal island carries destruction?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
038	Yes. This clock tower is a none other than a control device that amplifies the power of the Sacred Stone and anchors the ancient floating city from going berserk.
039	I come from a family of Timekeepers that were given the job of looking after the clock tower by the Elesters, using this Alchemy.
040	I've never heard of any of this before!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
041	As a Timekeeper, I was not told this entire picture.
042	The truth about the clock tower's functions and existence is one carefully guarded by the Elester family.
043	I'm sure the master was planning on telling you someday...
044	However... before he could entrust this knowledge to you... he was killed.
045	Wait... what does that mean? Didn't father fall from a cliff...?
046	No... the master was killed... by the Beckrams.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0039
047	What...?!
048	I'm so sorry! I brought all of this about!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0036
049	My careless actions have led to this disaster!
050	What do you mean? Explain, Ethan!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
051	The destruction of Envylia... that incident was the start of everything.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0018
052	Alchemy was suddenly gaining attention... and, even here in Slothstein, the public expressed the desire for a Sacred Stone.
053	I remember that movement. I felt frustrated to see my father singled out by demands that,	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
054	if we were to make our Sacred Stone's presence known, we could respond to threats of Alchemy.
055	The pressure from the public was considerable as, the Elesters were running this country, most assumed your father knew of the stone's whereabouts.
056	That being said... the Sacred Stone Belphegor has the immense responsibility of quelling the colossal island that carries destruction.
057	Thus, your father ignored public opinion, even at the risk of provoking antipathy.
058	And...?
059	Alvarez's name began to rise on the back of this public opinion.
060	That man had realized very early on about the connection between the Sacred Stone and the clock tower.
061	He bid his time until your father had gone to a meeting between the five kingdoms. While your father was away, he approached me.
062	...!
063	I'm so sorry! All of this was caused by my stupidity!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0036
064	I am to blame for having let that man talk me into this.
