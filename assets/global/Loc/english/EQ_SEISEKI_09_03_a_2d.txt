001	A permit? Like I said, I'm a guest of Orion!!!
002	We've been informed not to allow those without a permit to pass. If you want to get through, then bring a permit.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0039
003	Look...we're actually going out of our way to assist Greed Dike.
004	Seriously. Go tell your superior.
005	Hmph. Enough with your cockiness. You lot who don't even have a country of your own!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
006	If you think we all welcome you with open arms then you've made a big mistake.
007	What did you say...?
008	Look over there! There are Greed Dike soldiers at the barrier! No way... Could Wratharis already be...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
009	But the torches haven't even been lit yet. Do you think they've just arrived?	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
010	Perhaps. In any case, we must quickly infiltrate them and grasp the situation.
011	Like I said, we're not letting you through. Come back when you have a permit.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
012	"Child whose name is etched in the world, polish thy dog's fangs on a grindstone."
013	Only by keeping an eye out for those under you can you become capable of ruling the world. At this rate, your general won't be very successful.
014	What did you say?! Say that again!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
015	Hmph...
016	They seem to be having some kind of dispute.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
017	Now's our chance. Let's make our way through the opening.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
018	Keep up the good work, soldier.
019	Huh? Hey, hey, you're just gonna let them pass? They don't have a permit!
020	They're clearly our soldiers! Or are you blind as well as dumb?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
021	Tsk. I could ask you the same thing...
022	If you have business with Orion, you'd better look elsewhere.
023	Huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
024	No...we were just summoned by our captain.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
025	Ye-yes! We're actually quite late. Come on, let's hurry on!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
026	I-I'm sorry. I looked back involuntarily.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0035
027	Seriously, my heart almost dropped for a second there. Anyway, it's fine. Let's hurry on.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
028	Hmph...
029	Hey wait! You lot...you're not allowed...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
030	Oh, by the way...you just said something quite rude, didn't you?
031	That you don't have a country of your own? Hehe... How else am I supposed to describe you lot?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
032	I personally don't mind, but you're insulting my friends.
033	I can't let that insult go by. Now you'll have to pay the price.
034	Huh...? Ugh...?! Ug-ggh...?! Aghh!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
035	I'm bored of here now. Let's go and pick up our reward.
036	What a relief! There still aren't that many casualties!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
037	This isn't Greed Dike's main army.
038	Their invasion of Wratharis seems like it was just to cause a commotion.
039	......
040	Captain Othima?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
041	The way he was talking...do you think he realized we were outsiders?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
042	Huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
043	Um...are you talking about the man we just passed?
044	Yeah. Anyway, let's go and get our men.
045	Understood!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0006
046	...Othima!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
047	Seida...?!
048	Huff...huff...! I finally found you!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
049	Seida...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
050	Captain Seida, what are you doing here?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
051	Right after you launched your attack...
052	Greed Dike's main army appeared in Northern Pride! Come back as soon as you can!
053	What...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
054	...! That's not good... How did they notice us?! We've been surrounded!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
055	...!
