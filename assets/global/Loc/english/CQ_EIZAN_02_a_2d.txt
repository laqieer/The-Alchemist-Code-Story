001	...Looks like they won't be chasing us anymore. Tsk. You got me involved...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0016
002	Ack...!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0042
003	Sigh... There's a river nearby. We'll cool off your feet there.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
004	Are you hungry? I caught some fish there so let's make it into a meal. If you don't eat, you won't be able to regain your strength.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
005	Please, I can cook. Allow me to do that at least.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0042
006	...Use this knife.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
007	Hey, Beardo...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
008	Be-Beardo...?!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0026
009	Why did you lie and say you were the Ultimate Blacksmith?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0016
010	I've...met the Ultimate Blacksmith before.
011	... ...
012	(She's met me before? Now that I think about it...I've seen this noble lady somewhere before.)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
013	Sob...o-ohh... I'm sorry, Reido... I heard there was herbal medicine in this forest that could help you...sob...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0019
014	...Boy, I'll give you this sword. At least try and become strong enough so that you can use it to protect you and your sister.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
015	But...this is your sword, old man.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0025
016	Watch it, boy! I'm not an "old man" yet!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0012
017	Besides, one day I'm going to make the Ultimate Blade, so I don't need that sword!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
018	I'm not a boy either... I'm Reido.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0016
019	Reida, stop crying and thank the man for helping us.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0001
020	Thank you...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0034
021	I didn't know it at the time...but later on, I found out that the man was called the Ultimate Blacksmith.
022	(So this girl was that little kid. Honestly, time flies...)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0044
023	That man had neither your fine beard nor your grey peppered hair. Why do you pretend to be him?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0030
024	... ...
025	(Come on. People change with the passing of years.)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
026	If you are really the Ultimate Blacksmith...then I will stab you with this blade!!!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
027	...What?!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0026
028	Thanks to the sword, my brother grew into a wonderful swordsman. However...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
029	Ever since then, my brother never lets the blade leave his side even for a moment. Even when he sleeps, he keeps it next to his bed.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0042
030	He won't even let me sleep in the same bed with him!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0018
031	I, who belong to him completely—from the ends of my hair down to the tips of my toes. My life, my death...all of it belongs to him.	VO_reyda.reyda_chara_1011
032	(Seems like it'll be best for me to keep quiet about the fact that I'm that blacksmith.)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0029
033	Now that I think about it, this knife...it reminds me of my brother's blade. Who made it?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0031
034	W-well now that we've eaten, let's be on our way! There's a cave further ahead where you can find the ore you're looking for.	VO_eizan.eizan_battle_1017
035	...Are you just going to guide me?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
036	Yeah...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
037	(Who would've thought that Reida would be jealous of the blade that I made?)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
038	We've arrived. The ore is located deep within here. However, to reach it we'll have to pass through the dens of mythical creatures, so—	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0002
039	Hold on, Reido!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0009
040	Don't get separated from me!	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1011
