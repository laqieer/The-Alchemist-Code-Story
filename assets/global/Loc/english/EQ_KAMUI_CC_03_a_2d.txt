001	Ah...
002	I've been here many times before...
003	But it's a completely different feeling coming here now that everything is over.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
004	...
005	This is what I left behind a long time ago.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
006	Yes...
007	Haha! You've upped your game again, Kamui!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
008	We both have. But...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
009	Whoa, I'm not gonna go down that easily! Hah!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0027
010	Nngh... I still can't match you in terms of sword fighting.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
011	Well, I can never really keep up with you in our Spiritbonding training.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0010
012	I should at least be good at my area of expertise!
013	Okay, both of you. Good work!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
014	Ah, thank you, Malta.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
015	Malta! I'm glad you're here! Have you come to see me in all my glory?	VO_ishido.ishido_favorite_1004
016	Noooope!
017	I'm on my way back from training at the altar, then I saw you guys.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
018	You two really are close, aren't you?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
019	You know, Kamui and I are best friends... Right?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
020	Yeah, right.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
021	Hmm... I'm a little jealous.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0044
022	Jealous?
023	Because you've been spending a lot of time together.
024	It makes me feel like I'm the odd one out.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
025	No, Malta, it's because you have your druidic priestess training and our schedules don't match anymore, and...	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
026	Yeah, I know that, but...
027	I know it's fun to have guy time, but it's not fair to leave me out!
028	You need to learn to adjust to a girl's schedule! It's good practice for you now! You don't want the girl you like to hate you because you're not considerate of her time.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
029	...?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
030	...
031	Hm? Is something wrong?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
032	No, it's nothing. I'll be sure to invite you next time, Malta.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
033	Yup! I know you will!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
034	Well, my father is calling me. See you!
035	Isidore, you need to rein it in a little.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1009
036	Sorry, Kamui...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0035
037	I don't know. It's like... I can't keep still when I'm near Malta.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0031
038	Is this...what love is?
039	How should I know?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
040	Aw, man... I wish I could just talk to her normally.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
041	No matter how much I train my body, it won't strengthen my heart...
042	Wait... Don't they say that a healthy body makes a healthy mind?
043	There we go. Only someone like you could bounce back so readily.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
044	No time to languish, Kamui! I have to get stronger and become a man worthy of Malta!
045	How so?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
046	That's the thing. There's a point where training too much has the opposite effect...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0031
047	If only there was a way of training that could display clearly just how much I've grown...
048	Don't get wrapped up too much into this and forget to stay safe. There's no point if you hurt yourself or worse.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
049	I see your point. But...mmm.
050	I got it! Kamui, have you heard about the shrine on the outskirts of this village?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
051	That place where the ancient corruption was sealed? The Chief told us to stay away from that place.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
052	That's exactly why!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
053	We're strong! The two of us can easily beat even the adults of our village!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
054	I'm sure we can purify whatever is in that shrine!
055	Where do you get all that baseless confidence?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
056	Now that that's settled, let's get on with it! Come on, Kamui!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_1011
057	This is our chance to show Malta how cool we are!
058	H-hey! It doesn't look like have a choice here...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
059	That's what I would always say, but secretly I was just as enthusiastic as he was.
060	At the time, we had just learned how to Spiritbond...and to put it bluntly, we were young and stupid.
061	We couldn't tell the difference between what we could and couldn't do. We just felt like we could do anything.
062	But that was...
063	It's here! Look, Kamui! There's the shrine!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
064	Yeah, but...this corruption... It makes my skin crawl. It's more than I ever imagined.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
065	But we can do it! The other day, we cleansed a Jam in our first battle like it was nothing!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
066	This level of corruption shouldn't be a problem—
067	Uh, what?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
068	Urk... That's not a Jam! But this corruption is...	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
069	Get back, Isidore! I beseech the supreme...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
070	...
071	It's not...working?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0026
072	Dammit! Then let's attack at the same time!
073	Isidore, behind you!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
074	Wh-what?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
075	Whoa?!
076	That light...
077	What are you two doing? Didn't father tell you guys not to come near this place?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
078	Malta?
079	Get a grip, you two! Aren't you the soldiers of Sephira, the protectors of this village?
080	R-right! You still good, Kamui?
081	Of course!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
082	Perfect! Now then, you're lucky I'm here and willing to lend a hand!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
083	Just a little more, and we'll have this in the bag!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0002
