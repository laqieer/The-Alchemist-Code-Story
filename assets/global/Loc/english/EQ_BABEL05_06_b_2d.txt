001	This isn't what I learned Alchemy for!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
002	Enough already! Let's get out of here!
003	Don't be a fool! If we fail this mission, we'll be the ones getting terminated!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0015
004	N-no!
005	The activation key for Slothstein was lost, but the Wratharis key, the key for this place, is still in our hands!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
006	We should be able to bring down Magnus with the Demonic Soldiers!
007	Then we can have him take all the blame! Their activation, the destruction of the ancient stone...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
008	It was all his doing!
009	I'm not a fan of that idea... Particularly the part about bringing me down.	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
010	Magnus!
011	Just because you're having trouble taking me out, doesn't mean you get to blame all the rest of your troubles on me, you know?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
012	To tell you the truth, though, it'd help me out a lot if you did.
013	You...! What are you...?!
014	There's a way out in that direction.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
015	Get out of here, and go write up your reports.
016	Make it clear that "It's all Magnus' fault," if you like.
017	Haaa...haaa...haaa... You still alive?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
018	Barely!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
019	I'm out of ammo, and my gadgets are all busted up!
020	...
021	What?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
022	I said, I'm losing face here.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
023	...
024	What are you talking about?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0003
025	Meeting him will get you involved. Knowing too much will make you a target.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
026	He's not worth all the trouble, you know. As far as company goes, he leaves a lot to be desired.
027	Isn't there anyone who you would want to meet, regardless of what should happen?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
028	...
029	There is, isn't there?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
030	Who, me?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
031	Isn't that why you're so bullheaded in the first place?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
032	Because you owe it to just such a person?
033	All right. Yeah, there is someone.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
034	I'm going to do as I please.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
035	I will go to him, even if he doesn't want me to.
036	What's—?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
037	Rrroooohh... Grraaahhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0021
038	Demonic Soldiers! How are there so many left?!
039	We've got nothing left to fight them with!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0021
040	Could this place have been a factory for building Demonic Soldiers? If not...perhaps a depository for them.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0021
041	Are you saying there could be even more of these things?!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0021
042	Heh! This could get interesting.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
043	Grroooooohhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
044	No...! I don't want to—!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0024
045	What's that?!
046	The ceiling collapsed. I can't believe our luck. It blocked off their path.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
047	Who the hell could've done this?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
048	Are you all right?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
049	Y-you...!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
050	Who's there? I can't see anything.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
051	Nobody special, here. Nobody you know.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
052	Wh-what?
053	Sorry to startle you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0035
054	I'll take care of things here. You should get yourselves out.
055	What about you?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_battle_0019
056	I'll just be taking out the trash.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
057	That man...is fighting. Just on the other side of this wall...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
058	...
059	We're leaving.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
060	He's right there... Fighting... Alone.	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
061	Come on!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
062	You know him, don't you? The one who spoke? Are you just going to leave him behind? Are you okay with that?
063	Yep.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
064	You...!
065	You're lying.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
066	Albea...
067	He's... It's him, isn't it?
068	That's none of your concern.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0013
069	That man... He's my brother!
070	Don't be—!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
071	Magnus!	VO_albell.albell_event_1012
072	Albea!
073	I...! I don't remember much, but I do remember!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
074	When I was little, you made a doll move for me, didn't you?!
075	Dang it!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0021
076	I was such a sloppy kid, but you'd clean up for me when I made a mess, wouldn't you?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0019
077	I don't remember everything, but I do remember!
078	Magnus!
079	Haa...haa...haa...	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0020
080	Magnus!!!
081	Heh... Hahaha! None of that rings a bell. You must have me mistaken for somebody else.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0011
082	There's no mistake! Let me fight with you!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
083	This is my game to play.
084	M-Mira! Please!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0021
085	Albea...
086	Stop him! Please! Stop my brother from...!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
087	Albea, I...
088	You can go through walls, can't you? Won't you do something? Please!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0019
089	I...!
090	Arghhh!
091	Hey.
092	You understand, don't you?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
093	...
094	I know you've been watching... Observing.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
095	...
096	You know who you should be protecting right now—and it isn't me!
097	There you go again.
098	How can you be smiling?
099	I want you to see my hair! It's pink, just like yours! I've taken such good care of it!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
100	Mira! Tell me that it's the same! Tell me that he and I have the same hair color!
101	Yes... The very same.
102	Urgh! Nngh... Argh!	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0023
103	Magnus! I've made us a home!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0025
104	I've turned father's workshop into a real mechanic's repair shop!
105	And Father... Father's... Father's dead!
106	I'm all alone now!
107	...
108	So... I...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0019
109	Please... Please, Magnus! Let me see you!
110	...
111	All I want is for you to live your life.	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0020
112	Magnus?!
113	Will.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
114	Yeah... I know.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0022
115	I'm counting on you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0041
116	Just so you know, I don't really care for gambling.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
117	Huh?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
118	Watching you win it all and lose it all, all over again...
119	That was what I loved the most.
120	I won't let anything get in the way of your last big wager.
121	Heh. Who knew I had such a good friend all along?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0033
122	I just figure this friendship is worth all the trouble it causes me.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0038
123	You're gonna make me blush.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
124	So don't you lose, now.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0041
125	Hahaha! You better not be praying!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0008
126	You know I never lose!	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0029
127	...
128	Magnus!
129	I gave my little sister a present once.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0018
130	Wh-what?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
131	It was the first Alchemy I ever used as a Paladin.
132	I imbued my uniform with it.
133	That coat...?
134	I hope you know that it came from the bottom of my heart.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
135	Magnus! Magnus, wait!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0028
136	You should forget about me.
137	I'm nothing but a bundle of lies.
138	Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
139	Don't think for a second that I'm the type to sacrifice myself for others.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
140	If your fate's already sealed, then there's only one thing you can do.
141	Go all in.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
142	I'm betting my life...
143	...in one final burst to win it all!	VO_magnus.magnus_battle_0014
144	No...!
145	Magnus!
146	Albea...
147	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0028
148	Magnus! Why?!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0027
149	...
150	...
151	I was bluffing...
152	Even though I was out of chips, I kept up the pretense of winning.
153	With warped powers at my fingertips, I kept toeing the line that I was never meant to cross.
154	My eyes were fixed on a broken clock...
155	But the hands are finally moving again.
156	Albea.
157	You're the one who fixed it up.
158	You even took over our rotten father's shop.
159	I'm proud of you.
