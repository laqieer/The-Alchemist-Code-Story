001	...So...do you understand now, Fuu boy? Do you understand the crisis that threatens Saga?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
002	... ...
003	In order to advance forward, it’s crucial that I understand why you killed Alia, eradicated the power of the wind, and upset the natural balance of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
004	I'd also like to know why you have taken in the Alize descendants that carry the bloodline of Alia.
005	You old fox...so you were eavesdropping!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
006	The Wind Temple, which is now under the control of the Fuu faction, is losing its power. Ever since that night, even the whereabouts of the Wind Matter have become shrouded in ambiguity.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
007	How will it help to know the truth now?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
008	Part of the responsibility lies with me...I accept that. I focused only on the results of those past events and abandoned the will to learn the truth.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
009	That's why I'm here kneeling before you now. With two Wind Shamans having emerged, this is the perfect opportunity to restore order to the power of the wind and to Saga.
010	There's no need for this. I'll protect Saga with my own hands.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
011	I don't know why you're acting so stubborn, but at least tell me the location of the Wind Matter.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
012	...There's no need for me to tell you.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
013	I know where the Wind Matter is, Voda.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
014	Mocca, is that true?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
015	Mocca! You keep quiet! I will not forgive any recklessness on your part!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
016	But, Fuu...!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
017	I told you that I'll protect Saga...without Voda's help and without resurrecting the power of the wind!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0015
018	You just need to keep quiet and follow my lead!
019	...You're wrong.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1001
020	Of course, it's better if all of you work together. I mean...doesn't this problem concern all of you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
021	At any rate, it's not your problem! You're a foreigner and this problem concerns only those of Saga!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
022	Yeah, that's pretty much what I've been trying to tell you.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
023	...Fuu, what burden is it that you're shouldering on your own?
024	Nothing. Cease your unnecessary prying.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
025	Mocca! Where is the Wind Matter?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
026	It's lost its power so it's nothing more than the Matter's core.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
027	We are simply preserving its source, but...
028	!!!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
029	I will not forgive any further insolence! Do you dare to underestimate the power of the Sprite Trio?	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0010
030	No! I just want to protect the land of Saga! Why can't you understand that?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
031	How dare you question my actions! You forget your place!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0013
032	Mocca...you're back? Is everything okay? Are you hurt?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0003
033	!!!
034	Tamis! Yes, I'm okay. I just got back.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
035	...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
036	Those eyes of yours....?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
037	Both her height and appearance closely resemble Mocca. Is she...your sister?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
038	Yes. This is my twin sister...Tamis. And...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
039	Mocca, stop!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
040	She is the "vessel" which the Wind Matter resides within!
041	The "vessel" for the Wind Matter...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
