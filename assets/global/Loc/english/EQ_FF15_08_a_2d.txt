002	A traitor doesn't sound like the most diplomatic of professions.
003	All I did...was choose a different path...from my father...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
004	So it was a family feud.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0014
005	A family feud?! It was nothing of the sort. I had something I wanted to protect. That's all.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
006	Same difference.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0010
007	Noct used to say all kinds of nasty things about the king.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0008
008	Hey...c'mon...	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_1017
009	It's likely that this is the case with all parents and children.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0008
010	Whether those around me call me a traitor, I will continue forward. That's what I must do.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
011	Then you haven't betrayed your father.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0045
012	...?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
013	... ...
014	In other words, you just gotta keep going forward.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0022
015	Thinking won't get you anywhere!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0038
016	I would never have expected such excellent advice from you.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0007
017	Now you're just being mean!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0039
018	... ...
019	(I haven't betrayed him? What does he mean by that?)
020	(That's right. Father was once called the Great Sinner Zeke. I wonder how he felt about that.)
021	Looks like our break is over. Keep your guard up.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
022	Again?	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0012
023	What an annoying bunch!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0028
