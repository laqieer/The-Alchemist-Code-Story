0001	Alchemy—the forbidden art—said to have been eradicated from the world. Its resurrection would mean a threat to all of Babel. To determine the truth, the Blue Flame Guard is ordered to search for the rebels.
0011	In search of the rebel army hideout, Logi and Dias head towards the Gilrack Ruins. En route, they enter the Woods of Mystical Nights. The sorrowful flames of war will inevitably transform the hearts of the brothers bound together by fate.
0021	The sins of their father's past, unknown to Logi and Dias; Agatha's secret held by Sabareta... As Caesar, the phantom bent on revenge, approaches, what truth will be discovered in the collapsing ruins?
0031	With the Lizard Brigade's use of Alchemy come to light, the Holy Guard intervenes. These elite knights alone are permitted to use Alchemy under the authority of the Holy Order of Babel. Sent to serve under them, the conflicted Dias pursues Agatha's whereabouts.
0041	During a fierce battle, Dias finally unleashes his hatred. His desire for revenge vanquishes his enemy's dark Alchemy. Is it a door of hope or a descending stairway of despair? Furthermore, who will Dias draw his innocent blade against next?
0051	The Demon, an ancient weapon responsible for the destruction of ancient Babel, has already been carried off. To counter the mighty Demon, Gabirond fuels Dias's desire for revenge. Will his awoken bloodlust defeat the Demon?
0061	Ashamed of his inability, Logi seeks further power. Zeke, learning that Dias has defeated the Demon on his own, experiences unease. The two head to the ruins of Fort Mugarde where the Lizard Brigade has gathered. There, they witness something terrifying—
0071	Against Sabareta's will, the Demon suddenly begins to activate. As the two armies violently clash, will there truly be any victors? To save Agatha, Logi plunges deep into the flames of war.
0081	Logi manages to rescue Agatha. However, Sabareta takes possession of the Demon and vanishes. To end the cycle of revenge, Logi heads to stop Sabareta.
0091	Dias is determined to kill Sabareta, leader of the Lizard Brigade. However, having learned of his father Zeke's desire for peace with Wratharis, he is unable to hide his confusion. To know his father's true intentions, he makes his way to him with Gabirond.
0101	Worried about Agatha, Dias intently pursues the Lizard Brigade led by Sabareta. Will Logi be able to save his brother Dias as the Power of Darkness consumes him? And what is the real meaning behind Gabirond's smile?
0111	Envylia and Wratharis—in the hope of establishing peace between the two kingdoms, Agatha heads towards the meeting point. Meanwhile, Sabareta senses something sinister about Gabirond. Individual motives, hidden beneath the surface, slowly begin to intertwine.
0121	Why Dias and his dad? Is conflict the only solution? Logi's sorrow echoes across the brutal battlefield. Can Logi's faith save the vengeful desires of both kingdoms—and Dias's soul?
0131	Logi and Sabareta succeed in delaying Dias and the Holy Guard. However, Logi's words do not reach Dias's stubborn heart. Unaware of this, Agatha and Zeke advance to seek an audience with King Patrick.
0141	With the Sacred Stone Satna dwelling within her, Agatha is the Vessel of Reincarnation! The real aim of the Holy Guard's intervention was to get their hands on her. Will she be able to escape their dark schemes?
soul	Many a knight visits the historical ruins. Search for Soul Shards in its deepest parts, and attempt a new Soul Encounter with the phantom soldier who sleeps within the sealed casket.
