001	Welcome home, Kamui!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
002	Ah, you're still awake?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
003	Yeah. I'm feeling wide awake!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
004	Go to sleep, Hisham. Otherwise you'll end up missing breakfast again.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
005	Oh, right. Um... By the way, Kamui... I kind of have a favor to ask!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
006	I, um... I wanna go see the village I grew up in.
007	Ah...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
008	I... I remember now. My village was burned down by soldiers of Gluttony.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
009	They needed supplies to support the troops going to attack the Liberation Army stronghold nearby.
010	They were especially interested in the village's well, our water.
011	But that well was our lifeline... Without it, we all would have died anyway. That is why everyone laid their lives down to protect it.
012	What choice did we have but to die even in an effort to live?
013	I see...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
014	I already know that...there is no one left there for me.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
015	The only thing I can do now is at least give them proper burials.
016	I see. Hisham... Let's go to your village, then, to pay your people their final respects.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
017	Thank you, Kamui!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
018	Have you finished your preparations?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
019	Yep! I've got everything I need to cross the desert!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
020	Good. Then—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1017
021	Why, hello there! Where might you two be heading?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
022	Isidore?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
023	I heard from Malta that it's not safe out there, so I've decided to join you as a bodyguard.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0010
024	Is it really alright for the head of the warriors to be away from the village?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
025	Eh, it should be fine. Until matters come to a head, all we have to do is train and chase beasts off.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
026	Besides, Malta asked me to come. What was I gonna do, say no?
027	Ha. You never change.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
028	Of course! My love for Malta is the driving force in my life!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
029	Yeesh. You know that Miss Malta complains about your shamelessness all the time, right?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
030	Huh?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
031	Let us go quickly, before the sun goes down.
032	Wait, wait! You were joking, though, right? Right?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0027
033	Ahem. So, about Hisham's village... Do you two know where it is?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
034	Yes, those mountains... I distinctly remember a place with the same mountain view just south of here.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
035	Yes, and the area around here is starting to look a little familiar.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
036	Grrrrrrr...
037	Ack!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
038	Monsters? Here? Hisham, get back.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
039	O-okay...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
040	We've been surrounded, but we shouldn't have any problems with this many. Let's show them they picked on the wrong people today, Kamui!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
041	Got it!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
