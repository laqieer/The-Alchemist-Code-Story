001	Gwahhhhh!
002	You got him, Ravina!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0009
003	Ravina, why?! Why did you attack Santa?!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0026
004	Calm down Klima. Look closely.
005	Huh?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
006	Ugh...
007	Hey, this isn't a jolly old man!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0003
008	Hm? Wh-who is this?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
009	A fake Santa.
010	A fake Santa?!
011	I see. You're the thief masquerading as Santa, aren't you?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0045
012	...now that you mention it, that soldier earlier told us something about this.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
013	You pretend to be Santa Claus bringing presents and then you steal all you can...you miscreant!
014	I see now... I'm sorry Ravina, for yelling at you.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0045
015	No, it's fine. I'm sorry too.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0036
016	We heard you caught a thief! Great work!
017	Thanks to you we can all enjoy a wonderful Winter Holiday. Here, for your troubles.
018	Eh? Is this...cake?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0005
019	This is our most popular cake. Please share and enjoy it!
020	!!!
021	I...I can have it?
022	Someone cancelled their order, so we decided to give it you for being so good.
023	B-but, I'm...
024	Go ahead! It's yours! You saved Winter Holiday for everyone. You're a great kid!
025	That's right! On top of your own job, you also helped Michael and Lofia out with their job.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
026	Yes yes! A very good kid!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
027	There are only good, hardworking kids here. That's why the real Santa is sure to bring you a wonderful present!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
028	A present...
029	Santa always puts his presents in stockings. Birgitta taught me that.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
030	So, you should put the biggest stocking you have close to your pillow. The thing you want most, Ravina, Santa is sure to put it there for you.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
031	Tomorrow morning, let's show each other our presents! Promise!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
032	I can't wait!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
033	(My heart...)
034	(Seeing those two smile...warms my heart)
035	Oh dear children of the world...is there no greater happiness for this old man than to see your smiling faces?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
036	(...I see now. Michael and Lofia were protecting the smiles we see on Winter Holiday)
037	...
038	Ravina, what's wrong?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0006
039	...oh, nothing.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
040	Well, we should probably get going. The Maruda tribe will be delivering our tree soon and all.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
041	That's right, the tree! Nina, Ravina, let's go see!
042	Dear me, I didn't expect an evening like this one!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
043	Lofia! Is work over?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0003
044	All the good kids went home. So, I'd say our work is pretty much done.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
045	Even so, working security for Winter Holiday, it was harder than I thought it would be.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
046	Thieves over there, fights over here, Michael and I were running all over the place.
047	I was so busy that I asked you to pass on a message for me, Lotiyah... I'm sorry it turned out to be so much trouble.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
048	No problem! It was fun, actually!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0037
049	It was good that I asked you all for that favor.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
050	I thought that you, having treated people and beasts alike in the arena fairly, would be the right person for the job.
051	Awww you're making me blush!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
052	Hey! But, if you felt that way, wouldn't it have been better to just let Ravina do security with you?
053	She so badly wanted to work with you two tonight, but you wouldn't let her... She was really bummed out about it.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
054	Well, Ravina still doesn't know about that secret, so...
055	In the unlikely event that she witnessed a real Santa chase, she might do something crazy and rash.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
056	Ahh, that's true!
057	Really, thank you so much. As thanks, I'll take you to my favorite pancake place.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0034
058	Wow! Yes! Looking forward to it!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
059	So, when you're done with your work, make sure to come to the party as soon as possible! Everyone will be waiting for you!
060	It was also a great opportunity. I wanted Ravina to become closer friends with everyone, besides Michael and I.
061	Since becoming a phantom soldier, we've been able to meets lots of different people.
062	That's exactly right.
063	Michael! Are you done with Santa's work?
064	Normally, I wouldn't leave early, but... I heard that good little children were waiting for me to return home, so I left early.
065	Since I myself am a good kid, I feel I got a present too.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
066	What do you mean?
067	Ho ho ho, why, I'm talking about a Winter Holiday miracle.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
068	Well, shall we go? We can't have good kids waiting too long for us.	VO_michael.michael_chara_1006
069	Yipee!!! Look! Right in the middle of the room! The tree!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0024
070	Yes! What an amazing tree! It really is the biggest one!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
071	Well, it's still a regular tree for now. We need to decorate it.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
072	Don't worry, we'll finish decorating it in time for the party. Let's go!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
073	Yes, let's. We can decorate it with lots of Nina's dolls...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0008
074	Let's make the tree so wonderful Michael and Lofia will be blown away when they see it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
075	Let's get to work!
076	(The presents are coming...to all the good kids waiting, including you, Ravina)	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
077	May you have a warm, joyful Winter Holiday!
