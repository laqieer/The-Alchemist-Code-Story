001	Asena...will fall at the hands of Georgios? That must be prevented at all costs.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
002	I'll head immediately to Asena! Mocca, you come with...!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	Wait, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
004	It's not a good idea to let your emotions get the better of you. There's no guarantee that Georgios will act immediately.
005	I...I know that! But...we cannot afford to lose Asena! Is there...is there no other way?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
006	First, we should save that village that has been attacked, then we should head to Tehre. I believe that would be the most efficient way to protect Asena.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
007	We don't have time to think about efficiency!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
008	Georgios could act at any time. So our top priority is to make the Sprite Trio Discourse a reality and quickly restore the Wind Matter.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
009	I know...but...argh...isn't there something else I can do?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
010	...Tina.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
011	...?! Whuff...arff...yuff...duffing?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
012	What are you doing?! Now isn't the time to be playing around and pinching my cheeks!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
013	Have you calmed down? I understand why you're impatient. I also understand that we don't have time.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
014	That's why we must think calmly. We are currently shouldering the future of Saga. We cannot let temporary emotions get the better of us.
015	Yes...you're right. I'm okay now. Thank you for always helping me, Mocca...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
016	Let's go over what we need to do!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
017	Right now, it is unlikely that Georgios is headed to Asena.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
018	After he raided the Fuu village, he withdrew.
019	Right...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0045
020	Given that their base appears to be Port Nahema, even if they had made their way immediately, we still have time.
021	Hmm...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
022	In that case, it may be most efficient to make your way to Tehre as a messenger while simultaneously surveying the movements of the Gluttony army.
023	Isn't there a possibility that, in the meantime, Georgios will be making his way to Asena?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
024	In such a case, leave it to me.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
025	I swear on my honor as one of the Sprite Trio that I will stop him. I will remain here and remain on the alert.
026	Voda...! Thank you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0034
027	I haven't seen the vision myself, so I cannot judge your feelings, Tina.	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
028	But that's all the more reason why I want to fight by your side! In order to prevent that future, we must do everything we can right now.
029	Yes! Well then, let's first head to the village that asked Voda for help. Let's save as many people as we can!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
030	I'll be depending on you. With my power now devoted to managing the Matter, I feel encouraged by your presence.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0041
031	However, I swear that my heart is with you all!
032	Well then, I will return the Matter first and prepare the letter of summoning for the discourse. I'll leave the rest to you all.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
033	Tina! I know you might feel anxious, but...you can rely on me more! I'll help you with all my strength!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
034	Lisbeth...thank you. I'm sorry for involving you even though you're not a citizen of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
035	Don’t worry about it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
036	I still have the matter of Lustburg's curse to deal with. Besides, I can't just stand around and do nothing while people are suffering in front of my eyes!
037	I'll leave this to you. Tina...I'm sure everyone here right now feels the same. It's all for the future of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
038	Yes! I leave now, Voda!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
039	Well then, let's hurry to the village! Both of you, keep your guard up.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
040	Glurrrrrppp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0026
041	Wow! What numbers...! We need to hurry to the village!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
042	The top priority isn't to destroy them, but to reach the village!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
043	If we calmly deal with them, there shouldn't be any problem! Don't be misled by their numbers!
044	All right! Let's hurry! We need to save as many people as possible!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
045	You're right. I...we need to protect the people of Saga. Now isn't the time to be rushing into matters alone!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0038
046	Everyone, thank you! I'm going to rely on your strength!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
047	Tina...!
048	I...need to save all of Saga, no matter what the future holds...I will change it all! After all, I'm not alone!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1006
