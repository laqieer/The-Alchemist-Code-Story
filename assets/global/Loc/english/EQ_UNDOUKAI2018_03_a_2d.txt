001	The time has finally come! It's the event of the century! The Survival Race is about to start!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
002	I, Teona, will be your play-by-play announcer, while Richie here—who has nothing better to do—will be your commentator!
003	Was that necessary?	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
004	Now to explain the course! First, you will take ten laps around the arena.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
005	Then you will cut through the plains and enter the wasteland! Over to you, Lotiyah!
006	Hello, everyone! Lotiyah here, who you'll find at the turnaround point! Once you get to me, please make a U-turn and head straight back to the arena!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
007	If you try to cheat, well... My sweet little babies will chase you down!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
008	What are...?! Hey! Don't chew on the set! Stop it! B-back to you, Teona!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0014
009	And that concludes the explanation of the course!
010	Incidentally, the cameras and other equipment making this broadcast possible were acquired with the help of Phantoms from Slothstein and Lustburg!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
011	This is rather a bigger deal than I thought.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
012	Okay! Is everyone all set? Then it's time! Ready... Go!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
013	Hahah! We're going to blow them away! Don't go falling off now!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0009
014	Wow! Look at the Blonde Sloths go! They've taken the lead with breakneck speed!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0024
015	W-wait! Let me get strapped in! I'm going to fall! I'm falling!	VO_megistus.megistus_battle_0027
016	Ahahahahahahah!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0008
017	Sh-she's fast! But you know what? So am I!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
018	What's this?! Daisy is speeding ahead on what appears to be modified mech gear! What has she done to it?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
019	We modified it to make it capable of keeping up with a motorcycle. It can now convert the user's own energy into momentum.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0010
020	I see. Thank you for that exquisite explanation. I award you five Teona Points!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
021	That little savage really goes all in, doesn't she? If nothing else, it's impressive that it can support their combined weight.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0011
022	Hey, Richie! I can hear you, you know!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0016
023	He has a point, though. It's incredible that this thing can support the two of us, especially at this speed... Reagan's Theory is phenomenal!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
024	Hmm... I wonder if we can go any faster? Perhaps a little tweak here...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
025	Aaaaahhh! I'm gonna lose my balance!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0027
026	Don't panic. You must work with the speed. Imagine that you're attacking.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
027	R-right!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
028	Hold it right there!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0032
029	Oh, would you look at that! Closing in from behind at a ferocious speed that is almost as frightening as the intensity of their love are Dorothea and Reida!
030	Hmph! There's nothing frightening about it!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0014
031	Look at that unbelievable dash! Incredible! Is this the hidden strength of a woman in love?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
032	Never underestimate the power of love! My feelings for my brother are strong enough to shatter boulders and hot enough to melt permafrost! This race is nothing compared to that!	VO_reyda.reyda_battle_0016
033	I'll do whatever it takes to obtain any power that will allow me to assist him!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0007
034	That's right! Do I seek power? Of course I darn well do!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0010
035	I'll become so powerful, and then he'll... Heheheh...	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0023
036	I've been curious about this since yesterday, but... Who exactly is this man you keep referring to?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
037	Who? I could speak of his brilliance forever, but I don't know his name.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0025
038	I see... Unrequited love, for someone whose name you don't even know. How marvelous! I'm sure he must be a lovely man.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0045
039	He is! He is stronger than anyone, and his fighting figure is remarkable. He is the best man in the world!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
040	The best man...in the world?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
041	C-could it be...?! Is that man my brother?!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0021
042	What?!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1004
043	There can be no mistake! The man you just described...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
044	The best man in the entire world... He can be none other than my brother, Reido!
045	As if I could love such a lanky man! Don't make me laugh! Just imagining it gives me chills!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0013
046	E-excuse you?! The price for saying such horrible things about my brother is death! Prepare yourself!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0027
047	You're the one who should die for insinuating that I would like a weed like that! I hope you're not expecting me to go easy on you!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1004
048	Uh-oh. What's this? Are the two lovestruck women having some sort of internal conflict?! They're at each other's throats so intensely they've gone off course!
049	There, passing them by, is...the Magia Gunslinger Pair!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
050	Is that really our team name? Couldn't she come up with something cooler?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
051	Look at those two... They're so heated up over—whoa!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0029
052	Oh, no! Ravina, distracted by the fight, has tripped over a pebble!
053	Careful! You would've gotten hurt if I hadn't caught you!
054	S-sorry...	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
055	You all right? You've gotta stay focused, okay?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
056	I... I am!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0012
057	Don't worry. I'll catch you again if I have to. Now, let's head straight for the goal!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
058	R-right!	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
059	Aww, how sweet! Fifty Teona Points to the Magia Gunslinger Pair!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
060	What exactly is your standard for giving out these points based on?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0001
061	What is this?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0029
062	Oh? Is it really so unclear what I feel deserves to be rewarded points? It's very simple. You see—	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
063	Nobody cares about that! Vivi!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
064	Hey! The audience is not allowed to enter the race cou... She is definitely not listening.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
065	M-Mei Fang?! What's wrong?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0026
066	What do you mean, what's wrong?!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0013
067	I came all the way out here to cheer you on for this race and what is this I find?! That girl! Who is she?!
068	M-me?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
069	Yes, you! I do not appreciate those leering eyes of yours one bit, nor will I tolerate the way in which you are ogling my best friend! Are you conspiring against me, you thieving cat?!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0029
070	Who are you?! You're so rude!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0012
071	We're taking this competition seriously. If you're going to get in our way, I won't hold back!
072	Hmph! I'd love to see you try and so much as touch me, peasant!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
073	What a turn of events! Ravina seems to be preparing to do battle with Mei Fang!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
074	Let's see how Vivi reacts to this situation!
075	Well, looks like Mei Fang might make a new friend, so I guess I'll...do nothing?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
076	She will do nothing! She's just going to stand back and watch! Meanwhile, the gap between them and those in the lead is growing as we speak!
077	If this continues, the victory will go to either Caris' team, or to the little savage and her mate.	VO_rish.rish_chara_1017
078	Oh, no, Richie! Aren't you forgetting someone?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
079	Aaagh! Why am I doing this?! This is pointless!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0025
080	Captain Gormalas! We'll never catch up to the lead at this pace!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0029
081	We, the warriors of the De Tribe and Go Tribe—once enemies, now comrades—shall take the day!
082	Enough! I'm done playing this foolish game!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
083	You know, I heard that the grand prize for winning this competition is some rather valuable treasure.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
084	Why didn't you say that before?! Let's do this!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_1017
085	Glad to have you on board! Now it is time for us to unleash our power!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0008
086	Huzzahhh!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0032
087	Wh-what the—?! Are those stars? Bonfires? No...! They're two bright souls, and they're charging this way!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0027
088	Hey, what was it that you said was important for Mech War Games? What do you need to do to win?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
089	What? Uh, you need the speed and precision to hit your opponent in certain applicable areas!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
090	I see. Then use that precision and speed, Daisy, and you should be able to win against their muscles.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
091	Thanks! I've got it!
092	And now...we fight!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0012
