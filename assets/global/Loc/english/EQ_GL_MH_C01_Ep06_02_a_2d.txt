001	Since we've damaged the Core, the Constructs are lacking a unified set of directives.
002	It's just as we've observed in the Lustburg ruins and in the Guardian from Soren's village.
003	Without a consistent power source, these Constructs will instead turn to self-preservation.
004	Without a consistent power source and directive, these Constructs automatically turn to self-preservation.
005	Since their higher functions are impaired, they're reduced to a state that resembles starving feral animals...
006	Therein lies a problem your past self might've failed to forsee... an imperfection, you may say.
007	If my assumptions are correct based on our observations thus far, these Constructs will actively attack the nearest source of Alchemia...
008	...regardless of friend or foe.
009	(...)
010	If violence is in our blood, there is little we can do to prevent our bloodthirst from manifesting.
011	If we must fight, then it is far better for these Constructs to take the place of young men and women on the battlefield.
012	What exactly did I want from these Constructs?
013	Were they simply made to perpetuate warfare?
014	Ugh...! I should never have created them!
015	Created them? What do you mean?
016	Another vision?
017	When the core exploded, I had another vision. I saw... no, heard someone call my name.
018	The voice addressed... I think me, as Professor?
019	It seemed that I worked on the Constructs in this very place.
020	Wait, a... Professor? Like Teach? How is that possible?
021	We know you're super smart for a kid. Yes, you do realize that you're still a kid, right?
022	I don't know. That vision... it felt like it was me, but... older?
023	All I know is that I was trying to achieve something by creating them...
024	A better world free from human conflict, perhaps...
025	But how did it come to this?
026	Soren...
027	I do not doubt the good intentions of your past self.
028	There may have been many, many trials and tribulations you went through following that memory...
029	But, even after all that's happened, you're expressing a desire to set things right.
030	And that, my dear, is cause to rejoice.
031	I see...
032	You can always count on Teacher's wisdom, Soren.
033	Trust her like all of us trust you, okay?
034	Yeah...
035	Truly an inspirational story of time-bending proportions, Shaman of Sakris!
036	A young boy with goodness in his heart, a display of genuine care and concern for the well-being of others.
037	A motherly figure with a wonderful sense of righteousness, an ideal role model for all children!
038	An annoying brother. A caring sister. The makings of a happy family!
039	But alas, the truth is incontrovertible.
040	It would be difficult to argue that your visions had come to fruition, Soren.
041	I will take up your legacy and enforce the future.
042	Now that I've taken up this mantle, rest assured I will guide this era into the light.
043	Your orders, my Lord?
044	Secure this laboratory and subdue the Constructs.
045	See to it that our... esteemed guests are also taken care of.
046	I want no further distractions to Atropos and our operation.
047	Yes, my Lord!
048	We're not going anywhere!
049	You won't get a chance to use that Core again!
050	Soren, Teach, back us up!
051	Of course.
052	This is for everyone...!
