001	Huhhh?! Wh-what's going on?!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0024
002	Why are there so many vermin...?! And they're with the court mages...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
003	Heheh. You've underestimated them because they were once men. When tamed, insects are more useful than men.
004	They're manipulating these insects as well! Just like Salomo did...with stronger magic! 	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
005	How can you tell?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
006	I understand what the insects are saying.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
007	Didn't you say something similar before? If that's really true then why?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
008	I'm not sure why, but I can tell. They may not be speaking now, but those insects are in a lot of pain.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
009	You've got quite the imagination, Lisbeth. These insects are in pain? Impossible.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0044
010	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	After all, these insects are happy just to be beside those whom they love dearly!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
