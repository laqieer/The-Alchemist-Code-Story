001	Don't tell me it's going to breathe fire again! Get down!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
002	Dang it! We've got to do something quick! Otherwise...Saga will be...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	Its stomach glows green whenever it's about to let loose its fire. I think it might need to gather energy before it can breathe fire... Maybe...	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
004	How about its abdomen...? It used to be a mountain... Wait! That's it! Its back!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
005	I agree. However, we are one person short...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
006	Its back?! Mocca, can you let us in on what you've come up with?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
007	The dragon's abdomen glows green before it breathes fire, right? Well, the core could be in its belly!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
008	The dragon was originally a mountain, which means it must have a strong underside like the base of a mountain. We should climb onto its back and strike at it from there.
009	Wouldn't it be better to aim for its stomach, rather than its back?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
010	No, it wouldn't be safe. Look at the way it's moving. We could be crushed if we aimed for its stomach. Cutting open its back, on the other hand, would open a path for us to reach its stomach.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
011	It is the closest point to its core and where we would encounter the least danger.
012	The core's in its stomach, huh? But how are we supposed to cut open its back?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
013	We do it with the Dragonslayer, of course. Isn't that right, Georgios?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
014	Indeed. However, unless we learn to fly, we'll never be able to make it to its back from here.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
015	Lilith's Hill is high above the ground. If we go there, we might have a chance of reaching its back.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
016	Well done; you've managed to come to the same conclusion as me, but how do you expect to lure the dragon all the way to Lilith's Hill? We're missing a valuable individual.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
017	Tina, Mocca, Tehre! You're all okay!	VO_rega.rega_battle_0019
018	Rega! Kiki, too! And Adel and Leoferes! What are you all doing here?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
019	Graah!	VO_kiki_adel.kiki_adel_sys_0006
020	We were evacuating all of the animals in the forest when we saw you!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
021	That's it! With Leoferes, Kiki, and Adel, we can make it to the dragon's back without needing to go via up Lilith's Hill.
022	Indeed. We should be able to climb up its back.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0031
023	And someone could ride Leoferes and lure the dragon to Lilith's Hill. This is starting to look like a real plan!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
024	I'll lend a hand, too! Just tell me what you need me to do. You'll help us, too, won't you, Kiki?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0037
025	Raawr!	VO_kiki_adel.kiki_adel_sys_0002
026	Look out! Fire incoming!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
027	Ack! We've got to hurry! What the?! The dragon...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
028	It stopped?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
