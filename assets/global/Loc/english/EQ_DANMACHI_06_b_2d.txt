001	Ghh...	VO_bell.bell_battle_0019
002	Looks like we have more than a minotaur to contend with.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
003	A fun little parting gift from the guys who escaped. They were probably drawn here by the Alchemia the minotaur has been absorbing, and finally saw fit to wake up.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
004	Well, no amount of demons can stop us now!
005	All we need to do is defeat the minotaur at the heart of all this!
006	Hyaaah!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0032

017	Ah!
018	There are lotsa girls in your Familia, right?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
019	Just be sure you don't do anything to make them sad. Somehow or another, I'll know! Haha. Get home safe and sound, and give those girls something to smile about!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
020	Kevin... Thank you!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0033
021	Okay, here we go. I'll hold off the demons; Bell, you get back on your feet and prepare to dish out some punishment!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
