001	Hah! Is that all you've got?!
002	This is the end.
003	S-Setsuna...
004	It's over now.
005	Y-yeah...
006	Was that scary? But you have to know that in a real fight—
007	That was amazing.
008	Huh?
009	Were you not...scared?
010	N-not at all! You were fighting to protect this village, Setsuna. You fought for us!
011	I want to fight like that. I want to be just like you!
012	I want to grow strong for my sister!
013	(I knew it. Jayme understands the most important aspect of strength.)
045	Of course. Then we'll need to make sure you also learn how to control your strength.
014	Jayme! Setsuna!
015	Sis!
016	Oh, thank goodness. I heard monsters got into the village, and...
017	Well, I figured everything would be fine with Setsuna here, but I just couldn't stop worrying.
018	Setsuna took care of them all! There was nothing to worry about!
019	You know I'm going to worry regardless of—Jayme! Let me see your leg!
020	Oh, I think I scraped my knee during training. I'm totally fine!
021	We must treat the wound immediately!
022	It's important to take care of any injuries you sustain, Jayme. I'm sorry, Macherie. I should have been more careful.
023	It's not your fault, Setsuna. If I'm gonna grow stronger, I can't let something like this stop me.
024	...
025	Jayme, don't cause Setsuna trouble. There we go, all better.
026	Jayme is working really hard. You should be proud of him.
027	Truly? I am proud of him, of course! Did you hear that Jayme? Setsuna has such nice things to say about you!
028	Hehehehe!
029	It's getting dark. We should get home. Are you done for the day, Macherie?
030	Yes, I think so. I just came back, so I should be fine to go home now.
031	Came back? Did you go somewhere?
032	For a little while. I had some apprentice duties to take care of.
033	I see. Well, don't push yourself too hard. I wouldn't want you getting in trouble again.
034	I should be fine. Probably...
035	What was that?
036	Oh, nothing. Let's all go home.
037	I'll go help rebuild the fences the monsters wrecked. I don't want more coming in that way again.
038	All right. We'll go get dinner ready.
039	Thank you.
040	See you later, Setsuna!
041	Perhaps it'll be possible for Jayme.
042	Perhaps he will be able to walk the righteous path that I could not.
043	Jayme...
044	My greatest wish for you is to be able to protect the things you love with your sword.
