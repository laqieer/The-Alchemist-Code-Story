001	Uggrraaah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
002	Looks like you're the only one left.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
003	A-ack!
004	P-please, stay your blade! I was just trying to earn some coin! I have no quarrel with you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
005	S-so don't k-kill me. Please! I have a daughter. She's just a little girl!
006	...
007	Don't!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
008	What?
009	You there. Listen to me.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
010	Y-yes?
011	If you have someone who you wish to protect, then you ought to wield your blade for that purpose alone.
012	Y-you're right, I—
013	Now go.
014	R-right! I'm so sorry for...you know!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0035
015	Tch.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
016	Stay out of my way!
017	Ngh! Haa...haa...	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0019
018	So long as one has their life, the opportunity for mutual understanding exists. Kill one another, and all possibilities end.
019	What if you let someone go and they end up coming back one day to kill you again?
020	Then I would be forced to fight them again, perhaps multiple times over. As many times as they needed until they decided to sheathe their assassin's blade.
021	I will do whatever is necessary to remain true to my beliefs. All I can do is grow stronger, so that I may overcome every challenge in my life without needless death.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0010
022	What if I... Actually, what if one of your ex-disciples hired me to assassinate you? What would you do?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
023	Regardless of who my opponent may be, I will not cede to my emotions. Your blade is true. I have faith in your judgement.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
024	A job is a job. You and I go head to head, one of us is gonna end up falling down and never getting back up.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
025	The argument is moot. I hardly doubt anyone would be so extravagant as to pay to have me killed. However...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0008
026	I will not kill you. Nor do I have any intention of simply rolling over and dying.
027	I will restore Wadatsumi to a place in which one can live without fear. In order to do that, I believe with all my being that I must wield my blade mercifully.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0005
028	I won't give up until all of Wadatsumi is safe to live in again.
029	Wake up! That's never going to happen. You're just being naive.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0011
030	Yes... Perhaps I am naive. So what?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
031	You have a sweet tooth. Does that make you a child?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
032	What?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
033	In a world where killing is in demand, I consider the most valuable strength to be that which allows one to refrain from killing.
034	Hmph.
035	Some would say you're childish to believe in such things.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
036	Some would say you're childish for having a sweet tooth.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
037	Yet your blade is true. I know that any meeting of our blades would be honest.
038	Now that I know that, I will not falter.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
039	...
040	The strength to refrain from killing, huh?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
041	You know what I think? In a world where mercy is considered strength, only those who practice your way would flourish.
042	Eventually your naivety would spread, until no one even thought of killing others.
043	I bet my favorite dessert would taste even sweeter in a world like that.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
044	Reimei...
045	Until that day comes, however, I will do what I need to do. I will carry out my work.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
046	Someday, if we do end up going head to head, I want you to face me as you are now. Keep those convictions of yours close.
047	...
048	The path you have chosen will be a long one. Until the day the people of this world understand the value of mercy, I guess I could be something like your forerunner.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
049	Sounds good to me.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
050	You carry out your duty, and I'll carry out mine.
051	...
052	I'm going to have to do something about my impoverished lifestyle, aren't I?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
053	Even though I'm powerless to change the world or prove my point right now...
054	The way of the Sosenko isn't wrong. An assassin's dagger will not save this world, or its people.
055	So all I can do is spread my beliefs by way of this blade.
056	Perhaps it isn't quite their area of expertise, but I might ask the owner of that sweet parlor for the secret to their business's longevity. Continuing a business for a hundred years is no small feat.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0039
057	I must embody my ideology if I am to realize it, and become stronger.
058	After all, I can't let down that sweet-toothed guy who said he'd be my forerunner.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0010
