001	Ug...ghh... Wh-where am I?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
002	Discarded by fate, you drift between multiple worlds.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
003	Wh-who are you?	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
004	To obtain great power, which will you choose?
005	The Sacred Stone Genesis...or the Philosopher's Stone?
006	Huh? W-wait! What do you mean?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
007	Time waits for no one. For the sake of the world you live in...choose! The Sacred Stone or the Philosopher's Stone?!
008	I-I...!
009	Mm-mmm... What was that? What a weird dream.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
010	Oh no! It's already morning! I'm gonna be laaaate!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
011	What's wrong with you?	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
012	Right back at you. Quit picking a fight over something so stupid!
013	Something so stupid'?! How dare you! As a human—no, as a knight—there are some things you've just gotta stand up for!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
014	Give it back! That's my bread!
015	What?! I was gonna eat it first!
016	There's no way I'm giving it up!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0013
017	What do you two think you're doing?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
018	Oh! ...Sorry, Sir.
019	If you don't hurry along, you'll be late for your exercises! Go!
020	Ye-yes, Sir!
021	You'll regret this! I'm Kanon! I'm gonna make you pay for what you did!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
022	I'm Chloe of the 1st Rank! What Rank are you in?!
023	I...! I'm in the...13th Rank.
024	The 13th Rank?! You're like the lowest of the lowest! I'm shocked you'd pick a fight with me!
025	Sh-shut up! You know what they say: "a clever falcon hides its claws"!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
026	Hmph!
027	The world inevitably changes, but passions etched in time will surpass history. This memory, etched in a Philosopher's Stone, speaks of a Paladin still without a name.
028	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
029	Sacred Stone Memories -Entrusted Justice-
030	The joint training ground exists as a relic of ancient Babel, where Squires of the Scarlet Flame Guard and the Holy Guard come to joust.
031	Eeek! Ack!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
032	Ouch! Hey, be careful...ah!
033	Oh! You're...Coli!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
034	It's Chloe! How long are you gonna hold a grudge about the bread?!
035	Fall in line!
036	Listen up! You'll now undertake your final trial with your graduation on the line!
037	Our final...trial?!
038	In other words, once we pass, we'll go from being Squires to official Paladins? Yes!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
039	That's if you pass the test.
040	Wh-what's that supposed to mean?!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
041	I mean that I'm not sure a low-life like you can graduate.
042	Wh-what did you just say?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0013
043	What!
044	I'll now introduce your special instructor who will accompany you on your final trial.
045	It's Captain Vettel from the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia!
046	Th-the...Captain Vettel? The hero of Envylia who ended the battle at Gilrack?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
047	What?! Yo-you...know about him?
048	Come on; he's famous! He's strong, popular, and more than anything...super good looking!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
049	Just take Captain Vettel's motto! "My sword heeds my will. The future heeds my sword."
050	I've lost count of how many times those words have encouraged me!
051	You get it, don't you?
052	Huh?
053	It looks like I misunderstood you! No fan of Captain Vettel is a bad person!
054	I'm also a huge fan! Let's do our best to pass this trial together!
055	Ta-talk about a sudden change of heart!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
056	Squires, the trial that awaits you may not be an easy one, but I wish you the best of luck.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0002
057	Eeeeek!!! Captain Vettel is soo cool!
058	Well then, I'll now explain the final trial to you! The trial will be held at the Trial Ruins.
059	There is only one condition for passing! You must fetch a Philosopher's Stone from the ruins!
060	...A Philosopher's Stone.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
061	However, there are many monsters within the ruins!
062	Use the skills and knowledge you have gained from your training to pass this trial!
063	If I pass, I'll finally be able to repay my debt to the Holy Order of Babel!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
064	Many a Paladin can be traced back here! Follow in the footsteps of your predecessors! Clear the path to becoming a glorious Paladin!
065	Today, in addition to myself, I've asked another to travel with us.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
066	Oh! That's...!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
067	Wh-what's going on?!
068	I'm Cadanova, captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
069	Ca-Cadanova? The Guardian of the Land and the Flame Dragon King?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0044
070	He's a superstar that every knight—no, every living soul—in Babel has heard of.
071	H-hey! Isn't this—
072	A huge opportunity for us!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
073	Huh? Opportunity?
074	Even though I'm in the 13th Rank, if I impress Captain Cadanova, he might initiate me into the 4th Guard!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
075	Ohh... I'm getting my hopes up!
076	W-wait! Don't you think it's strange?!
077	Why are two captain-rank knights overseeing the training of Squires? There's gotta be a reason.
078	Come on! Who cares about the details? You should do something to impress Captain Vettel as well!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0016
079	...Really? If I impress him, maybe he'll say, "Would you join the Scarlet Flame Knights for my sake?"
080	And I would say, "But, Captain Vettel, I'm destined to enter the Holy Guard."
081	Then he would tell me, "Why not give it up? I want to be with you." Eeeeeek!!!
082	Now we depart! Squires, don't let down your guard!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
083	Yes, Siiiir! Guard is up and ready!
084	Alrighty! I'm gonna become a Paladin at all costs!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0015
