001	Grrraaaaaaaaahh!
002	Hahahahaha! Not bad, Keeper!
003	Uggrraaah!
004	Setsuna! The keeper's energy flow is... Setsuna, get down!
005	Nngh!
006	I can't predict its movements...
007	Setsuna! Here it comes again! Wait... It's coming this way!
008	Sis!
009	Grraaah!
010	No!
011	Aaaahhh!
012	Macherie!
013	Sis!
014	No... No... Aaaaaaaaahhh!
015	How dare you! How dare you...!
016	I wont let anything be taken away from me again! Never again!
017	Grrraaaaaaahh!
018	Setsuna!
019	Macherie! Are you okay?!
020	I'm fine! Oh no! Setsuna, get down!
021	Ack!
022	Setsuna!
023	Uggrraaah!
024	Jayme! It's coming this way!
025	I can't just watch her get hurt! I'm not going to just leave her!
026	I know. Just be sure to dodge when I tell you to, okay?
027	Right!
028	(I almost made the same horrible mistake again.)
029	(Those two there are doing everything they can to help me.)
030	(While I was merely distancing myself from them, under the guise of protecting them...)
031	Macherie! What do you see?!
032	Setsuna! When the keeper was attacking, I saw a powerful flow of energy towards its chest!
033	That must be where its core is. Its weakness!
034	(The question is...will my blade reach it?)
035	Setsuna! You can do it!
036	(Jayme believes in me.)
037	Now is not the time for me to hesitate!
038	Setsuna...? Did she just smile?
039	What?
040	Grrrraaaaaggh!
041	Sorry it took me so long, but this is the end for you.
042	Uggrraaah!
043	(I am not alone anymore.)
044	The sadness...the suffering...the anger... It's all a part of me, painful as it may be.
045	All I need to do is believe and fill myself with the desire to protect, just like Jayme does. Imbuing an honest desire into my blade...
046	And here it is! Vagabond - Flawless Beauty!!!
047	Grrrooooooogh!
048	Setsuna, you did it!
049	Setsuna! I knew you could do it!
050	My...strength...
051	So you've delivered the jewel to the shrine?
052	I have. Crafting a staff with that jewel will be the last of the preparations for the ritual.
053	Everything is just perfect! This is all thanks to you, Setsuna.
054	And the truth is...?
055	Oh, um... Hahaha... I told the Shrine Monarch about what happened in the ruins, and I got scolded pretty harshly.
056	It's because I helped you when the trial was meant for you alone, isn't it?
057	Yea, but...the Shrine Monarch did say that being able to help others and accepting help when it is needed is a characteristic worthy of praise.
058	I see. Then I suppose everything is all right, after all. Jayme will always be here to help you if needed.
059	Yeah! And if I keep training with Setsuna, I'm gonna get super strong and be even more helpful!
060	Yes, indeed. You might even become capable of using the same skill I did earlier better than I ever could.
061	Setsuna, please don't flatter him so much. It'll go straight to his head.
062	It's not flattery. I'm being honest. It was thanks to the two of you that I was even able to use it.
063	Hehehehe!
064	Sis, I'm really hungry. Can we have dinner as soon as we get home?
065	Sure. Let's treat ourselves to a wonderful meal today! Setsuna, won't you join us?
066	Of course. I would be delighted.
067	We're almost home!
068	Jayme, no running!
069	It wasn't my power alone that allowed me to defeat the keeper.
070	But if I am able to perfect that skill...
071	Maybe I'll have the strength to protect the ones I love from now on.
072	I lost my way once in pursuit of power. Now, I find myself in the same position.
073	Am I making the same mistake all over again?
074	Setsuna! Are you coming?
075	Sorry! I'll catch you up!
076	(There's no way for me to know yet whether this is a mistake or not.)
077	(The most important thing to me right now is that these two are happy to be with me.)
078	(Then, one day...one day...)
079	Welcome home, Setsuna.
080	Welcome home!
081	I'm home.
