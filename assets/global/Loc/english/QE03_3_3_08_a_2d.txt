001	Dias?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
002	How did you guys get here?! I couldn't even open it with my powers...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
003	It's an insider secret. But, if you managed to get inside here, doesn't that mean you opened the door as well?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
004	I had someone from the castle open it for me. But it was a trap, and I got locked up in here.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
005	U-um...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
006	We're here searching for the person who came from Slothstein. He's supposed to be here...
007	You can't help yourselves from following my trail, can you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
008	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
009	He's at the very far end of the prison, but...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
010	Grrrr...!!!
011	Wh-what is a monster doing in a place like this?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
012	It's a Familiar. It's an entity made using magic. It's similar to my Battalion.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
013	Since I've been here, it's persistently attacked me. Since it hasn't attacked the prisoner in the cell, I'm assuming it's meant to eliminate intruders.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
014	Please! Let us through!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
