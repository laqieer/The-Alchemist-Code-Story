001	Huff...huff... It seems like everyone from the village is safe!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
002	Wh-what a relief...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
003	I thought we wouldn't make it. Both of you have our gratitude.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
004	Wh-what a relief...! I did it!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
005	Well done. Your movements are getting better, but...Logi...your bangs are pretty long.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0006
006	Ah. I agree, now that you've mentioned it.
007	With long bangs, you can't observe your surroundings. You need to keep your range of vision as wide as possible. Here, take this.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0030
008	A bandana! I feel like Sabareta now.
009	And like Sabareta, I'll resolve myself to keep on fighting!<br>
010	Thank you, Setsuna. I'm going to try again!
011	Do your best, Logi.	VO_setsuna.setsuna_sys_0008
012	That's all I wanted to convey to you.
013	Huh...Alchemy?!
014	Setsuna, are you already...?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0020
015	... ...
016	(Great swordsman...I have fulfilled the promise that you left with me.)
017	This sensation... Can you use Alchemy?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
018	Are you the one that summoned Setsuna?
019	... ...
020	He-hey!
021	... ...
022	Setsuna...
023	Thank you, Setsuna! As your student...no, as a knight...	VO_logi.logi_battle_0018
024	I will obtain the power to protect Agatha—to protect everyone!
