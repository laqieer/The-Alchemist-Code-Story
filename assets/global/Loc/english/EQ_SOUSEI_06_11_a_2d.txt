001	Just a little bit more… We're almost there…	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
002	Our reward is nigh. All that we've accumulated will return to its original form.
003	Its original form…	VO_terres.terres_sys_0031
004	I see. That is what I agreed to. The future we desire requires the power to change the past.
005	That's right! And soon, salvation will be ours. We'll make it so that this nightmare never happened.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
006	What better way to wrap things up? And I'll finally be able to return there---	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0008
007	…But you must wait your turn.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0005
008	Wha--!?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0026
009	I've been biding my time--waiting for the moment your exhaustion weakens your connection to the Cursed Beast.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0010
010	…Is this Her Majesty's idea of a joke? Only I can activate this power.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
011	If I die, your plan to return the Ira Belt to its original state will be ruined!
012	Yet, if I let you do as you please, we won't be saved either.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0030
013	It almost sounded too good to be true--turn back the clock, defeat the Cursed Beasts and nip all our suffering in the bud…
014	Perhaps, if I were as naïve as that youth, Nimul, I may have fallen for it.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0003
015	However, he and I are different. I see through your deceit.
016	It…was never my intention to deceive. I never lied to you…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
017	You just happened to omit certain details.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0014
018	Namely, if we go back in time to defeat the Cursed Beasts, we won't actually be saved, will we?
019	We'll disappear.
020	…
021	The Cursed Beasts created these lands. So, what would happen if they disappeared before they created anything?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0001
022	Would that be "salvation?" Perhaps. In that scenario, mankind might build a utopian society on innocent soil.
023	But…those people wouldn't be us.
024	We are the children of a sinful earth. Our existence would be denied in your vision of paradise.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0031
025	So, you intend to rob us of our future for a second chance at something you let slip through your fingers.
026	However, you don't get to decide what "time" we go back to… I do.
027	…Ah, so you figured it out. Damn… I was hoping to avoid this little headache by keeping quiet…	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0003
028	What good will opposing me do you now? As far as the Ira Belt is concerned, this is checkmate. Game over.
029	Even if you take me out…there's nothing you can do.
030	That's a lie. There are others who can use the same power as you. Two are here now, as a matter of fact.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0006
031	…Oh, so you plan on using those twins, is that it?
032	What makes you think they'll do as you say?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
033	I'm sure those two are busy rescuing the people of the Ira Belt as we speak.
034	As humans, we get attached easily.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0001
035	It doesn't matter what kind of person you are, if you take someone under your wing for long enough, you'll surely develop a connection.
036	I've heard the cries of sorrow, the pleas for life, resounding near and far...and yet…I can't save them all.
037	…But those twins are willing to try. They'll go to any lengths to help others.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0005
038	…Do my ears deceive me? Here I was thinking you abandoned your people without a second thought.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
039	Or is this just another ploy to mess with their heads? What a devil you are.
040	So long as my land is saved, I'll employ any form of treachery.
112	ANY form of treachery, you say? Huh... So, that boy Sulva--is that why you sent him to do battle?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0044
113	To pull at the heartstrings of the Pursuers…?
114	...You couldn't possibly understand.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0003
115	That child is our salvation.
116	A budding flower of hope, never before seen in the Ira Belt.
117	One born of this land fraught with Wrath, yet who is not motivated by anger--	VO_terres.terres_sys_0031
118	He shall lead our people toward a new age of peace and prosperity. I'm certain of it.
119	But in order to do so, I had to make him a knight. There was no other choice.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0030
120	The "king" who rules this land must be stronger than anyone else.
121	He must have the power to conquer our merciless terrain.
122	For that reason, I dared to send him into the fray. He needed to learn that kindness is not always enough.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0005
123	How ghastly… Poor thing had no say in the matter.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
124	Still, he may find salvation if he rebels against you, but I seriously doubt that.
125	…How could he do otherwise when he owes you his life? Your cunning is truly remarkable.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
126	…
127	The question is…is there any hope beyond that?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
128	…Enough idle talk.
129	Your machinations end now, snake. I'll be taking over from here.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0010
130	…
041	…Meet your maker.
042	…We're approaching the summit. Mira, Nyx. How's everything looking?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
043	So far, so good! Making sure we don't get attacked by Space-Time Manipulation!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
044	We can't let that jerk keep beating us. Master would give us a tongue-lashing.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
045	Alright, let's go!
046	…What…the--	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
047	The heat and corruption are unbearable…This must be Satna's stronghold.	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
048	And yet the Cursed Beast is nowhere to be found… Quence! Show yourself!
049	…He's gone.
050	…Queen Terese?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
051	What do you mean "he's gone?"	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
052	Just that. By now, his body should be no more than ashes in the crater.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0005
053	…Did you have some kind of falling out?
054	Yes, I suppose that's how it must look to you. Here--
055	Libra!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
056	I believe this is yours.
057	…Why the sudden change?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
058	Think of it as an olive branch... To new allies. In return, all I ask is that you save this land.
059	…You want us to use Libra to go back in time?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
060	Precisely. Go back to the time our prized knight, Andechs, left us and my brother succumbed to sin. That was when this land began to crumble.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0037
061	…
062	If you defeat Satna while it's still dormant, then maybe the Ira Belt can be saved.
063	Maybe those of my people who you couldn't save before will escape ruin.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0002
064	But that's…
065	Mira, Nyx. Is it even possible?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
066	…
067	…Given the amount of magil they loaded into Libra…it's possible. In theory, anyway.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
068	But who knows what would happen to the present if we go changing the past.
069	I'm willing to take my chances.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0004
070	If the alternative is certain doom, it's a worthwhile gamble.
071	So? Can I count on you? The power to save the world is in your hands.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0001
072	A miraculous power that will right the wrongs of the past.
073	We…
074	Sorry, we're not interested.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
075	Andechs! You made it…
076	…What brings you here, knight?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0012
077	Did you not sully your hands to save this land?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0003
078	Why do you oppose our salvation?
079	Simple--	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
080	If we follow your plan, our "sins" will vanish.
081	Our "sins?"	VO_terres.terres_sys_0025
082	We chose to make sacrifices at our own volition. We showed little regard for others and shed blood.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
083	We can't pretend that didn't happen.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
084	We've got to carry those sins on our shoulders. Even if it's painful---even if we have regrets--that's the only way forward.
085	Andechs…
086	…I second that. I don't wanna rewrite the past.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
087	Adaleigh…
088	I'm saddened about opposing Icona and letting her die. There were many others I wish we could've saved.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
089	But if I did it all over again like it never happened--that just wouldn't be right.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
090	I've also thought about going back in time, once or twice. But y'know…	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
131	That pudding I ate yesterday was special because I could only eat it once. Mmmmm--just thinking about it makes my mouth water.
091	You're saying you'd go back in time for pudding? I think there's a point in there…somewhere.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
092	We all have times we'd like to do over. But why place your bets on a method with no guarantee of success? For now, at least…
093	Mira… Nyx…
094	I just accept things as they are.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
095	…Me too! I want to live without regrets!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
096	Eulalia…Daphne…
097	…Life is full of struggles. We make mistakes and we get hurt…	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
098	But we do the best we can. I'm sure every living thing does the best it can...
099	Emmel…
100	…Is this the conclusion you've reached?	VO_terres.terres_sys_0030
101	…It appears so.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
102	We've come this far fighting to build a brighter future.
103	And we'll keep fighting.
104	Very well…	VO_terres.terres_sys_0016
105	Your Majesty, I…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0031
106	I'm alive. I'm still alive!
107	That means we haven't failed. The Ira Belt isn't finished. So…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0005
108	…
109	You’ve made your decision clear. Our goals are at odds. I fear I have no choice--	VO_terres.terres_sys_0031
110	In accordance with the creed of this land, my strength will show you the error of your ways!
111	…! Everybody, brace yourselves!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
