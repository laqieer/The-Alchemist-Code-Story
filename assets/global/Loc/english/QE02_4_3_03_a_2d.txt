001	Th-this is highly inappropriate, Mayor Edward!	VO_keibi.keibi_sys_0027
002	Shut up! What is this place?!
003	I can't believe you the mayor are trespassing on my property. What if the citizens were to find out about it?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
004	Alvarez! Let's forgo the roundabout questions. Return the Sacred Stone to me.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
005	I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. As you can see, I still haven't finished with my development.
006	The Belphegor! What is going on here?!	VO_edward.edward_sys_0025
007	I am developing artificial intelligence using the Sacred Stone.
008	Once completed, their work efficiency will rise dramatically, thus reducing accidents and other human sufferings. It will lead to further development within our country.
009	Artificial intelligence?	VO_edward.edward_sys_0012
010	That's completely different than the story you told Ethan. Ultimately, you're just doing this for your own gain!
011	What are you talking about? You are also quite versed in the development of Alkaroids.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0030
012	If we were to inject them with Alchemic energy, they would be able to deal with bandits who can wield Alchemy.
013	Giving Alchemic energy to Alkaroids?! What nonsense!	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
014	Why don't you understand? If we left everything in the hands of machines, we wouldn't have to sacrifice human life anymore!	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0016
015	We should use the Sacred Stone and pursue this path!
016	That's a mistake! Machines are ultimately tools. Humans must be the ones to wield them!	VO_edward.edward_sys_0039
017	If we rely on machines, one day they will take our place. We must not sacrifice our intelligence!
018	Do you realize that your orthodox way of thinking has resulted in extensive casualties?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0030
019	Are you going to continue to create victims like my father Jonathan?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0044
020	Jonathan?
021	He was made to develop weapons under your instructions. Ultimately, he was targeted for his abilities and killed.
022	Alvarez...are you Jonathan's...?	VO_edward.edward_sys_0022
023	The mindset of the user can change even the most excellent products or useful machines into deadly weapons.
024	Those who are repulsive should be eliminated as much as possible.
025	I see. I'm sorry. I take full responsibility for Jonathan's death.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0029
026	But...I cannot allow Belphegor to remain absent any longer. At this rate...
027	Will the colossal island that carries destruction be resurrected?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0007
028	You...?! In any case, return it immediately!	VO_edward.edward_sys_0027
029	I thought I just told you that I won't.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0030
030	...?!	VO_edward.edward_sys_0025
031	If I were you, I would leave now. After all, you wouldn't want the Alkaroids to recognize you as a pirate who is a threat to their artificial intelligence.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
032	...!
