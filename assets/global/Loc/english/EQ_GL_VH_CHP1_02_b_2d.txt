001	You're pretty good, Emrys.
002	Your name holds up as well.
003	I'm not fond of it...
004	Call me Lilith instead.
005	My pleasure, Lilith.
006	Ok. Now that we are done here, I will bring some muscles to carry these crates back.
007	Guard them for me will you?
008	No problem.
009	Something about her fighting style makes me feel uneasy.
010	That inhuman agility and firing speed with accuracy.
011	Emrys turns around and opens a crate to find green liquids in reinforced vials.
012	Are these the psychoactive drugs?
013	Let's keep one.
014	They may be the ones who have helped us before, but from all the evidence I've seen...
015	And events leading me coincidentally to them...
016	Projekt Goetia... What do they want from us?
