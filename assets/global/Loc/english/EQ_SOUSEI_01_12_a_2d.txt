001	Hrgh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
002	Nngh! Two down...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
003	Are you all right, Waginau? You're looking rather ragged.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
004	The corruption is...too strong here. I can still fight, thanks to this sword...but I'm...nearly at my limit.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0019
005	It's not like you to complain.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
006	Hmph... And what about you? You're drenched in sweat.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
007	Heh. You caught me. My vision's been going blurry for a while now.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
008	This is the first time I've wielded my new technique in succession like this. It's far more taxing than I had imagined.
009	I'll need to...devise some equipment...to support it...when I...have the chance...
010	Hey! Get up! You can't fall on your sword here!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0026
011	I'm sorry, Waginau. I need to...save...my strength. There are still...two...cores...left.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
012	All right. You can count on me!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
013	Come to think of it... Adaleigh and Yna have yet to catch up to us.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
014	What the hell are they playing at? Wanderers... You can't trust them.
015	...
016	Nnrgh! I'm not sure I can hold out much... Arrghh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0042
017	But that's...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
018	Alright! Here I am! All Engineer Soldiers, open fire! Pump these chumps full of lead!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
019	Adaleigh... You're here.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
020	What's wrong with you two, lazing around on the ground there?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
021	I'd say that's pretty damn careless of you, but then again, what would I know? I'm just a child, right?
022	Hmph. Don't get cocky.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
023	What have you been doing all this time?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
024	You weren't waiting for me to catch up, were you?! This place is swarming with magil, and the controls were going haywire.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
025	They're fine now, though. So you can leave the small fry to me and the Soldiers.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
026	That's good to hear. Do you have one to spare? I'm...not sure I can walk. I ended up expending far more power than I expected.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
027	Yeah, yeah. All right. I've got you.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
028	You know, you sure are a strange one. I never know if I can count on you.
029	Hahah...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
030	(I trained harder than any warrior of the Sephira... Or so I thought. I never imagined I would find myself so thoroughly drained.)
031	(If I am to truly make this new technique accessible to anyone and everyone, I'm going to need to find some sort of medium. A mainstay, like Sephiron has been to us...)
032	We should keep going. There are still two cores remaining, but we're halfway there!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
