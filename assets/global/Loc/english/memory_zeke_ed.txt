001	This one man who sealed the flame of envy in his heart
002	<br>to bring about a peaceful world.
003	Though continuing to bear his past sins,
004	<br>this man's unwavering will
005	<br><br>was inherited by his family
006	The gears of destiny which this man had set in motion,
007	<br>continued shaping people's lives until this day.
008	What may the future hold?<br>
009	<br>A peaceful world filled with laughter,
010	<br><br>or one filled with sorrow?
011	The answer to that question
012	<br>lays dormant in the unknown future.
013	Huh?!
014	<br>Where am I? What on earth...
015	Heh... I see.<br>
016	<br>Who would have thought that I'd ever be transmuted,<br>
017	<br>after all my efforts of sealing Alchemy away.<br>
018	Well, I suppose I can't help it.<br>This is part of destiny as well.
019	If for a strong spirit who aims for peace,<br>
020	<br>who doesn't get swayed by power,
021	<br><br>I could lend my strength.
