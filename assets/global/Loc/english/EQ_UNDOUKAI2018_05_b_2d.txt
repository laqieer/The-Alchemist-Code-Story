001	Huzzahhh!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0032
002	Well done!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
003	Haa...haa... So that's what you meant.	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0019
004	I can't just keep blindly running into things that are too big for me to take on by myself. I have to face them with my friends.
005	We might butt heads, but together, we can overcome anything! I'm not alone! That's what you were trying to show me, isn't it, Teona?!
006	That's exactly right!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
007	I just knew that you are the type of person who shines brightest when surrounded by her friends, rather than when dealing with her troubles all alone.
008	Thanks so much for hosting this race!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
009	I'm going to be the greatest, coolest Phantom ever! Just you watch!
010	Excellent! I'll be cheering for you!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
011	Oh, Mister Reagan! Were you able to study the...? You know... The l-l-l...	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
012	Hmph. No matter how hard I tried, I simply could not peel it off of him, so I was forced to leave it behind.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0022
013	Yet, I find myself becoming more and more intrigued by its properties.
014	O...kay...?
015	Which reminds me... That Gormalas character, he was moaning something about there being a prize at the end of this race...?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
016	Here it is. This is for you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
017	Is this...a trophy?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
018	It sure is! This right here is proof that you won the race! Isn't its golden sheen beautiful? I made it myself!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
019	Whoa!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_1024
020	However, this is merely a bonus prize. As for the true reward, well...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
021	You will find that deep within your heart.
022	You're right! Money can't buy this feeling of accomplishment!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
023	Was that what this whole thing was about?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
024	Mister Reagan!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
025	It's all thanks to you!
026	I never would've been able to finish this race alone. Thanks so much!
027	Well, I can agree with that.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
028	Huh?!
029	I never expected you to be able to ride your mech gear—which is not supposed to be used as a vehicle to begin with, let alone after being so heavily modified—all the way through this race.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
030	Your dedication pushed you to accomplish things that would have been beyond your physical capabilities. I thank you for providing me with such intriguing scientific data.
031	I feel like even Leema is gonna see me in a different light after this! Thanks a bunch, Reagan!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
032	I'm not exactly happy with this so-called prize, but oh well. I have been pleasantly entertained.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0007
033	Well now, you know what they say! All's well that ends well!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
034	(Oh, thank goodness she won! I didn't have anything prepared for the people who expected treasure!)	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
035	(Well, I suppose I did have one thing prepared.)
036	Lotiyah reporting! We have a problem! We're getting complaints coming in from all over the place!	VO_lotia.lotia_chara_1011
037	I got caught up in Dorothea and Reida's fight! I'm pretty heavily injured here! Who's gonna pay for my hospital bills?!
038	Ravina's magic froze the lake, and Megistos is blowing holes in the mountain! Have they no respect for nature?!
039	There's a naked man collapsed in the middle of the road! This is public indecency! These are some of the complaints we've been receiving!
040	What should we do?! Back to you, Teona!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0018
041	A fight here, a fight there...and a naked man in the streets. Oh, my. I hope the cost of reparations isn't too extravagant.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0030
042	Thank you, Teona. I didn't actually think you'd go through with this.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0034
043	Not at all. However, I must ask... Are you sure that you fully understood Leema's intentions?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
044	Well, I'm sure Leema is planning on showing off the capabilities of her mech gear before the sports festival, not to mention the prize money, and...	VO_rish.rish_event_1006
045	I see. So we have the naturally talented Daisy and the highly intellectual Leema... What an ideal combination.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
046	By the way, Richie... Why are you doing so much for Daisy?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
047	Hmm... How do I put it? I just can't leave her be. I somehow found myself to be involved.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0022
048	Huh. And the truth is?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
049	Well... To tell you the truth, I am, in fact, a co-conspirator in Leema's plans.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0010
050	Oh...? I had thought that it was something more along the lines of—	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
051	We will show off the mech gear at the sports festival and win the prize money. If all goes as planned, I will get to place an advertisement for my toy store on the mech gear itself!	VO_rish.rish_sys_0007
052	Wow... I had no idea. So, all this time, Daisy has been nothing more than a pawn dancing on the palms of two great strategists, eh?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
053	Well... I suppose that's just fine, so long as Daisy's feeling confident.
054	I mean, I certainly couldn't leave a lost girl like her alone, and look at her now... She looks so happy.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
055	All right! Just gotta keep this up for the main event!	VO_daisy.daisy_chara_1017
056	Only one person can be number one!
057	Those who want to win must fight fair and with a combative spirit!
058	Richie! Richie! Richie!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0019
059	You're here again? What a pain. What do you want now?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0012
060	I've gotten so much better with my mech gear lately, but Leema is still mad at me!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
061	Yeah? And? How is that my problem?!	VO_rish.rish_sys_0027
