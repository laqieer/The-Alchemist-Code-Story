001	(Where is Emma?!)
002	(I bet she's sleeping in again. She definitely overdid it at her job last night, even though I explicitly told her not to!)	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
003	(I should have gone to wake her up.)	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
004	Now then! Noah!
005	Y-yes!	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
006	Before we begin, I'd like you to be an example for the class. You have a firm grasp of the basic principles, after all.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0008
007	You don't mind, do you, Noah?
008	O-oh! Of course not!	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
009	(If you practice magic in accordance with the proper theories and follow the correct procedures, you will definitely get results.)
010	All right. You can do this.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
011	(Ah, it feels so good to see my hard work pay off!)
012	Splendid! I can always count on you, Noah. All right, class, let us begin!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0008
013	If you do well, then next time we shall practice on real monsters!
014	Yes, professor!
015	Okay, here I go... Kazam! Huh? Why didn't it work?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0012
016	I can't do it! It's too difficult! Does it only work for honor students or something?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0017
017	Honor students only, huh?  Well, Noah is so inflexible, and if everything isn't by the book, she just snaps!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0010
018	Totally! She won't let you so much as put a book in the wrong place without nagging your ears off! She may be an honor student, but that doesn't make her a nice person!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0037
019	...
020	(If everyone just puts their books wherever they want, then the shelves will get all messed up. They have numbers on them! Why can't they just put them back properly?!)	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
021	(What does it matter that I'm an honor student? People who can't follow simple rules have no right to talk!)	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
022	(There's nothing wrong with my behavior! What I'm doing is right!)
023	Morning, Noah!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
024	What's got you all angry this early in the morning?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
025	E-Emma! Wait, did you take my glasses?! I can't see without them!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
026	Yup, I did! 'Cause, you know... Gotta turn that frown upside down!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
027	Wh-what? Why? This is so embarrassing! Emma, come on, I really can't see! Give them back!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0050
028	Uh-oh... Here! Quick, take them!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0027
029	Oh my gosh! The monster cage is open!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0043
030	Urgaahhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
031	Ugh! What is going on?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
