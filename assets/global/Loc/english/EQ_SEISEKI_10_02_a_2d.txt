001	The desert zone.
002	Ug...gfff... Where...am I?	VO_almira.almira_battle_0026
003	Wh-what?! Are these Greed Dike soldiers?! They're all frozen...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
004	...Morning♡	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
005	Wha...! Huh? Othima...?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
006	Come on. I'm the one who's surprised.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
007	You were supposed to have gone with Kagura and I find you sleeping here. Did you get sick of your mission and run away?
008	We realized you were surrounded by Greed Dike soldiers, so we rushed over here.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
009	That's right! I was blown away by Kagura's Vermilion Bird and...!	VO_almira.almira_chara_1011
010	Why would Captain Kagura do that?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
011	Othima, Kagura is in danger! She's currently engaged in battle with a man called Sol!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
012	Sol...?! Here's already made it to Saga?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
013	Yes! And the Greed Dike soldiers also appeared! We need to hurry!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0037
014	Clam down! It's all right. Captain Yauras is headed there. The worst has been averted.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
015	You don't understand! This all happened after Captain Yauras joined us!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0021
016	You don't mean...!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
017	She was killed! By this Sol fellow!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0022
018	!!!
019	Wa-wait...please...! Are you saying that Captain Yauras is dead?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
020	What I'm saying is that Kagura is in danger!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
021	Captain Yauras protected us...and she was killed in such a horrible way! Ohh...!
022	No...it can't be true! Captain Yauras!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0021
023	....I'm sorry. We'll have to change our plans.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
024	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
025	The fact that Captain Yauras and Kagura placed their lives on the line so that she could escape...
026	It means there's something they wanted Northern Pride to know about. Correct?
027	Y-yes. Greed Dike is headed to Northern Pride. She wanted me to pass that on to Kanon.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
028	Understood. Basheeny...sorry, do you think you can take Almira to Northern Pride?
029	Huh...?! Wait, but...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
030	She's witnessed Sol's way of fighting. I'm certain that information will be of an assistance to Kanon. You understand, right?
031	And...what will you do Captain Othima?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
032	I'm going to head straight to Saga.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
033	It still remains that if the Matter falls into their hands, it will place us at a serious disadvantage.
034	This is just my intuition...but I believe that the Matter will be the determining factor of this war.
035	Understood. I have...one request.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
036	A request...? What is it?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
037	Please, act rationally. You portray yourself as calm and collected, but, in fact, you are the most emotional one of us, Captain Othima.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
038	...Basheeny, there's one thing I have to tell you.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
039	...What's that?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
040	I'm both your superior in age and in rank. I'm the one who's supposed to be handing out the warnings, not the other way around.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
041	...I'm sorry.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0035
042	Haha. I'm joking. Don't worry...appearances aside, I do actually happen to be a captain, you know?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
043	With the world verging on a crisis, I won't be so idiotic as to let my personal feelings get the better of me.
044	Right, of course. Sorry. I spoke out of turn.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
045	No, not at all. Your concern means a lot to me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
046	Well then...if you encounter Orion's main forces, don't take any risks. It's best to avoid conflict.
047	Wait for the right moment to launch an ambush in Northern Pride...understood?
048	Yes. Please, be careful.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
049	Yes, yes. Understood.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0037
050	...Time is of the essence. Let's go.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0032
051	Got it!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0037
052	Honestly, I'm not a very good captain, am I? Sorry for always lying to you...Basheeny.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
053	I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. My patience has worn out.
054	...Unfortunately, I really don't think I can restrain myself any longer.
055	Meanwhile...at the Earth Temple in Saga region.
056	Agghhhh!!!
057	Ug-gh...! M-my people...!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0019
058	Looks like a great many of them have been blown to oblivion. What's your next move? Do you want to continue?	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
059	...Uck...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
060	You don't have to hand me your Matter if you don't want to, you know?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
061	I'll just need to slowly pry it out of you after I kill all your people.
062	Ack...!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
063	All right...we've lost.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
064	Sorry, I couldn't hear you. Do you want me to transform this entire landscape into a blazing field of fire?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
065	I surrender! It's pathetic, really... My power alone is not enough to protect my people.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0043
066	In order to prevent the destruction of my tribe...I will give you my Matter! So, please...no more!
067	Tehre...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
068	Hmph. A wise choice. You managed to avoid utter annihilation. You can leave now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
069	...?! Yo-you're not going to...kill me?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0042
070	Kill you? Of course not. You're my insurance just in case something goes go awry.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
071	Your insurance...?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0025
072	There's always the possibility that you've set safeguards on this Matter of yours.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
073	If I gather all four and nothing happens, then I will personally visit each of your factions and wipe them off the face of this earth.
074	I'm going to use the power your Sprites possess to evoke your Matter.
075	Ack! W-we will never do...something so...despicable...	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
076	Tehre...! Hu-hurry...tend to his wounds!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
077	...Agh...	VO_terre.terre_battle_0022
078	So this one of the Matters... Three more to go.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
079	...!!! Wh-what have you done...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
080	Hey...I obtained one of the Matters. Look. It's got quite the glow.
081	Why?! You said you were going to have a discussion in order to resolve this matter!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
082	This is my way of holding a discussion.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
083	What idiots. If they'd given it to me from the start, no one would've had to die.
084	Ack...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
085	What exactly is that you people want?
086	Huh...?
087	Look at all the lives you've sacrificed! You've thrown the entire world into chaos!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
088	With all the power you have, what more could you desire?!
089	...What I desire, huh?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
090	I told you earlier. What I desire is the Lost Blue...this beautiful deep blue landscape.
091	The blue landscape...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
