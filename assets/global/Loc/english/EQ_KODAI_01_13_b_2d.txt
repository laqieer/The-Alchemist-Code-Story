001	Haaa... Haaa... No...	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0027
002	Everybody was so happy here! They were all so nice!
003	Aaaagh!
004	Ah...!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0019
005	You all right there, Lil?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0001
006	Quence! I brought Sia with me, but Claybelle...and Zafeiris...!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
007	I know! I've been watching.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
008	Keeping an eye on that beast that appeared in the middle of the snowfield...
009	...
010	Good. She's only asleep.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0007
011	That's Asmodeus.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
012	Asmo... Huh?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0005
013	It's a Cursed Beast. An incarnation of corruption, infecting the world.
014	We haven't the means to defeat it now.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0031
015	(Or, perhaps the Alchemy engraved upon this sword can, but...)
016	(Would I be able to wield it effectively? Nimul and Emmel aren't here with me. Can I do this without my friends to rely upon?)
017	That sword...
018	Hey, be careful! You should never touch the blade of a swo—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0003
019	What the...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
