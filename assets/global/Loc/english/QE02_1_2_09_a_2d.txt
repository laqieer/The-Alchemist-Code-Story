002	Sorry for all the noise. Hey. Take every single one of them out. We don't want them alerting their buddies.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0011
003	Yes, Don!
004	Ta-take them out? You mean the Guard Droids?! That holds a heavy sentence under the law.
005	Here, I'm the law. You've nothing to be afraid of, young lady.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0012
006	Mr. Taras, you're a member of the mafia, right?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
007	I've never been called a 'member of the mafia" before, but I guess you could call me that.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0013
008	W-well, what does one from the mafia plan to do with me?
009	Plan to do with you? What do you mean?	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0014
010	D-do you plan on selling me to the Beckrams?
011	Heheh. You're a funny one, you know?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
012	Let me tell you this. It's neither money nor power that motivates us of the mafia. It's a moral obligation.
013	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
014	Don! That gunslinger on the motorcycle is inside the mansion!
015	He seems to have invaded while we were fighting with the Guard Droids!
016	Shut up!!! Stop getting rattled over a single gunslinger!	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0015
017	Eeek! So-sorry! But, he'll be here any moment now!
018	An arrogant idiot comes here to throw away his life. Why don't we help him along?	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0016
019	Ed-Edgar!
