001	Ooooh... What should I do?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	Her Highness granted me permission to give Asmodeus to Dias...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
003	But whenever I lay eyes on him, I get so flustered! I need to come up with some small talk.
004	There's actually so much I want to say to him...but my heart just starts beating like crazy...and my mind goes blank.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
005	Plus, I haven't seen him since...that day.
006	He smelled...so nice then, too.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
007	—No, never mind that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
008	How do I really feel about him?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
009	Hmm... Oh, I've got it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
010	I just have to get him here! If it worked with Alma and Rebecca, then this time shouldn't be any different!
011	This is where...we all started seeing...eye to eye. It's where we finally became friends.
012	That day... I looked into the ice mirror, but I didn't see Dias. Will I see him this time?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
013	They say that true love never dies. Can I honestly say that's how I feel about him?
014	Well... There's no point mulling it over any longer! The Stub Rules flower will show if he truly is my heart's desire. Time to go find it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
015	But then again... It'll be hard doing this on my own. Maybe I should ask Alma and Rebecca to come along.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
016	No, what am I saying?! They barely came out of our last sky skirmish alive. I can't endanger them again.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
017	This is my own problem.
018	I can't believe I even considered pestering them for help!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1007
019	That's right... This is supposed to be a no-magic zone... I'm sure they'll let me off; I mean, this is a do-or-die situation after all!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
020	What the heck?! It just won't stay down!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
021	ROOOOOOOOOAR!!!
022	AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0028
023	Lisbeth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
024	You all right? Man... You're hopeless.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
025	Dias...? What are you doing here?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
026	I figured I'd take a last-minute tour to see if I missed anything worthwhile in Lustburg before leaving.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
027	I see...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
028	Lisbeth, care to tell me why you're here?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
029	Oh, um... I came here looking for the Stub Rules flower! It only grows deep in the forest.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
030	This couldn't wait? Didn't you just survive the last battle by the skin of your teeth? You need to give yourself time to recover.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
031	Wouldn't searching for it after you're back in peak physical shape be bet—
032	No! It's got to be now! There won't be any point later!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
033	...!
034	(You'll be gone soon...and I need to know how I really feel about you!)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
035	Alright then... Lead the way.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0038
036	What?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
037	Well? I'll see for myself what's so astonishing about this flower. There must be a reason you want it so badly.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
038	Besides, you're always giving everything 110%. Maybe I'll even pick one out just for you.
039	Dias... I don't know what to say.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
040	Now that we're committed, shall we deal with this lot first?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
