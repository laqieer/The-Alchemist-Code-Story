001	Phew! I'm glad we were able to stop the Alkaroids before they made it to the main street!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1011
002	Honestly. I can't forgive them for trying to interfere with such a fun event!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0012
003	Seriously! Why would they want to disturb this event?!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0012
004	We shouldn't let our guard down yet. These types of jealous people are usually quite persistent.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
005	Jealous...huh?
006	Hm...?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
007	There are those who can't have a wedding...even if they wanted to.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0017
008	Hey, Eve...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_1029
009	Don't you think that Vanekis has been constantly looking at that scary sabre of hers?
010	Huh? But apparently, Vanekis is an informant and an ally...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
011	Mm...Vanekis, when you talked about wanting to have a wedding but not being able to...were you referring to Sabareta?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1011
012	Is that what you meant?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
013	What are you saying all of a sudden?! That's not what I'm talking about! Hmph!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0016
014	...? Sabareta from the Lizard Brigade? Why did he come up all of a sudden...?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
015	...! The Alkaroids again! Let's go!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0042
016	They're fast!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_0022
017	We need to stop the Alkaroids as well!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0042
018	Ohh...!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
