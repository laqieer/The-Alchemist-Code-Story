001	(A few days later)
002	Morning Sieg! I plan to head out for a hunt, care to join?
003	Certainly.
004	Good, this hunt is meant to secure the surrounding area before the ceremony starts tonight.
005	May I ask what the ceremony is about?
006	Hmm... It's an important tradition in our village to offer our thanks to the Divine for the protection offered. I can't tell you more but I'll see if you can meet the village Speaker after we are back.
007	Once the ceremony is done, it should be okay for you to visit the shrine and learn more about the Divine Protector of this village.
008	Enough talking about that, let's go patrol around the area and make sure the lizardmen don't get any funny ideas about the village.
