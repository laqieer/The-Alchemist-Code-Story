001	Take this!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
002	I don't know your situation. I don't know what happened to you.
003	But I have my own reasons to fight, and I will not give in to anyone or anything!
004	Very well, then.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
005	But I'm afraid you've already caused more than enough trouble, successor of the Shield. Though I do thank you for bearing its legacy well!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0036
006	...!
007	And with that...my oath is fulfilled.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
008	Haaa...haaa...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0022
009	All right! Nice work, Daphne! You totally pulled it off!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0009
010	I suppose. But she was already exhausted from her prior battle.
011	C'mon, a win's a win! Now let's hurry back to Nyx and the others!
012	Okay!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
013	Huh...?
014	Whoa! Are you all right?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
015	I think so. I used up all of my magil in that battle. The protection from the Alchemy is gone, too.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
016	Hmm. In that case, how about you rest here for a moment? I'm worried about Nyx, so I'll—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
017	What the...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
018	First line, fall back! But be sure not to leave any gaps in the magil barrier!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
019	And leave those corroded shields behind! The next wave is coming! Brace for impact!
020	...I've about had it. Where in the world are all of these Fallen even coming from?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
021	The second and third lines are ready to move out.
022	Then take both flanks, and let's clean up those Fallen!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
023	We're never going to be able to provide backup for Daphne at this rate...
024	When did so many Fallen manage to make it into the town, anyway?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
025	You're asking the wrong question, but you are on the right track! There is no castle that cannot be breached, you know.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0045
026	One must always plan for a worst-case scenario, such as an enemy infiltration in far greater numbers than could reasonably be anticipated.
027	Father? No... Who are you?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0025
028	I am Ignacio. Though I have also been called Esai.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0001
029	Pleased to meet you, daughter of my dearest friend. I think I'll keep you alive.
030	And just what does that mean?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0004
031	(What an icy cold glare. He's looking at me like I'm nothing!)
032	I know about the hidden passage to the tower's foundation in the castle ahead.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
033	Your plan is to use that to sneak in, is it not?
034	Huh? Wait, how do you...?!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
035	Is everyone prepared?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
036	This will be a race against time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
037	While Eulalia and the others keep Ouroboros' phantoms busy outside, we'll recapture the tower.
038	Let's move out!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
