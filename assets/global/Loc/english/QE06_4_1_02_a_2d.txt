001	...I'm finally back.
002	It looks peaceful at a glance. Though from what you've described, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's not the case.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	Admittedly, I don't know the present situation. Things may have changed in Wadatsumi since I've been away.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
004	It's best to keep expectations low, however. Although...
005	Hmm?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
006	I didn't think you'd really stick with me all this way.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
007	I told you, didn't I? I'd rather die than not help you out of whatever dilemma you've gotten yourself wrapped up in.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	So you're playing the fool, then.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
009	Are you saying I've been a nuisance?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
010	At first, yes. But now I'm glad to have you with me.
011	Nice to hear you've come to believe in me a little!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
012	Well, we have been through a lot together.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
013	So, ol' Logi... You think he's really gonna show up here?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
014	Yes. If that knight we met was truly headed for Gluttony Foss, then Logi has surely received our message by now.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
015	Nonetheless...or rather, because of that, there isn't a moment to lose.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
016	We must fully secure the stone's return, before the traitor notices its absence.
017	So we're just puttin' ourselves right in the line of fire, huh? This seems like it's gonna turn into a pretty big headache.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
018	You may take your leave if you'd prefer. This has been our fight from the very start, not yours.
019	No thank you, ma'am! Did you already forget what I said?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0035
020	I've never sold out a friend to survive, and I never will. We're in this together!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
021	Tch! Looks like we have company.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
022	Wait. Something's not right.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
023	The heck?!
024	Edgar! Get back!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0003
025	?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
026	Ghh!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0022
027	That did somethin'! Let's try it again!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0032
028	What the...? It deflected my bullet! But I just got a clean shot off a second ago!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
029	This is a Dismortant. It's a twisted, weaponized creation of Greed Dike.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
030	They learn from past pain.
031	I see. Guess I called the whole headache thing! How do we beat 'em?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
032	We don't. For now, all we can do is withdraw.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
033	So, just do whatever I can to hold the thing off! Got it!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
034	Gonna be easier said than done to shake it, though.
035	Even still, we won't fall here! Think of all we've been through.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
036	Oh, for sure. I won't allow anyone's tears to fall this day!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
037	Let's go!
