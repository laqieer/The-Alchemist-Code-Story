001	Look here, Mocca. Another one.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	What a shame.
003	Judging from the clothing, this body, too, must have been a noble.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
004	Though they escaped to the desert, the sun and its heat must've been too much for them.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
005	You would think they had some idea of how harsh traversing the desert can be.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
006	Did they really have nowhere else to run in this country?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
007	The brunt of the rebellion was pointed directly at everyone in the noble class, so I would say they did not.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
008	I wonder what will become of Gluttony Foss.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
009	There is nothing we can do by worrying. We should—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
010	Hurry up and find the Sephira, right? I know, I know.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
011	Right. Let's not waste any time. We should be coming up to an oasis soon.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
012	Mocca, wait!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
013	What is it?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
014	This body, it's holding one of these flower petals...like the others.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
015	Hm.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
016	What is this? Do the people of Gluttony have some tradition of gripping a flower petal at the moment of their death?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
017	That seems unlikely.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
018	Why so?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
019	Judging by how dehydrated this body is, the flower petal should have wasted away if it had been in their hand at the moment of death.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
020	You mean, someone is putting these flower petals on the dead bodies?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
021	Yes. Maybe they mean for it to be some sort of memorial service.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
022	Could it be the Sephira?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
023	Who knows? Either way, we should hurry. If we linger, we will be joining this noble in the sand.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
024	You're right.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
025	Ngh! How can you be so quick?!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
026	Sheathe your blade. I am not here to fight you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
027	Your fighting style is unlike any swordsmanship of this continent. Who are you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
028	Who am I? I am the one who stands against those of you who rule this world.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
029	Against us?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
030	How tragic, that a Crowley like yourself would fall so far as to join the Corpse.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
031	You!
032	In search of more power, you sank to the level of those bottom feeders who rule over the rest of us, and now you can no longer hear these lamentations, can you?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
033	I act on behalf of those who are crying out for justice.
034	Those who have been persecuted.
035	Wadatsumi...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
036	Wha—?!
037	So, you are a descendant of that tragic people. That would explain your peculiar style.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
038	You, too, have a past that cannot be forgotten.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
039	Huh...?
040	I-I mean, I'm the one asking questions here!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
041	Answer me! A member of the Corpse who works in the shadows should have the information I need.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
042	And you think I would simply answer your questions?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
043	If you will not give me the answers I seek, I will just force them out of you!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0007
044	What is this black water?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
045	Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Snake Bind!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
046	Urk?! Huzzaaahh!!!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
047	He dodged by using his sword as a foothold?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
048	I am the Captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
049	As one who bears responsibility for the lives of my fellow Paladins, I cannot be bested here!
050	Tch!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
051	The cries of my people, exploited and persecuted in an era long past...
