002	Would you like some tea, Carla?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0003
003	Oh, yes, please. Thank you.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
004	...
005	......
006	Hey, Ryle! Care to join the land of the living?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
007	Whaaaat...?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
008	We've come all this way to see you. The least you can do is wake up and give us a proper reception, you lazy oaf!
009	Ehh, nah, you're fine. I've got my own work to deal with.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0040
010	You grumble about being busy far more than the guild members who are actually on task!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
011	And you're sleeping rather well for a guy with a mark on his head. Letting down on your guard will end up doing you in, you know.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
012	All the more reason now is the perfect time for me to get some rest while I still can, don't you think?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
013	I'll wake up when the situation calls for it.
014	Hmph. I know you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
015	Oh! Najam, was it? Long time no see. What an unexpected surprise.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0044
016	...
017	I'm extremely grateful to you for giving me a bit of a break last time we met. But this time...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1038
018	Well, let's just say I won't be holding back, should you plan to turn your blade toward Master Ryle.
019	I don't recall giving you a break last time. As I said then, you simply weren't my mark.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
020	Things are different this time, however. I'll do what I must to complete my mission.
021	I see. In that case, I'm afraid I'm going to have to stand in your way, and things might get a bit messy.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0045
022	(I don't get it. Why is he so adamant about protecting that wreck of a guild captain?)
023	(No... That's none of my concern. I have a job to do. Nothing else matters.)
024	From the outside, it seemed rather empty in here. Not many guild members in attendance today. It's good to know that assessment was correct.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
025	Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have to cut through you to get to my mark. Do pardon the intrusion!
026	Lady Najam!
027	Look out! They've got reinforcements!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0003
028	Tch. All these maggots, crawling out of their holes...	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0042
029	Seems like we've got a pest problem indeed.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
030	Master Ryle! You've finally decided to move those lazy bones of yours?
031	What, you think I'd miss this party? You all take care of the riff-raff. I'll handle Najam.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0041
032	So, you do actually get out of bed from time to time.
033	I do what I want. And whatever I need to do to protect my people.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
034	...
035	The Desert Wings are my people. And I'm not about to let anyone walk all over them.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
