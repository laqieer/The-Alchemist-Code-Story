001	What is this power?! It's completely different than the Alchemy I use!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
002	Agh...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0022
003	Dias clutches his right arm as it begins to ache. Once again, it pulsates with an ominous aura.
004	Wh-what's the matter?! Are you all right, Dias?!
005	Don't come!!! It's nothing!
006	B-but...!
007	If you have time to worry about others, then work on your own power!
008	Without power, you cannot change this world!
009	Of course, power is necessary! But...no amount of power stands a chance against the hope of many.
010	Ack! You're able to say that...because of what you were born with.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
011	...What I was born with?
012	You are the true son of Zeke Crowley, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard and hero of Envylia.
013	Compared to you...I'm just an orphan who was discovered during the war.
014	Dias! Why would you say that?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
015	As someone who was born with nothing, I understand the terrifying consequences of what occurs when people give in to lofty ideals!
016	Ultimately, the only thing that can change the world is power! It's time you woke up to that fact!
017	Dias...
018	Tell me Sabareta's location! Where is he...where is Agatha?!
019	I-I can't tell you when you're acting like that!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
020	I see... I guess I'll have to force it out of you, after all.
021	!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
