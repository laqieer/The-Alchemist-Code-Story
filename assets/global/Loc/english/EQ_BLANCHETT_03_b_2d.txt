001	Agh...hahh...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
002	There are still more wolves. Maybe they're near the village? Hah. I'm not gonna let a single one of them survive!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0010
003	Blanchett.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
004	Freed? Are you going to stop me...?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1006
005	Huh, what...? Why...why did you...disappear?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
006	Oh, I'm a Phantom Soldier right now. I made a temporary life made from Alchemy.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
007	Your strong desire to live is what summoned me.
008	Well, I also had a bit of a hand in it as well.
009	You have the book I gave you, right? Actually, that's signed with my blood. It's enough to trigger my transmutation.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
010	Huh? But that's strange. Only people who've died become Phantom Soldiers, right? Then why you, Freed...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0021
011	I told you before, I'm an academic. If I stood up to a Blue Flame Wolf, of course it would end up like this.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
012	You went out of your way to be the victim of my blade?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
013	Yes. Unfortunately, I'm no match for you. That being said, the Blue Flame Wolf isn't soft enough to respond to enemy persuasion...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
014	Captain Zeke!
015	What's the matter?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0006
016	There are no signs of children in the cart. Just soldier equipment...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
017	So I was set up.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
018	We've both suffered the consequences. That being said, I'm going first. There's a child I've kept waiting...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
019	Is this Alchemy...? But, what is going on...?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0027
020	That Blue Flame...Wolf...Blood Wolf! I won't forgive him! I won't! I'll avenge you...!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0013
021	You don't need to do that, Blanchett. In my case, it was pretty much self-inflicted.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0014
022	You don't have to carry that burden.
023	No. No! Are you going to leave me behind again?! Everyone always does. Why...?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0021
024	I'm sorry, Blanchett. I've made you remember sad things.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0035
025	But that's just a memory. For my part, I'm nothing more than one person who you happened to cross paths with in this village.
026	No! No...after all, you taught me how to cut pictures...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
027	I thought revenge was the only thing I had left, but you told me that wasn't true.
028	When I was lonely, you stayed by my side!
029	I'm thankful to you. All this time, I never really felt alive. I was like a balloon floating aimlessly in the air, but...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0033
030	The moment that I decided to protect you, I truly felt like I was alive.
031	You saved me from that never-ending struggle.
032	I don't know what you're talking about! Explain it in a way so that I can understand! You're smart, right?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0020
033	I'm sorry. I think I'm not as good at self-analysis as I thought I was. I'm not sure how to describe this feeling.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0035
034	But, right now, you are crying for me, Blanchett. You saved me because you are that kind of person.
035	That's why, yes, it's selfish, but I want to see you off with a smile.
036	There's no way I can do that...I really want to cry right now!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0019
037	I see. I see. Oh, one last thing for your studies...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
038	No way... Freed? Freed?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0021
039	That is the extent of my memories of the night that I spent with Freed.
040	I have a purpose for living. There are people that I want to take revenge on while I'm alive, but...
041	Even now, sometimes I dream about that night.
042	Heh. This is a masterpiece! I call it the Pyramid Animal Orchestra!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0010
043	Wow! That's amazing! I might've seen this shape in a picture book before!	VO_ayllu.ayllu_sys_0024
044	Right? I've reproduced it! I'm pretty talented, if I may so myself.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1004
045	Your picture cuttings look like magic!	VO_ayllu.ayllu_sys_0046
046	... ...
047	What's the matter?	VO_ayllu.ayllu_sys_0002
048	Oh, nothing. I just remembered, a long time ago, someone I met in an orphanage said the same thing.
049	Oh really? I'm kind of interested in that person.	VO_ayllu.ayllu_sys_0027
050	She's doing fine. After the war ended...a lot of things changed though.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
051	Still, as long as you can stay alive, everything kind of works itself out.
052	Hmm. Your hometown was Wratharis, wasn't it, Blanc? I wish you would take me on a tour!
053	Sure thing! My recommendation is the National Library! It's the miraculous building that didn't burn down during the war. Also...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0038
054	It's where the man who saved my life used to work.
