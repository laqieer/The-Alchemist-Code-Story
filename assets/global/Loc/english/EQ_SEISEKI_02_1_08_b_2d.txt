001	...Die.
002	Hyaaah!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0001
003	My special move... Miracle Kanon Splash!	VO_kanon.kanon_skill_0001
004	All right, that's all of them.
005	How about it, Mizuchi? Do you still think I—sorry, we—are incompetent?
006	... ...
007	...N-no, I don't! I'm sorry!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0026
008	Tee hee hee! As long as you understand!	VO_kanon.kanon_chara_0010
009	Look at you, getting all cocky again, airhead!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
010	Hush! You're ruining my groove!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
011	What groove? I'm sure it was just a coincidence.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
012	No, it wasn't. Kanon's sword skill has increased since we've come here.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
013	What?! Kudan, you're complimenting Kanon?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0025
014	Well done, Captain Kudan! You've got an eye for these things!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0023
015	Well, true...you do seem stronger than during training, but...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
016	The three of you are all really strong! I'm sure you'll be able to beat him!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0008
017	Tee hee hee! Of course! When I protect my friends, my sword becomes 100 times stronger!	VO_kanon.kanon_chara_0010
018	Heh. You might be right.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
019	Kudan, are you acknowledging Kanon's skill? You must have hit your head in that battle just now.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
020	What are you saying? Let's hurry on ahead!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
021	Aye, Captain!
022	Oh, everyone...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0027
023	Huh...?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
024	Chihaya! I'm so relieved you're safe!
025	Please, run as far as you can from here! Don't worry about me!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0042
026	Wh-what do you mean?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
