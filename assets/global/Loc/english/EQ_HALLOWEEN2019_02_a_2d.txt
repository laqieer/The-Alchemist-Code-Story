001	Numu...
002	Rattys who love Halloween... I had heard about them from Magnus, but seeing them in person is something else entirely.
003	Looks like they've calmed down. Okay, little guys, let's hear what you have to say.
004	Numyua, numu, numu, numyua! Numumu, numyua, numu!
005	I see...
006	Numu! Numyua, numu, numu, numyua, numunuma, numunyu... Numyua!
007	Okay, so... This is what they've got to say. "Seeing the dark-red jack-o'-lanterns decorating the town fills our hearts with sorrow."
008	Halloween should be celebrated with orange and black. Replacing orange with red is a travesty, sacrilege, and absolutely outrageous, squeak! We are resolutely against this change, squeak!
009	Numu!
010	The creature is nodding in agreement... How marvelous this translation magic of yours is.
011	It is indeed incredible, but this isn't the time to be talking about that!
012	Oh, no... It's true! All of the lanterns in town are red now. I can see them from here! Just look at them all...
013	Rosa! When did you do all this?!
014	Huh? Wasn't me.
015	I've been with you this entire time, haven't I? You should know better than anyone that I couldn't have done it.
016	Right... Of course. Then...
017	Someone else must've thought red-and-black jack-o'-lanterns were a good idea. It's not just me!
018	(How can that be? Who else would have such an unorthodox preference?)
019	Hm...
020	In any case, red-and-black jack-o'-lanterns are, indeed, sacrilegious. I will change them back to their rightful colors immediately!
021	I'll go with you. You're gonna need some help.
022	My, my. It's turning out to be a rather turbulent Halloween after all...
023	Heeheehee...
024	...
025	I cannot believe this! How many of them can there possibly be?!
026	Every single one of them is red and black now. This has gotta be the work of more than one person, right?
027	Unless...! You don't think she has allies?
028	Ooh, look! The Halloween decorations are going up! The flowers from last year were really pretty.
029	They're using some weird jack-o'-lanterns this year. I like the normal ones better.
030	Of course you do! Jack-o'-lanterns ought to be orange and black, yes?
031	Are you the ones doing the decorating?
032	Yep, sure are. We're going to do our best to make this year's Halloween even more fun for you guys than last year's!
033	More fun, huh...
034	Hm? What's with the long face, little one?
035	Well, Mom said I have to go to bed early today. But it's Halloween! This sucks.
036	It's 'cause all the grown-ups are gonna have a party tonight! Why can't we join in? I tried asking, but...
037	I just got told that kids shouldn't be up so late. Well, what I wanna know is why's it okay for them and not us, huh?!
038	W-well...
039	Huh?
040	(I was intending to tell them that they ought to be in bed by nine o'clock, but...)
041	(They do have a point.)
042	I...
043	Heehee... Finally gave them the slip!
044	Like I said, they don't need to worry about it anymore...because it's already done! The preparations are complete. Behold!
045	Ooohh! It's so beautiful! Dark red and jet black, combined in perfect harmony! Truly, this is a masterpiece of the hallowed hues of red and black!
046	I couldn't have done it without Elizabeth's recipe. This is the ideal color for my tincture! All that's left is to check the effects...
047	It's not poisonous or anything. Probably. Nothing wrong with experimenting a little now and then. Besides, I made sure it tastes nice and sweet.
048	Mrngh?
049	You should be proud to have served me, the supreme Lady Rosa, the pure-white angel who spreads her wings in pitch-black darkness.
050	Phew... At last, we have corrected all of the jack-o'-lanterns.
051	Looks like it. I guess all that's left is to hand the treats out to the children.
052	This is terrible! It's a m-m-monster!
053	What?!
054	Urgaahhh!
