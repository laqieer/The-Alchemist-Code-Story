001	Now, I understand that you wanted to present your sweethearts with this egg in order to make up for your most recent spat...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
002	That is commendable of you. However, do you really think it would be happily received, knowing that you had gotten into a fist-fight to possess it?
003	No...
004	I'm glad that we are in agreement. Now, enjoy yourselves peacefully, please!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
005	All right, now that that has been taken care of... Neica? Is something the matter?
006	I-is this really okay?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
007	I got to watch Teona's battle prowess firsthand, from right up close...and I didn't even have to buy a ticket or anything.
008	Easter...is my new favorite holiday!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0046
009	Her graceful, limber movements! The way her muscles tighten under her skin! She is nothing less than art in motion!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0009
010	Neica, please! C-calm yourself this instant!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0026
011	Obviously, you must've trained a lot—right, Teona?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0008
012	O-oh, w-well... Yes, I suppose I did. I had to train doubly hard so that I could surpass my elder brother.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0047
013	Your brother...? Oh! He appeared in the Gladiator Collection, right?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0024
014	Hmhmhm. I am impressed and humbled by the depth of your knowledge.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
015	My brother was tremendously strong, but strength was not all that he possessed; he also fought in a style that bewitched his opponents.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
016	For when my brother swung his sword, everyone would prostrate themselves at his feet. When victory was his, smiles would break out all around him, on both sides of the battlefield.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
017	He had everyone under his spell.
018	I wish only to follow in his footsteps, by bringing joy to those around me and enchanting them with my talents on the battlefield. So I have trained and trained, giving every single session my all.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
019	As such, I hope you know that your words just now meant an awful lot to me, Neica. I thank you.
020	T-Teona...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
021	Um... Teona? Don't you ever get scared, when you have to stand in front of people like that?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
022	Hmm... I suppose I have felt afraid at one time or another. I would hate to disappoint people.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
023	When I feel that way, however, I remind myself of what I want to protect: the hopes and dreams of the people, and their smiles. Suddenly, I find myself filled to bursting with courage!
024	Wow... Teona, you're really amazing.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0007
025	Hmhmhm. I appreciate that, Neica. But I hope you realize that you yourself are rather extraordinary.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
026	Huh?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
027	Earlier you called this egg "regular," but it is nothing of the sort.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
028	There is nothing "regular" about an egg so sweet that it can make grown men forget themselves enough to get into a fight over it.
029	I-I guess you have a point, but...I really don't think I can do this.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
060	J-just go home already! I might have a thing for warriors from the Colosseum, but I haven't the slightest interest in real fights of any kind!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0013
061	Why're you being so stubborn, eh?! Don't hide your Neica Powers from the world! The whole country is missing out!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0013
062	Having you around gives the troops of our great nation a boost to morale! We're counting on you for that, you hear?!
063	C-counting on me...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
064	We came out of that skirmish victorious, but I don't really feel like a winner.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0030
065	I thought it'd be an easy victory, 'cause of all the Neica Power going around, but...
066	Everybody was making a big deal out of it—Neica Power this, Neica Power that... But it seems like it's just a bunch of cowardly codswallop for that girl to protect herself with.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
067	(Wh-what?! How can they say such terrible things?! They drag me out of my own home, only to treat me like this?!)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0013
068	(Haven't I done enough?! What more can they ask of me?!)
069	...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
070	I did my best, even though I was scared.
071	There's no way I could have lived up to their expectations.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0017
072	...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
030	Hmm... It seems that standing on center stage is too much for you, Neica.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
031	Ungh... Y-yes. It's just not me! I've never felt like it did any good, anyway...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0004
032	You've been placed in a bit of a difficult situation, haven't you? Well, I believe that the final decision is yours and yours alone. It's up to you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
033	I will say, however, that there are many people who would be thrilled to see you show your face at the festival today. I hope that you will keep that in mind when you make your decision.
034	Okay...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0004
035	I wonder what kind of look the person playing Neica will go for this year?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0003
036	Right?! The costumes are always so on point! I can't wait to watch her enchant the Imperial Easter Egg!
037	Hey... Doesn't the egg look kinda different this year, though? It's not as, like...sparkly.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0031
038	I guess so? Ooh! Maybe it's part of the show!
039	Well... We had better get back to searching for that egg.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
040	Whatever you decide can wait until after the egg has been safely restored.
041	R-right.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
042	(If I run away from this just because I'm afraid of getting up there in front of everyone... They'll all be so disappointed. They'll be sad.)
043	(B-but I... I still don't think I can do it.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
044	Where could that egg be?
045	Hey! Teona! Neica!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0005
046	What's the matter?! I...don't suppose you found the egg?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
047	Not yet...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0018
048	A couple of people have started noticing something off about the impostor egg up there, so things aren't looking very good!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0031
049	So you're not having much luck either.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
050	We've also caught wind of some suspicious people wearing masks who are going around looking for the person who's playing Neica this year.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0003
051	Huh...?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
052	You! You're the one who's going to enchant that egg this year, aren't yah?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
053	People just like that!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
054	Thank you, Lotiyah. I had surmised as much. So... What can we do for you?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
055	We can do this the easy way, or the hard way, but regardless, she's coming with us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
056	So I don't get a choice?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
057	You're going to use your powers to enchant the Imperial Easter Egg for us! Once it is complete, our noble ambitions will be realized at long last!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
058	Wh-what on earth are you talking about?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0013
059	Don't worry, we'll deal with this lot!	VO_pamera.pamera_battle_0015
