001	Nearly there—we're almost at the meeting spot. The Desert Wings we're meant to be guarding are waiting for us. We've got to push on.	VO_budd.budd_chara_1005
002	Yes, Captain! Although... With all due respect, it is quite unusual for us to be undertaking a mission for a foreign nation.
003	Unusual? Maybe. But that doesn't change the fact that these people need our help. In that respect, it's no different from any other mission.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
004	In fact, in some ways, it's an especially important one. We'll have to make sure we don't offend our charges, since they're being treated as guests of our nation.
005	Of course, Captain. I will mind my manners. I am honored to be trusted with this mission which will provide me with valuable experience. I'll be sure to be attentive and learn all I can.
006	Good. The Desert Wings' guildmaster is supposed to be pretty talented. I'm sure there's a lot I can learn from him as well.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
007	(Good thing, too. I've been doing a pretty poor job of leading everyone.)	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
008	(I've got to work harder. I'm the captain! I'm meant to be helping everyone else put their skills to good use, not—)
009	Huh?! What's going on over there?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
010	Hmph. You lot again? Tut-tut. You've been reckless lately—and loud. I haven't been able to take my afternoon naps in peace.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
011	Wh-whoa! Wh-where the hell did all of you come from?!
012	We are the Blue Flame Guard! I am Captain Bud Crowley! Are you all right, citizens?
013	Oh, yes. We're fine. My name is Ryle. I am the guildmaster of the Desert Wings.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
014	Y-you're...!
015	The ones you're meant to be escorting, yes. I apologize if this seems sudden, but do you think you could eliminate these cretins for us?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
016	Right. Leave it to us! We'll take things from here. Blue Flames, follow my lead!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0038
017	Yes, Captain!
018	Hm...
019	Leave the fighting to the Blue Flame Guard. Just focus on protecting the caravan and our cargo.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
020	(Huh? What's he doing hiding in his caravan at a time like this?!)	VO_budd.budd_sys_0016
021	Come on! Time to send these bandits packing!
