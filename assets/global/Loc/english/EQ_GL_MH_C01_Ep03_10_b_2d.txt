001	Ugh... this is insane! Just you wait... the Holy Guard will hear of this!
002	No! We can't let him escape!
003	Leave him be. We've busted his operation through and through. He probably won't be setting foot in Slothstein's underworld ever again.
004	What about the Holy Guard? If word gets out that Soren was using Alchemy...
005	As if that guy could go to the police in his state! You worry too much, Sieg.
006	Now that that's all settled, how about a nice warm bath and dinner at the tavern? It'll be my treat!
007	You were staying here all along, huh? So that’s how you ran into Soren.
008	T'was a lucky coincidence. I'm just glad it all worked out for the children, too.
009	You mentioned you were here for leads, right? That kidnapping ring has been on my radar for a while.
010	We've busted them thanks to you and Soren, but as for their employer, I'm afraid we haven't been able to find out anything. Elusive bunch...
011	I'm thinking, though... since Soren can wield Alchemy, maybe it would be best if we asked for her help.
012	You're not thinking of Teach, are you?
013	Oh, fancy meeting you here.
014	Shion! Good to see you again. What're you doing here?
015	On a business trip, as usual. I see you've brought the boy along.
016	Yeah. I thought I'd try to find out who hired the raiders back in Sakris Village. Turns out there's a similar kidnapping ring here, too.
017	And who might this be?
018	Ah, yes. Shion is a retainer to a noble house in Wadatsumi. I met her in the village. She really helped me out back there.
019	Shion, this is Roxanne. She's a childhood friend of mine.
020	Pleased to make your acquaintance.
021	...The pleasure is all mine. So you're a retainer, huh. Do they send retainers all over the place to conduct business these days?
022	My lord is interested in all manners of commerce. I merely carry out his will.
023	Does that include "helping" men out?
024	Roxanne, what are you—
025	...I do not claim to know what you're getting at, but if my information is reliable, do you not engage men in your line of work?
026	That's different. Nobody shows up and helps a random man in a village in the middle of nowhere without ulterior motives!
027	Ah, then are you implying you only help others for selfish reasons, like personal interest?
028	Now see here—
029	Have I spoken out of turn? I must apologize. I have other matters to attend to, so... please do excuse me.
030	Until next time, Siegfried. To you as well, Soren... and of course, Miss Roxanne.
031	Honestly, Roxanne, I don't know why you're so worked up.
032	All I'm saying is you should watch your back around women like her! Who knows what she's up to?
033	Yeah, yeah... what are you, my wife? Keeping me on a short leash and all that...
034	NO!
035	Okay, sheesh. You didn't have to shout...
036	(Stupid Sieg... How dense can he get?!)
037	Ugh... I barely escaped with my life. That brat... How did he obtain Alchemy?!
038	Ah! So you came after all.
039	There was an unexpected complication. Brass Rose Roxanne managed to mess up my operation with some Alchemy-wielding kid.
040	Please, you have to help me stay under the radar. After all I've done to fulfill my end of the contract...
041	(The figure gestures to the slight figure beside him.)
042	We do not deny that you have been of great assistance. However, we cannot ignore your duplicity.
043	Some of the children we received were found to have families.
044	That is not what we requested from you.
045	W-well... you just wanted children, right? There are only so many orphans in Slothstein—
046	Hold your tongue and keep your excuses. I do not want to hear from a man who trivializes human lives for monetary gain.
047	Deliver the judgment.
048	As you wish.
049	Wait! What?!
050	Your wicked ways end here.
051	Hrrkk...
