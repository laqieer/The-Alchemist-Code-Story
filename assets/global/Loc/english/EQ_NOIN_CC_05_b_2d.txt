001	Their sacrifices were what kept me alive.
002	I was born as a monster. Traces of scales on my vermillion skin, fangs, and a golden mane...
003	I don't know the details, but they called it a mutation, or ancestral reversion, or simply called me a demon child.
004	I ate through my mother's womb, killed my enraged father, and survived being thrown off a cliff.
005	They were worshiping me in some shrine deep in the mountains by the time I was self aware. They fed me sacrifices.
006	Sacrifices...
007	In Wadatsumi, they believe demons and humans formed a truce between themselves long ago. It is said their blood gradually combined.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
008	So, every now and then, a demon child is born.
009	Humans always ostracize those who look different, whether they be demons or beasts.
010	Heh.
011	They kept feeding me sacrifices in this commune full of such people.
012	Devour one human life, and you take another step away from humanity.
013	That's what was taught there. The more I ate those sacrifices, the more I felt my conscience getting chipped away.
014	Those bastards must have been planning on forging me into a true demon and exacting revenge on the rest of the world.
015	Heheh. Bet you can tell I never made any friends.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
016	Well, I don't think you really had a chance to make any... So yeah, I don't think you have any friends.	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
017	Even then, I had one friend I got to play with.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
018	A therian slave that got both his eyes gouged out and his fangs pulled by the all-mighty humans.
019	What...?!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
020	He never feared me because he never knew what I looked like. He liked me, and that didn't feel bad at all.
021	I used to slip out of the shrine to meet him down by the village at the base of the mountain. We built a secret hideout together.
022	I was such a hopeless little demon back then.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
023	The next full moon, the sacrifice presented was that therian kid.
024	...
025	That kid was a helpless one, too. He never knew that the monster on the altar was me.
026	He smiled and prayed to me, "O' great demon lord, take my flesh and bring retribution upon the humans."
027	Devour one therian life, and you take a beastly leap away from humanity.
028	The eyes of the cultists that curried my favor, the scarred eye-lids of that helpless kid, and his shivering lips...
029	I really was such a hopeless little demon back then.
030	I wouldn't judge you if you ran away.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
031	I beat them all to death. The bastards that worshipped me, and the apathetic villagers. All of them.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
032	You, what?!
033	I told myself I wasn't wrong for doing so, but I knew it wasn't right.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
034	That's when I swore to follow the rules I set for myself.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0018
035	I've always been scared.
036	I like you, Dead Nine.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
037	You're creeping me out.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0027
038	You say power is everything, but you're not willing to throw everything else away, are you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
039	Nng!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
040	(He's strong!)
041	I love the way you are now. Rational, with your own set of rules to restrain yourself.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
042	You don't know anything about me!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0012
043	I do know I need your strength, but I don't know how to get you to work for me. What should I do?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
044	You're a philosopher, aren't ya? Think on it yourself!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0013
045	What's the matter? Don't tell me the other dimension's power was all talk!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
046	Haha! I'm just not used to it yet.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
047	Show me what you got!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0016
048	Nnrk...!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
049	M-my powers won't coalesce? What the—?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
050	(Is this the discomfort I felt while in Veda?! But it's on a totally different scale!)	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
051	Look at you. Can't even control your own power.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
052	That's right. That's why I need some sort of commandment.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
053	Commandment...?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
054	Something that can bind powers together. Something that can hold a body that's coming apart.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
055	A strong commandment that can discipline my weak self!
056	Aghh!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
057	Pathetic.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
058	Urgh... Gah!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
059	This is a terrible fight.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0035
060	Hm...?!
061	Oh...
062	Rat-Killer?! Where have you been?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
063	I'm not "Rat-Killer" anymore.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0021
064	What are you saying?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0027
065	I'm now a member of the Veda Templars.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0010
066	Call me Zwei.
067	What?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
068	Lost Blue is a place where outlaws deceive and get deceived for the sake of their own ambitions and greed.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
069	We'll need true solidarity to climb Veda. You already know betrayal will only bring more betrayals.
070	Yeah. Ain't that the truth.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
071	Dead Nine...
072	If I am to reach the top, I will need a powerful commandment.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
073	I'll need to keep things simple. Ten members in the group should be enough.
074	We'll take on dirty jobs while we train. We'll take the Sacred Stones for ourselves to turn this world on its head.
075	We'll engrave and carry commandments on our backs.
076	We'll be the Veda Templars!
077	I will lead them, and I will bring the sky to this world. I will drag the weak-willed, apathetic scum into the light!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
078	My name... Is Sol.
079	Sol?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
080	I will be the Sun that Lost Blue needs.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
081	I can't afford to be nihilistic anymore.
