001	Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.
002	Kazahaya! He's back!
003	You were right, mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_chara_1010
004	It appears that Greed Dike's main troops plan to reach us by going through the Saga region!
005	Saga! That must mean they went after the Matter first!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
006	It appears that Captain Othima has headed towards Saga.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
007	Captain Yauras and Captain Seida are already heading there as well. Saga may very well become the setting for this crucial battle!
008	...!
009	More importantly, there's one more thing I must warn you about!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_1018
010	Captain Othima told me this was the utmost priority.
011	The utmost priority...? What is it?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
012	There is a possibility that the Lion Monarch Orion is a Vessel of Reincarnation.
013	A Vessel of...Reincarnation?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
014	My apologies. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0022
015	Having heard the rumors surrounding Orion from Basheeny...Captain Othima told me to tell you this.
016	Rumors...?
017	The rumors surrounding Greed Dike's Sacred Stone.
018	According to Basheeny...the Lion Monarch Orion might have Greed Dike's Sacred Stone embedded within his body.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
019	Within his body...?! Does that mean...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
020	...Sorry, Suzuka! I'm gonna step out for a moment!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
021	Mistress...?! Where are you going?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
022	To the office! I'll come back right away!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
023	The Sacred Stone is embedded within his body! Captain Othima...is Orion to become the Vessel of Reincarnation?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
024	Saga region. Fire Temple.
025	Agh...!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0043
026	It appears the people around here belong to a battle tribe. There seems to be a considerable difference according to each faction.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
027	Unfortunately...your esteemed fighting power doesn't work on me.
028	After all, when it comes to brute force, I am well acquainted with one of the most powerful fighters in all of the continent.
029	Having been trained daily by this individual, your attacks do little damage to me.
030	...Ug...ghh...!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
031	You're the leader of this faction, aren't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
032	If you obey my instructions and give me your Matter, I'll back down quietly, you know?
033	Ack...! D-don't make me laugh! I will never submit to...scum like...you...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0016
034	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
035	Huh...?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
036	Oh, dear. Once again, because of your stubbornness, countless lives have vanished in an instance.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
037	Y-you...!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
038	That Tehre...he was smart. In order to protect his tribe, he submitted and gave me his Matter.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
039	Sh-shut up! W-we will not waver in the face of danger!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0018
040	We of the Fuu faction only look ahead to the future!
041	If I were to give you the Matter, Saga's future would...
042	...How should I best convey this to you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
043	!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
044	The more you resist...the more that future of yours ceases to exist.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
045	Ughhh...!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0043
046	...N-no!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
047	I'll give you one last chance. Answer me carefully. Your next words will determine the fate of your people.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
048	Ug...ghh...!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
049	Do your people want to live...or do they want to be blown to oblivion? Which is it?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
050	Stop!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0028
051	Ughh...! Arghh!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
052	...!
053	You're certain...Tehre is alive?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
054	How many times do I have to tell you? Are you finally going to follow his wise example?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
055	Agh... This is...for the sake of protecting my people...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
056	That was a handful, but now I've got two of them.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
057	Prepare yourself! May our god rain fury down on you!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0018
058	A god...?
059	Is this god...stronger than me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
060	!!!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
061	Come on...let's go, redhead.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
062	...Ack...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
063	Fuu! Are you going to let him go?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
064	Destruction of the Matter is our final option. We must avoid it until we have no other choice.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
065	But...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
066	That wind warrior...she told us there was a way to prevent the worst possible outcome.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
067	She said she was willing to sacrifice her life in order to protect the Matter.
068	Are you talking about Captain Seida of the Holy Guard's 3rd Regiment?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
069	Yes... Let's believe her words.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
070	When the worst possible outcome befalls us...we will destroy it with our hands.
071	I'm glad you're okay. What a relief.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
072	I know I'll receive a scolding for saying this, but...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
073	In our current predicament...we have no one to rely on but Asena.
074	Asena will come to protect Saga. I'm sure of it.
075	The Godwolf Asena. Until then...please, protect Beelzebub a little longer.
076	...I will leave now.
