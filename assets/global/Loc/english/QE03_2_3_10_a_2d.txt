001	What is this? It's too strong!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
002	Hahahah! Wonderful. I'm impressed, you king of Vermin. Your hatred feels tangibly different!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0023
003	Agh... At this rate...I can't do anything.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
004	It's not like you to be so weak-kneed.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
005	!!!
006	You're not about to give up, are you?	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
007	Alma...Rebecca!
008	Hmph. You're a tenacious bunch, but what can you do now?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
009	Don't underestimate us. When we get together...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
010	We can even break the curse that binds this country!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
011	...Liz?
012	The truth is...I don't want to fight against that ant.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003

014	Then are you gonna flee with your tail tucked between your legs?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0044
015	I'm not scared. I just...don't want to fight.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
016	Liz...
017	Don't worry. I understand. Sometimes, you just have to fight.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
018	But I don't want there to be hatred between us...I want the ant to understand that as well!
019	Are you gonna try talking to an insect? Seems like the flies are still swarming around in that hollow head of yours!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0012
020	Ssshhh...
021	It's coming!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
