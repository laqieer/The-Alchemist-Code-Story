001	The 11th Lord Commander, Kanon... So she's your friend.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0022
002	Yes, she's the one who saved me from loneliness. My only friend.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0037
003	She kept her promise. She came here to visit me again shortly after.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
004	We talked so much that I can't even remember all that we talked about.
005	For someone like me, who didn't know anything but that cramped space... Kanon's stories opened up the world for a brief moment.
006	Each time, we spoke about everything under the sun while drinking tea. During those times, my loneliness wasn't so noticeable.
007	Thinking back now, it was right after she took over as Lord Commander, so things must have been very difficult for her.
008	Lord Zain had died, and though she had friends to help her along the way, the burden of upholding justice on the continent fell to her.
009	Still, she was always smiling.
010	Her smiles weren't even forced. I could tell. She smiled because she was genuinely enjoying our time together.
011	She taught me what friendship really was...
012	And before I knew it, my loneliness was gone.
013	Her smile filled that emptiness inside me.
014	She's a really important person to you, isn't she?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
015	Yes, very.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0005
016	But we were forced to go our separate ways, quite suddenly.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
017	Lakina, are you okay?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
018	I'm all right! There are just too many...
019	It's just like you said. There definitely is someone out there after you, or Lucifer, rather.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
020	So it's not unrelated to that, then...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
021	Did something happen outside?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_chara_1009
022	The Lion Monarch's Charge.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
023	I'll explain later. First, we need to take care of the enemy before us!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0015
