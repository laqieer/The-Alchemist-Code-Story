001	Whoa! Seems like everyone and their dog is out and about today. And they all look so...happy. The Winter Holiday will do that to you, I guess.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0046
002	But I can't afford to get swept up in all this festive cheer! I'm on duty. The people's lives are depending on me! Let's see... What's everyone else up to?
003	Well, I'm done for the day. I made sure all those presents found their recipients!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
004	Already?! No way!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0026
005	Yup! Icona's a real whizz with the schedule. It would've taken hours longer without her help!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
006	Oh, don't mention it! I was just trying to be efficient.
007	Hey, um...I've been thinking. When we're all finished for the day, why don't we have a party to celebrate the Winter Holiday?	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
008	A party, huh?
009	Sounds good to me. It'll be something to look forward to after a long day of hard work.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
010	I'll have my group start getting things together for the party as soon as we've finished putting up the decorations around town.
011	It's basically tradition by now, isn't it? I hope this year's Winter Holiday party will be just as fun as the last!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
012	Huh. You guys have fun with that.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
013	But I have to ask...what's so special about this Winter Holiday? Everyone in town seems so excited.
014	Well, of course they are! This is a magical time of year!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0037
015	Exactly! It's a time to be spent with friends and loved ones; a time of joy and good cheer. It's special in every way!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0023
016	Oh? You don't say.
017	Loved ones...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
018	Good...cheer?
019	What's that, Ishuna? You're mumbling.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
020	Huh? Oh, uh, I didn't say anything!
021	You'll join us for the Winter Holiday party too, won't you, Icona?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
022	Me? I don't know... It's not really my thing. I was hoping to spend the evening tinkering with this incantation gear I found while on the job.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
023	Oh... That's a shame.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
024	Yeah... How about you, Ishuna?
025	Who, me?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
026	We're reaching out to everyone still on duty. I think Lofia and Michael in Lustburg will be able to make it.
027	And Glanz and Rochelle are in Wratharis, but they should be coming too.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
028	Wait... Glanz and Rochelle are going to be there?
029	Why did you come back? You betrayed us...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
030	You sold the Unicorn Knights out, didn't you?
031	Yes, I think so. How about you? Will you join us? The more, the merrier, as they say.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
032	I, um...
033	Sorry. I didn't mean to strong-arm you into coming. You can say no, if you're not in the mood.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
034	Huh? Oh, no, don't apologize! I don't feel pressured or anything. I appreciate the invite, and...I'll swing by if I can.
035	Glad to hear it. I hope to see you there.
036	But if those two are going, I...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
037	I dunno...
038	Hey. Ishuna.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
039	Y-yeah?
040	You should have been honest with her. What's the point of getting her hopes up if you have no intention of going?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
041	You'll feel bad, and she'll feel let down... Dishonesty is inefficient for both sides.
042	I-it's not like that! I wasn't lying or anything. I just haven't made up my mind yet, that's all!
043	Besides, I do actually want to go. I'm just not sure about the, um...timing.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
044	You don't have to explain yourself to me. I was just telling it as I saw it.
045	Besides, at the end of the day, it's up to you. Whether you choose to go or not is none of my concern.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
046	True enough.
047	(Geez... Icona's a weird one. I'm not sure what to make of her sometimes.)	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
048	Uh, do you hear that? Sounds like something's going on over there...and it doesn't sound good.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
049	Uh-oh... We'd better check it out.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
050	What the heck are you trying to pull?! This isn't what we agreed on!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
051	Hey!
052	What's going on here?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
053	Well, you see...the peddler is delayed, and so our special Winter Holiday baubles have yet to arrive.
054	Ooh, I love those! There's ones with adorable little Rattys with Santa hats on them—some of them even feature the Maruda Tribe! And they sell out crazy fast every year.
055	I mean, no wonder! They're all handmade with love and care, and every little face is unique!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
056	Those are the ones, I'm afraid. I was only able to order in a very small amount to begin with.
057	It's all very strange. This has never happened before! First orders are restricted, and now the items haven't even arrived...
058	The peddler might have been robbed. The rarer the item, the higher the resell price, after all. Were any precautions taken to protect them?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
059	W-well, the peddler employs a band of mercenaries, so I'm sure that's unlikely... But at this rate, it doesn't look like I'll be getting those baubles until tomorrow at the earliest.
060	What?! Are you kidding me?! I reserved a dozen of them! They have to be here today! Today, understand?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0012
061	I promised my kids they'd get a set of those baubles for Christmas!
062	I-I'm terribly sorry, sir, but there's not much I can do.
063	Let's all just take a deep breath and cool our heads for a minute, yeah? Yelling at this shopkeeper isn't going to get you those baubles any faster, sir.	VO_lotia.lotia_chara_1011
064	You think I don't know that?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
065	I know it's not the seller's fault, but...what am I supposed to tell my kids?!
066	Haa... You know what? Fine. It's fine. Good day to you.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
067	He clearly doesn't think it's fine, but off he goes.
068	More importantly, it feels like a shadow has passed over the town, bringing down the mood. When did that happen? It can't all be because of those missing baubles, can it?
069	It could be... I mean, a lot of people were counting on getting those to give as presents for the festive season.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
070	Well... There's only one thing for it.
071	I'm going to try and find that peddler!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
072	Really?!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
073	Why?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
074	I-it's the right thing to do, isn't it? Someone has to! We can't just let that guy storm off and make his kids miserable by being in a grumpy mood all day.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0042
075	They're lucky enough to be able to enjoy this occasion as a family. I want them to have fun.
076	B-besides, I wouldn't want there to be bad blood between him and that seller over something so trivial.
077	I'm quick on my feet, so I bet I can find that peddler and make it back here in good time. I could even deliver the baubles myself, if need be.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
078	It's very kind of you to offer, but...you shouldn't go alone.
079	It's really not your place to do this, you know. For one, it'd mean neglecting your duties as a Phantom Soldier.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
080	I-I know, but...still...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
081	I have to do something.
082	The Winter Holiday only comes around once a year, and...you never know how many of those you'll get in life.
083	I want to give everyone in this town a chance to really enjoy this precious time with their nearest and dearest.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0020
084	Oh, Ishuna... That's so sweet!
085	Huh?
086	If you'll really be all right on your own, then I say go for it! I'll take over your shift patrolling the town until you return, so you won't have to worry about a thing!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0037
087	Really?! Thanks, Lotiyah!
088	A special time, huh?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
089	Achieving endless possibilities for the future, while minimizing the sacrifices required...
090	I've always believed that this should be my creed as a researcher, but maybe it's time I considered some alternatives.
091	Or maybe they'll come to me naturally as I spend time with other people...people like her. Come to think of it, there are a few components for my machines I've yet to salvage...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
