001	Looks like we've managed to lose them. What's the matter? Why've you gone quiet on me?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
002	Was it true?
003	Behind the scenes, did my father use the Sacred Stone Belphegor to dabble in the military industry?
004	Hm? That's a lie my client came up with. Why do you ask?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
005	Actually, Alvarez told me the same thing.
006	He said that, while he was alive, my father had been planning on using the Stone to invade other countries.
007	Don't worry. Your dad wasn't the type of guy to do something like that.	VO_edgar.VO_edgar.
008	There was no lie in his eyes, when he told me that his job as mayor was to think of the future of the children.
009	Really?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
010	A man's way of life is always revealed in his eyes; there's no mistaking it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
011	You've got nothing to worry about.
012	Once we find the Sacred Stone Belphegor, we should know what your father was thinking when he was alive.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	I promise you I'll find it.
014	So, you're searching for the Belphegor after all?!
015	To be honest...
016	I'm more interested in discovering its location than the Sacred Stone itself.
017	After all, I made a promise to one tough old man.
018	My father...
019	I'm a little late, but I came to fulfill my promise to your dad.
020	You want to discover his true intentions...
021	I want to fulfill an old promise. Let's do everything we can to find that Sacred Stone, okay?
022	Yes!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
023	Well then, now that's decided, how about we get something to eat. The cheese dog sold at that shop is supposed to be famous in this city. Hold on a second.
024	He's not a bad person...I'm certain of it.
025	Allie, don't you think that if we stick with him we can find out what father's true intentions were?
026	Well, I don't know about—ekekek!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0011
027	Allie! Wh-who are you people...mghhh!!!
028	Look how delicious they look, little lady. No wonder they're famous. Huh? Where'd she go?
029	Ekekek...Fi-Fiona was abducted, aye! We gotta go save...ekeke!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0012
030	What?! Tsk... Was it the Beckrams?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
