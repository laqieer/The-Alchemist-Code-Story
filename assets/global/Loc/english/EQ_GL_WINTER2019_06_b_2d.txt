001	Good job Eira! Whatever you are doing is calming the monsters down!
002	...Yes!
003	...help...Blair!
004	You all stay here where it's safe! We'll see what we can do to help stop that avalanche!
005	You three be careful now you hear? We won't lose to no natural disaster!
006	Ugh!
007	Blair! We're here, is everything okay?
008	The machines don't have enough power to divert the avalanche completely.
009	The village will be swallowed whole at this rate.
010	Foxes....can help!
011	Yeah... Yeah that might be just enough to save us!
012	Then there is no time to lose! Eira, you ready?
013	3... 2... 1...
014	It worked! Huzzah!
015	Villagers...safe...
016	...zzz...
017	She's fast asleep, that must've taken a considerable amount of Alchemy.
018	Great job you two. Eira, you deserve a good rest.
019	Let's get back to the village to tell them the good news.
020	You all did it! You saved the village!
021	We couldn't have done it without Eira, she soothed the monsters...
022	...and she helped stop the avalanche!
023	We're sorry that we gave you the cold shoulder these past few days Eira.
024	Heheh, this village could always use a new addition to the family.
025	!!!
026	Thank!
027	Well it looks like you're in good hands now Eira.
028	Looks like it all worked out fine!
029	And thus, a new mutual understanding is forged between Eira and the villagers.
030	Soren bids goodbye to his newfound friends, and begins his journey back home.
031	Happy Winter Holiday!
