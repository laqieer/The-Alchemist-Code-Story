001	You're one of Aedith's assassins. It's good to look for an advantage, though you're lacking focus.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
002	You should've taken the shot before raising your voice just now.
003	Well, yes…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0044
004	But for you to escape again would be more troublesome.
005	Being basically a decoy… Not a bad idea.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
006	But I've seen a situation like that gone badly with my own eyes recently.
007	Instead of fooling around, why not come at me?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0001
008	Being weird and serious are not mutually exclusive.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
009	Rather, it's the people who seriously act stupid that you should be worried about.
010	Not fond of people who look down on others…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0039
011	That's not at all how I meant it, but you're saying that I'm above you?
012	Hmph!	VO_karne.karne_battle_0019
013	And this is how you take a shot.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
014	No way… That was faster than a bullet…	VO_karne.karne_battle_0022
015	I was just predicting your moves. You should learn about feints.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
016	Though, there won't be a next time.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
017	Ugh…
018	Lord Aedith?
019	This is the first time I've seen you become a shield for someone else.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
020	So what if I did...?
021	Ae…dith…? Oh no, there's blood!	VO_karne.karne_battle_0019
022	Don't worry, my angel. It's just a scratch!
023	I missed your vital points. But Aedith, you've weakened.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
024	I'm just not in the best of shape now… Dammit.
025	You're willing to let that slide?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
026	You're seriously asking me that?
027	Let go, Aedith! I'm not just some pawn!	VO_karne.karne_sys_0019
028	…
029	Huh…	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
030	I don't know what you were going on about, but I'll just say that this isn't like you.
031	So, who's the next opponent?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
032	Eeek!
033	What is this…? Just randomly shooting bullets?
034	Right. Shooting that way is just a disturbance.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0006
035	?!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0022
036	Well, that's what I wanted, actually.
037	Matia…?!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
038	Hey, stay where you are.
039	Yishai Ignacio…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0042
040	Ah, I've finally caught up with you. I got information from Shahel, who was "dispatched" to this layer.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
041	Schmeier. One of the seven Draconic Pillars. Would you come along quietly?
042	…
043	(Matia…)	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
044	…
045	(She's still breathing, but she's unconscious.)	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0029
046	(And as for me, I can't even turn into a dragon because of my injuries.)
047	Ultimately, I'm in a desperate situation.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0020
048	I'm glad you understand. Let's head back to the Pride Layer.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0007
049	Wait a minute… Why?
050	Aedith?
051	Hm? Are you the ruler of this layer? I apologize that my Shahel made some unreasonable demands.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
052	Even if it's just to buy some time by killing a dragon in human form, there's a way to say it.
053	What will happen to the layer's autonomy?
054	The territory of the Seven Sins used to be the land of dragons.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
055	No matter how many cities are built, no matter how much prosperity is gained...humans are still guilty.
056	It's not a bad idea to wipe all of them out, don't you think?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0023
057	Damn you…!
058	Hrgh! Ghaah…
059	! There was no reason to shoot him!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_battle_0019
060	No reason was necessary.	VO_esai.esai_battle_0016
061	Hrgh! Ugh…
062	Hmm, interesting…	VO_esai.esai_sys_0044
063	Aaaaahhhhh!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0032
064	…You're going to forcibly take Magil from this burial ground to heal yourself?	VO_esai.esai_battle_0022
065	Esai…!
066	You're too evil to even be human...!	VO_schmeier_transform.schmeier_transform_battle_0028_b
067	You can't transform...? No matter…
068	Everyone, the opponents who are preparing for battle are the seven dragons. Watch out or they'll take you down quickly!	VO_esai.esai_sys_0002
