001	Bubbles flutter in the wind--carried away until they disappear.
002	This is nice, isn't it? This scenery.
003	Sis, why'd you decide to join me today?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
004	I dunno. I guess sometimes it's good to make sure.
005	Make sure of what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
006	Of where we belong.
007	I had a dream--first time in a while.
008	People do their best in life, don't they?
009	That doesn't sound like something an assassin would say, sis.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
010	Killing makes it that much clearer--the hopes and dreams people carry all come flashing through right before they die. And I take them all away.
011	What's gotten into you? Is your stomach upset?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
012	Hmm, I'm pretty sure we ate the same thing, Renny.
013	You're being serious right now?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
014	Dead serious. Why do we carry these swords?
015	To kill, obviously.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
016	Right. To kill. I want to believe there's more to it than that…
017	You sure you didn't eat something weird?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
018	I can't remember what my sister said after that. All I know is that, even now, my sword only exists to take lives.
019	So, this is where you've been!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0001
020	Chloe? Yeah, I have a soft spot for this place. Did you need something?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
021	The Scarlet Flame Guard is conducting some drills, so I wanted you to join us.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
022	What about Captain Vettel and Vice-Captain Gerald?
023	They're having an audience with the king.
024	Oh? Even Gerald?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
025	Uh-huh. He wasn't too happy, but he is the vice-captain after all, so…
026	Hmmm...
027	We don't know when war will break out, but at least for now there's peace.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
028	(Times of peace are favored by those who work in the shadows.)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
029	(I wonder if I'll have a chance to spar with Captain Vettel if war breaks out…)
030	Can I kill or can't I? That's my only criterion.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
031	I'm not really interested in fighting those weaker than I am.
032	Something on your mind?
033	No offense, Chloe, but I can't tell you.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
034	Aw… Well, never mind that, I'd like for you to participate in today's drills.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
035	Is that an order?
036	Not exactly… It's just that it's a joint activity, so it'd be nice if you came along.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
037	Hmm…Then, I think I'll pass!
038	*Sigh* If Captain Vettel and Vice-Captain Gerald aren't around, you really won't join us, will you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
039	They make things interesting.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
040	Hmph... That's all you ever say…
041	It's the truth.
042	I'll be back later to try to convince you. I hope you'll consider joining us!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
043	Yeah. Yeah. Sure thing...
044	*Sigh*… So that's what "doing your best" looks like--completely opposite from my sister. It's hard to even compare…	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
045	Someday, I'll die at the hands of an opponent stronger than me.
046	It's only fair--especially for a killer like me. All debts must be paid eventually.
047	Then, I'll return to the place where I truly belong. In the meantime, I'll use lies to divert myself and float along like a bubble.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
048	Now then…there was a reason I came here.
049	…Do you need something?
050	You must be new to this. Your reaction was too fast.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
051	…What do you mean? I'm just a simple--
052	Oof…
053	Assassins can't fool one of their own. I'm sure you suspected me, too...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
054	But you overreacted. I almost don't want to kill you if it's going to be this easy.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
055	But Vettel's mine. I can't have you killing him before me.
056	Fluttering bubbles--floating aimlessly until they disappear.
057	What on earth!? Oh, no! What happened to him!?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
058	Looks like you caught me.
059	I heard a scream…
060	An assassin was trying to sneak in, so I took care of him.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
061	You don't believe me, do you?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
062	I don't know why you did what you did, but I'm not the one to judge you.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
063	Does that mean you're going to turn me in?
064	Is that what you want?
065	No, I just don't want to be kicked out quite yet…	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
066	…Alright, leave all this to me--the burial rites and the report. Just...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0006
067	Please join the Scarlet Flame Guard drills!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
068	I'm sure Vice-Captain Gerald will sneak away from his meeting and join us. You'd like that, right? I promise!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
069	Seriously?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
