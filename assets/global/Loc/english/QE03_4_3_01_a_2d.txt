001	It's easy when it's just you, Liz. I'm impressed that Alma managed to carry the both of us.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
002	I agree. We can't let Alma's effort go to waste!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
003	In that case, we need to get through this place, Liz.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
004	Agreed.
005	So, you've come this far, Lisbeth!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
006	We finally caught up with you, Your Majesty!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0019
007	I'm impressed that you flew up all the way here on your own. Still, it's unfortunate...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
008	What are you trying to say?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0005
009	If you'd also worked together with someone, you may have been able to reach Asmodeus...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
010	I? The queen? Work together with someone?! What nonsense...the queen must always be above all others!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0026
