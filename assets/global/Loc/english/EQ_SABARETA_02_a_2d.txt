001	Sorry for the delay.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0003
002	You're late. How long do you think we've been waiting?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0017
003	Welcome, General Vlad, leader of the Liberation Army.
004	Don't call us the Liberation Army. We remain the proud and honorable Knights of the Royal Order.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
005	My apologies. What happened to Count Maldini? Has he not come yet?
006	He died, at the hands of a "hound hunt."
007	Tsk. Envylia...	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0013
008	Informant, who is this arrogant fellow?	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0001
009	He's Sabareta, leader of the Lizard Brigade.
010	Lizard Brigade. I've heard rumors. They're a rogue group that is only brigade in name.
011	That is true for now. However, if you lend us your strength, we'll no longer just be a band of rogues.
012	My strength? Save the niceties, tell me what you want.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0010
013	You are none other than General Vlad the Thunderer. I want to borrow your strength that is renowned throughout the continent.
014	Let's join forces. The time has finally come for us to stand up together and resurrect Wratharis.
015	Join forces? You want me, a proud knight of the Royal Order, to join your band of rogues?
016	Hmph. Don't make me laugh.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0010
017	Listen, boy. Don't underestimate real warfare. Sending an untrained militia into battle will only result in more deaths.
018	True, but what if that militia was made of soldiers who would never die?
019	What?
020	Philosopher's Stones. With these, we can wield Alchemy.
021	Do you understand, General? Soldiers that have been transmuted using Alchemy can never die.
022	Soldiers transmuted using Alchemy?
023	Ridiculous. Did you bring us all the way here for such an absurd story?
024	I don't know where you came up with this, but Alchemy is a Forbidden Art.
025	Even the royal family of Wratharis kept Alchemy a secret. There's no way a youngster like you could wield it.
026	Make up your mind after you've seen it with your own eyes.
027	What kind of idiocy...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0010
028	Hurrah!!!
029	... ...
030	That's quite a skillful deception.
031	However, it's ridiculous to call such magic tricks Alchemy.
032	Just because you made one scrawny wench appear—
033	Who are you calling scrawny wench?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0010
034	I am Lady Lamia of the Royal First Order, known as the Coquelicot Lancer. I am a proud and honorable knight. Know your place.
035	Y-you insolent...! Do you mock the Royal Order by falsely taking on the name of Lady Lamia?!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0013
036	Lamia the Coquelicot is a hero of Wratharis who protected Wratharis during the Thousand Nights against Gluttony Foss.
037	A wench like you has no claim to the name of Lamia—
038	The Thousand Nights. Actually, it was 1,065 nights to be exact.
039	?!
040	Ah, the memories. That war dragged on so long that a silence eventually fell over the entire country. It was like dusk even when the sun was high.
041	... ...
042	Pardon me, but it appears you were the one who was insolent, General. Has your faith in me increased now?
043	No...it can't be!
044	Ge-General! Soldiers of Envylia are pursuing Count Maldini's remaining troops.
045	What?!
046	Perfect. Why don't you judge yourself whether this is all a deception or not!
