001	Siegfried and the party travelled to a small town near Greed Dike in search of more abandoned Alchemia research facilities.
002	Deep within a concealed laboratory, they confronted the mastermind Zheng Yi, a nobleman, and his head guard Asuka.
003	In the heat of battle, a Core called Atropos, Alchemically enhanced Asuka and attempted to apprehend the party.
004	The combined efforts of Minerva and Soren managed to temporarily disrupt and disable the Core,
005	but it resulted in a massive explosion that shook the laboratory.
006	Ugh...mmrgh...
007	Ow, my head...
008	(I was able to hit the Core with Minerva's help...)
009	(Then there was a huge explosion, and I think I passed out.)
010	What was that vision all about?
011	If I was involved in the making of the Constructs in my past...then...
012	Does it mean that I... worked here?
013	Soren! Teach!
014	Is everyone alright?!
015	Soren! Thank goodness. Are you hurt?
016	I'm fine.
017	As am I. Despite our close proximity, we were spared much of the damage, it seems.
018	Whoa, Teach. You popped out from nowhere. At least you're okay...
019	That one probably isn't.
020	An ethereal aura pulls itself away from Asuka and returns to the enormous Core.
021	So that's what the Core meant by "conduit". It was channelling some form of enhancement through Alchemia.
022	Indeed. It appears to be linked to its—or, indeed, all sophisticated Constructs'—ability to manipulate Alchemia particle levels.
023	This could be extremely dangerous and volatile if not carefully controlled.
024	Near the Core, Zheng Yi gets to his feet and notices the stream of Alchemia particles.
025	(Asuka... Rest, you have done enough)
026	(Leave the rest to me. My... no, our dreams will come to fruition!)
027	Looks like you've lost your gamble.
028	Hmph. It was never a gamble to begin with.
029	For the greater good, we all were prepared to place our lives on the line.
030	Our work here is far from complete!
031	*Whiirrr...*
032	[ Restoring Alchemia Array... ] *Bzzzt*
033	The Core!
034	[ Repairing in progress... Re... restoring Directives... 23% ]
035	Even after all that damage? Not only did it survive that attack, it can even peform repairs on itself?
036	Damn! We've got to get to it before it finishes!
037	Bzzt...
038	*crackle*
039	Wait, what are they doing?
040	The blast must have knocked something out of them.
041	Atropos, restore Control Protocol.
042	......
043	[ Er... Error. Failed to iiiinitialize.... ] *bzzt* [ ... Control Protocol. ]
044	[ Re-routing ener... energy reserves... ] *whirrr* [ Initiating Emergency Repair Sequence. ]
045	[ All functions will be suspended until repairs are complete. ]
046	What...? This will prove to be more complicated than I thought...
047	Looks like Lady Luck is on our side today!
048	We'll stop you before that pile of junk can... Huh?!
049	*Bzzzt... bzzzt...*
050	*Whirrr... ...* *CACKLE*
051	On your guard, everyone! These Constructs just don't know when to quit!
