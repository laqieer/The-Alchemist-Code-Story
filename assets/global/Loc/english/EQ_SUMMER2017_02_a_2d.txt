001	Oh...look at that! It must be the curse of the leader of the Go tribe... It's been decades...the fight begins!
002	Huh, what's the matter, old man?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
003	Now that I think about it, I've heard in the past about two tribes who fought around here for authority over the ocean.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
004	Both of the tribes wore 'battle garments'...
005	And when it became a certain period they engaged in battle.
006	The winner would hold authority over the sea until the next battle. It's time for battle...let's fight!
007	Everyone, go to the library and find historical material about these waters!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0041
008	We might be able to find a way to get rid of the curse!
009	But are you all right on your own?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0027
010	I'll stay here!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
011	No, I'm fine. I'll hold him back!	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
012	Groooowwww!!!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0027
013	Ack! I won't let you get in the way!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
014	Put on a loincloth! Put it oonnnn!!!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0009
015	Ack! What resolve he has! Will I also be overpowered by the loincloth...and forced to put it on?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0020
016	How would I be able to face my fellow knights then...?	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
017	... ...
018	You seem to be okay.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
019	I'm sure Chloe would be pleased.	VO_almira.almira_chara_1015
020	Huh, really?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
021	I think it would suit Vettel well!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
022	True!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
023	Honestly...men...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
024	Come on, let's go.	VO_charis.charis_chara_1023
025	...!!! The monsters!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
026	If you're gonna get in the way, we'll have no choice but to fight you!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0009
027	I've just seen the most revolting thing...I'm gonna clean you guys up good!	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0015
028	Now that I'm actually witnessing it, it's hard to imagine the loincloth being effective at all...
029	I can't afford to wear something so unreliable right now!
