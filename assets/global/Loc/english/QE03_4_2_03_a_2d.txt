001	Gyaaahhhhhh!!!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0028
002	Wh...what the...?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
003	Haven't you forgotten about your Broom Ace? You better ride on it properly. If you fall from this height, you won't survive.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
004	How dare you take pity on us!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0027
005	What's wrong with that? I don't want Liz to see any more people die.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
006	What are you talking about?! Aren't you a descendant of Helkovara who kicked down countless witches and paved her way to glory?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
007	That brand of the Helkovara family ends with my mother's generation!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
008	What...?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
009	In the past, the witches of this country could never love people properly.
010	This isn't just limited to the opposite sex. I'm talking about between witches as well.
011	Everyone was either a romantic or professional rival. That's why witches never held hands with other witches.
012	But I was saved by Liz's hand. Holding Liz's hand is what brought me this far!
013	And I promise that we will achieve what no one else ever has—the removal of Asmodeus' curse.
014	We will show you the power of holding each other's hands!
015	W-what nonsense! The queen has forbidden any to lay hands on Asmodeus!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
016	In that case, I will act as queen and change everything!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
017	?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
018	Queen?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
019	I was disciplined strictly from an early age.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
020	No matter who kicks you down, head for the top. That's the Helkovara family motto I was taught.
021	Yet, in spite of all the talk about aiming for the top, not one witch of Helkovara ever became queen.
022	They resigned themselves to just being the elite.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
023	That was the limit of the Helkovara family who always fought alone.
024	At Sabbath, I was defeated by both Liz and Alma who worked together. At that point, I felt my limit.
025	The limit of a single witch. I will surpass that and, beyond the clouds, I will obtain Asmodeus.
026	This feat will destroy all sense of value that has existed until now and usher in a new era for us witches.
027	I want to create a Lustburg where witches can take each other's hands and stand together!
028	Do you dare to say that you'll take the place of the queen?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
029	If things will not change, then it is time for a revolution!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
