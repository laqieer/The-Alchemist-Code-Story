001	Ugff... It appears that I've lost this time.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0022
002	However, my domination will not end here!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0019
003	Phew... Well, we managed to survive somehow, even though Zangetsu escaped. We were also able to rescue Chihaya.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
004	I guess you can say we accomplished the bare minimum of our mission.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
005	Come on, man! It was a big success! We were able to save both of them! Look at them! Two people!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
006	The bug is getting worse...	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0026
007	The content team says they didn't do anything to cause the Lizardman bug in the Sacred Stone Memories scenario!	VO_ishigakiad.ishigakiad_sys_0018
008	I see... So, we can't find the source of the issue on the developer side, and it just keeps getting worse...	VO_fujitad.fujitad_sys_0031
009	If we don't know where the problem is, we have no choice but to check it out ourselves! Prepare the emergency DLC!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0002
