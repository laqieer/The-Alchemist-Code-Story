001	Ah, I guess that bell means the bridal fair is over.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0002
002	It's so nice to see the smiles on everyone's faces as they exit the venue.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
003	So, it went smoothly, Ewan?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
004	I'd say so. Nothing out of ordinary to report. I guess my part is done.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
005	That reminds me. Once this job is over, care to join me for a board game?
006	We may have been called here as Phantoms, but we’re allowed to have a little fun, right?
007	Sure, why not? I might actually enjoy playing against an army commander.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
008	Coming from you that's quite the compliment!
009	I'm still shocked a famous military man like yourself was called to Greed Dike for bridal fair security.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
010	Is that right? You're quite the big shot yourself, Supreme Naval Commander of Greed Dike.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0025
011	Honestly, I don't mind these kinds of gigs. A soldier's duty is to secure the people's happiness.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
012	Everyone seems excited to check out the venue and try on dresses for the wedding rehearsals.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
013	I get a kick out of watching it all. I'm probably better at this than I am at combat.
014	Oh? If that's the case, you should've seen the event for yourself.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0044
015	I would've loved to...but there's no way I could leave my post.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0011
016	Besides, I'd kill the mood if I barged in with my military uniform on.
017	…You never change.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
018	Hey! I'm just saying every man has his place.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0001
019	…
020	Also, I heard a band of thieves has been stirring up trouble lately. Best be on guard.
021	Word travels fast. So, you're aware of the situation. They say--	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
022	Mei Fa--ng!
023	What's the matter? Must you yell?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0005
024	Please forgive the intrusion, Lady Mei Fang. Lady Lucia has an urgent matter to discuss with you.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0035
025	Darn tootin'! I was looking everywhere for you! I have a huge favor to ask!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
026	Wait a minute... Lucia? Is that you, Lucia?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
027	Hm?
028	And who are you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
029	Huh?
030	*Sigh* Lucia, you've made weapons for Ewan countless times…	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
031	Oh? I have? Let me see that weapon for a second.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
032	Oh! Right, right! I remember this one--gave me a real hard time! How does it handle?
033	Quite well. I've survived all manner of threats thanks to your handiwork.
034	By the way, why are you all dressed up?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
035	Well, we're providing on-site security, so we thought it best to blend in.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
036	More of us are needed to handle recent threats to public safety, but we don't want to alarm anyone.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
037	Gotcha…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0044
038	Say, why don't you join the party, Ewan? I'd love to hear your opinion as a weapons connoisseur.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
039	My opinion? About what?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
040	Well, you see…	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1008
041	*Swoon* What a breathtaking wedding that was! I can't wait to get married!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_1029
042	Oh! Oh! I have an idea! Why don't we have a wedding rehearsal, too?
043	Us? What exactly do you want to rehearse?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0002
044	Well, um… The bride and groom practiced reading letters to their parents, right?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0031
045	Yes! It was deeply moving! I couldn't help tearing up.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
046	Right? Let's try doing that! It'll be a chance to express our gratitude for one another.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0004
047	You know, the part I really liked was the cake-cutting ceremony.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
048	That special-looking knife they used was all sparkly.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
049	The wedding knife? Actually, I heard it was hand crafted from Felicitite.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0001
050	Felicitite? I've made weapons from that before.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
051	I don't remember it being that shiny, though. Maybe because I wasn't making wedding knives...	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
052	Come to think of it, I've never made a wedding knife before…
053	Maybe I should give it a shot!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0008
054	Oh! That's perfect, Lucia! If you make the wedding knife…	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0007
055	Then we'll all cut the cake together and have a lovely party!
056	You got it! I'll make the finest knife you'll ever see!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
057	So, that's why I'd like you two to try out my wedding knife at the party.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
058	Mei Fang is already familiar with my designs and, Ewan, you can share a military man's insight.
059	A military man's insight?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
060	Good grief... Your eyes start to twinkle whenever we talk about weapons.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
061	*Giggle* I'm just so excited to make the world's sharpest wedding knife!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
062	Knock yourself out. But keep in mind it's not the same thing as a weapon.
063	It's not?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
064	Well, no. The point of a wedding knife isn't to hurt people, right?
065	Indeed, that's true. He has a point.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
066	But a knife is still a weapon!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
067	Um… Well, yes. But a "wedding" knife isn't!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
068	Huh? So, you're saying a wedding knife isn't a weapon even though it's a knife?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0026
069	Uzuma means that objects can be categorized based on their intended use. Don't overthink it.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
070	That I get. But don't you still use a wedding knife to cut?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
071	If you tell me it's not a weapon, I have a hard time imagining what to make.
072	I think once I get my hands on some Felicitite, I'll think of something.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
073	…
074	Say, Uzuma, do you have any clue where I can find any?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
075	Actually, my fortune-telling research indicates this area on the map.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
076	Oh, that region? I remember there being a mine near that village.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0001
077	Are you familiar with the area?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0002
078	I am. I visited once a while back... Bet I could even guide you around. But the mine…
079	…Well, never mind. Why don't we just go have a look?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
080	Alright! Let's get a move on!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
081	Ahem, shouldn't we change first?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
082	Nah! I'm sure these sparkly clothes will help me brainstorm some ideas!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
083	O-Of course…	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0037
084	Is this a good idea?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0025
085	We may be no use when it comes to weapon-making, but we sure can help throw a great party!	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
086	There's no greater joy than the joy of helping others. Plus, I want to see this mine for myself.
087	…Very well. It won't hurt to have a look, I suppose.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
