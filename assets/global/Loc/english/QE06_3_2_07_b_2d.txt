001	Hah!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0004
002	(There are too many of them! I'd like to try taking them all down at once with Kagutsuchi...)	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
003	(...but with all this chaos, I'd just end up catching the two of them in the blast. I'll have to be more deliberate with my strikes.)
004	Nothing's going to stand in our way!
005	Hyahh!!!<br>Huh?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0032
006	Waaaaah! What was that? What did I just do?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0026
007	What in the world...?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
008	Mikaboshi! Is that...ink?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0025
009	Hyah!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0001
010	I don't know what it is, but I can do it again, so it was no fluke!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
011	Maybe this is one more power I've been gifted to help return Wadatsumi back to the way it used to be...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
012	Back to how it should be.<br>Oh, wait!
013	Mikaboshi?
014	I have an idea! Sumeragi, follow my lead!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
015	Uh, o-okay!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
016	Hyaaaaah!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0032
017	Grragh?!
018	Sumeragi! Now!
019	Got it!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_battle_0001
020	Well, that sure did the trick! And in one fell swoop, too.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
021	Okay. But what actually was that?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
022	The things you were saying earlier about restoring Wadatsumi back to what used to be normal just randomly popped into my head.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
023	It was kind of a gamble, but I thought maybe I could control that ink and shape it into a representation of that future. Figured it might work as a new technique, and I guess I was right!
024	I even came up with a name for it: Beast Art Evocation!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0008
025	Ugh, this is so unfair. You keep hogging all the glory!
026	I can't help it! It just kind of happened. And it came out of our shared dream for Wadatsumi's future, anyway, so just shut your mouth and be glad I'm on your side!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
027	Sadly, there doesn't seem to be much choice right now but to kill or be killed when facing demons like that. But I'm hoping that with a little work, we can get by just incapacitating them.
028	That's the kind of future you were thinking of when you did that?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0045
029	Yeah, basically. It was almost like praying for a miracle.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0005
030	You really are a kind soul, Mikaboshi, you know that? I don't think I'll ever be that nice.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
031	Well, I am the older twin. That makes me wiser, too, probably. Make sure you don't forget that!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
032	Haha.
033	Pff...hahaha!
034	They say children grow up fast, but I don't think I've ever seen any others grow quite as fast as you two. It almost boggles the mind.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
035	That ink technique you used, Mikaboshi? Kaede used it too, once upon a time.
036	Really? Mother did?
037	Absorbing her horn may have triggered a physical reaction in your body, like unlocking a muscle memory or something. At least...that's the best theory I've got.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
038	Showoff...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0030
039	No pouting now, Sumeragi. You've inherited Koga's fierce resolve.
040	The two of you really are just like them. The resemblance is uncanny.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0037
041	Huh?
042	But it's you who raised us, Lady Mitsuha.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
043	We wouldn't be where we are today without you.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0005
044	...Thank you.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0007
045	We're all in this together, right? No long faces allowed!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
046	There's still so much left to be done, though.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
047	No kidding. But we're on our way, and that's what counts.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0037
048	Time passed quickly, and we continued our covert search for the origin of the malice that had settled upon Wadatsumi. It was definitely slow going, though.
049	Oh, it's you. Nothin' but bad news these days, eh? There's a rumor goin' around that says you lost your parents. Is that why I always see you skulkin' about by your lonesome?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
050	Sorry, I don't mean to pry. Such a shame, though. Ain't nobody been spared from a loss or two these days. Heck, won't be long till the demons reach us here, I reckon.
051	The powers that be won't do nothin' for us, neither. And to top it off, I hear them foul demon spawn they been keepin' in the castle have gone and run off, too! Bad tidings all around.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
052	...
053	I tell you, there might be somethin' to them rumors about the authorities conspirin' with demons, and even bringin' more of 'em in. Just a matter of time before they get us.
054	But look at that, I went and talked your ear off! Here you go—I tossed a little extra in there for ya. Just let me know if you need any help, now.
055	We—or, in this case, Sumeragi—learned that if we hid our identity, everyone would be kind to us. It really drove home that we were fighting malice on behalf of these people, too.
056	As the days wore on, my eye continued to seek out demons with malice in their hearts, and Sumeragi's blade continued to cut them down, one after another.
057	It's almost as if we were possessed by the Eye and the Blade.
058	And we would continue to welcome that possession until the day we managed to cull the demon named Malice.
059	It helped that there weren't just two of us anymore, but three.
060	And hopefully, at some point, there would be even more. Hopefully one day our ranks would include everyone—all of humankind and demonkind alike.
061	That vision of the future is what kept us going.
062	Until one fateful day...
063	Soup's on! Huh?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0001
064	What's the matter?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0006
065	Shh! Do you hear that? Sounds like a large group of people by the entrance.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
066	You're right. I wonder if something's going on outside.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
067	Here they are!
068	Huh?!
069	Oh, this isn't good...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
