001	So it's true about the Cursed Beasts... The documents from Lustburg are consistent. My observation is complete.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
002	I knew it... It's just like I thought. This...is a record of a war fought in the distant past.
003	Perhaps it should be called "The Great Battle of the Cursed Beasts". Once I'm done researching the seven giant beasts, I will need to do a lot more research about the related factors, too.
004	However...
005	If this is true, it's a discovery that ought to be written into the history of Alchemy. Mm... I'm going to investigate this some more.
006	Kaya...
007	This part is interesting. Don't disturb me, okay?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
008	Tell me this. What would happen if the Cursed Beasts were to be resurrected?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
009	The possibility of their resurrection isn't something I've set out to observe.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
010	Maybe not, but it's been on my mind. I wouldn't have accompanied you merely because I was afraid of losing you.
011	My intention as Lord Commander was to understand the meaning behind that mural.
012	I don't have enough information yet, and I don't really want to discuss hypotheticals.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
013	It's possible that the world could be destroyed, isn't it?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
014	That is a possible outcome. Preventing that is one of the reasons for my investigation.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
015	In that case, although our paths may differ, our cause is the same.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0045
016	Kaya, I now understand your duty, and how important it is that you accomplish what you are trying to do...
017	And it's something that only you can do. I want you to take your time, observe, and investigate until you find the truth.
018	In the meantime... I'll work on fulfilling my duty. Likewise, it's something that only I can do.
019	It seems you finally understand.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
020	Kaya, bout with me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
021	What?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
022	I must surpass you, Kaya, and give you a proper send-off toward your new path.
023	This is the resolution I have come to.
024	Heh heh. You're tactless, you know that? And you're as clueless about women as ever.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
025	You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.
026	Nngh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
027	But...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
028	I do like that look in your eyes. Allow me to test your resolve.
029	I suppose this is a good spot for it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
030	Nn...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
031	This is unusual for me...but I won't hold back.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
032	Come to think of it...this is our first bout, isn't it?
033	If you let your guard down, you won't get off lightly. You do realize that my Alchemia is of an irregular class, do you not?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
034	I possess Alchemia on par with the Sephira... "Alchemia Pura".
035	That is exactly why you're worth defeating. I will surpass you, here and now, as both your Lord Commander and as an old friend.
036	Kaya...as you set out on your new path, this is my parting gift to you! For I am a bastion of absolute justice!
037	There's that fire of yours. If you truly are capable of shouldering the justice of Babel, then come... Show me!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0009
