001	Hmm, Eira has been spending more and more time up in those mountains lately
002	I do hope she's alright. What could she be doing up there all by herself?
003	...hnnn...
004	Surely this isn't the limit of your power? If you can't even best this level of flames, how will you ever reach your full potential?
005	Focus on the image of ice. Feel the magic condense within you, then draw it forth and release it!
006	...together ...now!
007	Awoooo!
008	...eyy!
009	*pant pant*
010	... Eira... do well?
011	That was wonderful Eira! You really have improved your control over your magical strength!
012	Its impressive that you managed to conjure this much frost despite the heat I was releasing.
013	Not to mention the teamwork with your fellow companions.
014	Arf arf!
015	Yay! big sis... Thank!
016	It's my pleasure to help. All I did was teach you to manipulate your latent magic anyway.
017	Besides, it does get rather dull up on this lonely mountain. No one else would visit me here anyway.
018	... Mmm...
019	... Idea!
020	Eh?
021	...visit ...big bro ...big sis!
022	(Siblings? Is she referring to other human companions?)
023	Eira... humans don't take well to my presence. You've already witnessed how easily they fall to temptation around me.
024	...Good people ...kind!
025	No... trouble!
026	(She seems pretty fond of these friends. And she considers them brother and sister too... as she does me)
027	Well, I guess I don't have much reason to decline, I'll be in your care then.
028	... yes!
029	Still, it wouldn't do to leave the village unguarded in your absence. Shall we weed out the local monsters before we take our leave?
030	... Eira... ready!
