001	Nnnghh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
002	Where...am I?
003	I remember we were all caught up in the awakening of the Cursed Beasts, and then...
004	Nimul? Where are you?! Is anyone...?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
005	Well.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
006	We were wondering what uninvited guest had just come into our home and made a mess, and what do we find but a survivor of Gluttony?
007	Survived? Hmm... Perhaps flushed out would be more accurate.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0039
008	You abandoned the village, and now you flounder for life.
009	I understand now, looking at you. Humans do not give up easily.
010	I remember you! You were the one who—!!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
011	I have no idea of what you speak.
012	However, you must leave, human. This is my domain. All the ways about here belong to me..	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
013	Only those whom I allow may stay here. For my way is the only one that exists here.
014	Any sympathy I might have once had for you and yours was exhausted long ago.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
015	Exhausted the moment my way—that of the Cursed Beasts—was rejected.
016	The Cursed Beasts are your...way? You created the Cursed Beasts?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
017	I am the unquestioned way of this world. All of this world is of my creation.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
018	But...why?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
019	Why what?
020	If you made this world, then why?! Why would you create something as terrible as the Cursed Beasts?!
021	If only they had never existed, then...!
022	Then the Sephira, the previous Vessels of Purification...Julia. None of them would have ever needed to die!
023	Hm.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
024	Her love deserved more than to end so prematurely! She and my brother should have been able to have an entire future together!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
025	I see your hatred, your desire for revenge for the deaths of your loved ones.
026	I am curious whether or not you truly believe those emotions are justified.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0046
027	You're...curious?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0026
028	Yes. The day you lost Julia, your comrade in arms, I too, lost someone.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
029	Wh-what?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
030	Nidhogg. Though it was unfortunate that it forgot the duty entrusted to it and ran amok...
031	It was among the select few I consider to be dear to me.
032	You... What were you to the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
033	Your people destroyed Nidhogg for the sake of your own survival.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
034	If I, in turn released the Cursed Beasts, would it not have been justified in your opinion?
035	I... I-I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
036	Your self-centered justice is limited and bigoted. It sees only what has been done unto you and not what has been done unto others.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0029
037	That is why your fate is to be destroyed by the Cursed Beasts.
038	What? Wait, what are you saying?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
039	And yet you speak of love. How curious.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
040	This love you speak of is little more than a basic instinct that all creatures possess, that is better known as lust.
041	What is the purpose of granting it more importance than it is truly owed?
042	Love and lust are different! They must be. They just have to be.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
043	Julia always looked so happy because of that love she treasured so much.
044	Even though it was a love that could never be requited! Despite that, it made her smile so blissfully!
045	Without love, why would we bother caring for and supporting one another? I believe that is what separates love from pure lust!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
046	Are you willing to put yourself on the line to prove that there is a difference between the two?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
047	Wh-what?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
048	In your world, lust is the love trap that ensures the continuation of a species.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
049	I will be watching your actions carefully, as they will prove either that love can truly save your pitiful existences, or that it is little more than survival instinct.
050	However—
051	Hmph. More uninvited guests have entered my realm.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0016
052	Who dares?
053	Nngh...
054	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
055	N-Ni...mul...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
056	Good, you're awake. It sounded like you were having a nightmare or something.
057	I'm sorry for making you worry. I had...a strange dream.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
058	Where are we?
059	How much do you remember? We were attacked by Beelzebub, and—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
060	Oh! The village! What happened to everyone?! Are they all right?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
061	Where...is this place? Everything is...white. I've never seen anything like this before.
062	Nor have I. I believe that somehow we ended up in an entirely different belt region.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
063	Aaahh! It's cold! It's so cold! I wish I'd brought along warmer clothing!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0043
064	I believe that this is what is known as snow. In addition to the cold, this place is quite dangerous.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
065	How is our ship?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
066	Er...well... It's not looking good, boss. Definitely can't fly yet. I mean, the ship took some damage but the real problem is the reactor.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
067	So the ship usually compresses the magil in the air to make energy, but the intake mechanism was damaged when we got hit and now the magil conversion rate is—
068	In short, you are saying that it will not fly without repair.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0040
069	Why've you gotta be like that, Waginau? I was still talking! It's rude to just cut in!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
070	What is the point of wasting time with a technical explanation? In an emergency, simple and straight to the point is most effective.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
071	Well, yeah, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
072	I see. How long will the repairs take?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
073	So, my initial assessment is, uh...a while.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
074	You said that you'd be able to fix it.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
075	That was before I saw the extent of the damage!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
076	It's pretty bad. It's the magil intake mechanism that's broken.
077	Plus, it's not exactly easy to do this out in the elements, what with this blizzard and everything!
078	Ah... I can see how it would be difficult to do precision work in this weather.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0045
079	That's not even the least of it! The Engineer Soldiers aren't built for the cold! Their oil keeps freezing, and the monitors keep fogging up... It's a huge pain!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
080	Ugh! If we had to crash in the Luxuria Belt Region, couldn't we at least have ended up somewhere where the weather is a little more stable?!
081	Luxuria? Lust...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
082	Oh! Emmel! You're awake, then! That's great!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
083	So yeah! We're in a new Belt Region!
084	It's the Luxuria Belt Region. With all this ice and snow that never melts, I seriously think this is the worst one of the lot.
085	The Luxuria Belt Region...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
086	It feels like there's no end to these little surprises. It's hard not to feel overwhelmed by it all.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
087	Of course, Adaleigh did talk about this place, but I never thought that it would be so cold as this.
088	It's hard to believe that people live here.
089	Right. Well, you see—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
090	This is the heart of the Luxuria Belt Region, the territory of the Cursed Beast, where the cold winds rage and scream.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
091	Just west or south of this area, we'd be in much more comfortable weather.
092	Why do you always have to steal my thunder, old dog? I was about to say that!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
093	I have a name, you know. And I am neither old, nor a dog.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
094	How shall we handle this, Nimul?
095	It's freezing outside, and the ship can't fly at the moment.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
096	It's still warm inside the ship, but how long will that last?
097	Well, it'll stay warm for as long as the reactor holds up, but...
098	Like I said, the magil intake mechanism is dead, so it's not going to last that long.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
099	For this to happen when it is urgent that we return to the Sephira village is a complete disaster!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
100	...
101	That was your hometown, right? That's a pretty big deal.
102	Aw, man. I'm sorry. If only my ship were made of sturdier stuff, then you wouldn't all be stuck here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0035
103	No, I must apologize. I am frustrated, but you have done all that you can for us. I didn't mean to sound as if I was accusing you of anything.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0035
104	The fact of the matter is that it's not possible to repair the ship at the moment. We'll have to wait for better weather conditions.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
105	Isn't that right, Adaleigh?
106	Yeah.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
107	Unfortunately, we don't know anything about the weather patterns of this region.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
108	It's possible that if we wait, we might just end up freezing to death.
109	Then I propose the following. Why don't we leave the ship here for now and try to make our way to where there are other people?
110	If I understood you correctly, Adaleigh, there are people living not too far from here. Yes?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
111	Yeah. Last time I was here there was a settlement that helped me out!
112	Then we should make our way there, gather information and supplies, and also take the time to plan out how we will repair the ship. I believe that this is the right course of action.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
113	I have no objections.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
114	I am glad to hear it. Let us waste no more time in setting out, then.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
115	Is everyone else okay with this new plan?
116	Sounds good to me!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
117	I agree.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
118	Emmel? If you don't feel up to it, then...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
119	No, Nimul. I'm fi—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
120	In your world, lust is the love trap that ensures the continuation of a species.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
121	Ngh!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
122	Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
123	No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
124	I see. In that case...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
125	Aaaaahhh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0028
126	Wh-what is it?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
127	There's something huge right outside of the ship!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
128	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
129	This shaking... Is that the wind?! The snow storm seems to be getting stronger!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
130	This presence... Everyone, prepare yourselves! It's here!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
131	What?! What's here?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
132	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!
133	What?! No way! This magil response is almost on the same level as that Guardian Dragon's...maybe even greater!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
134	No... This is...! That's...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
135	The ruler of the frozen lands...the Cursed Beast Asmodeus!
136	What was that?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0026
137	The hull's taken some damage! The magil response is increasing with the snow storm! We've got a group of monsters or something attacking us!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
138	Nrk...! The ship can't take much more damage!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
139	Waginau! Yna! We need to do something about that magil response!
140	R-right!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
141	Understood!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0038
142	What should I do?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
143	Provide support from inside the ship! It should be enough to have the Engineer Soldiers back us up!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0041
144	Got it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0037
