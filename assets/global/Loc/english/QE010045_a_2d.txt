001	The ancient Alchemy ruins... I never would've thought that the Lizard Brigade would be nesting there.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
002	That's the information we received from the villager just now. We believe it is highly reliable.
003	Hmm. Dias.
004	Yes?
005	At the village, why did you refuse to annihilate them? I thought I told you not to give in to sentiment.
006	We are here to destroy the Lizard Brigade. To turn our blades against villagers, who have no intention of fighting us, runs contrary to the way of chivalry.
007	And if the villagers were to show signs of hostility, what would you do then?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
008	If they showed hostility towards me?
009	I would have no mercy on them, of course.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
010	Without a second thought, I will stop any who stands in my path.
011	...!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0018
012	H-hm... Very well then. Is there still no word from the scouts?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0027
013	What is it?
014	Dias, you have a dark shadow hanging over you. Can you still not erase the sorrow from your past?
015	Huh?
016	Nothing. Just don't forget the voices of those who seek for a way to coexist with Envylia.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0041
017	Keep in mind, that you are the son of a noble captain of Envylia.
018	... ...
