001	Agh!!! Ackkk!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
002	Othima!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
003	Ug...Gfff! I-it appears that my magic is not very effective against you...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
004	N-no matter what technique I use...you reduce its power.
005	Yes. I am being used for my ability to resist your magic attacks.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
006	Ughh...! So...you were sent with the sole purpose of handling me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
007	B-but no matter how much I search for your weakness...you change your attack pattern every time you change that artificial arm of yours.
008	Jeez. To be honest, I'm in a bit of a pickle here.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
009	Captain Othima, it is an honor to hear you think so highly of my abilities. Please, rest peacefully.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0033
010	?! Aghh!!! Akk...!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
011	!!! ...Hm?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0028
012	Well then...you now no longer have anyone to protect you.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
013	Please obediently hand over the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
014	You are foolish to think I would hand it over to the likes of you...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
015	...Hand.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
016	A-an iron fist...?! Wh-what are you planning on doing?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
017	If you will not hand the Sacred Stone to me...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
018	I will rip every single limb off of you until you tell me its whereabouts.
019	I would be most appreciative if you would tell me before I have to remove all of them.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
020	S-such threats will not...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
021	It's not a threat. It's the truth. Once I'm done with all your limbs, I'll rip your upper body off of your lower body.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
022	Worst case scenario, as long as I leave your brain intact, I should be able to probe its depths for the answers I seek.
023	...!
024	First of all, an arm.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
025	Ugh...?! L-let me go!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0043
026	Of course...as soon as you tell me where the Sacred Stone is.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
027	As I just told you, my sole purpose for being here is to find the Sacred Stone. It's not to take your life.
028	Uck...! Furious Blizzard!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
029	Aghh...!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
030	A-alright!
031	...! Hm! Let go...!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
032	No...I still haven't learned where the Sacred Stone is.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
033	Is it not working on her?! Ack! Absolute Darkness!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
034	Uck...! You're very persistent...wouldn't have expected any less from you, Captain Othima.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
035	I-I'm starting to lose confidence...seeing how little effect it has.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
036	Y-you know...as a gentleman, I'd like to ask for a favor. Do you think you can let go of Her Majesty's arm?
037	Very well.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0038
038	Ack! Y-you little brat!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
039	My intention is not to make you sad, Captain Othima.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
040	I will save hurting her for until I've properly dealt with you first.
041	Th-then...I guess that means I can't afford to let that happen...Mystic Fire!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
042	It won't work. It's time to say goodbye.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0016
043	Ughh...!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
044	After all the stories I've heard about you, it was an honor to have been able to fight you.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
045	Ugfff...! My...stical...Fire...!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
046	You don't give up until your last breath. Your fighting spirit is...admirable.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0009
047	U-ugh... My last breath? Don't be silly. My flames have only started to burn.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
048	...?
049	Is this...the Phoenix?! ...Aghh!!!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
050	Ugh...! D-did you see that? My final evolution of Mystical Fire. I call it "Phoenix's Dance"...or something like that...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
051	Seriously...you had me worried about you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
052	...?!
053	But...if you have enough time to be spewing nonsense then I guess you're okay.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0007
054	G-great timing! I'm so relieved to see you, Kagura. I was in a real fix here.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0026
055	Kagura...of the 5th Regiment.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
056	Captain Othima, why don't you rest for a while? I'll take it from here.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1002
057	He-hey, wait...! The problem is that magic attacks don't...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
058	...! What...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
059	She dropped to her knees! Is it working?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
060	Th-this flame...! Does it mean that I've been inflicted with damage?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
061	What I wield is Kagutsuchi. It's a little different than ordinary magic.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0017
062	I see! Kagura's magic was born from Wadatsumi. They use a unique form of Alchemy.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
063	I-it's surpassing the scope of her magic defense!
064	It seems like I'm not a very compatible partner for you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
065	Ack...! Gauntlet!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
066	This isn't your time to shine. Get out of here.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
067	...Burning Heavens!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0001
068	You've defused my attack...? Sword!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0021
069	...! Burn Out!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
070	Agh!!! It's true. It appears your attack techniques are quite effective against me. But...I cannot afford to lose!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
071	Even Kagutsuchi's power is reduced in half. I'm sorry, Your Majesty...would you mind?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
072	What...?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
073	Whoa! C-careful!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
074	It seems like it'll be more effective if I overpower you...Axe!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0044
075	Such sad eyes. You've suffered from a painful past, haven't you?
076	...!
077	But I won't sympathize with you!
078	Not only did I lose my family, but my entire country was destroyed. I also have had a painful past!
079	Ack...! I don't have time to be talking with you!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
080	Flaming Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0007
081	Aghh!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
082	Ug...ughh! I-it has no effect! I won't lose!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
083	I-I...I'm going to see the ideal word imagined by Sol come to fruition!
084	Venomous Lure!!!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0004
085	...! You used something as silly as a pillar to seal my movement? Please don't get in my way!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
086	No...it's wonderful. Your power is astounding, Your Highness.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
087	?!
088	The force behind your incredible magic defense comes from that eye.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
089	In that case...if I were to seal your power, what would happen?
090	!!!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
091	M-my eye! The eye that Sol gave to me...my power to protect myself...!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
092	Sol... You're carrying out this individual's instructions, aren't you?
093	...!
094	The way you push yourself so hard to fulfill his orders, without fearing for your own safety...I can almost respect that.
095	But...what you're doing is threatening the peace of this world.
096	N-no...! I...I just want to be by Sol's side when he creates his ideal world!!!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
097	It's unfortunate. When it comes down to it, the only thing that separates us is a difference in values for what we perceive justice to be.
098	For your sake as well...I promise to end this cycle of tragedy.
099	Ug...ughh...! Ughhh...!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0007
100	Y-you can do it...! Kagura!!!
101	Got it! Kagutsuchi...Flying Star!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
102	Ack...! Ackkk!!! Ee...eekkkkk!!!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0028
103	Huh...?! What the...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
104	Did you...kill her?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
105	No... It's almost as if...I erased all her powers.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
106	I need to go back...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
107	?!
108	You...!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
109	No way...?! Did she just escape my Flying Star?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
110	I was told that if I lost my power, I must return. Excuse me.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0035
111	Ack...! H-hey, wait!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
112	Did she...disappear?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
113	Does that mean you got rid of her?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
114	Your Highness! Reinforcements have arrived!
115	Greed Dike's invasion has also stagnated. It's the perfect time for a counterattack!
116	All right! I can see victory in sight! Othima, let's go all out!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0046
117	Victory...? Are you kidding me? I'm filled with a sense of defeat.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
118	I can't believe even my Flying Star didn't finish her.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
119	There's no point in feeling down. Let's get back to the others, Kagura.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
120	...Got it!
121	The Veda Templars, huh? Jeez. Who would've thought someone of that caliber existed?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
