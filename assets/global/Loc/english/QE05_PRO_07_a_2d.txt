001	...
002	Where is the intruder?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
003	We've sealed every corridor, but we still haven't found her!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
004	Urgh... That woman has some sort of mystical power! We have to think outside the box to catch her!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
005	Yes, sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
006	...
007	Found her! Over here—grk!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
008	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
009	Stop! We've got you surrounded! Seize her!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
010	Ack...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
011	She jumped out the freaking window?! Quick, we need to send soldiers after her!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
012	...
013	...
014	Where'd she...? Impossible! There should be no way to get around the blockades!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
015	She'll head to the border! Send more soldiers to bulk up the defense on the wall!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
016	(Something's not right.)	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
017	Haaa... Haaa... There it is!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
018	Oh no!
019	Insolent girl! How dare you defy the authority of Greed Dike?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0012
020	Your blasphemy is unforgivable! You have earned the wrath of the great Sun King!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
021	Tch!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
022	(What is this sensation? I feel uneasy...)
023	What a peculiar thing to say. I, Zechs, would be very grateful if you might elaborate on what you mean by that.
024	You...! Hah!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
025	Urgh! I-it's just a dust cloud, push through! Don't let her escape! Kill her!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
026	(This, too...)
027	To be honest, this is child's play compared to—
028	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0007
029	What?!
030	She allowed herself to be swallowed whole...?
031	No! She intends to escape beyond our walls! After her!
032	(Here, too...)
033	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
034	(This is all going better than I expected. Almost too well.)	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
035	Thank you, Orochi.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
036	...
037	Maybe I'm overthinking it... I must...hurry.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
038	I'm impressed. You managed to steal the Mikaboshi from right under the noses of all those Greed Dike soldiers.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
039	Huh?!
040	Who's there?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
041	Really, how short-sighted can you be? Did you really think it would be that easy to make it out of here alive?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
042	Edgar L. Leonhart!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
043	Your end game leaves a lot to be desired. It's like you're not even trying to escape death.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
044	Edgar?! Don't tell me you've become loyal to the Sun King!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
045	Loyal to...? Don't be ridiculous! I'm the only one who decides when to pull the trigger!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
046	Then...you always planned to—!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
047	You just couldn't lie low, could you?! Go to hell!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0010
048	What?!
049	Again...? Why must our noble will be defied yet again?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
050	Nevertheless, this sorrow...will not be forgotten. It will be passed down through generations.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
051	Even if this life is to come to an end...the flames of this soul will...never...die.
052	Nnrk...!
053	Huh?!
054	I'd really appreciate it if you could pass that message on to your so-called Sun King.	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0008
055	Wh-what the...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
056	I told you! Death was chasing you!	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
057	You didn't even try to run! Unbelievable. Just muttering about "the flames of this soul" instead, like you had all the time in the world!
058	I-I was just—forget it! It's nothing!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
059	Here they are! Found 'em!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
060	Ah, crap. This is why we need to lie low! Why do you just never listen?! Come on, jump on!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
061	Huh...?
062	Do you want to get caught?! Get on!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
063	Urk...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
064	Nnnrgh... G-get...them!
065	Ha! You wish! Just try and catch us with the wind on our side! Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
066	R-right...
067	I'm not seeing any of our pursuers... Looks like we're in the clear for now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
068	...
069	Hey, so... I wasn't expecting anything over the top or whatnot, but...I mean, I did save your life. A "Thank you!" might be nice.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
070	How strange.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
071	Excuse me?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
072	This is all going better than I expected. Almost too well.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
073	Wh-what is this?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
074	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
075	Oh...!
076	It is said that the Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance of power has been disrupted.
077	The disruption of that power balance will cause the founders of Alchemy to descend upon this world...
078	N-no...	VO_amane.amane_battle_0025
079	What's happening? You okay?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
080	P-please... Keep...gura...from...the...kaboshi...
081	No... No!!!
082	Noooooooooooooooooo!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0019
083	What?! What should I do?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
084	G-get...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
085	What?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
086	Get out of my sight! Get away!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
087	I can't do that. I'm not the kind of guy that can just ignore a woman's tears. That's part of my code.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
088	I don't need your pity! These aren't my tears!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
089	What? What are you even saying? Those right there are definitely tears.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
090	You're wrong! These are just—!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
091	Look, I didn't just save you out of the goodness of my heart, okay?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
092	I accidentally made a big show out of it, but I'm also thinking about whether or not you're planning to use the Mikaboshi for ill-gain.
093	Are you saying you refuse to do as I request?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
094	Then I have no choice but to remove you by force!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0007
095	Are you serious? Is this really necessary?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
