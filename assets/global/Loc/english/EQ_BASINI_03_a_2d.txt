001	Irene of Corpse, reporting in. I have spoken with Lord Commander Basheeny.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
002	Subsequently I have personally confirmed that he remains unable to wield the power of Excalibur.
003	I have concluded that he is superfluous to the preservation of order.
004	I see... Good work, Irene. Then I have another mission for you.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
005	You are to eliminate Lord Commander Basheeny and recover Excalibur.
006	So you believe him not only superfluous, but dangerous?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0006
007	Surely you are not questioning my orders. Perhaps you do not believe you can kill him?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
008	Of course not.
009	Good. Most likely, Basheeny will not step down as Lord Commander of his own volition.	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_1015
010	If order is to be maintained, we must give him a push as soon as possible.
011	If he is not a threat, why is it so urgent that we eliminate him?
012	Currently, Excalibur harbors power enough within its blade to turn the world upside down.	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
087	If a naive Lord Commander were to misuse that power...they could plunge Babel into chaos.
013	What does that...mean?
014	There is a particular ritual that is performed when Excalibur is passed from an old wielder to a new one.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
015	What kind of ritual?
016	Oh, the ceremony itself is of no import. It is the feelings burning in the heart of the Lord Commander, and the rest of those present, that truly matter.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
017	Their desire for peace flows into Excalibur itself, to crystallize within the blade in the form of pure compassion.
018	I am sure you can imagine what that power is capable of, if released.
019	The power of compassion that lies within Excalibur was left behind by Emmel, the founder of Alchemy.	VO_irene.irene_battle_0019
020	If Basheeny were to unleash it, then this world would descend into chaos. We must act before he learns how to.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
021	I want you to lure him into contact with forbidden knowledge, then use that pretext to eliminate him. Can I trust you with this?
022	As you wish.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0038
033	Pain, sorrow, hesitation, and doubt mean nothing before the absolution of order, was it? A fine philosophy.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
034	Very well. I will continue to rely on you, so long as you continue to serve.
036	Human resolve is the root of chaos.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
037	My earliest memories are of the Arena in Gluttony Foss...where I served as a test subject for a certain research organization.
039	Sometimes they made me fight humans.
040	Sometimes they made me fight monsters.
041	Once each battle was over, they would inject my body with magical energy. "Enhancement," they called it.
042	The power was too great for my small frame to contain, but my screams fell on deaf ears.
043	No resolve drove me. I grew stronger because they wished it, fought because they asked it, and suffered afterwards because they demanded it.
054	But, all that time, there was one who stayed by my side:
055	My fellow subject, a great bird. Like me, his body had been warped by our captors' depraved desires in pursuit of power.
056	I named him "Carlotta," meaning "freedom".
057	My reason was simple: I hoped someday he would take wing and fly free.
058	Eventually, my captors grew dissatisfied with just magical energy and began experimenting with Philosopher's Stones.
059	The Arena was nothing more than a front for their experiments, hidden in the dark underbelly of the world.
088	My voice reached no one when I screamed, at the mercy of their twisted resolve. That was when I knew resolve to be corrosive to a just and ordered world.
089	But I refused to be like them. I would not become a monster.
090	If resolve could drive humans to such atrocities, I was better off without it, and so I cast it away.
060	One day, everything changed.
061	The Inquisitors of the Holy Order caught wind of my captors' illicit alchemy and raided the laboratory.
062	At last, we were saved...by a group named Corpse.
063	My captors masqueraded as a legitimate organization, but that did not earn them the luxury of a trial. Only we, their subjects, were spared.
064	After that, Carlotta and I fell into the care of the Holy Order.
091	It was not long before the two of us joined Corpse.
074	I felt no reservations. I had seen for myself that some evils lurked where the light of day could not touch them.
075	And so it was to Corpse, which preserved order from the shadows, that I chose to lend my powers.
076	That is the story of my life.
077	To those whose resolve would plunge the world into chaos...
078	I offer only the mercy that the edge of a blade can afford.
