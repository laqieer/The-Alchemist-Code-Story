001	Nothing's changed.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
002	This view... The grating city noise...
003	It's all the same as that day a blood-thirsty thug turned into a self-made mafia boss.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
004	...Heh. Not bad.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
005	Don! What are you thinking?!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
006	Pipe down. You sound too much like some nagging woman, nearly gave me goosebumps.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
007	What do you mean?! Renouncing your seat as Boss and making it official without consulting anyone?!
008	...a light.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
009	Wha—?
010	Didn't you hear me? Give me a light.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
011	...
012	Come on, Boss. You suddenly decide you're done with the business and you act like I shouldn't be surprised or upset.	VO_tango.tango_battle_0019
013	Is it because of the citizens' boycott?
014	Our Family has been getting some negative press and even the government is getting slammed for letting us loose...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
015	Mayor Edward has been targeted as well. The next election is in jeopardy with that clean upstart in the ranks ready to take over.
016	Look. What do you think of this?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0003
017	Huh?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0005
018	About this view.
019	What do I...? Nothing in particular.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
020	Right. Nothing's changed.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
021	Not since that ex-merc thug decided to live here. Not one darn thing...
022	...
023	I was a halfwit with no place to call home. I sought a place in this filthy city...
024	...and I got it. A fallen heaven that prizes only the name you make for yourself. I became the Boss of Heaven district.
025	Now that I think about it, the citizens noisy with their boycotting back then too.
026	Show me to your boss.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
027	Well, well. I didn't think the mayor himself would come personally to greet us.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
028	So you're Taras.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0001
029	Sure, I never really thought the citizens of Redington would welcome someone as notorious as me.
030	But I'd finally found my place. I was ready to face the nation itself to keep it.
031	Go home before someone gets hurt.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
032	...
033	Did I stutter?
034	What a monstrous arm you have.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0007
035	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
036	I heard you sealed your right arm yourself. Why is that?	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
037	...
038	Mayor Edward wasn't just making small talk. His eyes were that of a man listening intently.
039	The world.
040	The world...?
041	One day, this right arm will save the world. It's not cheap enough to spend on a bunch of bull.
042	Some thug thinks he's important enough to save the world, you say?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
043	Hehe... What a joke!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0010
044	...Understood.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0037
045	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
046	Gentlemen, we are leaving. There's no point in continuing.
047	Huh?!
048	Are you going to let these people go?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0025
049	Nothing I do or say will make them leave. It's a waste of time.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0014
050	But still—	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0030
051	Consider this: what happens if we cast them out from the Heaven district?	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
052	If they scatter throughout the country, none will be able to walk the streets safely.
053	Ngh...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0042
054	Not only that, but this city was plagued by attacks from bandits who were forced to leave their homeland of Wratharis.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0031
076	They've been rather quiet lately, don't you think? Perhaps the rise of the Taras Family has something to do with that?
055	Now that I think about it, the bandits haven't attacked us recently...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
056	I won't let them do whatever they want, of course. They will not be allowed to lay a hand on anything or anyone outside of the Heaven district.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0004
057	What should we do?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
058	If the mayor says so, we'll have to wait and see.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0030
059	You heard me, right? Lay a finger on a civilian and you'll regret it.
060	What are you trying to pull? Why are you going easy on us?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
061	Why?
062	This city needs you. That's all.	VO_edward.edward_sys_0003
063	...
064	If that's the case, why resign? Mayor Edward is right. The Don is essential to this city.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
065	It's true that if we want to coexist with the citizens of this city, maybe we need to change Heaven... But you don't have to quit.
066	Change?
067	I'm talking about a compromise.
068	Thugs, pickpockets, beggars, and wanted men. Theft and violence are commonplace. People living in poverty wherever you look.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
069	It's normal for us, but it scares away the citizens. That's something we can change.
070	You still have a lot of learning to do.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
071	Huh?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
072	Anyway, I'm getting out. I'm leaving the rest up to you, Tango.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
073	That's...! That's just too irresponsible!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0027
074	Yeah? What're you gonna do about it? Gonna use your fancy footwork to try and stop me?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
075	Seriously?! I can't just let you go. I'll use all of my power to stop you!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0038
