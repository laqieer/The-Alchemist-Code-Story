001	It's been a long time, Father. Things turned out just as Mr. Taras said they would. I...I cried the whole way here.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0011
002	So much has happened.
003	I've been so busy with my duties as mayor that I haven't been able to visit you regularly. I only come here when I need comfort. I really am a horrible daughter.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
004	Mr. Taras jumped from the top of the clock tower, taking the AJ7000 Prototype with him...
005	And just like when you died, I was left alone again.
006	If that had been the end of it all, it would have been fine, but the Alkaroids are still functional...
007	Which means that their leader, the AJ7000 Prototype, wasn't destroyed by the fall.
008	The people of this city, whom I ought to have been protecting, were so shaken up by this incident that they've shut themselves away in their homes.
009	We were working so hard toward the restoration, too.
010	What should I do?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
011	I'm all alone... Well, I have done my best up until now, even by myself.
012	It's just that now, I'm a little lonely.
013	......
014	Oh, I should change the flowers.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
015	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
016	These flowers... They're new. Could it be...?
017	In my mind, Mayor Edward is still mayor of Redington City.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
018	If we're gonna start an all-out war here in his city, I gotta apologize to him first.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
019	Mr. Taras... You were father's—and this city's—ally all along, weren't you?	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
020	You came here to apologize to my father... You were ready to sacrifice yourself...
021	Trying to sacrifice himself in order to save the rest of us humans...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
022	That's not a collaborator: that's a friend.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
023	......
024	Heheh. Hahahahahaha!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
025	Mr. Taras, why did you leave white roses for my father?
026	Father, I'm sorry that it was such a short visit, but I must be going.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0036
027	It seems that there have been friends at my side all along.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
028	I just didn't notice them until now.
029	It looks like I have to keep moving forward.
030	Bride... Fiona... Signal has been located in this sector.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
031	S-sensor error detected. Regular security ch-ch-check impossible.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0042
032	R-r-r-reproduction u-u-urgent. P-porting required for p-p-population data memory.
033	I-i-imperative.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_battle_0019
034	That took a while.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
035	Bride. Located.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
036	Well, it only makes sense that you'd be slow now. You probably won't be able to use those legs that Mr. Taras broke either, hm?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0036
037	Legs suffered significant d-d-d-damage.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0018
038	It's just like Mr. Taras told me, isn't it?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0011
039	To win, you have to destroy your opponent's weapons.
040	Wedding d-d-d-dress? Why?	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
041	Your weapons...are your data analysis and your insane speed.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
042	You can't make use of that speed anymore.
043	Furthermore, you have proposed to me.
044	M-m-memory retained... Does not compute.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0042
045	Please try and analyze it.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
046	In your data, do you have any record in your database of a groom assaulting his bride at the altar?
047	A-analyzing... Data not found.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0018
048	We have only happy marriages in this city, you know?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
049	Statement is h-h-highly l-likely.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0042
050	Excellent.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
051	What relation does this s-s-style of dress have?	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0027
052	You are my bridegroom, are you not?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
053	A-...ffirma-...tive.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_battle_0020
054	Can you attack your bride?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
055	You...!
056	If you can attack me, and destroy a wonderfully happy wedding ceremony, then go ahead.
057	I won't run or hide anymore.
058	Archive not found. Data not found. C-cannot v-v-verify attack orders.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_battle_0021
059	A-attack... D-d-d-d-dis-...tress... Unable to execute regular output.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_battle_0019
060	Funny, I don't seem to have that problem.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
061	What...?	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0025
062	I retain the memory of our happy wedding being destroyed. I have all of that data inside my mind.
063	After all, I am the bride who called off her wedding almost as soon as it had begun.
064	I left you behind, and I moved on. Someone helped me to move on.
065	I remember it so clearly, even now. Recalling it fills me with hope.
066	I no longer have any doubts. I will not hesitate.
067	Y-you may leave everything to machines, and live a life without pain, fatigue, or want. You will not have to lift a f-f-finger...	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0022
068	That is a wonderful thing.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
069	W-wonderful. Acceptance c-c-confirmed.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0018
070	However, we cannot walk along that path together. There is no happiness in that kind of life, nor is it the kind of freedom that would be worth fighting for.
071	If I can't step out on my own, I won't even be able to enjoy the feel of the wind in my hair.
072	Moreover...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
073	I really don't care for your face.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
074	F-f-f-face?!	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0022
075	It's not that you are a machine, so much as that I do not want or need a cold, mechanical love. It's not you. It's your programming.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
076	What moves a human heart, and what is truly important, is that one's partner has a strong sense of duty and morality!
077	I don't want to lead a self-indulgent newlywed life, and I certainly don't want to spend the rest of my life with you!
078	Insufficient data may be imported from Don Taras and patched. L-l-let me d-demonstrate.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0018
079	If you choose to think of this as underhanded, then so be it. A split couple will ultimately and unavoidably get in each other's way.
080	I will stop you in your tracks right here! I will move forward!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0011
081	This is how I file for divorce!
