001	I don't see anyone around. But I don't imagine they've given up, either.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
002	For now, shall we go speak to the townsfolk? There are a lot of people here for the festival.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
003	Hey! Over here! This way!
004	Wait! If you go so fast, I'll lose you...
005	Here, take my hand! That way we won't get separated.
006	...
007	Friends holding hands and running along... What a happy pair!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
008	I suppose.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
009	This makes me look forward to enjoying the festival with Ephylinde.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0023
010	You really like that person, don't you?
011	Yes... Though I did terrible things to her.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
012	Still, even now I would like to share this view with her.
013	Don't you care what you did?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
014	Of course. But it's Ephylinde who gets to decide whether or not to be around me.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0006
015	What is it that you are looking for?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
016	...
017	I just went to see everyone having fun.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
018	Though even spotting them, I can't join them.
019	Th-This is so wrong!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0027
020	E-Everyone murdered... B-But me still alive? Is that right? Is that proper?!
021	Will there be peace?!
022	When morning comes, the people of Wadatsumi, the soldiers, me, and Button would all burn up in the flames of war.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
023	Our only option would be to wait for death. And this is the only way for you to survive.
024	This is the only correct solution.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
025	...
026	It was a clever trick...creating a situation where a choice had to be made with no explanation.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0020
027	...
028	Having considered what you said... That's a load of crap.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
029	Sure, it started out the way you said, but after that, she made the choice herself.
030	She chose to live with us filled with her hatred. To live as Füry.
031	Don't find blame in that decision.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
032	...
033	She was resolved and made her choice. But what about you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
034	Me? I hadn't thought much about me. Though, I think I got what I was after.
035	...
036	Well, I suppose I have no quarrel with that notion. I'm sorry to have spoken so much and said so little.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
037	Sol really gets worked up, doesn't he?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0012
038	Just drop it.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
039	I'm surprised, as well. You're quite...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0045
040	That's why I said "drop it."	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
041	I meant to compliment you. I'm sure it's because of the way you are that Button survived.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0008
042	I'm grateful that I was able to entrust her well-being to you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
043	Pl-Please stay away from me!
044	...?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
045	Don't be like that! C'mon, let's have some fun together.
046	It's your job to entertain us, right? You work for the festival.
047	That's not right at all! Please, leave me alone!
048	What is going on? Are they drunk?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
049	Seems that way. Guess they've been having a little too much fun at the festival.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0016
050	The woman seems unable to pull away... Doesn't she remind you of that child a little?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0005
051	Maybe... What do you think?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
052	...I'll go take a look. All this noise is ridiculous.
