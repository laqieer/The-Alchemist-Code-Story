001	This is the end!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_battle_0007
002	Ngh!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
003	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0004
004	I had a hunch. There's been a sharp increase in power. Was the girl touching the blade what did it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
005	Claybelle!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0001
006	Claybelle, you've come to!
007	Stay back!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0015
008	I've regained consciousness, thanks to you...but it won't last long.	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0019
009	Claybelle, I...
010	You absolute moron. You'd be doing me a favor by ending my life now!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0002
011	I can't! I just...can't! How can you possibly expect me to do such a thing?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0018
012	Well, now. Look who's being open about their feelings all of a sudden.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0010
013	Cry-baby Zafeiris... A foolish dragon who was born with power beyond any other, yet remained ever hesitant to wield it.
014	It's that kindness of yours that Schmeier believed in.
015	Claybelle, I...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
016	But what's happened here... What's happened to me will be spreading to the other Stratums in no time at all.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
017	Many dragons will fall to this corruption. The world is going to change.
018	I can at least buy you some time, though. Time to prepare.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
019	I will...bear all the corruption...in this Lust Layer.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
020	Claybelle!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
021	Soon, I will lose self-awareness. I'll become mindless, like the ones I've quarantined. I need you to find the resolve...to kill me by then.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0042
022	...
023	Quence... I'm sorry. Please, take care of Ambrosia.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
024	I will.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
025	There has to be a way! I refuse to believe that there's not! I will find a way to save you!
026	...
027	Quence. We should—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
028	I know.
029	Claybelle. I won't pretend to understand how you felt as you protected this world. You're a dragon, and I'm a human.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0002
030	The span of time we've each lived is itself so far apart that it kind of boggles the mind. I quite literally can't even imagine what all has shaped and changed you over the years.
031	But you can at least rest assured that I'll carry on your will. One way or another. As best as I can.
032	I will protect this world, and every living person—especially Ambrosia. You have my word.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_battle_0019
033	Quence...
034	I guess this is goodbye.
035	So, this is where you've been, huh?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
036	Oh? Now, this is a rare sight!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0005
037	What could've possibly inspired an antisocial shut-in such as yourself to leave her room in the middle of the day, I wonder?
038	Huh? I'm not antisocial! I like people. Mostly.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0005
039	Bold words from someone who can count on one hand the number of people she's able to even make eye contact with.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0010
040	I'm not that bad! Are you sure you're not mistaking me for someone else? You do seem to have trouble remembering things sometimes!
041	I'm just teasing you, grumpy. Don't get into too many fights after I'm gone, all right?
042	I won't be able to hold you back anymore, you know?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
043	So... You're really going?
044	Yeah. There's not much time left.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
045	If we humans want to survive this calamity, then I'm going to have to venture into the outside world sooner or later. And, you know what they say: no time like the present...
046	Still...	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0020
047	There must be something we haven't tried yet. We only just started our observation and research. If you could just wait a little longer—
048	You got this, Ambrosia. I leave it in your capable hands.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0004
049	Come on!
050	While you search for a solution within these borders, I'll search outside of them. It's the smart move here! Division of labor, right?
051	That way, even if one of us fails, the other can pick up the slack!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0031
052	...Snf.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0018
053	C'mon, now, no crying allowed on these premises! You know I'm terrible with this sort of thing.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0020
054	You really don't need to worry. I'll definitely be back.
055	No matter how far I go or how long it takes, I'm comin' back. Promise!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0007
056	Really?
057	Count on it. We'll see each other again. From this day forward, I'm a friend of the dragons. And no friend of dragons is gonna be able to stay away from here for too long!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0008
058	Give Lil my regards, and tell her I hope to see her again sometime, too.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
059	Of course.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0038
060	...
061	No... No more crying. I need to do everything I can before they return.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0020
062	I'll dedicate myself to becoming the greatest witch there ever was!
063	That's surely what Claybelle would have wanted.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0006
064	Are you done with your farewells?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0002
065	Yep. Wasn't planning to get too teary-eyed or drag it out or anything. I am coming back as soon as I accomplish my goals, after all.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
066	If I'm too dramatic about it, it'll just feel awkward next time I step through that door.
067	You sure you're willing to come with us, though, stranger?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0003
068	I am. To be honest, I'm still reeling from everything that's happened, but...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
069	Now that I'm here, I can't possibly turn a blind eye.
070	A noble sentiment, that! Glad to have you with us. That power of yours to banish corruption will no doubt come in very handy.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0007
071	(He's so different in this time period. So much more...youthful, and vibrant. It's hard to even imagine the curmudgeon he's destined to become!)
072	What? Why are you staring at me like that? I don't like the look in your eyes. You're thinking something rude about me, aren't you?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0005
073	Of course not! Anyway, Lil, are you sure you don't need to say goodbye to your friend?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
074	Yeah. I'm not going to be away for long! We'll be back soon.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
075	Besides, we said enough goodbyes last night. We promised to see each other again, so I'm okay!
076	...
077	Then let us go. We each have our goals to accomplish.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
078	This can't be...
079	How could the Seeker, Waginau, wander into my memory like so?
080	I recall no such departure like this ever occurring.
081	Failing to kill Claybelle, I leave this place in haste with my princess.
082	Quence, who can manipulate space and time, ventures out alone, with nothing but pain and his meager resolve to see him through.
083	That is how the situation played out before. But this? Is it naught but a fantasy? Or could it be something more?
084	I must see this through. Perhaps at the end of this divergent path...
085	The answer we dragons lost may yet be found—the path to salvation upon which the Pursuer, Nimul, is struggling to find his footing.
086	Firstly, the Pillar of Lust has found a vessel within which it can take root.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
087	The successful altering of Claybelle's consciousness definitely falls outside of all expectations, however.
088	It is perhaps attributable to the transformative effects of sin and corruption upon a dragon's magil, as Melvillei predicted may occur.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
089	Indeed, that altered form was nothing more than a mindless beast. She functioned merely as a device for accumulating sin.
090	I cannot explain how it came to be, but I shall record these findings in great detail nonetheless.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
091	The creation of Cursed Dragons, whose power extends far beyond that of even True Dragons... If this is what comes of it...
092	Then we cannot expect to make any use of it on the battlefield whatsoever. They lack any capacity to effectively support our war efforts.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
093	We must be more prudent in the steps we take henceforth...
094	Given that we don't exactly have an infinite supply of expendable pawns, do we?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
