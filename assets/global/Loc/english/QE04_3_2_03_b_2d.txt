001	What's the matter today? It's rare for you to ask me out for a walk.	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
002	I really wanted to talk with you, Mocca. You're leaving tomorrow morning, right?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
003	...Yes.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
004	I heard that you're headed to Asena... Oh, and about the trial!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
005	Why...?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0020
006	Why can I never be of a help to you, Mocca?!
007	Tamis, calm down. This is something that I must overcome.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
008	That's what you always say, Mocca! You always try to shoulder everything on your own! There's no need for you to do it on your own, Mocca!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0019
009	Tamis...I am not shouldering this burden alone. Don't worry.	VO_moca.moca_battle_1028
010	But...!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0018
011	Besides, I promised you that day that I would protect you, didn't I?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
012	Hey, here comes Tamis. I know she can't see, but she's so bothersome walking around like that.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
013	I heard she was blinded so that she could see no corruption...but, to be honest, it's creepy.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
014	Yeah. Rumor has it that she's related to some extinct tribe...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0020
015	There's something sinister about her... She's probably the one that's brought misfortune to our village.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
016	Shh! She'll hear us. Apparently, since she can't see, she can hear really well. Seriously. What a menace.
017	Leave this village, you useless menace!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0005
018	......!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0043
019	What are you doing to my sister?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
020	Mocca...?!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
021	Who threw that rock just now?! Who's the one who hurt my sister...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
022	I will not forgive you!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0007
023	Is that...the power of the wind?!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0021
024	If you have any problem with Tamis, then you'll have to go through me! I'm going to protect her!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
025	Tamis, are you okay?	VO_moca.moca_battle_1028
026	Mocca...that power...	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
027	Never mind that. You're bleeding. I'll bandage you now. Why don't you say anything back to them?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
028	Well...my blindness is part of my vocation. I don't care what anyone says about me. More importantly, are you hurt, Mocca?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
029	Don't worry about me! ...I'm sorry for making you shoulder everything, Tamis.	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
030	I'm all right. Are you sure you're not hurt? You're always protecting me, Mocca.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
031	You worry about me too much, Tamis. I know you're my twin, but it's me who should be supporting you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
032	That's why I've decided that I'm going to protect you from everything out there!
033	That's the one thing I can do for you, Tamis!
034	Mocca...!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_1028
035	And...one day, I'm going to show you Saga...and all the world. Until that day comes, I will be your eyes and your shield!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
036	This I promise you now, as your brother: I will protect you, Tamis!
