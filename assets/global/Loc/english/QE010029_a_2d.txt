001	Why?! Why would you do something so terrible?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
002	All this will accomplish is repeating past tragedies.
003	So you survived, after all, Agatha Crowley. As promised, let's continue our talk. Come.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
004	As Sabareta moves forward, the citizens of Envylia, in an attempt to protect Agatha, stand in the way of the Lizard Brigade with pitchforks and sticks.
005	Do-don't come closer! Lady Agatha is our beacon of hope! We'll never give her to you!
006	... ...
007	So, you civilians, who've never held a sword in your life, plan to fight our blades with your sticks.
008	Stop! Everyone, stand back!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
009	Do-don't worry! We won't let them lay a finger on you, Lady Agatha!
010	Then let's see how your sticks hold up against my sword.
011	Agghh!
012	No!!!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0028
013	...Stop!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0015
014	Huh?!
015	I believe I told you not to lay a hand on any who are not knights. Do you need to be reminded of my orders?
016	M-my apologies, Sir!
017	...Why?
018	We are proud knights of the Kingdom of Wratharis.
019	Unlike your incorrigible knights of Envylia, we don't lay hands on civilians.
020	... ...
021	Lord Sabareta! There are Envylia knights in front of us! We're surrounded!
022	Tsk! I'll wipe them out! You lot, bring hostages!
023	Wait! I'll go! Just take me!
024	What?
025	Lady Agatha!
026	I'll lead you to an underground passage that takes you outside the castle. Use that, and you'll be able to leave without unnecessary conflict.
027	What're you playing at?
028	I want to reduce as many needless victims as I can. I'm sure you feel the same.
029	You expect me to take your offer seriously?
030	I swear I speak the truth.
031	... ...
