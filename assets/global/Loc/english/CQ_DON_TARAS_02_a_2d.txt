001	Did you hear? I heard that the shops in the city were ransacked by bandits again today.	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0002
002	Those castoffs of Wratharis again. The city guards can't do anything about them...	VO_mafia-b.mafia-b_sys_0030
003	...
004	What's your plan, Tango? Are you still not ready to take over as boss?	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0001
005	Don't be dumb. The Don is the head of Heaven district. There's no way I can do this.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0040
006	Sure, but where in the hell is the Don? I don't see him anywhere around here.	VO_mafia-b.mafia-b_sys_0001
007	Aren't we working together to find him right now? I'm sure he'll show up soon.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
008	You don't think he left the country, do you?	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0031
009	It's possible. He's a man of action that doesn't listen to what other people say. When he says he's out, he's really out.
010	Darn it... It's unbelievable how he just left. It's like he doesn't even care about anyone else.	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0030
011	What did you say?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0012
012	Now's not the time for arguing. Let's focus on the bandit problem.	VO_mafia-b.mafia-b_sys_0014
013	Bandits hailing from Wratharis are always end up targeting our country... If the boss is still absent...
014	Yeah, this country is just a loosely guarded treasure trove to them.
015	I know that. But to think the Don would thoughtlessly put everyone in jeopardy like that...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
016	We've got bigger things to worry about! We're getting more reports of attacks every day!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0002
017	On top of that, it looks like some members of our family have started to side with the bandits from Wratharis.	VO_mafia-b.mafia-b_sys_0022
018	...
019	The only reason they've been so quiet is because of the Don's reputation. We gotta get a new boss.	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0029
020	It's only a matter of time before they swallow Redington up whole.
021	I said I know that! You know I'm not gonna let some villains threaten the citizens! I just need a little more...	VO_tango.tango_battle_0019
022	...!
023	...Villains...
024	Huh?	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0016
025	I see. Hahaha... I get it now, Don.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
026	Tango?
027	Hey, tell everyone to sit tight and leave the bandits be for the time being.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0002
028	What?!
029	Hey, what about the mayoral election?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
030	What about it?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0025
031	With Don Taras gone and Heaven district quieting down, I think things are looking peaceful.
032	Are you asking me if I would vote for Mayor Edward? He's the guy who got in bed with Don Taras. He's probably cozying up to other mafia right now.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
033	True. Well, with all the bandit attacks, it's doubtful that an election will even be held.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
034	Cozying up, huh...
035	And to think, I didn't even get paid for all this "cozying up" people seem to think I was doing.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
036	D-Don Taras?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
037	Stop, pinhead. If you don't wanna die, give me what you're wearing.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
038	B-bandits!
039	Run! They're coming for us!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0028
040	Why are you messing around? Just kill him.
041	Eeek!
042	Hey, you blockhead over there! You too...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
043	W-wait... He's... Isn't that Don Taras?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
044	What?
045	I see the petty trash Wratharis tossed out is making quite the scene.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0001
046	H-hey... This is bad!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
047	B-but they said he was kicked out of his Family...
048	H-help!!!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
049	These guys are a cakewalk for you, right? Let 'em have it!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0002
050	No can do, I'm afraid.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
051	W-why?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
052	I'm not a mafioso anymore. I have no interest in getting involved in other people's turf wars.
053	What?!
054	They say that me being here corrupts the city, and I don't want that.
055	Heh. Sorry. Now I'm just some boring passerby checking out the sights of the city.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
056	!!!
057	Heh, heh. You mean you're not involved with this city anymore?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
058	It's not that I'm not involved, exactly. I'm here, aren't I? It's just that I'm not gonna fight you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
059	Heh...heheh! You hear that?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
060	Without Don Taras, there's nothing to fear! Hey! Contact main command!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
061	Take everything, roots and all! If they resist, kill them!
062	Eeeek!!!
063	Don't get me wrong. I said I won't be raising a hand.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
064	Huh?
065	Agh...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
066	Wh-wha...?
067	Don, aren't you having a little too much fun?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0001
068	Who, me? You don't have anything better to do than talk to me? I'm not your boss anymore.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
069	You're the one with a lot to say...
070	Hey, mafiosos! Crush every last one of these sneaky scumbags!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0002
071	Yeah!
072	Wh-wha—?! This isn't the last you'll be seeing of us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
073	That was a little much.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
074	Haven't you said enough? I'm not listening to you anymore.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0029
075	Hehe. Then why are you here?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
076	To wake up.
077	Wake up? You look pretty awake to me...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
078	Please stop deliberately misunderstanding me...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
079	Just like these citizens, I'm trying to wake up from this fake dream of taking peace for granted.
080	Hehe. You got true grit.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
081	Well, I learned it from one of the greatest villains of our time.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
