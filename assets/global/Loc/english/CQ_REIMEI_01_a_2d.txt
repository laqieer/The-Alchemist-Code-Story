001	Die!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_1014
002	Aghhhh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0043
003	I don't know the reason why you're being killed by me.
004	It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from, but, if I'm requested to kill you, I'll do it.
005	(Agh. I managed to complete my task, but I don't have my usual strength.)	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0013
006	(Ever since that day, I've developed a sense of hesitation.)
007	Is that you...Chihaya?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
008	(Chihaya's dancing is truly beautiful. Just watching her seems to cleanse me of my sins.)	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
009	(Still, ever since that day, I can't find the right words to tell her.)
010	Why would someone like you, from Wadatsumi...harm other individuals from Wadatsumi?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0013
011	I don't understand it.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0012
012	(Ever since I was young, I've never hesitated to kill someone that I've been assigned to.)
013	(Ever since she asked me that, I'm not sure about what I'm doing anymore.)
014	(What am I wielding my sword for?)	VO_reimay.reimay_chara_1007
015	...! What's that?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
016	What's going on? Who are you people?!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0028
017	Look who we have here. It's the priestess that's supposed to lead the reconstruction of Wadatsumi.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
018	She holds the hearts of her people in her hands. I'm sure we'll get a good price for her.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
019	Hey! Men, restrain her!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
020	What outrageousness!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
021	Hyahhhh!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
022	Be careful, Chihaya!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
