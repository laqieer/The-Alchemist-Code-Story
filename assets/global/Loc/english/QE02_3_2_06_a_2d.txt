001	Have you found the redhead?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
002	There've been traces of him having been in Drest, but we still haven't found him yet. I've told men to make frequent updates.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
003	This is Zeke's son we're talking about. I highly doubt he'll lay a hand on the young lady.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
004	I hope that's the case. But...why are we heading to Redington City all of a sudden?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
005	Isn't our priority to request the young lady?
006	Before that, I need to be sure of our reason for fighting.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
007	If we act based on our assumptions without determining our opponent's concept of justice...then we're no different than them.
008	Zeke will be laughing at us from the grave.
009	Zeke...?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
010	Just shut up and drive. Head to the city hall in the center of Redington City.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
011	Huh...?
012	I'm sorry for putting you through all of this.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
013	Your father's attempted rebellion led to the downfall of the Kingdom of Envylia.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
014	That's what I heard.
015	Is that true?
016	Why do you ask that?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
017	Because I can't think of you as a bad person—not you nor your father...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
018	Every human lives by their own interpretation of justice. Those were my father's words.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0019
019	However, only the justice of the victor remains. The vanquished are ultimately regarded as villains.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0020
020	What do you mean by that?
021	Well, you can use me and your knight in shining armor as an example. Here he comes now.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
022	Huh...?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
023	Hey there.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
024	Did you enjoy your brief date, prince charming? It's time you gave the princess back to me.
025	Edgar!!!
