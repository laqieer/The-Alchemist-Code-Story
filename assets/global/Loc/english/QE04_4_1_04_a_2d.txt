001	Why would it suddenly stop?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
002	This is perfect! All I need to do is slice its legs off and send its towering body to the ground! Then we'll have no need to climb its back!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
003	Hyaaaahhh!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
004	Keh! It's tougher than before!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0027
005	What is this?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0029
006	His attacks aren't making a scratch! What's happening?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
007	It doesn't look like it's about to move, either. In this state, we have no way of reaching our destination.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
008	Mocca, how do you read the situation?
009	I might just be imagining it...but it looks like the dragon slows down after each spurt of fire.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
010	It must take up an absurd amount of energy, so after each attempt, it has to rest before it can do it again...or maybe...
011	The fire increases its body temperature to the extent that it needs time to cool down. It might even be able to harden its scales...?
012	To stop us from attacking it from the outside while it's recovering...?
013	Then, let us return to the Wind Temple and flesh out a plan.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
014	Call back Voda and Fuu, and together, we'll figure out how to reach the core and destroy it.
015	What if it starts moving again while we're away?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
016	Rega, you keep a lookout. Report to us if you see the dragon move even the slightest.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
017	I'd like to start moving some of the animals to safety in the meantime. Would that be okay?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0002
018	I don't mind, as long as you stay near the Wind Temple.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
019	Understood! Let's go, Kiki!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0005
020	Georgios, you go with them, too! With your blade unable to breach the dragon's scales, we have no better solution than to rely on this plan.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
021	Hmph...!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
022	......
023	What's the matter, Tina?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
024	It's nothing...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
025	Glurrrppp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_b
026	Tch, looks like the dragon's current state has no effect on these! Get out of the way!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
