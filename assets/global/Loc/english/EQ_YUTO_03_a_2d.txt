001	I won't!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_battle_0011
002	Agh... They keep coming...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_battle_0022
003	Honestly, you're a handful to look after.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
004	Lu...cian?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1004
005	Don't let your emotions get the better of you when you wield power. It makes you no different than an animal.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0014
006	You've got to handle the situation calmly, constantly considering how you can gain the advantage.	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0002
007	Take down their formation. Make them scatter and then isolate them.	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0001
008	Your power truly comes to life when you read the situation and then act on it.	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0004
009	The way...to use my power?	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1008
010	Being a mercenary is a complex business—sometimes you attack and sometimes you protect.
011	And fighting to protect is the most difficult. After all...
012	To protect someone, you need to protect yourself first.	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0007
013	This all...really difficult...	VO_yuhto.yuhto_chara_1013
014	Anyway. It may take a while but remember this.	VO_rusia.rusia_event_1005
015	After all, this is the only time that I can watch your back!	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0010
016	Argh! What are you doing?!
017	Looks like that's their boss! Let's go, Yuto!	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0045
018	Got it!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0038
019	This forest is our beloved hometown. We'll not let you abuse it any further!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0032
020	The protectors of the forest, huh? In that case, you can become fertilizer along with your beloved forest!
021	Activate all remaining Guard Droids! We'll overpower them out by sheer numbers!
022	U-understood!
023	We've gotten permission from the boss! Use all units we've received from the Trading Company!
024	Mm...!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0018
025	Tsk. They still had leftover pawns. Let's defeat them before they can be activated. Match me, Yuto!	VO_rusia.rusia_battle_0009
026	Hyaaaah!	VO_yuhto.yuhto_sys_0032
