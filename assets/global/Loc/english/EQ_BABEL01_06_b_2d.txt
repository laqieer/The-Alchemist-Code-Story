001	It's been a while, Nina. Are you sure you're ready?	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
002	Yes! She's trained a lot and she's really strong now! If you see her in action, I'm sure you'll agree!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
003	I was surprised as well, but it's true. In addition, watching her fight showed me that she does know what she's getting herself into.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
004	Well... I mean, if Chloe is the one saying it, it's hard to deny, but...
005	What is the problem?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
006	...Erm... It's hard to admit, but relations between the therians and humans are not going well. It might be hard to get people to accept a therian joining one of the knight orders.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
007	It could cause...difficulties.
008	I see...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
009	What are you saying, Natalie?! Isn't the Scarlet Flame Guard a knight order that accepts anyone? That sees no class, background, or gender? Why would race matter?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
010	We're the Scarlet Flame Guard! Something as insignificant as race shouldn't matter to us as long as a knight is willing to help us protect joy and peace!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
011	So, I beg you! Let Nina join the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0041
012	I am of the same mind! Please, speak to Captain Vettel and give her a chance!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0041
013	I see. Nina, I have to be honest, since you seem set on this. You know Gerald, right?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
014	Yes...
015	Gerald is not a fan of therians, to put it lightly.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
016	I am...aware.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
017	Ah...but, of course, that's not the only reason we would stop you from trying to join... I just wanted to make sure you knew that.
018	It's just that he has had certain experiences...but he's really a very kind person. Honestly.
019	I am aware of that, as well.
020	Oh! Okay. I'm so sorry for all of this. I really do hope it all works out for you, Nina!
021	Thank you! I hope that I can properly express the things I want to...	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
022	You called me?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
023	Ah!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
024	Gerald! Um, so...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
025	I should tell you that I heard almost everything. I wasn't eavesdropping. You were just too loud to ignore.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
026	Hmph. It's you. That therian kid from before. Just to let you know, I don't let my personal feelings get in the way of what's best for the Guard. I am an impartial judge. If you have what it takes, then you have what it takes.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0044
027	Y-yessir! I'll do my best!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0041
028	Why do you wish to join the Scarlet Flame Guard?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
029	I want to pay forward the good deed you did for my people when you saved us!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
030	If that is why you wish to join, you are better off just going home now. I cannot allow you to join the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0017
031	But...why?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
032	Your convictions have no justice to them.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
033	Justice...?	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
034	Debts of gratitude, aspirations... These are shallow things. There are no knights in the Scarlet Flame Guard who do not carry both justice and conviction with them to the battlefield.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
035	So...my desire to pay your help forward is not an acceptable reason to join you?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
036	Aspirations do not save people.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0044
037	But...I did what you said! I trained every day! A thousand swings! Victor even said that he could sense my iron will!	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
038	"Respect none who use the sword without heart." Tell me... Once you have repaid your debt of gratitude, what do you have left? What will the purpose of your sword be?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
039	...
040	Is your conviction so weak that a simple question is enough to make you put down your sword?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
041	There is no place for someone without an iron will in the Scarlet Flame Guard.
042	If you truly wish to join, you must show me proof that you have the conviction to stand by your principles.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
043	...!
044	O-oh, Nina... Gerald, aren't you being a little too cold-hearted?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
045	No. Chloe, Victor, report.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
046	Come on! You're not even giving her a chance! You haven't seen what she can do!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
047	Are you willing to see her put her life on the line for such a flimsy reason? Are you willing to risk her life on the battlefield? Are you prepared to watch her die?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
048	...!
049	I'm telling you now that she does not have a place in the Scarlet Flame Guard until her convictions are more than just pretty words and petty, imagined debts of gratitude!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
050	Now... I will be waiting in my room. When you are prepared to do your duties, find me and give me your report on what happened at the volcano.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
051	That Gerald... He's really not great at stuff like this. He tried, though.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
