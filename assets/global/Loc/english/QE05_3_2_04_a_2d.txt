001	We're almost to the border. We should be seeing the Gluttony checkpoint soon.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
002	The security is heavier than I expected.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
003	There were already rumors of nobility and merchants from Gluttony Foss defecting when we were heading into the desert.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
004	If Ceclidis is in control of the military, I would expect him to enforce the prevention of such things.
005	What should we do? Should we cross the border through the mountains to avoid the checkpoint?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
006	No. They should be here soon.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
007	Who?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
008	Sorry to keep you waiting, boss.
009	Right on time. Good.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0008
010	Merchants?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
011	This caravan is transporting supplies and weapons to a fortress in Gluttony Foss.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
012	A country in the throes of a civil war is the prime client to sell weapons and supplies to. It wouldn't be strange if there were to be merchants who think like that, would it?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
013	Interesting.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0044
014	These are real weapons, but of course we won't really be selling them to Gluttony's army.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
015	They'll be meeting up with the rebel forces after crossing the border to make contact for us.
016	They will negotiate their support on our behalf.
017	Why aren't we going with them?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
018	We were attacked by the Collectors of Wisdom.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
019	There is a chance that we are under their surveillance.
020	We need to move as a small number to increase our chances of avoiding their eyes.
021	I see.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0045
022	Now let's join the caravan and cross the checkpoint. This is where the real fighting starts.	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
023	Halt! What's in the wagon?
024	It's a shipment of supplies to the fortress. Here's my letter of introduction.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0006
025	This does seem legitimate. All right, move along!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0004
026	Did it work?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
027	Looks like it. Hopefully nothing will go wr—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
028	Now! Attack!
029	What the—? It's a raid!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
030	Argghhh!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0022
031	Time is of the essence! Take what you can, and set fire to the rest! Try to avoid combat where you can!
032	This is unexpected.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
033	What should we do?! They'll take all the supplies!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
034	I say that we aid the Gluttony army here.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
035	It should make our travels ahead much easier if they owe us a favor.
036	But do not use Alchemy or Ouija. We cannot afford to have our identities uncovered just yet.
037	Don't worry, I have a bow! Let's go, Logi!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
038	I'll take care of the bandits around the wagon!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
