001	General Leordas is on the far end of the village, taking in any survivors that manage to escape!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
002	Both of you should head that way!
003	Leave this place to the Liberation Army for now! You should fall back and reorganize your forces!
004	Understood! Isidore, can you move?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
005	Aah...
006	They got the jump on us here. Cursed Ceclidis! He must have had his eye on this village from the beginning.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0020
007	This must be the hidden village of the Sephira, the elusive tribe that protects the great tree.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
008	I estimate the enemy has five times our numbers. In addition, the village's defenses have been nullified, and there are likely still reinforcements due to arrive from the royal capital.
009	This battle may mean certain death.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
010	It does not matter. The Liberation Army cannot forsake any of those who live in the South!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
011	We must first find and rescue any survivors. If the enemy takes any hostage, we will lose any advantage we might have.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0037
012	Tell me, are you willing to follow me even in the face of certain death?	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0001
013	Lord Waginau has commanded us to see this fight through to the end. Besides, the slaughter of innocent people is unconscionable.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
014	This battlefield is heartless, merciless, and, above all, lacks justice. It is our duty to remedy that situation.
015	Very well.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
016	Warriors of the Liberation Army!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0002
017	Behold! This is the barbarism of the Royal Army! This is Ceclidis' answer to the cries of our people!
018	The nobles of the North no longer consider us to be people! They will seize, destroy, and exploit all that we have built!
019	It is clear what we must do! It is clear who we must protect!
020	You all know what must be done! Now, warriors! Take up your swords for the sake of our compatriots, and for justice!
021	Forward!!!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0030
022	Huzzah!!!
023	This roar... Is that the Liberation Army assaulting the Royal Army?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
024	We should hurry and meet up with the other villagers.
025	Urgh...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
026	Isidore! Are you all right? Here, show me your wounds.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
027	I'm fine. I don't hear the voice in my head anymore.	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
028	Voice? The voice of Sephiron?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
029	Yes, but not the Sephiron we grew up with, filled with warmth and light.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
030	It was more like a resounding echo in a hollow place, beckoning me to sink deeper and deeper into the abyss. It is...horrible.
031	Enough. Do not force yourself to speak. Let's just make our way to the Royal Army. Everybody should be there.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
032	Yes, you're right.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
