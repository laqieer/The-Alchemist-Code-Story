001	Th-this is...!
002	We are now in the realm of the Truth. This place is the fountain of power for we who wield the Alchemy Source.
003	Agatha!
004	What is this? Some sort of crystal? Or is this...ice?
005	Dangit! How can I free her?!
006	Use Leviathan!
007	What?
008	That cage is made from the Alchemy Source.
009	A Sacred Stone with the same energy properties should be able to match its power and shatter its walls!
010	Now pray, and channel your thoughts into saving her!
011	The Sacred Stones and the Alchemy Source share similar properties?
012	I... I'm not a worthy vessel for the Sacred Stone.
013	Leviathan has never responded to my call.
014	That is because you never wished for it to.
015	Logi, you have always been opposed to the idea of using the Sacred Stones to change the world.
016	Leviathan sensed this from you, and in response, kept its powers from you.
017	That stone has already formed a bond with you.
018	Leviathan is waiting for you to unleash its power.
019	Leviathan is waiting...for me?
020	I won't let you get in my way!
