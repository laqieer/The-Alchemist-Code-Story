001	Hey, Rahu! Come here!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
002	What's going on?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0005
003	We have a girl's only chocolate making thingy. Actually, I want to use Valentine's Day...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
004	To do something about Albea's pink-haired brother and sister.
005	Oh, that sounds good!
006	I'll ask Fraise and see if we can use that channel to talk with the guys...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
007	That sounds like a great idea! If we do both at the same time, it might be more effective! Do you want me to go ahead and tell Polin about it?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0045
008	Of course! After all, Polin was the most interested in those siblings...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
009	We're all thinking that she should hurry up and say something...
010	All right then! We'll now commence our Valentine’s Day event!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
011	Yeah!
