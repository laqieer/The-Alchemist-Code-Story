001	So, how have your mentors been performing lately?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
002	In a word? Terribly!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
003	They still don't get any work done, they're always teasing me and joking around...	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
004	And the other day, they came into work with hangovers so bad, they could barely move!
005	I see.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
006	Why can't they just do their jobs? I mean, they're talented enough. It wouldn't even be that hard for them!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
007	If they would just put some effort in, they could be at the top of the Holy Guard by now!
008	Hmhm. That they might... But I think what they truly value lies elsewhere.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
009	On another note... Don't you think you're being a bit too hard on them?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
010	Huh?!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
011	After all, they seem quite fond of you. I'm sure they'd be sad to hear that you have nothing but complaints to tell of them.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
012	Oh, um...
013	W-well... There is one good thing I can say about them.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
014	And what would that be?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
015	They're very kind. They helped me carry my bags, the other day.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
016	Pardon the intrusion.
017	What the...?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
018	Magnus! Would you mind telling me what's going on?!
019	What do you mean?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
020	Why did you give Captain Kaya a report about dangerous elements in Real Heaven?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
021	Oh, that? That was just a little something I took care of while you were helping Captain Othima with his errand.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
022	And why is this the first I'm hearing of this?!
023	Look, there were concerns that the recent spike in suspicious activity in Real Heaven had something to do with Alchemy, so I was asked to investigate.
024	My findings showed that there was no reason for the Holy Guard to get involved, and that's what I wrote in that report.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
025	Mind if I ask what led you to that conclusion?
026	Obviously, the fact that Alchemy wasn't involved. That means it's a problem for the Slothstein government, not us.
027	The motivation behind the planned purge of Real Heaven is to punish it for sponging off the city's power supply.
028	Wh-what?!
029	Considering the lacking state of the town's hygiene, there are also fears that some kind of plague might be festering down there.
030	It's been left alone up till now because no one wanted to mess with the mafia, but it can't be ignored forever.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
031	So someone paid off another underworld gang to pick a fight with the mafia and wipe out Real Heaven once and for all.
032	I see... I suppose Alchemy really isn't involved, then. Still, that's somehow even more extreme.
033	But what's going to happen to the people down there?!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
034	Don't ask me. My job ended with that report.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
035	You can't be serious!	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0019
036	There are innocent people down there! If a fight like that breaks out, someone's bound to get hurt—or worse!
037	Fine... I'm going to help them! Captain Othima, please give me leave to go and—	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
038	Sorry, Ryui. I can't do that.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0014
039	Like Magnus said, this is a problem for the Slothstein government. We can't afford to get involved in matters outside our jurisdiction.
040	The Holy Guard only has the authority to intervene when Alchemy is involved. Since that isn't the case here...
041	Not only that, but we've just received official orders not to intervene. I'm afraid we couldn't grant you permission even if we wanted to.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
042	That's interesting. If I didn't know any better, I'd think some kind of collusion was going on here.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
043	(What are they trying to hide?)
044	But then... What's going to happen to the town?
045	How can we be told to just abandon them to their fates?
046	Ryui, you've been given a direct order from your superiors. You're expected to follow it, regardless of what your personal views might be.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
047	I know that, but—	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0019
048	Or are you saying there's something you want to prioritize above your duty to the Holy Guard?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
049	Magnus...
050	You're a paladin now, remember? Don't forget what that means. You wouldn't want people's hard-earned taxes to go to waste, would you?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
051	I...
052	You're right. I...should go calm down.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0036
053	Good. You're not a little girl anymore.
054	Magnus... This is just like what happened with the mock battle, isn't it?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
055	I've got no idea what you mean.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
056	You knew how it would make me feel to hear that, after having just gone back to Real Heaven.
057	Well, if you think you know what's afoot, what do you plan to do about it, Ryui?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
058	I... I realize I've been selfish.
059	You have a bit, haven't you? But that's fine. It just means you have the ability to do what you want, and make it work for those around you.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
060	Not just anyone can do that, you know.
061	Personally, I'm glad you joined the Holy Guard.
062	Because like attracts like?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
063	Because sometimes it takes a bunch of selfish paladins to do what's right.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
064	And that flower wouldn't be sprouting in Real Heaven right now without your help. You worked hard to create an environment where it could grow.
065	I'm going to go back to...to pick something up.
066	Justice isn't gonna fill your belly, remember?
067	Maybe not, but you showed me that justice is about helping people. Not everyone can save themselves like I did.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
068	That's why I have to go. I left something there that I can't do without, and I'm going to go pick it up.
069	You keep talking like you're doing it all by yourself, but you're not. Remember, you're not alone in this. Not now, not ever.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
070	So do what feels right. Let your own sense of justice lead you, because we'll have your back.
071	My own sense of justice...
072	Yep. It's up to you. What do you want to do? Who do you want to help?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
073	I...
074	I want to help everyone—everyone in Real Heaven!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
075	All right, then.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
076	Hah. It's pretty ironic that we're the ones standing up for absolute justice now.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
077	But...the Holy Guard isn't allowed to get involved. What are we going to do?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
078	Who said anything about getting involved? You're going back to pick something up, and we'll just be there to escort you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
079	Now I see why they call you the troublemaker.
080	Heh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
081	So, are we going, or what?
082	Yes. Let's do this!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0037
083	Be careful, you three.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
084	Yes, please take care. I've heard things have only gotten worse down there of late.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
085	Huh. You packed light today. I mean, compared to last time.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
086	Well, that's because the other half of what I need is still in Real Heaven, where I left it.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
087	By the way, Mister Othima... I just wanted to thank you again for inviting me to join the Holy Guard. It was easily one of the happiest moments of my life.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0001
088	Really? Well, I'm glad to hear it. Good luck out there.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
089	Thank you.	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0018
090	Tch... Who're you lot workin' for, anyhow?!	VO_mafia.mafia_battle_0019
091	That is none of your concern. We are merely here to clean up the streets of your little town.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
092	Aaaaaahhh!
093	No!	VO_liuie.liuie_battle_0019
094	Are you all right?!
095	Ryui! You came to help us!
096	Things're really kicking off down here, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
097	And who are you three?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
098	No one worth mentioning. Right, guys?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
099	Right. Just consider us...allies of justice.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0037
