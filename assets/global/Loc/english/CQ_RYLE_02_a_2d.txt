001	... ...
002	What is it? Is there something on my face?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0005
003	I'm surprised you followed me this far.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
004	What are you talking about? You were the one who told me to. As the Successor of the Sun, I am willing to endure hardship to obtain that which I want!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
005	Right. Got it.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
006	Have no fear! I will fight off any danger.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0038
007	Rest assured, as your client, I have every intention of riding along with you!
008	(...Seriously. I didn't actually think he'd tag along.)	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
009	Amazing! You've truly lived up to my expectations! I am shocked that you managed to procure this amount of fine art during this time period!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
010	I went way over and beyond. This as far as it goes. If you're satisfied, then hurry on back home.	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
011	What are you talking about?! This is just a portion of the items I've listed up! Here's the next list!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0014
012	...!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0018
013	About the money, I'm willing to pay double from now! Thanks to you lot, my collection is growing increasingly complete. I am grateful, Ryle!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0010
014	You seem to have misunderstood something.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
015	What?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0012
016	You rich folk are always like that. You think that you can procure anything with money. I hate people that are like that.	VO_ryle.ryle_chara_1009
017	What are you talking about?! I am paying a price that is more than generous. You have no right to say that about me! I'm your customer! Your client!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
018	Money isn't always the solution to everything.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
019	The fact of the matter is, in order to fulfill your unreasonable requests, my men are placing themselves in considerable danger.
020	What are you trying to say?!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0001
021	Would you be willing to risk your own life in order to get these items that you want?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
022	... ...
023	My point exactly. Our business with each other ends here.	VO_ryle.ryle_event_1009
024	Hmph. Is that what this is all about? Of course I'd be willing to risk my own life in order to obtain what I want!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0010
025	Huh...?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0025
026	My name is Ramses. I am the Successor of the Sun. No living soul will stand in my way!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
027	(I'm sure he'll go running at the first sign of trouble.)	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
028	The guard I sent out as a scout should be returning soon. If there are any goblins, we may consider turning back.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
029	Why?! We've come this far!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
030	Do you really plan to put your life on the line? You know as well as I do that nothing is worth that price.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0014
031	Lord Ryle, there is a goblin's nest up ahead. It would be wise to turn back.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
032	I see. Soldiers, let's head back.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0020
033	Wait! We cannot retreat now. We continue onward.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0014
034	What are you talking about? You heard what he just said, didn't you? There's a goblin's nest up ahead. That's a clear and present danger.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
035	I am well aware of the danger. All of you, stand back. I will wipe out the goblins.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0016
036	We just need to fall back. There's no need to push yourself like that!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0015
037	Of course there is. There is no better reason than my desire to obtain what I want!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0012
038	(This guy...!)	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
039	No matter what threat may lie ahead, I will eliminate it! After all, all that is worth obtaining must come at a price!	VO_rameses.rameses_battle_0010
040	Prepare yourselves, goblins! My life is not so cheap as to be wasted on you!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0032
041	...!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0027
