001	Heheh! What do you think? I'm pretty strong when I want to be, right?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
002	Aghh...uggh!!! Impossible...I've never seen such...haphazard magic!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0027
003	Liz, how are you feeling? Were you able to rest a little?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
004	Yes! Thank you, both of you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
005	All right, then let's hurry on ahead!
006	I think the prison is in the basement. I didn't see any prison while we were making our way to the queen.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
007	Let's start by searching for stairs!
008	Got it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
009	Liz, did you find any?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
010	There are too many doors! I can't find any!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
011	We need to search everywhere! Where's Rebecca?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
012	Aghhh!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0024
013	Eeeek?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0025
014	Re-Rebecca?! Did you get rid of them on your own?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
015	Well...um...the enemy didn't have any armor on so it was easy...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
016	What do you mean?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
017	Th-thanks! I managed to not get turned into an insect!
018	No way...is that the Succubus Ritual? No...it can't be. I mean...that...that...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0022
019	Rebecca...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
020	Give her some time to recuperate, Liz. Let's search for the stairs!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
021	Huh? He-hey, Alma?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
022	This door is suspicious...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
023	Why?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
024	It's tinged with magic. I think if we touch it...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
025	Whoa! All these letters came floating up!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
026	It's a code.
027	If we use these letters to make a password, the door will unlock. I have something similar in my house.
028	Rebecca! Are you okay now?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
029	...Yes, I guess.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
030	The problem is the password. If this is connected to the prison, then the queen must have chosen the password.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
031	There they are! It's Lisbeth and the others! Catch them!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
032	The pursuers are already here!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
033	You two, handle them! I'll take care of the unlocking the key.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
034	Huh?! Can you open it?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
035	I have about 10 possible ideas in my head. I'll try all of them! Buy me some time!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
036	I-I don't really understand, but all right!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
