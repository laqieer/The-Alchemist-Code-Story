001	Huff…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0030
002	What am I doing here…?
003	Hurry! Hurry! Or we'll miss the candy!
004	Wait for me!
005	Hey, where am I supposed to put this stuff?
006	Line it up over here. Also…
007	(Everyone seems to be having fun, but I don't want to be suspected of being a vampire and causing a fuss like before...)	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0031
008	(Looks like a festival where children are the focus. Best to stay out of the way and not stand out.)
009	Found ya! Here, have some!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
010	Hyahh?!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0026
011	Th-this is…candy?
012	They're being handed out. It's Halloween candy. Pretty good stuff, eh?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
013	R-Ramses? What are you doing here?
014	I didn't see you around even though this festival was happening.
015	As I, Ramses, successor to the sun, was invited here to this event again…
016	…means that I have the obligation to make sure everyone is having fun! And that includes you too!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0023
017	M-me too? But, this seems to be a festival for the city's children…
018	My take on Halloween is that everyone no matter their age should be having fun.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
019	Adults, children, phantom soldiers should equally be part of the event!
020	Equally…
021	(Even though people have called me a monster, am I really to be included here…?
022	It's time to come with me and receive candy with smiles. Let's go, Coredlia!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
023	Huh…? W-wait a minute!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
024	If I…hand out candy, the people might get scared…
025	Scared? Of what?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
026	Um… Because…of what happened before…
027	That was then and this is now. Look at how you're treated by people now, compared to before. Things have changed.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
028	If the environment changes, the people will also change.
029	In addition to that, I'm here to help!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
030	Ramses…
031	(He's accepting me for who I am without prejudice…)
032	Well, you're right. I'll do my best then.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0004
033	That's the spirit! I have an idea. Why not also invite Tethys?
034	Huh?
035	But I'm not good at this sort of thing…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0001
036	See, Tethys is saying she can't. Don't worry, we can play together instead, okay?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0011
037	No! I want Tethys to play with me!
038	…
039	What's going on over there?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
040	Ramses! Don't start running so suddenly...
041	Hey, Ramses and Cordelia!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0003
042	It seems there was an argument going on. And so I'm here to settle it!
043	So, what seems to be the problem?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0005
044	Okay, so this child wants to play together with Tethys…	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
045	I want Blanchett and Tethys to both play with me!
046	The two of them can play together. Just not me…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0030
047	Why??? Let's play together!
048	Hm…	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
049	Alright, little girl. First, why don't you help me hand out some candy!
050	Hand out candy…? Sounds fun! But Tethys…
051	Sounds good! Tethys, when you're ready you can join us, right?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0044
052	Well…	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0004
053	(I'm sorry…)
054	(I won't be any fun for them, so I really shouldn't be joining…)
055	H-help! Someone help!!!
056	What the…? What was that?!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
057	Someone's screaming!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0025
058	Over there!
059	What happened?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0002
060	Rattys came and took our goods!
061	Numa! Numaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
062	Are those the goods for the costume parade? Where are they taking them? We won't let them get away!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
