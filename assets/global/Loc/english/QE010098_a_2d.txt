001	Dias and Gabirond find themselves confronting a group of knights from the Lizard Brigade.
002	After you advanced towards Envylia with your blades drawn, do you truly think there can be peace between us?!
003	Of course not.
004	...What?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
005	Our rage is not so petty that it can be this easily quenched!
006	Our ever-increasing resentment towards Envylia will never dissipate!
007	Lord Sabareta has merely been overturned by Zeke and the others and is wandering astray!
008	We...have no desire to coexist with Envylia!
009	You despicable scum of Envylia...! You naively come to talk of peace negotiations without ever having atoned for your sins.
010	Your arrogance has not changed since the old days!
011	You...!
012	This is the reality. Not all wish for peace.
013	There are those who, unable to escape their past hatred, continue to direct their rage towards Envylia.
014	Captain Zeke must have known that by announcing peace, there would be those who would oppose it.
015	Is he attempting to plunge Envylia into chaos?
016	Tsk! I told you not to ridicule my father!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
017	As the man who took you in when you were a war orphan and raised you...I understand your desire to believe in him.
018	However...it is none other than Captain Zeke's judgment that has given rise to this situation.
019	Is it plausible that he had some ulterior motive other than peace?
020	D-don't make me repeat myself! My father would never—
021	Face reality, Dias. The reality before your eyes...
022	We will never forgive Envylia!!!
023	Agh! What were you thinking, father?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
024	If your decision was based on the hope for peace in this world...then your thinking was flawed!
025	Even if temporary peace were to be made, the deep-rooted rage of Wrath would remain! In that case...!
026	You're right. Better to tear out the buds of hatred from their roots.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
