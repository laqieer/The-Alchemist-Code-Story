001	You don't want to fight?!
002	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
003	You ungrateful little worm! Who do you have to thank for being alive? Who's the one who brought you up from nothing? Are you just going to throw all of that back in my face?!
004	Hmm... I suppose Bianca could draw in the customers. I've left her alone up till now, because you've been doing so well in your fights. Would you have her become my new moneymaker?
005	N-No...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
006	If you're so intent on not fighting, how about you just die instead? You get plenty of chances to kick the bucket every damn day! Why complain to me when you can just take one? To spite me?!
007	N-no!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
008	No, go on! Go get yourself killed! Just lose a match, and throw it all away! I won't miss you!
009	Do you even have a reason to live? If you're not going to earn your keep, keel over and die, right now! When your body grows cold and lifeless, you won't have to fight ever again!
010	You're good-for-nothing garbage! Utterly worthless!
011	When you're not fighting, all you do is take up space! Understand?!
012	...
013	I will do my best.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
014	Well, there's a fresh perspective. These war orphans aren't normally treated like humans.
015	To the people who buy and sell them, they're just a cheap commodity with a variety of uses.
016	They can provide manual labor, learn circus tricks, become guinea pigs for experiments...whatever you need.
017	To top it all off, they're pretty malleable. Easy enough to keep them from rebelling against you.
018	You just have to convince them that it's their fault, not yours.
019	Make them feel responsible for some of the damage.
020	"And the victory goes to Amu! Another glorious bloodbath, ladies and gentlemen!"
021	"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"
022	Aaaaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0032
023	"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"
024	My stomach hurts!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
025	Huh?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0042
026	The more I fight, the more it hurts!
027	I-I'm sorry, but...if I don't... If I don't fight, then I'll...I'll be thrown away!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0036
028	And then Bianca... Poor Bianca!
029	Listen how they cheer for you!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0004
030	I-I really thought that if I kept doing my best, then someday... Someday...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
031	For your blood to be splattered across these walls! You've kept them waiting for ever so long!
032	Someday someone would...p-praise me. Be...kind to me. Even though I'm such a stupid... Such a...a... Uwaaaah!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
033	I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted! Did you like prancing around in that ridiculous dress of yours? Did it feel good to fight while the crowd cheered you on?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
034	I did everything I was told!
035	So why does my stomach still hurt?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
036	I always did the best I could! Every single day!
037	Nihil!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
038	Shh. Just leave it to me!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
039	Huh?
040	Let me handle this.
041	Understood.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
042	"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"
043	Aaaaaaahhh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
044	Rraaah!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
045	Haa...haa...haa...
046	Your strength is incredible.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
047	H-huh?
048	I'm kinda jealous.
049	I-I never wanted it!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
050	I-I'm only strong because I had to be! For Bianca! To survive!
051	You did your best.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
052	Ah!
053	You fought, and fought well, because you had no other choice.
054	Th-there was nothing to eat! I-I couldn't talk! I couldn't do a-anything!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
055	The only freedom I had was the freedom to move my hands. I wanted to use them to help, but...!
056	But helping wouldn't fill your belly. You had to kill to drink blood, to live another day.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
057	I-I've killed so many people! I even drank their blood!
058	I've done s-so many terrible th-things!
059	Sometimes, you have to do despicable things to survive. That's how it is for people like us.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
060	P-people like...us?
061	Yes, us. We're all terrible. But there's no point stressing about it and giving yourself a bellyache. Been there, done that.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
062	...!
063	Instead...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
064	How about you keep doing your best, but for yourself this time?
065	What do you mean?
066	I'm just saying... Why not fight to turn this messed up world on its head?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
067	You've got the strength to make it happen. You just need to keep going, and put the past behind you.
068	...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
069	You can still put those hands of yours to good use.
070	My...hands?
071	Use 'em to fight back. An eye for an eye.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
072	Unless you're happy to just let all your grudges go unsettled? Do you really want to carry them around on your back forever?
073	Do you want to be on the receiving end until the day you die? No? Then you've gotta speak up. You've gotta show the people who corralled you that you're not ready to lay down and die.
074	You've got to survive, whatever it takes. And when you're put on the chopping block, you'll have no choice but to take on the role of the villain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
075	You're starving, aren't you? Well, so are we.
076	...!
077	I am very hungry.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
078	We couldn't just leave her behind.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
079	That doesn't mean she has to follow us all the way to Veda!
080	Hey, Amu. Since Nihil's too busy having a tantrum to hear this, allow me to let you in on a little secret.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
081	Oh?
082	I'm literally right here!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
083	It's about that eyepatch of yours.
084	I can hear every word you're saying!
085	What is it?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0006
086	That day, Nihil wanted an excuse to talk to you, and that eyepatch was the best thing he could come up with.
087	Ohh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0009
088	Shut up! That's not true.
089	As for why he had it on him in the first place...he actually bought it for himself.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
090	Why?
091	I suppose he wanted to show off, or something like that. Perhaps he thought it'd make him look cool and dangerous, like a war veteran?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
092	You know, most people associate eyepatches with pirates.
093	Aha! See? He was definitely trying to show off.
094	Was not. I was planning on trying it out for the same reason many pirates do.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
095	Isn't that usually because they lost an eye?
096	Sometimes, but I've also heard it helps them fight better in the dark.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
097	For example, when boarding an enemy vessel, you might have to move between a bright, sunlit deck and a dark hold. Your eyes would need to adjust, but you don't have time for that when every second is life or death.
098	However, if one of your eyes was covered by an eyepatch, that eye would already be used to the dark. You'd only need to remove the patch to be able to see your surroundings and leap instantly into the fray.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
099	Wow. What an infodump.
100	Ooh! Interesting.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0024
101	Come on, be honest. You also thought it'd make you look cool, didn't you?
102	Just a bit.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0050
103	You two really are polar opposites.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
104	Huh?
105	On the one hand, we've got Amu, who barely says anything at all; on the other, we have Nihil, who talks way, way too much.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
106	Hey, if you don't make yourself heard in this world, you'll wind up being forgotten. So if you've got something to say, you have to speak up, or lose out.
107	I've been thinking this for a long time, but you really need someone strong enough to listen to those rants of yours and...reflect them.
108	Reflect them? As in, back at me?	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
109	No, silly. Out to the rest of the world.
110	...
111	You balance each other out, like a positive and negative charge.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0005
112	I guess we do make a pretty good team.
113	...
114	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
115	Oho! I thought you hated kids, women, and animals?
116	I do. A lot. They're the top three scariest things in this world. And the strongest.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
117	Mystic Tower Veda - 100th Floor
118	Heed me.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0003
119	Huh?!
120	You who have followed in the footsteps of your predecessor.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
121	...
122	Wielder of dark powers, who wishes for the world to acknowledge him.
123	I hear a...voice.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
124	What? I don't hear anything.
125	You two wait here.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
126	But...!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
127	You sure? Not even Dead Nine has gone beyond the hundredth floor.
128	Someone's waiting for me.
129	Who?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
130	My name is Nero. I am the darkness. That is all I know.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
131	I am a pioneer.
132	I am she who seeks to break this world with truth. I am she who would twist the threads of fate. I am power incarnate.
133	Do you crave power?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
134	Yes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
135	Give me your sacrifice, and you will receive...a revelation.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0006
136	Pay the price, and you will receive the power you seek.
137	All right. Sounds good.
138	But...!
139	You're not afraid?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
140	Why would I be?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
141	All I do is provide the opportunity for power to be gained. As for those who seize this chance...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
142	They must give up that which makes them who they are, or that which keeps them going.
143	In doing so, they will receive an explosive boost in power.
144	Would that satisfy you?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0016
145	Are you truly willing to discard your identity? To shatter your personality? You should know that most of those who undergo this transformation...
146	Lose their sanity as well.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0021
147	What?!
148	Every single weak-willed person who has sought power beyond what they are capable of has ended up losing sight of who they are, destroying themselves in the process.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
149	They have become...inhuman.
150	However, such failures can never be undone.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
151	...
152	Now, tell me.
153	Do you have something you consider important to you? Do you have someone or something that ensures you never lose sight of yourself?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
154	...
155	Would you be willing to give up that person or thing in exchange for power?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
156	Will you still be able to hold on to your humanity, even after you have lost that crucial part of you?
157	...!
158	I've already made up my mind.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
159	(The truth is...)
160	This is exactly what I want.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
161	(I'm scared out of my wits.)
162	Where are you going?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
163	Amu?
164	Do you really have to do this?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
165	...
166	I'm not fit to be the villain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
167	Why are you rushing into this?
168	Amu? What is it? What did you hear?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0003
169	How can you agree to something so...terrifying?
170	(I...)
171	Don't do it!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
172	Amu!
173	Don't follow me!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
174	Don't disappear!
175	Wh—?!
176	You're all I have left!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
177	Amu...!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
178	Why must humans have such inflexible wills?
179	That voice sounded so familiar.
180	Not that I can talk.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0042
181	I can barely wield my own powers... All I do is destroy every last human whose path crosses mine.
182	For what reason was I born? Was it only to destroy?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0043
183	So I ran towards it, without hesitation.
184	What am I? What is my purpose?
185	I have made yet another failure.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0021
186	I never meant to make anyone sad.
187	Will I ever get it right, I wonder?
