001	That's just a load of hypocrisy!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
002	There is honor in it.
003	Self-righteous bull!
004	The world isn't easy to change. Violence and pillaging only breeds more of the same and it eats away at this world without end.
005	And you say you represent absolute justice?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
006	The only absolute is that what you lot are doing is wrong.
007	You needlessly spread tragedy, rendering our efforts to establish peace futile.
008	...
009	Futile...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
010	Then I, too, was...
011	Let me tell you about what it means to take on a job that you know you won't return from.
012	I'm talking about a job with high risk and negligible returns. A job for the most pitiful of pitiful: those whose lives are most valuable in the act of throwing it away.
013	Dragon hunting?
014	A dirty job reserved for those seen as expendable.
015	Assassination is one of those jobs brought to Lost Blue in secret from Greed Dike.
016	The people of Lost Blue who live in the shadows are perfect for it: they are untraceable and expendable assets for Greed Dike to exploit.
017	A wretched business that could be likened to climbing aboard a ship made of mud doomed to sink. And yet for those of us already drowning in Lost Blue, it was all we had.
018	The target... The Flame Dragon King Cadanova, the Guardian of the Land?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
019	A job in which we take lives without ever being told why. That is what we have been reduced to.
020	Nobody's willing to take this job anymore. I am prepared to make the pay worth your while.
021	What do you mean by "anymore"?
022	Exactly what I said. I'm very disappointed. The hardy, infamous villains of Lost Blue are all acting cagey.
023	They're all declining this job, making excuses about not being able to kill the guy who defeated Vanir.
024	Oh... I see.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0045
025	They think he's a real dragon or something.
026	They've been reading too many fairy tales.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
027	Dragons aren't real.
028	Quit acting all high and mighty!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
029	What?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
030	Ex Atmosphere!!!
031	Hm...
032	Argh! He's too strong!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
033	Have you any sense of honor?
034	When has honor ever put food on the table?!
035	Those without honor have no right to hold power.
036	I-I don't wanna die!
037	Aghh!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
038	Is there not even a shred of honor in you?
039	What the hell is honor supposed to be anyways?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
040	Have you no honorable will?!
041	My whole life I've been trying to run from the pointless, tired waste that is all I have ever known, but what waited for me at the end of the tunnel...
042	Dammit! Tell me, who do you think would've taught me about something like honor?
043	Life on the verge of burning away.
044	Someone who lives their life alone will die alone.
045	And without ever accomplishing anything. That was the life I was going to leave behind.
046	What the hell was I supposed to do instead?!
047	...
048	What the hell was the point of any of it?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
049	Why did I even bother to...?!
050	?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
051	At least you weren't a complete waste.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
052	Y-you...!
053	Vanir...
054	I'm honored that you remembered me.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
055	It would have been wiser of you to just disappear.
056	Now, absolute justice... I told you, didn't I?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
057	There's always some sort of reprisal if you let an evildoer go free.
058	What did you do? Your Alchemia has changed... You seem incomparably more powerful than before.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
059	Does it please you? You ought to compliment me on the results of my considerable efforts.
060	In such a short period of time... How?
061	I've been diligently climbing a particular tower, you see.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
062	I suppose I can't afford to let you go again.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
063	Take a good look.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
064	Huh?
065	That is what the world considers to be the image of justice.
066	Hear the lamentation of my soul.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0001
067	What the—?!
068	Phantom Karmacoma—
069	There it is, that's what got me last time.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
070	It's...a dragon.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0028
071	It's really a dragon!
072	Isn't that just unfair?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0016
073	I've been forced to fight alone. This raging fire of righteousness incinerates all: powerful enough to dry the tears of dragons, it also poses a danger to my comrades.
074	Hear these tearless lamentations.
075	Oh, get over yourself, you hypocrite.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
076	The things that the greater nations do always end up getting copied by others. It has always been like that throughout history.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
077	What?
078	Watch.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
079	Wha—?!
080	This is...!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
081	...
082	Phantom Karmacoma!
083	A...unicorn?
084	What incredible talent.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
085	Talent? No. This is a result of hard work, thank you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
086	How ridiculous. No matter how hard I work to accomplish things, people just assume it's the product of pure talent.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0016
087	I never expected it to be possible for my dragon to be imitated.
088	A friend of mine who knew nothing of the sky built this mount with me with the sole purpose of allowing me to charge ahead.
089	I will hear you weep, Flame Dragon King.	VO_eins.eins_battle_0010
