001	Soren plans a visit to the outskirts of Lustburg to take a break from his training.
002	Upon hearing his plans, Roxanne asks him for a favor and points him to a quiet village to help her with an errand.
003	Haah... Am I finally here?
004	Soren nears a village nestled against a breathtaking backdrop of snowcapped mountains.
005	Wow. This place is beautiful.
006	Okay. Roxanne told me I could find her favorite mechanic here.
007	For such a small community, I'm sure the villagers can direct me to the workshop in no time.
008	Excuse me mister!
009	Is this Tröstendorf?
010	Well, hello there traveller. Welcome to Tröstendorf!
011	Coming all the way out to this village instead of the Lustburg state city, you must be looking for Blair.
012	Ah yes, I've heard that she's currently working here.
013	That lass is a smart one, I'll tell you that.
014	After she installed a complex heating system underneath this village, there isn't a need to wear thick coats outside anymore.
015	Woah, that explains the absence of snow around here.
016	If you're trying to find her in person though, I'm afraid you just missed her.
017	Last I heard, she went up to the mountains to set up her new machines.
018	Thanks for the info.
019	There's been some recent monster sightings in the area, so you take care now!
020	There are some sneaky ones that have even been taking and breaking our stuff. You never know when they'll strike.
021	Thanks, I'll keep that in mind!
022	Grrrrrrrrrrrrr!
023	I can't outrun them all! These monsters are fast!
024	Alright you beasts, bring it!
