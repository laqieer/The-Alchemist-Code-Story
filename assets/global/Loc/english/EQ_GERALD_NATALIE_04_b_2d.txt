001	Heh. That's some big talk. Might wanna save your breath, though. Your breathing's a little ragged.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
002	Nngh! Ack!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
003	You did pretty damn well for just one man. No idea what made you try so hard against hopeless odds, but it's all over now.
004	Good night.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
005	What made me...?
006	I wanted to protect that which is important to me. I wanted to carry out my oath.
009	That much should be obvious.
010	So what is with all these...feelings?
011	And why does your face come to mind?
014	Gerald!
015	Ngh!
016	What are you doing?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
017	D-don't just...lie there...
018	No! Don't you—!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
019	Huh...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
020	Snap out of it! You're being so stupid, Gerald.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
023	Wh-what?
024	How many years have I stood by your side? You might not realize it yourself, but it's clear as day to me.
025	I can see right into your mind. "Vettel would do better." "Vettel is already way ahead of me."
026	Those are the kinds of useless, unproductive things you're dwelling on right now!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
027	Is Vettel all you care about?! Are you so consumed with him that there's no room in your heart for me? We swore that oath together, didn't we? The three of us!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
029	Gerald, you're such a fool. That foolishness is exactly why you should be holding your ground!
030	You idiot... You've got to prove that the path you chose is the most righteous one! Force your opposition to believe in you with the sheer power of your will! I know you can do it.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
031	N-Natalie!
032	Nngh... Getting mad makes your blood pump faster. I...forgot.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0042
033	I suppose that...makes me a fool, too. A fool who decided...to prop up...another fool.
034	Natalie! Hang in there!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
093	You are not alone, Gerald. I am here, and all of the Scarlet Legion are with you.
035	If you still don't understand, then...I'll have to dissect you after all.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0011
036	H-huh?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
037	We're all...here...for you. Ngh...
038	Natalie! Natalie, wake up!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
039	Damn it! Look at them all!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
040	Natalie! Brother Gerald! Are you all right?
041	Wh-what are you all doing here? I never...	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0020
042	When we couldn't find you anywhere, we feared the worst... I'm just glad we made it in time.
043	I...!
044	Why didn't you tell us what you were planning? You're always charging recklessly into things. Why don't you ever ask us for help?!
045	I mean, we might not be as strong as you, but we're all members of the Scarlet Legion, aren't we? Which means we're all in this together! Let us help you, Brother Gerald!
046	I-I...!
047	We're not letting these bandit scum win! You got that?! Our captain is counting on us! We're all going to live another day!
048	Show them what it means to be a part of the Scarlet Legion!
049	All of you...!
050	I...
051	I've been watching others, preoccupied with what they are achieving instead of what I am doing.
052	But that wasn't what he tried to teach me.
054	Having something to protect is what will make you strong.
094	For example, what I want to protect in this world is you. You and your mother. That is what centers me. It gives me the willpower I need to fight to protect everything, as a knight should.
095	So, ask yourself. What is it you want to protect?
096	What was my answer back then?
055	Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!
056	What am I fighting for?
057	Is it not to protect that which is important to me?
058	Ask yourself this: what do I want to protect?
061	What am I doing?
062	The bonds I have worked so hard to forge, the friends I have made... Are they not plain before me now?
063	Denying the path that I have walked...
064	That would mean denying those very bonds. My own friends.
065	I won't let that happen!
066	What is it I want to protect?
067	The answer is clear.
068	And now that I know it...
069	All that's left is to defend it by sheer force of will.
070	For that is the knight my father taught me to be!
071	Hah... Bwahahahah! What's happened to your fangs, Legion dogs?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
072	No...!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0012
073	...
074	Brother Gerald!
075	Hmph. It's all the same to me if another dog joins the pack. Get him!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
076	Hahahahahah! Skewered like a pig on a stick! Argh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
077	Huzzzaaaaaaahh!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0032
078	You...dog!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
079	Like I said. Nothing's more effective than a frontal assault.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
080	Brother Gerald!
081	Don't worry. My injuries aren't fatal.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
082	Your captain's not going down that easily.
083	Understood, Brother Gerald!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
084	Nnrgh... You're still outnumbered, dogs! You can't win!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
085	Oh, yes we can.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
086	What?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
087	I forgot myself for a while there...
088	But thankfully, I have friends, good friends, to help me remember who I am.
089	For their sake...
090	From this point onward, it will no longer be just my willpower or my faith...
091	But my very being, my heart, the blood running through my veins!
092	All of it will become as steel, glittering for all to see!
