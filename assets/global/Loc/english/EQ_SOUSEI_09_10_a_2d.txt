001	Hmm? It's most unlike you to miss at such close range.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
002	Regardless of whatever else you may be, you're also still my father. There's only so far I can bring myself to go.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0018
003	Even if I took another shot, I don't think I'd hit you with it.
004	Not that it matters. I don't believe we'll meet again, Father.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
005	Yes, sadly, I think you may be right.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
006	...
007	Well, this is rare. Cat got your tongue?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
008	Ha. In a manner of speaking.
009	It simply struck me how even in a situation like this, no emotions are afforded me. I wondered if perhaps I might be feeling something after all.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0020
010	Your opinion of him has changed a bit, though, hasn't it?
011	A little, yes.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
012	And a little part of me thinks that perhaps I should have been more fatherly to that boy—if only once, just to see how it went.
013	...! Your movements have gotten sharper.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0019
014	Finally, your true abilities come to light!
015	Just as you said before, we are not meant to fight alone.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
016	We've come this far by combining our strengths and watching each other's backs.
017	This is the result of working together to overcome the seven Cursed Beasts.
018	Unfortunately for you, I am not alone either. Melvillei!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
019	Grrrrroooooaaaaar!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0002
