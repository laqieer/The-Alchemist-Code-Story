001	Back again? I sense a strong desire for accomplishment.
002	Very well! Show me how well you can apply your knowledge!
003	It's time for you to learn about Status Effects. These effects can negatively influence the affected unit.
004	Poison, for example, damages the unit every turn. Sleep will prevent the unit from taking action. Both can last for several turns.
005	Fear not! There are ways to counteract these Status Effects. For example, a Chemist can use Vaccine to nullify Status Effects for three turns.
006	Better to see it in action! Use the Chemist's skill to deal with Status Effects!
007	Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!
008	I expected nothing less from you.
009	As you saw, Status Effects can be a terrible nuisance, but proper preparation and strategy can help you through tough situations.
010	Of course, enemies are also susceptible to Status Effects, so use a Thief or a Ninja that can apply many different kinds of effects.
011	I have great faith in your abilities.
012	I shall grant you even greater wisdom the next time you come.
