001	Emma!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0002
002	Haaaahmmn... What do you want? I was having such a great nap.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
003	What do you mean what do I want? What are you doing?! Don't you know class is in session?!
004	But I finished all my assignments, and I'm so freaking bored.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0030
005	You need to read the textbook and review the lesson just like everybody else!
006	And look at your uniform! Your skirt's too short! You're wearing too much makeup! You need to focus more on your studies instead of—	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0013
007	Looking this cute? I thought witches were supposed to be alluring!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
008	That does not excuse you from breaking school regulations! Why must you be like this...
009	Your performance and test scores are excellent, but you are sorely lacking in manners.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0016
010	Lacking...?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
011	You need to take yourself more seriously!
012	I'm sure you had to work hard to become a scholarship student. Why can't you act more appropriately? You're embarrassing yourself in front of your classmates!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
013	(Aw, come on. Do I really have to act all goody-goody just because I'm here on a scholarship?)
014	(My grades are some of the best. I really don't think she has to tell me off like this...)	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
015	Oh, my. You look quite displeased.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0006
016	Huh?
017	Professor, isn't the next class about to begin? I can take over lecturing her if you'd like.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0003
018	Goodness gracious, look at the time! Well, if you wouldn’t mind, Ms. Celine...
019	Not at all. Now, then...	VO_celine.celine_sys_0007
020	We’re finally alone.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0010
021	...
022	Don't be scared. I’ve been wanting to have a little chat with you for a while now.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0012
023	And why is that?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
024	Well... You stand out from all the other students. They're all so earnest and diligent.
025	You’re the only one with any nerve. Devil-may-care, that’s what you are!	VO_celine.celine_sys_0007
026	Yeah, I guess. They're all goody two-shoes, aren't they? I can see how I'm kinda out of place.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0037
027	But it can't be helped. Hard work and effort and all that crap just isn’t my thing.
028	Oh, really?	VO_celine.celine_sys_0006
029	...
030	(She's not like the other teachers. It's like she can see right through me... I don't like this.)
031	Anyway, Emma... How would you feel about helping me with my research?	VO_celine.celine_sys_0003
032	Research?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
033	You’ll be paid, of course. I find your magical aptitude to be very valuable indeed.
034	Your other attributes are also very...stirring. Hehehe...	VO_celine.celine_sys_0007
035	(E-eww...)
036	So, what exactly is it that you want me to do?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
037	Various things. Organizing files, cleaning, tending to the monsters I keep for research...	VO_celine.celine_sys_0031
038	Now and again I might also ask you to recapture escaped monsters.
039	Urgaahhh!
