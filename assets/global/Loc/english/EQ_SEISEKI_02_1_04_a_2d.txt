001	Your mother ruled the fallen Wadatsumi? Doesn't that make you royalty?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
002	I guess so.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
003	Y-you gotta be kidding!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
004	I wish with all my heart that I was.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0030
005	Ever since then, Wadatsumi has been under the reign of Greed Dike as part of their country.
006	But what about this Chihaya person? Wasn't she a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi?
007	Yes. Apparently, she remained in Wadatsumi after its collapse and attempted to reconstruct the desolate, war-torn country.
008	It seems her prayers and dances have a mysterious power that gives courage and hope to all who see her.
009	Thanks to her, the country's restoration has been proceeding unexpectedly fast.
010	I see. Chihaya really seems to have made a difference.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0045
011	You might be right.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
012	But how do you think it would appear to Greed Dike who now occupies Wadatsumi?
013	Huh? Ah... They may see it as the start of a rebellion.
014	Right? I mean, even someone like you can anticipate that. She's really naive.
015	You said something similar earlier.
016	My entire family, as well as the people of Wadatsumi, were killed right before my eyes.
017	That's...horrible. To be destroyed by such a one-sided attack...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
018	Greed Dike invaded us simply to expand their territory. Also, they wanted the rights to Wadatsumi's unique trade goods and works of art.
019	Are you serious? If they attacked for a reason like that, there's no way the Holy Guard would have remained silent.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
020	Yes, normally they wouldn't.
021	However, ultimately Greed Dike's acts of aggression were accepted and justified throughout the continent.
022	This was because it was discovered that we had been using Alchemy in Wadatsumi.
023	Alchemy?! Why? Did you not know about the Magna Code?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
024	Wadatsumi engaged in little trade with the other countries; thus we had our unique culture.
025	Within our culture, we referred to what is known as Alchemia as Chakra and phantoms as samurais.
026	In other words, since using Alchemy had always been the norm from ancient times, we had little idea that it was forbidden.
027	Don't tell me that Greed Dike knew about this and took advantage of it.
028	Who knows? One thing I can say for certain is that their invasion was incredibly swift, calculative, and merciless.
029	I tried desperately to resist, but I didn't have enough power. All I could do was helplessly watch as the flames consumed everything.
030	...!
031	If Kudan hadn't saved me, I wouldn't be here today.
032	Captain Kudan?
033	... ...
034	That's why I decided I would become strong.
035	...I would learn the skills necessary to survive and to protect those who I came in contact with.
036	What Chihaya did was by no means a bad thing. But...I do think it's problematic.
037	By her acting independently in Greed Dike occupied Wadatsumi, it gives them an excuse to once again go on a rampage.
038	... ...
039	So are you surprised? I have a pretty messed up past, don't I?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
040	Sniff...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0018
041	Huh?
042	Kagura, I'm sorry about the cruel things I said to you without even knowing about your past.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
043	Hey! What are you crying about?! I didn't tell you because I wanted your sympathy!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0002
044	Bu-but...sniff...sob...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0019
045	Come on. You're too easily manipulated by your emotions. I told you it wasn't good, airhead!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
046	You called me airhead again! Sniff...so mean...
047	Enough talk. Both of you, get ready for combat.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
