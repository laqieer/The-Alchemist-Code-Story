001	Today's outdoor recreation activity will be a group practice with teams of three. Please take a look at today's schedule as a group.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0005
002	(I just got into this school and it's already a pain... Ugh, group projects.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
003	This practice will give me a chance to show off my magic!
004	Me too!
005	(Seems like the others are weirdly into it. They're way too fired up.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
006	(Excited to get to know each other, I guess. Or, more likely, desperate for other people to know them.)
007	(I guess all witches are like that. All the witches I've seen so far have been like that.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
008	(It's boring how they all think the same. Well, I shouldn't point fingers... I'm cut from the same cloth since I'm here, too.)
009	(Ugh. Can't something interesting happen for once?)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0022
010	Hey, you're Alma...right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
011	Yeah?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
012	This is the first time we've properly talked, right? I'm Lisbeth! We're in the same group together!
013	Oh... Is that so?
014	Yup! Let's do our best!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
015	Hmmm. Sure, Lisbeth.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
016	Today's assignment is for each group to make a magic stew with different effects.
017	Your evaluation will be based on your group's teamwork and ability to reproduce the recipe. Also...you are not to use magic at all!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0004
018	What! Why?!
019	But I thought I'd be able to show off my magic!
020	Silence!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0014
021	This practice is to test whether you've absorbed the knowledge about magic ingredients you should have learned up to this point.
022	No magic may be used, whether for cooking or gathering materials or anything else.
023	I will be watching and grading you all from a different location. Make sure to cooperate well with the other members in your group.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
024	Now then, please start your practice.
025	Huh. Well, this is new, I guess.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
026	Our team's assignment is "a recipe that can heal someone in any physical condition"!
027	Don't you wish they would just teach us magic normally instead of making us do something weird like this?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0016
028	Really? I think it'll be interesting.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
029	Magic is still hard for me, but I have made stew with my mom before.
030	Besides, even witches should be able to make a good meal. So let's give it our all!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
031	Sigh... But it's more important for elite witches to be able to do magic than cook.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0030
032	What? Why? Even witches have to eat. Plus, making food yourself is fun!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
033	Huh?
034	Ahaha! Sure! I guess first up is making something we can eat, then.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0008
035	(I haven't talked to Lisbeth that much before, but she seems kinda interesting.)
036	(...No, all witches are the same in the end.)	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
037	(They kick each other down and steal people's lovers... They all only think of themselves. They're all selfish, narrow-minded people.)
038	(It's clear as day to me. I've seen them do the same thing over and over, and I'm going to use that to my advantage.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
039	(I've sold so much information about them in order for me to live on my own. Witch scandals are especially profitable.)
040	(But I lose hope every time I get my hands on new information about witches only focused on their ambitions, witches with loose lips... They're all the same. All of them.)
041	Alma?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
042	Hmm?
043	What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
044	No, I'm fine. I just spaced out for a second.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
045	Looks like the stew needs to simmer for a bit longer. And we're almost out of firewood.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
046	Lisbeth's still not back yet. Just how far did she go to get firewood? I guess I should go check on her.
047	I'm sure she's fine. She's bad at magic, so she goes above and beyond to do things like this so she can get more points. She's just faking it. Don't you think so, too?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0010
048	Maybe.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
049	That's why she talks to guys so easily and talks about insects like they're human or whatever. She doesn't have the self-awareness necessary to become a noble witch.
050	You, on the other hand, are very promising, Alma. You're athletic, calm, collected, and can fade into the background, in a good way.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0001
051	You have a lot to say with Lisbeth gone... So what's your point?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
052	In short, I think you could become an elite of the elite of witches! We should work together!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0004
053	We'll swap out the other groups' herbs with this and take everyone else out. How about it?
054	Is this what you used in that other class a little while ago? The stuff that made your stomach hurt when you ate it?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
055	Sigh... I was wondering what you were going to suggest. I don't do things that seem like a hassle.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
056	But if you get good grades, your tuition will be waived.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0006
057	Your family's poor... I mean, I heard money is tight for you, so...
058	Oh, there's rumors going around about me?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0045
059	I would love to hear where you heard that from...but right now we have to finish up this stew.
060	So I'm going to go gather firewood after all.
061	(Sigh... I feel sick. Nothing good comes from working in groups.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
062	(Toxic herbs, stupid gossip, cheap tricks... She wants to become an 'elite' that badly?)
063	(She may still be a student, but she's definitely got alllll the terrible parts of witches down pat.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0022
064	Witches all only think about themselves. They're the worst.
065	(But I guess since I'm selling other people's information to survive, I'm just like them, huh.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
066	Oh? Is that you, Alma?! What are you doing here?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
067	Well, I thought it would be difficult to carry firewood by yourself, so I... Huh?
068	Oh, thank you, Alma! And look at this!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
069	Matthew helped me gather firewood! That's why there's so much.
070	I see. Thank you.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
071	No, I just...
072	Oh. Matthew, you hurt your hand.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
073	Even small wounds can fester. We have to sterilize it. Here, put this on it and it'll speed up the healing.
074	I didn't even notice. Thank you.
075	Alma, you're amazing! Good job noticing a small wound like that! Do you know a lot about medicinal plants?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
076	I'm not that knowledgeable, but I guess I've got practical knowledge? I guess collecting information on a regular basis was worth something.
077	See, you are amazing!
078	Hehe. Plus, you're kind.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
079	Kind? Me? Ehehe. That's the first time someone has ever called me that.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
080	Really? I wonder why?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
081	Never mind that. Let's get this firewood back quickly. Practice is almost over.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
082	Oh! Right! We have to hurry—whoa!
083	Geez. That's what you get for running with all that firewood. Honestly... You need to be more careful.
084	(Huh? I was annoyed up until a second ago, but it's all gone away now.)	VO_alma.alma_chara_1024
085	Huh? Lisbeth... What did you just say?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0025
086	Yeah? I said that Matthew showed me a place where there's a lot of firewood.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
087	Eeeeek! That's this wood?! I can't believe it! A man touched this firewood!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0043
088	Huh?! What?! What is it?! Is something wrong?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
089	Everything is wrong!
090	(Sheesh, just because a man touched it. Firewood is firewood.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
091	(Although, I guess someone like Lisbeth who can be so open with everyone is rare.)
092	Well, the fire is already lit and we already started using it, so it can't be helped. So let's just simmer the stew a little more and...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
093	Aaaaah!
094	What?! What's going on?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
095	Everyone over there seems like they're panicking. What's happening?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
096	Everyone, run! Monsters are attacking!
097	Monsters?!
098	Grraaaah!
099	Oh no!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0042
100	This is an emergency! You are now all permitted to use magic to fight them! Everyone, vanquish the monsters nearest you!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
101	We got the green light from the teacher now, which means we'd better do something. Let's go!
