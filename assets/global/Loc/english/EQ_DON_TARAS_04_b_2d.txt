001	D-d-divorce. Data insufficient. Cause of defeat unclear.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0018
002	You have shown too much of your hand.	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0017
003	D-d-d-damage q-quota ex-...cee-...ded.	VO_aj7000.aj7000_sys_0043
004	Huff...huff...huff...	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
005	I... I won?	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
006	But it's not over yet! There's still one thing left to be done in order for me to lay this to rest.
007	Mistress! You did it!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0009
008	Thank you, Ethan, for listening to my unreasonable request.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0033
009	It was nothing! Making one or two dresses is the least a lousy fighter like myself can do!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0039
010	Though the clock tower repair has...been delayed some.
011	It's all battered again!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0036
012	It is a simple matter of fixing it, as many times as it takes.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0011
013	Ethan...
014	Please don't worry. You are mayor now, and I will follow you wherever you go.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0007
015	Right! Thank you!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0010
016	Oh, and one more thing...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0004
017	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
018	I have also finished with that other matter that you wanted me to attend to.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0007
019	Allie...?!	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
020	Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
021	Allie! It's Allie! This is like a dream! I can't believe I can talk to Allie again!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0009
022	He still can't talk properly at the moment, but I will definitely have him working in due time.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0030
023	It's more than enough, Ethan! Thank you! Thank you so much for all of this.	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_1001
024	That's right... I was so focused on doing my best alone that I was blind to my surroundings. I couldn't see those who were supporting me, even when they were right by my side.
025	I have Allie, Ethan, and...!
026	I still have one task left. I have an important role to fill. Yet I...	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
027	Mistress...?	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0025
028	I... He...
029	The future is paved by people foolish enough to keep on believing, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
030	A-Allie?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
031	Fiona!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0004
032	Allie!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0002
033	But your repairs aren't done yet! How...?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0026
034	Aye, this is a matter of the highest priority.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
035	Wh-what is, Allie?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
036	You gotta believe and keep moving forward, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
037	......	VO_fiona.fiona_chara_2001
038	S-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
039	Alkemono?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
040	You're right, Allie. We've always been together, haven't we?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
041	It's always been us, this city, and...
042	Hmm. That's why we can't afford to back down now.
