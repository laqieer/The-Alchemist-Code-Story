001	Well, I said let's go back, but...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
002	Even if we were to go back to school, they might come chasing after us again! Liz, you should go back to your home for now.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
003	But that will cause problems for my mom.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
004	But I guess staying here will cause problems for the school. What should I do?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
005	True. Really. What should we do?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
006	Hmm. True.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
007	Matthew...I...sob...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
008	...You're stuck, huh?	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0012
009	Wh-what's this? Is it alcohol?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
010	Oh...it's caramel jaeger...um, it's the sweet alcohol from Slothstein.
011	It seems like it never became really popular over there because it raises the body temperature of whoever drinks it, but...
012	What is that caramel something?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
013	I remember now...that first time I stood in the hall...
014	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
015	Oh! Wait...was that customer...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
016	Thank you for the food, Liz.	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0007
017	Wh-what's going on?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
018	Yes...of course!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
019	Matthew, you were the first customer who ordered from me that day that I first helped out at the bar!
020	R-really...?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0044
021	Even then...you were flustered like you are now.	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0020
022	...!
023	But...in your clumsy way...you were accomplishing your job before you. And...I was able to receive that sweet drink...	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0045
024	You can still go forward. Just do what you need to do...step by step.
025	Matthew...
026	Thank you...Matthew.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
027	I don't really understand what happened, but I'm glad you're feeling better.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
028	Yes...thank you also, Rebecca.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
029	I didn't do anything. More importantly, what do we do from now? Wait, huh? Alma?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
030	I-it's not looking good, you two!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0024
031	Alma?! Where were you until now?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
032	The forest is burning!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
033	It was pretty rowdy near the dormitory, so I went to look and I saw the forest burning in the distance!
034	What?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
035	Whoa!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0028
036	It's the insects now?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
037	I'm just gonna chase them off for now! There's too much happening at once!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0021
