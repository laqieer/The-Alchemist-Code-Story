001	... ...
002	What's the matter, Kanon? You are looking downward a lot.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
003	Wait, are you mulling over what Kudan just told you?
004	N-not at all!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
005	I'm sorry to say this, but he's right.
006	If you keep worrying about your opponents, no number of lives will keep you alive.
007	Of course, if you have a death wish, that's another story.
008	I get it! Can you not speak down at me? I'm older than you!
009	Hmph. You may be older, but I have more experience. Also, I'm prettier and smarter♪	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0007
010	Arghhh! You're making fun of me! Just you wait!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
011	Hwaaaahhh!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
012	My special move! Miracle Kanon Slash!	VO_kanon.kanon_skill_0001
013	Mwahahaha! Did you see my splendid attack?!	VO_kanon.kanon_chara_0010
014	You really are a hopeless airhead.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
015	An airhead?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
016	What about me is airheaded?! Explain!
017	Honestly... Kudan, say something to her!
018	Your moves are so tactless that they're dangerous.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
019	Careless rampages increase the likelihood of the enemy noticing and launching an ambush or surprise attack.
020	Oh...
021	Also, if you exert your energy at your current pace, you won't have enough stamina to last you until the end. Try to use your head a little.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0010
022	Agh...!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
023	Here comes a new wave of them.
024	They're so persistent. Do you understand now, Kanon? There's a lot of them, so try to be more careful this—	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
025	Gaaaarrrrr!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
026	He-hey!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0025
027	My policy is to face the enemy head on with everything I've got!
028	There's really no end to her stupidity.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0030
029	It can't be helped. Let's cover for her, Kagura.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
