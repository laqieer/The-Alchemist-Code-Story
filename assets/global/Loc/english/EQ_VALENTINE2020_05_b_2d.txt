001	Arghhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
002	Oh! You Wadatsumi swordsmen really are a force to be reckoned... Ah.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0024
003	D-did I say something wrong?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
004	I never thought I would ever be acknowledged by a valiant general such as yourself. It pleases me greatly.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
005	O-oh! I see, I see!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0046
006	...It really made me happy when you first said it. It's just I couldn't put it into words very well.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_chara_1011
007	Awww, it's already over!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
008	How's it going on your end?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
009	We've come to an agreement. The higher-ups in Lustburg were having a difficult time dealing with these bandits.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
010	They will turn a blind eye to the commotion that we caused because we were able to expose these guys.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
011	All that's left is for us to hand these guys to the guards and get the cacao to where it needs to be!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
012	And with that, we're gonna head back first. We'll get the chocolate prep started, so hurry back, okay?
013	Making chocolates... Okay... I'm ready for this.
014	Hm? Leafah? Why so serious?
015	Leafah still has something super important to do, right?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
016	Yeah...I do. But it'll be okay. I won't run away from this. I'll face this head on and put everything I feel into my chocolates.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
017	I'm not very good at this kind of thing, but I'll manage somehow! I think I'll be able to express myself through Valentine's Day.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
018	Speaking of which, Leafah, you gave Yomi some chocolates, didn't you?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
019	Yeah... I made some chocolates for Yomi, and...some apology chocolates for you.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
020	For me?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
021	Yeah.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0006
022	Ooo.
023	What do you have to apologize for?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
024	...
025	Waaahhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0026
026	N-n-n-never mind! J-j-just know I'm sorry!
027	Huh?
028	You love Valentine's Day, yet I went and said some things that maybe made it less enjoyable for you!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
029	S-so I w-wanted to apologize for that!
030	You're really...honest.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
031	I see... Hah...hahahaha!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0008
032	Eh! Why are you laughing!
033	Why wouldn't we laugh? You ended up saying everything out loud after all! What happened to the plan we came up with?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0030
034	It didn't feel like enough!
035	(I had no idea how to interact with the person who was once General of Greed Dike.)
036	I see. Just be straightforward and honest.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
037	Suzuka?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
038	No, it's nothing.
039	I was just thinking about the kind of chocolate I want to make for Leafah.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
040	Happy Valentine's Day with lots of love!
