001	It was several years ago now.
002	The first birthday I ever celebrated fell on a sunny day, just like this one.
003	You cannot erase your past.
004	Be that as it may...I can't call myself D. Lily anymore.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
005	Why not? Yes, when we fled Greed Dike, you left Imperial Security behind you, and I abandoned my duties as shrine maiden. Now we are forging a new life here together.
006	But that doesn't mean that you have to become an entirely new person. You can keep some of who you were.
007	I betrayed my employer. I abandoned my subordinates. I fled in disgrace. I don't want to be that person anymore.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
008	If you feel guilty for those actions, isn't that even more reason to hold on to your old name?
009	You mean you think it'd make me an even bigger disgrace to abandon that, too?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
010	...
011	No one is going to forgive you for the wrongs you have committed. Murder, betrayal, treason...
012	These aren't crimes that you can atone for. Not even in the afterlife.
013	So, what do you do? You bear the burden, no matter how torturous. You shoulder these sins for as long as you live.
014	In time, it will get easier. Humans do, after all, heal naturally.
015	Given enough time, we can even forget our guilt, and our penitence...but that is by no means a good thing. If you ask me, you should hold on to those feelings...
016	And live out the rest of your life doing what you can to apologize for them.
017	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
018	I suppose this is why people seek companionship, or a place to call their own. We all need a receptacle in which to deposit our burdens when they grow too heavy.
019	It could be a country, a friend, a home, or even a duty. Something or someone that provides us a means of resting our spirit.
020	I no longer have any of those things. I abandoned them all when I left Greed Dike.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
021	You have me.
022	Y-you?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
023	You gave me a second chance at life. Nothing you or anyone else can say can change that.
024	I...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
025	Did you know that there is more than one variety of daylily?
026	No, I didn't.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
027	There is a bright-yellow variety grown in Wadatsumi known as the zehnteika.
028	It's my favorite kind of daylily.
029	Like all daylilies, it blooms and wilts within the span of a single day, but it continues to grow new flowers, day after day, littering the garden bed with spots of yellow.
030	I've always liked the idea of filling my garden with zehnteika, the flower that is continually reborn, irrespective of place, circumstance, and the vicissitudes of life.
031	They would make for a beautiful addition to our home.
032	Of course, they're not currently in bloom, but if we were to plant some seeds, we could see them as early as next year, and enjoy them forever after that.
033	Why do I get the feeling we're not just talking about our garden, here?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0007
034	Because this is my alternative solution: a new name, with the same meaning. What do you think of Zehn?
035	Zehn...
036	I... I accept. I'm sorry.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
037	Tut-tut. When you receive a gift, the proper thing is to express your gratitude, not apologize.
038	B-but I have nothing to give you in return!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0035
039	Hm?
040	I-I still haven't found you that bouncy ball.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
041	Oh, that? Don't be silly. It doesn't matter now.
042	I... I actually did a little research into what that colorful ball means in Wadatsumi. It's connected to the New Year, isn't it? It's a toy enjoyed by children during that time.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
043	That's all true...except for one thing. You've already given me a gift. The greatest gift of all.
044	Wh-what? Y-you mean...?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
045	I do.
046	I'm gonna be a...!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
047	Hmhm. You know, the very first time I met you, I felt like your heart was reflected in your eyes.
048	It was plain to me that you were...killing yourself, in a sense. It was hard to meet eyes so tortured, but...I wish I had been able to, now.
049	I remember feeling something similar.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
050	Hmhm. Yet, here we are. Now...
051	Now we can stare into each others' eyes forever.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0007
052	We must not take our eyes off the enemy!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0017
053	Heed me, beloved citizens of our proud nation! I will repeat this message as many times as it takes for it to sink in!
054	The shrine maidens of Wadatsumi are the root of all evil!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
055	Is it any good, boss?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
056	Boss?
057	This dish is a favorite of mine, but I made it especially for you. Are you enjoying it?
058	What's more, we have discovered that Wadatsumi has been covering up the rampant misuse of Alchemy perpetrated within its borders!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
059	Yes, they defy the Magna Code, the taboo acknowledged by the entire world, as if they alone are exempt from it!
060	This is not a matter to be taken lightly. We cannot forgive such atrocities on the principle of ignorance, when they are by nature unforgiveable!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0013
061	Come to think of it, you never told me what sort of dishes you enjoy, boss. Do you have a favorite?
062	Won't you tell me? I'm sure I can make it for you. Turns out, I'm as skilled as any gourmet chef.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
063	It brings me great sorrow to report that one such incident has already occurred here in Greed Dike. A vile shrine maiden has employed her wicked rites to corrupt the mind of none other than the star of our nation, the father of Imperial Security himself... D. Lily!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
064	This tragedy has struck our military such a blow that I have been cowed into admitting my defeat.
065	Why did you leave me behind, boss?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
066	How to express my regret that I, who ought to be without weakness, have known such a loss? How to atone for the fact that the great pillar holding up our nation has suffered a devastating crack?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0018
067	I have failed you, my citizens, and for this, I ask your forgiveness.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0035
068	Don't you care about me at all?
069	Rest assured, action will be taken. But before we can bring the fires of war to Wadatsumi, we must first stabilize our national interests.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
070	I suppose that's an unfair question. I'm being petulant, aren't I?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0010
071	As such, Imperial Security is henceforth abolished.
072	In these troubled times, I have greater need of faithful servants in whom I can fully place my trust than ever before.
073	Of course you care about me. You must do.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
074	That is why, in place of the old Imperial Security, I will be forming a new organization: the Imperial Elite Guard.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
075	How can I doubt that, after all those times I watched you enjoy my cooking so sincerely?
076	And who shall lead this fledgling organization, my new Imperial Elite Guard? None other than my unswervingly loyal confidant, Na Zhu!
077	There can be no doubt. You wouldn't have left me if it wasn't for that demon shrine maiden.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
078	She twisted you, didn't she? It would have been easy for a freakish occultist like that to warp someone's mind...even yours, boss.
079	We shall be working together to rebuild our military, establish order throughout the capital, and form a united national front. Once we have achieved all this...
080	We shall invade Wadatsumi! And when we strike, there is no one in this world who will be able to stop our advance!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
081	But don't worry, boss. I'm coming for you.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0029
082	Never again will I taste defeat, for we shall fight the coming battles together! As one, we will march on the very world!
083	I'm going to open your eyes, and then...things will go back to the way they were.
