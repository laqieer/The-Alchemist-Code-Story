001	The Lizard Brigade... They're accustomed to guerrilla warfare, so they're not easy to capture.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
002	...Dias.
003	Before we encounter them, we should assume the worst scenario.
004	The worst scenario...?
005	The scenario that Captain Zeke was in collusion with Wratharis from the beginning.
006	Wh-what...?! What do you mean?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
007	Despite the obvious fact that it would cause confusion, Captain Zeke proposed a peace treaty with Wratharis, offering his own daughter Agatha as the representative.
008	If this were all a scenario planned out decades in advance...
009	Tsk! Stop speaking in a roundabout way! What is that you want to say?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
010	To put it frankly, I am stating that he may have taken Agatha in to serve her current purpose.
011	Taking in an infant with Wratharis lineage and raising her...may have all been in anticipation of today.
012	Y-you...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
013	If you ridicule my family any further...you'll pay for it!
014	Calm yourself. Personally, I do not want to believe that's the case.
015	However, when you consider how the Lizard Brigade and the Blue Flame Guard—supposed sworn enemies—so easily colluded together...
016	When you consider Captain Zeke's actions in involving his beloved children...it makes sense.
017	Sh-shut up! There's no way that's possible!!!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
018	If you want to change the world, then make up your mind!
019	I recall you saying that averting your eyes from the facts will only bring about further tragedy!
020	...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
021	I pray that my suspicions are unwarranted.
022	However, with the abundant amount of proof we now have lying before us, we must act on it.
023	I'm well aware of that. I'll confirm my father's true intentions once again.
024	Yes... Please do so, Dias.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
