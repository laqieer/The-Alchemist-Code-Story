001	Days later...
002	This last tweak should be enough.
003	Okay Soren, activate it.
004	Here goes!
005	Hyaah!
006	Woah, this feels intense!
007	Cool...
008	Blair...want!
009	It's too early for you Eira, maybe next time.
010	Eira puffs out her cheeks defiantly.
011	But you've progressed so much since you became a part of this village Eira!
012	You should pat yourself on the back for a job well done.
013	Eira beams.
014	Villagers?
015	Don't you worry, I have something for you that is guaranteed to get their attention!
016	Here, just let me just put it on for you.
017	...laughs Tickles!
018	Blair, where did you even get this...
019	It was one of Roxanne's gifts, but I never got around to wearing it.
020	It suits her more than me, don't you think?
021	...
022	???
023	...
024	Cute...
025	Did you say something Blair?
026	*ahem* What? You say something?
027	Erm...no...
028	Villagers...like?
029	Eira, trust me.
030	This will sweep them off their feet!
