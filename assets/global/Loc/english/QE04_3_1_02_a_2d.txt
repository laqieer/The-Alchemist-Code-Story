001	There were so many Jam. Also...I feel like they've gotten a little stronger than before.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	Yes...I wonder if it means that Beelzebub’s power is growing even stronger.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
003	We must hurry, or the situation may become irreversible. Even though I know we must not be impatient, I can't help being anxious.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
004	Let's stay calm. Right now, what we must avoid most is becoming impatient and making a mistake.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
005	Tina, Mocca! Is that...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
006	...?! Georgios?! Is that...Tamis next to him?! Why?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
007	Are they talking about something?! Hey...wait, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
008	Who are you? I've never met someone who was shrouded in such a mysterious wind before. What is your...purpose?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0001
009	I am Georgios the Flame-Armed General of the Gluttony army. I am waiting for the Wind Shamans here.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
010	The Gluttony army...? But why do I feel something sacred in that wind? Circulation...no, is this purification...?!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
011	There's no need for unnecessary prying, young girl. It has nothing to do with you.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
012	It does have something to do with me. That power of purification may be the key to restoring the Wind Matter that we are looking for!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0019
013	I have nothing to say to you. If you wish to find the answers then you'll have to reach them on your own.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
014	If you are shrouded in such a wind, why do you lend your power to the invading forces?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0031
015	Enough, girl—	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
016	Tamis! He's dangerous! Stand back!!!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
017	Wind Shaman, I've been waiting for you. Let's continue what we started the other day!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
018	Hyaaaahhhh!!!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0007
019	Ack! Let's go, Lisbeth! Follow me!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
020	Yes, let's go, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
