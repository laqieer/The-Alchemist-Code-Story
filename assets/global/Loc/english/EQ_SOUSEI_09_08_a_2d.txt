001	This tree, I shall call Sephiron.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
002	This great tree, which has been fed the blood of dragons... The soil upon which it rests will one day birth the child destined to create the new world.
003	Those connected with this child shall grow stronger than any other.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
004	They shall bear the sephirah. Born from the mixing of human and dragon blood, they shall be inexorably linked with nature.
005	But is all of that truly necessary?
006	I am uncertain. Which is why I must leave it to be determined.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
007	The next time this choice must be made, I will no longer be alive to make it.
008	Ah. That's right. You will die as well, won't you, Matia?
009	Of course. After all, I am only human.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
010	I somehow had the impression that you might live forever.
011	You flatter me. But no matter how highly a human may be regarded, every human must inevitably die. It is a fact of life.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
012	Though I do think I could have lived a better one of those. There simply wasn't enough conflict for my taste. I would have liked more reason to fight.
013	What's the point of strength if there is no combat with which to hone it? All that remains without it is decay and diminishment.
014	I wish I could have truly tested my mettle, alongside my will and my heart.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
015	Ha. You never change, always going on about the glory of combat.
016	It is my joy and happiness. I cannot help thinking of it, when I take such great pleasure in its pursuit!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
017	If, by some chance, a miracle should occur, and I should be able to fight on behalf of another once again...
018	I would not hesitate for a moment. I would delight in spilling more blood.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
019	I'm sorry to say, I will be praying that such a time never comes.
020	How hurtful! I thought we were friends?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
021	...
022	...
023	Finished already?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
024	The Dragon Realm... Perhaps best referred to as a temple now, given the ceremony? It is indeed a place of great power.
025	But when the one with domain over it is in such a sorry state, none of that means a thing!
026	Wh-why...?	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0001
027	Why what?
028	If this continues, the world will be swallowed by corruption and destroyed. Even you must know that. In fact, because of who you are, there is no chance you are unaware.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0003
029	You are of the Sephira. Why ally yourself with Ouroboros?
030	Simple.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
031	If I must die, I've always wished it to be in the field of battle.
032	...
033	It seems like such a foolish regret to concern myself with, looking back. But, I just can't help it! It's who I am. Farewell, Ophioneus!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
034	It's finished, Ouroboros.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
035	...Hmm.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
036	Is something the matter?
037	The will of the Cursed Beast lingers. It would be most bothersome were it to get in the way of those humans who shall next make their play.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
038	Shall I take your magil and overwrite it with something a bit more to my liking, Lucifer?
039	Just as you did when we were created? Hmph. Are you trying to flood the board with pieces now?
040	Only make the best use of the pieces already in play, I assure you. Though humans certainly do seem prone to playing the numbers game in situations like this, don't they?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
041	...
042	Hmm... Here's an idea. Let's bring back that one man. The one who killed more humans than any other, if memory serves.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
043	What was his name again? Ignacio, I believe?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
044	Well, well. How nostalgic. I certainly didn't expect to meet you again here. Decided to crack open the lid of the hell pot and let some steam escape, did you?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
045	You certainly like playing with fire, don't you, Ouroboros?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
046	Don't say that. I'm a professional, you know! I've never once done any less than my best, and I take great pride in that.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
047	My Wrath is a righteous flame...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
048	(That strike... I put a lifetime's worth of experience into it.)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
049	(And now, in this place...)
050	(I must replicate it!)
051	Oho!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
052	I shall commit the full power of my Wrath into my blade!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0012
053	Now!
054	It went through?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0046
055	Ha! How precious. Did you really think that would work?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
056	I recognize that power. At the top of the tower, that man used the same thing. Alchemy, was it?
057	I don't...believe so? It's nothing like what Nimul can do, with the wind and the ice and everything.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
058	All I'm doing is committing my full self to each swing of the sword.
059	Shameful. You don't even understand the power you wield.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
060	But I will recognize that strength, nonetheless. And in so doing...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
061	I shall change my own strategies and meet you where you stand!
062	What...?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
063	Leviathan?! Andechs!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
064	I have been given a portion of the power Ouroboros has at hand.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
065	It is time for you to drown in the endless sea!
066	"We are the ones who embrace Envy..."
067	"My body is a shield, a silver barrier that blocks and breaks all that attempt to cross it!"	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
068	Think you can block this?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0008
069	Nrgk...	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
070	(I can't push through! Even if I could cut it with my sword, the makeup of the magil is too different!)
071	It's like we're fighting a Cursed Beast itself!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
072	Yes... But luckily, we have allies on our side.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0005
073	What? What is the meaning of this?!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0019
074	All right, we're up and running! Took us a bit to get the hang of the magil in this place, but we figured it out in the end!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
075	Daphne! Andechs! We're keeping her held in place! Now's your chance!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
076	Got it!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
077	Space-Time Manipulation? That takes me back.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
078	Uh...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
079	I can't say I understand the exact parameters of the technique, but if all you've done is slow down time for my body movement, then there's a simple solution: I'll just move even faster!
080	Agh?!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
081	She made an explosion with her magil to propel herself forward and attack, almost like she shot herself from a cannon!
082	This is what's required to pierce the scales of a dragon.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0010
083	Let's see if you're any tougher than that!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
084	Show me that my faith in your potential has not been wasted!
085	What are you—?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
