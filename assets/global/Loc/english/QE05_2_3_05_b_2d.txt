001	Hah!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0007
002	That was the last one. Why don't you show yourself?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
003	You're as strong as the rumors say. Definitely worth the trouble of finding you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0044
004	You are...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
005	I expect there's no need for me to introduce myself. I assume you already have a dossier on me.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
006	So this was a test.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
007	We should talk. Come with me.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
008	I never expected to receive an invitation from the famed Desert Wings.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
009	Uh, yeah, flattery won't get you anywhere. All I want to know is whether you'll take this job or not.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
010	The tyranny of the nobles is crumbling and a new era of a true republic is upon us... We're pretty much willing to use any tool we can get our hands on.
011	In particular, you Sephira would be a pretty effective game piece in resisting the Holy Guard.
012	Personally, I'm of the opinion that I can make the best use of you and your friends.
013	Are you saying you want to use us as a constraining force against other factions?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
014	Well, yeah. The way I see it, this continent is in peril.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
015	Gluttony continues to interfere with everybody's affairs, and Greed Dike is doing that inconvenient military expansion thing they seem to be stuck on.
016	Without any blessings from Sacred Stones... With all this aggression surrounding us... The Desert Zone is in a precarious position. Wouldn't you agree?
017	...
018	Oh, and recently, some Sand Hawks and I ran into the Corpse.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
019	I can't believe the Holy Guard claims to represent justice with such a dangerous pet at their heels.
020	We share a common enemy. All I'm saying is... If we were to join forces, the sooner the better.
021	Very well, but what do you intend to have us do? If we become too active in public, we will be become easy targets for our enemies.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0038
022	I'm thinking of spreading word of you lot around certain back channels—make something of a name for you in the underground. Publicly, I was thinking...couriers for my guild?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0037
023	Will we be permitted to prioritize our own needs?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
024	Come on, old man. Don't be such a stick in the mud. Your objective is to coexist with us, isn't it?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
025	Otherwise, you would've tried to solicit Carla, a marked one, into your ranks.
026	You're waiting, aren't you? You're waiting until the people of the desert can accept the burden of living with the Sephira.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
027	You think too highly of me, but...I am glad to know that you are trying to understand my people.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
028	All right. We will lend you our strength, but in exchange, you will help us as well. So that we can each accomplish our goals.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0038
029	Well, I guess this concludes negotiations. Kinda hoping you'll make life easier for me.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
030	The people were struggling. Every time war enveloped their land, I was frustrated by my own helplessness.
031	My time had already passed and the future was now in the hands of another.
032	All I had left was the ability to do what I believed to be right.
033	I worked to protect my remaining comrades and reduce bloodshed as much as possible.
034	I believed this to be my mission, and the reason I was allowed to live as long as I had done.
035	But...
