001	Aye, it's here! This is the Panema Overpass! The railway runs under here!
002	Allie, where's the locomotive?!
003	It'll pass here in a minute from now! We made it, aye!
004	Just barely. There's one thing I want to make sure before the locomotive comes.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
005	Huh? What is it?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_00225
006	As you can see from how they were waiting for us at the station, the Beckrams have been expecting us to attack.
007	I'm sure they've implemented extreme security measures. Moreover, once we're in the train compartments, there's no way of escaping. There's a chance that they've even planted traps.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
008	Are you trying to say that it'll be dangerous? Don't worry. I'm prepared. I'm the cause of all of this. There's no escaping for me.
009	But...
010	You have to pave your own path...right?
011	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
012	I also want to pave my own path...to follow my destiny.
013	Aye, don't worry! Whatever happens, Fiona, I'll protect you!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
014	You seem determined.
015	I am.
016	Jeez. Don't hold me responsible for whatever happens, all right? That being said, little lady...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
017	Huh?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
018	You moved me with your determination.
019	I'm sure your father would've been proud to see how much you've grown.
020	Heheh. Thank you.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0007
021	Here comes the locomotive, aye!
022	All right! Look sharp. We're going in!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
023	A-are we gonna jump down?
024	Come on. There's no way I'm leaving my pal in a place like this.
025	Wait...we're gonna go down on the bike?!
026	Of course. Come on. The clock protector is waiting for us! Hold on tight!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
