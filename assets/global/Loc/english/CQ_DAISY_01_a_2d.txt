001	All right, it's opening time. I hope I don't get any annoying customers today.	VO_rish.rish_chara_0003
002	Hey, Mister Weirdo!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0003
003	Urgh. So I get the most annoying one first. Of course.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
004	Mister Weirdo! Misterrrr Weirdoooooo!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
005	Don't run in my shop, you little savage! And I'm not a weirdo, so stop calling me that!	VO_rish.rish_sys_0012
006	You make toys and play with your machines all year round. I bet you talk to the dolls when you get lonely!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0039
007	Your hat is funny-looking, too!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
008	Oh? So that's what you think of me, is it?	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
009	Hey, Richie?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0002
010	Tch. Why do you drop the "Mister" as soon as you use my actual name?	VO_rish.rish_chara_2009
011	Well, um... Heheh. I, uh... D-do you have any fun toys?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0031
012	Hmm? Ah, now that you mention it... Recently, I procured a game called shogi from Wadatsumi.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
013	It's an interesting little game that requires wit and tactics. Speaking of which, what's that game you're always playing, again?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0010
014	Um...
015	You know the one I'm talking about. You fight with those strange little armored machines... Ah, Mech War Games! That's it.	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
016	M-Mech War Games?! I-I wasn't talking about that. This has nothing to do with Leema! It's not like I came here to talk to you about Mecha Lance, or—	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
017	You're not much of a thinker. It would be a good way for you to study tactics.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0001
018	Anyway, so, uh, I...wanna mod my Mecha Lance! Yeah! That's it! I don't have a request or anything specific in mind...but yeah, if you could teach me how to service machines, that'd be really...	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0029
019	You're not listening to me at all, are you? What do you mean, "how to service machines"?	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
020	...
021	You know, if you suddenly go quiet or avoid my eyes, it's a bit of a giveaway that you have something to say.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
022	Please, Richie! I've been scoring really low in Mech War Games lately, and I ended up fighting with my mechanic, Leema!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0002
023	She services my gear for me so it's her fault, but she just won't accept it! She said that if I wasn't happy with her work then I should do it myself, 'cause maintenance doesn't do itself...or something like that!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0016
024	And I told her—I will do it myself!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0030
025	So I ran off and signed up for a tournament that's kinda like the Mech War Games held in Real Heaven! I'm competing all by myself, and that's why I need your help!
026	(Hmph. Just when I think she's clammed up, she starts talking at a mile a minute.)	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
027	So, please, you gotta teach me how to service machines! Please! I'm begging you!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
028	No.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0039
029	Why?! I need to be the best, no matter what! I don't care if I have to do it alone—I'll do whatever it takes! I will be the strongest!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0012
030	(Hmph. This girl really is an insufferable little savage.)	VO_rish.rish_chara_2009
031	Customers?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
032	More like...regulars.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
033	Hello! I'm here to rob you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
034	He says he's here to rob you.	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0039
035	That's what we call a regular around here.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0010
036	Well, then. If I get rid of these guys, you can thank me by teaching me how to service machines!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0044
037	H-hey! I'm not agreeing to anything!	VO_rish.rish_sys_0025
