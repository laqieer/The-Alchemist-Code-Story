001	The scouts have returned. They've found a village where the Wratharis soldiers are hiding.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0004
002	I'll go take the report. Bertrand, I leave you in command here.
003	The village is close. It is possible that Wratharis soldiers will launch a surprise attack. Don't let your guard down.
004	What did you mean earlier when you told me to be wary of Lord Gabirond?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
005	As you can see... Lord Gabirond's motives are tinged with a strong desire to conquer Wratharis.
006	Of course, his goal is to annihilate the remaining rebels. However, under that banner, it is quite likely he will not hesitate to eradicate the citizens of Wratharis as well.
007	True...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
008	The enemy's people, too, are the victims of this sorrowful conflict.
009	That is something Captain Zeke once told me.
010	Although it may be nothing more than a mission for us, our actions could possibly lead to the creation of war orphans.
011	...!
012	Before we wield our sword in any battle, we must bear the weight of that reality.
013	Would you want young children to experience the same pain that you felt?
014	You know that I'm a war orphan?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
015	In the Dawn of Wrath that led to the destruction of Wratharis, I heard that two war orphans—a boy and a girl—were rescued on the battlefield.
016	That boy was you, wasn't it, Dias?
017	... ...
018	I know about your painful past, as well.
019	However, the desire for revenge only gives birth to further revenge. You should not rely on that emotion.
020	Bertrand, you...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
021	I'll say this once again—do not be swayed by flattery. As long as you allow malicious intentions to guide you, you will never become a true knight.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0041
022	...!
