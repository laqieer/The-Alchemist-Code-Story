001	Gluuuurrrp!
002	Was that the last one? Wow, I'm a long way from the village.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
003	(The threat of the Jam still lingers in Saga. I can't just leave...)
004	Hm? This is...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
005	Oh, yeah... I used to come here with Father, all the time.
006	Urgh!
007	What's the matter, Tina? Is that all you've got?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0030
008	Only with a pure, well-trained body can you control Ouija.
009	You will eventually become a Shaman and lead the Toxotes tribe.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
010	Do you think I can let someone who gives up this easily be the next Chief? Now, come at me!
011	Right!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
012	Nngh!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
013	Father!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
014	I'm fine. Just as I thought... You will grow to be a Shaman greater than me.
015	Greater than...? I-I couldn't!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
016	No, that is how it should be. The younger generations have always been the ones sustaining the land of Saga.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0039
017	Father...
018	Tina, do you love Saga?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
019	I do! Of course!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
020	The Toxotes, Father, and everyone else!
021	Kiki, Adel, Leoferes... I love everything and everyone in this vast, natural land!
022	Then you must become stronger. Earn the strength to protect those whom you love.	VO_adne.adne_sys_1023
023	There will come a time when you must shoulder the fate of Saga. That is, if you can indeed manage to become stronger than me.
024	I'm not so old as to let my child defeat me.	VO_adne.adne_sys_1047
025	Right! I will keep your words in my heart and train even harder!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
026	That's the spirit! But, never forget, Tina...	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
027	You, too, are part of Saga.
028	Those who cannot defend themselves cannot defend others.
029	I'm...part of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
030	Do not think too hard about it, as you tend to do...	VO_adne.adne_sys_0030
031	Though, some would say that's a good quality of yours.
032	Thank you, Father.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
033	Well, this is nostalgic. It's been a while since I've been here.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
034	I'm part of Saga, huh?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
035	Father, I love this land of Saga, even more so now than before.
036	I just can't leave this place.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
037	I have to let Mocca know.
038	(Now...where is she?)
039	...
040	(Is he...threatened by me?)	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
041	What do you want?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
042	(No, the boundaries among the tribes are dissolving, but... I guess he just still isn't sure how to act about it.)
043	(Saga is changing. The Wind Matter has been restored, and the stiffened hearts of the people are starting to melt.)
044	Is Mocca here?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
045	Yeah... Mocca should be at the wind shrine.
046	I see. Thank you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
047	Hey, uh...
048	Yes?
049	Thank you. I heard that if it weren't for you, Saga would be...
050	Well... You know what I'm trying to say.
051	Thank you. As comrades living in Saga, let's continue to work together to protect our home.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0018
052	Y-yeah!
053	Nnk!
054	Concentrate! You must contain the Matter's power.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
055	When you're manipulating the Matter's power within you, you must be aware that it may run wild, tearing you to shreds.
056	Yes, Voda.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0029
057	Haa...! Haa...! I'm...sorry. I just can't seem to get it right.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0035
058	It's fine. Reabsorbing the Matter you discharged back into your body takes time to master.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
059	We don't have the luxury of time. This one must become the Wind Sprite Alia.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
060	There's no rush. Tamis is doing just fine.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0030
061	That's exactly the kind of talk that comes under the title of "luxury." It is imperative that we get the Sprite Quartet assembled to rebuild Saga.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
062	It doesn't help to be hasty. What we should do for the time being is watch over Saga with care.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
063	Now, don't get started, you two. Tehre has a point.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
064	We can't keep meeting here while the reconstruction is still underway.
065	We do need her to be able to carry the Matter within her.
066	Do you think I will be able to?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0030
067	Don't worry, I have faith in you. I know you can do it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
068	That's right! Be confident, Miss Tamis!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
069	Mocca... Lisbeth... I'll do my best!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
070	Well, we will come again to train you. It is about time we return to our temples to store our various Matters.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
071	We seem to have a visitor.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
072	Excuse me...
073	Miss Tina! What are you doing here?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
074	Hey, Liz. I had something to talk about with Mocca.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
075	With me?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
076	Tina, Mocca... Can that talk wait for just a moment?	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0019
077	What's the matter, Tamis?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
078	I...sense an ominous wind from outside.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0029
079	The Jam?! We can talk later! Let's go, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
080	Got it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
081	I'm coming, too!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
082	Huh, how reliable. It seems our help isn't needed.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
083	Hm...
084	What is the matter, Tehre?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0006
085	It is just... Something has caught my attention.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
086	Something bothering you?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
087	Mm...
