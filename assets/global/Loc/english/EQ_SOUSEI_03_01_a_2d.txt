001	Where am I?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
002	I can't see anything. What is this place?
003	What was the point of such relentless suffering?
004	Emmel? Are you there?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
005	Who are you talking to?
006	What's this?
007	The road you have chosen is an untrodden wasteland.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
008	To disavow sin, to punish it...
009	How do I...know this? That's right, I—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
010	Understand this well. This is what it means to relinquish your sin.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
011	Relinquish...sin?
012	W-wait! That gate! That's the gate I've been...!
013	—mul, Nimul! How long do you plan to—
014	...?!
015	Ah, you're finally up...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
016	Adaleigh? I...
017	You're the one who offered to help! Then you just doze off like that...
018	Day in and day out, I've been navigating this airship. I could use some sleep too, you know?
019	Ugh, well, I'm used to that, but I would have at least enjoyed having someone to talk to!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
020	I'm sorry.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
021	What's wrong? You don't look so good.
022	Lately, my sleep has been quite poor. I've had horrible dreams every night.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
023	You're tired. Go to your room and rest like everyone else.
024	No, I'm fine now! I'm completely refreshed already.
025	So, this Acedia Belt Region we're headed to... What kind of place is it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
026	Curious? Well, I can tell you a little bit about it, or...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
027	You could see it with your own eyes! We'll be crossing the barrier soon!
028	This is...
029	This is the Acedia Belt Region, the domain of the Cursed Beast Belphegor.
030	And the place I was born.
031	I can see some mines here and there. What's that floating island over there?
032	That would be our destination. It's the largest research complex in this region, the floating city of Redington.
033	That floating piece of land is a city? What's that tower in the center?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
034	Oh, that? Uh, don't worry about it for now. Everything will be explained in due time.
035	I see... What a sight! A city that floats in the sky!
036	Isn't it? This is the power of our magic! But we didn't put our cities in the sky for no reason, you know...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
037	Ah, right. If I remember correctly, this region—
038	Let's save the details for later! I'm bringing the airship alongside!
039	It's going to be a little rough going in. Can you go tell everyone to brace themselves?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
040	No problem.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
041	Alright, docking complete! Perfect, just as expected!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
042	This is a city of the Acedia Belt Region, is it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
043	Incredible! The city's really floating! And there are so many airships! They're mostly smaller than ours, but there are scores of them!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
044	I had already known from seeing Adaleigh's airship, but this is truly a region on the cutting edge of technology!
045	A place of such development... It really puts Sephira Village to shame.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
046	Everybody I see is carrying some kind of machine. It shows how deeply technology has permeated this region.
047	Those machines enhanced with magic are characteristic of what we research.
048	Our research is focused on developing the technology to control magil in-line with the principles of the world.
049	It requires some very specialized tools to maintain, so it is less adaptable compared to your Spiritbonding or the magic of the Luxuria Belt Region.
050	But any individual can use it, regardless of what strengths or weaknesses they might have.
051	Basically, its advantages are that it's reliable and anyone can use it as long as someone understands the system, so—
052	Adaleigh, you really love to prattle on about your favorite topics, don't you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0010
053	Wha—?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
054	Come on, Mira. Let him go on. Experts like him need to get a sense of satisfaction from listening to themselves talk.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
055	You both know that you don't always have to speak what's on your mind, right?
056	Anyway, I'll be happy to have a place for us to settle down for a while. Will the airship's repairs take a great deal of time?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
057	Yeah. A complete overhaul will take at least a week.
058	Many of the specially ordered parts are busted, so we need to start by getting those.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
059	That being said...
060	So that airship we were talking about has returned? What does that have to do with anything?
061	But really, to bring in people from another region...
062	Are they seriously planning to do something to the Cursed Beast?
063	That isn't any concern of ours. We have no time to spare on this matter.
064	There's just not enough time. In order to keep everything on schedule, we must complete our current research.
065	Despite all the attention we're getting, not one of them seems to be interested in speaking to us.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
066	Adaleigh, do people here...not like you? Are you all right? You do have friends in this region, don't you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
067	It's none of your business!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
068	The people of this city are just like this. Everyone has their hands full with their own research.
069	So they're all so absorbed in their own world that they can't be bothered by anything outside of it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
070	Hmm, this attitude sounds familiar...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
071	Don't look at me like that. There's absolutely no way I'm as bad as they are.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
072	Hmm...
073	Your silence is hurtful.
074	In any case, pretty much everyone here is like this, so try not to mind it.
075	Hah! I knew I recognized the sound of that motor!
076	What's with this wear and tear, Adaleigh? How much time are you gonna spend running around in corrupted regions?
077	Oh no... I know that voice.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
078	Hey, you could at least pretend to be happy to see me!
079	I came all the way out here to greet you!
080	...
081	...
082	What a touching reunion, huh?
083	Why are you just standing there with your arms wide open?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
084	Statistically speaking, this kind of reunion should result in a big hug and joy and that kind of thing... Right?
085	No way! Why are you trying to embarrass me?
086	That's adolescence for ya.
087	Adaleigh, who might this be?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
088	This is Icona. How should I put this... She's my senior, er...fellow researcher?
089	I'm delighted to meet your friends! For the first time! I've never been so proud. Brings a tear to my eye... My little boy's growing up...
090	My name is Icona. I'm the Chief Engineer here in Redington.
091	Chief...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
092	That means I'm the head honcho of engineers here!
093	Even the mayor listens to what I say. You could say I'm something of a VIP around here, a member of an elite, privileged class of people, right?
094	You're not supposed to brag like that. You're embarrassing me...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
095	There's nothing wrong with a little bragging! The people in this region don't care about anything but their own affairs. It's terribly dull.
096	If don't do this, no one would know to appreciate my excellent achievements!
097	Right. No one here seems interested in the people around them. Well, except you, that is.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0045
098	Isn't it sad? Technology would progress by leaps and bounds if only we could manage to cooperate better with each other around here!
099	If you isolate yourself completely, then you're bound to make a ton of errors and get stuck in uncertainty without any way out.
100	...Icona, you don't think much before you open that mouth of yours, do you?
101	Ahaha! Well, I did actually have a reason for coming here. Your airship needs repairs, right?
102	Yeah. The environment of other regions is more than I imagined, and our specs aren't as good as I'd like.
103	Gotcha, gotcha! Still looking for the Sephira, right?
104	Finding a way to deal with the Cursed Beasts isn't going to be easy.
105	With a quest like this, you'll fail time and time again. But then you can—
106	Actually... I've found them.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
107	...What?
108	Apologies. We haven't introduced ourselves yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
109	My name is Nimul, and I come to this region to save it from the threat of the Cursed Beast.
110	...Give me all the details.
111	I see. So you're saying...
112	So Nimmy and Waggy here, plus Emmy too, are all people of Sephira?
113	Emmy?
114	And you guys came all the way here to the Acedia Belt Region right after beating down Asmodeus, the Cursed Beast of the Luxuria Belt Region?
115	Put that way, it does sounds pretty unbelievable.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
116	Even I can barely believe we really did all that, and got ourselves all the way here to boot.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
117	So the Sephira are capable of subduing corruption and Anti-Curse magic, huh?
118	That's a pretty selfish way of going about things...
119	Icona?
120	Nah, it's nothing. So this is to say that you guys think you know how to deal with the Cursed Beasts?
121	Yes. We plan to release all people from the threat of the Cursed Beasts. In fact, we consider that our mission.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
122	I know this might be difficult to believe, but we would be honored to have your cooperation.
123	Nah, I believe you. I'm not so distrustful as to doubt my own brother.
124	Uhm, you two are related?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
125	We're not blood-related. We were both orphans.
126	Oh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
127	Icona...
128	It's fine, Adaleigh. It's not like it's a rare thing in this region.
129	Ah...
130	So, have you guys already worked out how to defeat the Cursed Beast?
131	No. We were able to defeat the Cursed Beast of Luxuria, but we cannot expect the same method will work every time.
132	So first, we'd like any information regarding the Cursed Beast of this region.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
133	If that's the case, I do think I can help you out. I was planning to go down to the surface for an inspection of the mines sometime soon.
134	I can share whatever info I gather there.
135	There's rumors of illegal mining that I need to check out, though that's not really an engineer's job.
136	Mining on the surface? So your cities are floating above ground, but people live on the surface too?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
137	Ah, it's time to explain things for our guests.
138	You'll need every advantage you can get, and to do that it's vital you know what kind of nightmare you're dealing with.
139	The floating city of Redington was built to avoid earthquakes caused by the Cursed Beast.
140	Earth...quakes?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
141	Simply put, it's a shaking of the earth. The ground shakes so violently that everything on the surface is reduced to rubble.
142	That's right. The land of this region was reduced to a wasteland.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
143	It's all thanks to the earthquakes caused by that Cursed Beast.
144	So you built your homes in the air to avoid the shaking on the surface.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
145	The technology required to make something like this... It's truly remarkable.
146	Though unfortunately, the city isn't large enough to house all the people of this region.
147	And it takes fuel to keep the city airborne, the same as an airship.
148	Something the size of an airship can make due with magil from the air alone.
149	But for something this big...
150	So you mine for fuel on the surface?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
151	Exactly! This region is composed of the elites living in the sky and the laborers living on the surface.
152	To be honest, there are far more people living on the surface than in the air.
153	All commodities and necessary resources are made in factories in the floating cities, then distributed to the population below.
154	Only after collecting a ton of tariffs from them, though. It's the peak of ineffectiveness!
155	If we were to defeat the Cursed Beast, the circumstances here would change.
156	If you believe that going down to the surface would be helpful to our cause, then... The Cursed Beast is on the surface?
157	Not quite. According to the legends, the Cursed Beast lives underground.
158	Legends? You're saying that no one has ever seen it?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
159	I'm sorry to say it, but there is no record of anyone laying eyes on it for centuries.
160	Still, the earthquakes are real and there are many tales of corruption swallowing miners in the mine shafts.
161	At the very least, there is no denying that there is something underground.
162	That means that we should start by locating the Cursed Beast. When will your inspection of the surface begin?
163	Well, it could be right around the corner, but I haven't been told that it's an urgent matter.
164	I mean, the fact that they have a technician taking care of this inspection instead of the Special Detectives, Redington's so-called "hunting dogs," shows that they're not too pressed about it.
165	I suppose they just want to be able to say on paper that they did indeed take a look.
166	Special Detectives...
167	What's wrong, Adaleigh? You don't look so good.
168	No, it's... It's nothing.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
169	A long time ago, Adaleigh was tied up in allegations of embezzling research funds.
170	Wow, you were a real bad boy, huh?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
171	It wasn't me! They targeted me because I was an orphan!
172	I didn't know you've led such a difficult life, Adaleigh.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
173	What do you mean by that?!
174	In any case, the first thing to do is to get ourselves situated.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
175	It's possible that we might encounter the Cursed Beast, so it would be wise to make sure we're in the best condition to handle it.
176	That's right. We've been cooped up in the airship for too long with barely any physical activity.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
177	I'd like to try and get back into shape.
178	Aha! Exercise! So you'd like get moving?!
179	What?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0005
180	I was just griping over how there's not enough combat data for the new Engineer Soldier models.
181	I'd be incredibly grateful if you could help me collect some data with a practice battle!
182	Nimul...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0031
183	That woman is a vital ally. Got it, Waginau?
184	Tch!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
185	It doesn't matter if you agree or not, okay? All right, let's move!
186	Very well. We'll show these tin men what we can do!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
187	W-what? Me too? Me too?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
188	Well, it's not a bad chance for me to test this out!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
189	Target acquired! Target acquired! Confirmation of enemy units. Commencing with elimination.
