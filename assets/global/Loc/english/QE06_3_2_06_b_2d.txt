001	Has anyone seen Mikaboshi and Sumeragi?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
002	Are they not in their room?
003	Of course not! That's why I'm asking you! You don't think...?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0020
004	Lady Mitsuha, where are you going?
005	I'll return shortly!
006	And so, having found an out-of-the-way cave we could use as our base of operations, we began living in secret, away from prying eyes.
007	Our first order of business? Figuring out our first order of business...
008	Malice, huh?
009	Think about it. Our parents successfully ushered in peace between humans and demons. So, why didn't it last? What caused it to fall apart?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
010	And now there are humans suddenly transforming into demons? That's almost unthinkable. And more importantly, it's never happened before.
011	Nothing about this suggests it's part of any natural order. It seems to me that someone must be pulling the strings, trying to deepen the rift between humans and demons.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
012	And that's where this idea of malice comes in...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
013	Right. In short, what we're up against here isn't humans, but nor is it actual demons.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0005
014	Rather, it's more of a metaphorical demon. A demon called malice. And whatever entity may be harboring it.
015	Okay. But how do we fight something like that?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
016	I have an idea. For now, though, I just know that if we're going to realize our parents' will, we can't allow ourselves to lose to something as petty as malice.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
017	Besides, we need to find a way to make Lady Mitsuha smile again, right?
018	Yeah. We do.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0038
019	From then on, Sumeragi started working on something in the back of that cave.
020	Banging and hammering echoed throughout, almost nonstop. I didn't really have the heart to ask him what he was doing, but clearly, this was to be our secret weapon.
021	A fair amount of time passed like this, though I had no way to tell how much. But eventually, the hammering stopped.
022	Blast! It's not quite right! I just can't seem to get it how I want it...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0027
023	Sumeragi? is that...a katana?!
024	Yeah. A Treasure Blade, to cut away the malice. That's what we need to set things right.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
025	Isn't that just Father's old kitchen knife, though? And... Wait, what's that attached to it?! Don't tell me...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
026	I'm using Mother's horn that was hidden in her clothes when Lady Mitsuha found us.
027	That's our only real keepsake of hers! How could you?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0012
028	How could I? This is its purpose! This is why she left it for us!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0012
029	We can't let malice win the day. We have to use every tool at our disposal!
030	That's not what I mean! I mean, you should've said something to me, so we could work on this together! I wanna help too, you know?
031	Though, that is also the only thing Mother left for us, and there's only one horn, so you are definitely a jerk for using it on your stupid blade without asking me first!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0017
032	Oh, come on! Fine. I'm sorry for keeping this a secret, but don't call me a jerk, and don't call my sword stupid! You're the stupid jerk!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0025
033	If the shoe fits...then you're a jerk! Stupid jerk.
034	Quit acting like a spoiled brat!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0027
035	I'm glad to see you two haven't changed.
036	?!
037	You both really are quite the handful, you know.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
038	Lady Mitsuha!
