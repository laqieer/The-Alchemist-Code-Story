002	Whew... They sure are savage. At least we can breathe easy now.
003	Everyone okay? Teach, are you getting what you need?
004	Minerva examines several of the monster corpses closely.
005	As we've observed, not all of the wildlife here exhibit unprovoked aggression.
006	It appears that only a certain population is affected... But, why?
007	If it was contamination from the earth, we'd be contending with an entire forest of aggressive wildlife... But clearly, we're not.
008	I really hope they aren't directly feeding on Alchemia samples.
009	They wouldn't be able to break into the containers anyway, if they're anything like Lustburg's.
010	Nothing short of a heavy impact would.
011	Grrrrr...
012	Did you hear something?
013	*howl*
014	Dang! They're back!
015	Guess they came with backup.
016	Where do they keep coming from? There weren't so many of them when we were observing them just now.
017	We'll have to find out later. For now, let's try not to turn into monster food!
