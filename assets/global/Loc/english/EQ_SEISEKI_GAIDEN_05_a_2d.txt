001	This is consistent as well... That means... Could this be...the reason for which Alchemy was created?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
002	A giant beast... Colossal... And the humans who stood against it.
003	If they were Knights of the Holy Guard... It's only a theory, but...there's no mistaking that there's something substantial waiting to be discovered here.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
004	Interesting. I mustn't jump to conclusions...but if this is true...it's incredibly dangerous.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0024
005	How's the observation coming along?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
006	One step at a time... We won't reach the truth so easily.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
007	It will likely require the same level of knowledge and persistence as fumbling blindly in the dark.
008	Fumbling blindly in the dark...huh?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
009	This really is a huge undertaking... Overwhelmingly so.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
010	However, this is what I want to do. It's what I was made to do.
011	I... What I want to do...is...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
012	Watching the knights in action made you doubt your decision to come with me, didn't it?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
013	I... Yes.
014	That's why I told you... You should just keep facing forward. I'll look backward, and uncover the truth.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
015	But...I need to protect everyone!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
016	The right person for the right job. You can't protect everyone by yourself, you know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0014
017	Honestly... A chivalrous fool and a blockhead, trying to protect everyone... You really don't understand women, you know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
018	Ngh...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
019	Heh...heheh...hahahah! Ahh, I never usually laugh like that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
020	I'd prefer it if you wouldn't make fun of me.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
021	How nostalgic... I feel like we always used to talk like this when Cadanova was still here.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
022	Hyahh!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0032
023	Hmm... That was good.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0024
024	If you never improve yourself, you'll be caught off guard... Hah!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
025	That was close, Yauras, but I can't let you beat me, now can I?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
026	You win.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
027	You lack foresight. You need to visualize a few strikes further ahead; improve your perception.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
028	That will allow your natural speed to flourish...but I must say, your improvement surprises me, Yauras.
029	Your technique is truly magnificent. I even find myself captivated by it. You should devote yourself to it.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
030	Wh-what are you saying all of a sudden?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0047
031	Just watch. I will wipe that complacent smile off your face someday.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
032	Hmm, Cadanova is good with women... Unlike a certain someone.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
033	But...didn't he simply praise Yauras' development?
034	Heheh... Lord Commander or not, you never change, do you, Zain?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
035	You're still a chivalrous fool and a blockhead.
036	Ngh...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
037	Don't make fun of him, Kaya. Those are also Zain's strengths.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
038	Cadanova...
039	It's rare to find someone who spends every waking moment thinking of the peace and justice of Babel... Alright, Lord Commander, let's go.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
040	I was hoping you would say that, Cadanova.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
041	This may be mere training, but with you as my opponent, I'm not going to hold back.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
042	We've fought more times than I can count...but I'm going to enjoy this, Zain!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
