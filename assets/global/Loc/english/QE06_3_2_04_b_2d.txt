001	Match point! I win!
002	You got me, fair and square. You really are something, Mikaboshi.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0030
003	It's all thanks to these horns.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
004	Yeah. I'm a little jealous, I won't lie. Those horns are a direct connection back to Mother.
005	It's because of them, though, that we have to stay hidden like this.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0030
006	I don't care. I'm still jealous. Always will be! Plus...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
007	It's thanks to those horns that we were able to grow up with Lady Mitsuha.
008	Well, I'm jealous right back! You have a strong heart in you, Sumeragi. Just like Father did.
009	I guess the grass really is always greener on the other side.
010	Eheheh. I guess so!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
011	Good. You're smiling again. That's how it should be.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
012	I bet that's the spitting image of how Mother would've looked when she smiled.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0007
013	And you probably look just like Father! Maybe. I'm guessing.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
014	Oh, speaking of which, I really need to gather up all these drawings. I got a little carried away reading Father's journal.
015	Hmm?
016	What is it?
017	What's this a picture of? People and animals, side by side. Looks like they're all having fun together.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
018	It's my interpretation of a story from long, long ago that Father mixed in with one of his recipes.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
019	It tells of a time when humans and animals lived as equals right here in Wadatsumi.
020	Humans and animals...lived as equals?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
021	Yeah. It's hard to imagine, isn't it? But I found it really interesting, so I tried to draw it.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0005
022	Even the mighty tigers and leopards lived side by side with giant serpents, which we'd just see as monsters to be vanquished nowadays.
023	But back then, they all got along just fine.
024	......
025	That's how I think things are supposed to be, since back in those days, it was just completely normal.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
026	And that's also why I believe in what our parents were trying to do. They wanted to put Wadatsumi back on its proper path—to return things to the way they used to be all those years ago.
027	Wow, okay. I had no idea!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
028	One day, you and I will be able to show everyone.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0038
029	That our parents weren't wrong?
030	Yeah. All of it.
031	Then people will stop turning against Lady Mitsuha, too, right?
032	Of course.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
033	It's...good that we were born, isn't it?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0018
034	Well, yeah! Don't ever doubt that. Imagine how sad Mother and Father would be if they thought you felt any differently!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0030
035	And...Lady Mitsuha, too.
036	Yeah... Yeah! You're right!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
037	I think it's kind of our destiny. Just like our parents, we need to come together and find some way to create an everlasting peace for Wadatsumi.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
038	We need to change what normal is for people. Today's "normal" is pretty screwed up. But I believe we can bring back the Wadatsumi of old, if we try.
039	No, it's not just that we can. We have to! It's something only the two of us can pull off.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0005
040	Let's make Wadatsumi into the country Mother and Father always thought it could be!
041	Then Lady Mitsuha will start smiling a lot more often, right?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
042	Yeah, as long as you stop bothering her, anyway.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0005
043	Hah! Well, then that settles it! We're doing this! For ourselves, for our parents, for Wadatsumi, and for Lady Mitsuha!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
044	There you go. That's the face, right there. That's the "normal" I'm looking for from you, Mikaboshi.
045	Thank you, Sumeragi! I'm really feeling motivated now. I truly believe we can make all of this happen, as long as we stick together!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0034
046	Me too.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0007
047	This was our vow to each other that day. And we would never stop striving to fulfill it.
048	We existed somewhere between human and demon, but continued to support each other in pursuit of a world where such distinctions would no longer matter.
049	But in our noble pursuit, we remained blissfully unaware of the stage being set all around us.
050	For it was around this time that an even greater malice was poised to envelop Wadatsumi altogether...
