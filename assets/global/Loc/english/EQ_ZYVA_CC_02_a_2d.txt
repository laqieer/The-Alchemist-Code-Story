001	Reason for applying?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
002	I want to do something meaningful. Your principles of world domination left an incredibly strong impression on me.
003	I am seeking a new post, and I would very much like to work under you.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
004	Tell me... Why would a member of Greed Dike's Imperial Elite Guard elect to venture all the way out here to Lost Blue?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
005	The assassination contracts issued by Greed Dike were taken up by people from this region.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
006	Your expertise is well valued in my homeland. It is said that you achieve the greatest results while causing the minimal amount of damage, and evaluations of your speed, magical resources, and martial prowess are always favorable.
007	If it is world domination that you seek, then I do believe that Greed Dike, the nation of avarice, would serve you best.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
008	Or if you would borrow a power greater than your own, perhaps you might pay a visit to our king, Dead Nine.
009	You're quite cautious.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
010	I am merely a coward.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
011	And if I were captivated by you?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
012	That would truly be frightening.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
013	Oh, my apologies, madam.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0035
014	Move it, lump.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
015	Oho...?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0044
016	Friend of yours?
017	Not likely.
018	As you can see, this region is little more than a cesspool where the dregs of the world gather.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
019	I would prefer people to value their lives, you see.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
020	What are you talking about?
021	I am sick to death of my homeland, where life is, sadly, wasted.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
022	I abhor it; there is nothing worthwhile for me to do back there.
023	As for your suggestion regarding your king... He is far too reckless for my liking. I will not pander to him.
024	Should we succeed in turning this world on its head, there would be more than a few casualties. An extensive purge would be called for, in fact.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
025	I would enjoy that. Oh, so very much.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0023
026	I thought lives ought to be valued?
027	Contrary to appearances I am, in fact, quite picky.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
028	You know, you still haven't told me your name.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
029	Ah, yes. My apologies.
030	You may call me...Giudecca.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
031	Hm...?!
032	Heh... I see.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
033	Do you? Are you certain?
034	I am. That's why I'm going to take you on.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0037
035	Am I correct in assuming this means that I am hired?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
036	Starting immediately. Your first task will be to retrieve what that filthy sneak-thief stole from me just now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
037	Ahh, I was so hoping that it hadn't escaped your notice. Splendid! What did she take?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0046
038	Something that ranks third only to my own life and...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
039	And...?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
040	Terror itself.
041	I wonder how many days it's been since I've eaten...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
042	Hahah... Ahahahah...! That fool's bag is so...heavy. Must be something worth a lot of gold...and food...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
043	Urgh...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0029
044	Nothing but books...
045	Philosophy textbooks, apparently.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
046	Aaaaahh!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0026
047	I'm afraid they aren't worth a single Zeni to you. You can't sell those here.
048	Y-you were with him...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
049	Would you be so kind as to give those back?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0003
050	Hah. As if. You should've been more careful.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0010
051	Are you interested in philosophy?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
052	I'm interested in surviving.
053	From a philosophical standpoint?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
054	Anyway, I stole it, so it's mine!
055	Very well. How about a trade? Tit for tat, this for that.
056	Huh?! B-but that's mine! When did you...?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
057	I stole it, so I believe that makes it mine, yes?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
058	Give it back!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_battle_0019
059	Don't you know stealing things is wrong?!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0003
060	I could ask you the same question.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
061	That's mine, because it's mine! This is mine, because I stole it!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
062	What is in here? Something...valuable?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
063	Don't you dare open it!
064	Oho...?
065	Keep your slimy hands off it!
066	You really are piquing my interest.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
067	Nnrgh!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0025
068	You should have been more careful.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
