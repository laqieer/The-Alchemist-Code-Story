001	We do not desire open conflict! We are here to make simple inquiries, so please allow us to speak to the head of the household!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
002	Lower your weapons! We do not wish to fight!
003	Huzzaaaahh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
004	Tch! They won't listen to a word I say!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
005	What are they planning?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
006	Kill them! Kill them all! The time has come to take action!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
007	We'll have to force our way through!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
008	Where is Yomi?! What are you planning?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
009	Be warned, I'm not going to hold back!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0001
010	They're after the Discarnate Power! Do not let them approach! We'll overwhelm them with our numbers!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
011	Fear not death! For the Shiba Senko!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
012	Get out of my way!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
013	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
014	...
015	Haa...haa... J-Jin! Are you okay?!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
016	...
017	Well?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
018	...
019	Yomi?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
020	Yomi!
021	J-Jin...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
022	Hello, Yomi.	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
023	Hello...Jin.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
024	I've been...thinking.
025	About...how I could overcome my past.
026	I decided that...
027	I have to see you.
028	Wait, do I? Yes, I do have to see you.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
029	Y-Yomi?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
030	I have to—aaaaah! Have to...see...you, and...and...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
031	The demon's corruption is emanating from her!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0012
032	I have...to...see you...and then... Then...	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0024
033	Kill! I have to kill! Aaaaaaghhh?! Aaaaah!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
034	Yomi! Have you figured out what's really happening here?! It's not Jin who's trying to use you and your powers!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
035	It's the Shiba Senko!
036	They are the ones who are trying to exploit your powers for their own cause! They colluded with the Kagomurasaki so that they could use your Discarnate Power to rebuild Wadatsumi as they see fit!
037	Yomi, you shan't heed a word they say.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
038	Ugh... Aaahh... Old-t-timer?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
039	I came to determine the sincerity of the Shiba Senko and their leader.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
040	I came in peace, and yet they attacked us. Do you know what that means, Yomi?
041	Do any of you know what any of this means?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
042	Wh-what are you...talking about?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0021
043	All of this is for the offering.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
044	Yomi, you are too far gone—beyond the point of no return.
045	The corruption and hatred within you have been amplified to their very limits by the Chakra infused into you through the Demon Calming Ceremony.
046	Now, all you need is a little...push.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
047	A p-push...?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
048	You built up a pile of bodies, and now the lamenting souls left behind are steeping this mansion in a miasma of fear and loathing.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
049	All of this is for the offering—as is my own life.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
050	Hee hee hee!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0023
051	Wh-what are you...?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0027
052	D-did he just...martyr himself?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
053	Ggh! Hahahahaaa...!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
054	I never swore...my allegiance to Yomi! My master...has always been the Discarnate Power—the corrupted...power that lurks within her, which can overwhelm...and conquer this land!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
055	It would be of great satisfaction to me...if this old, rotting life...could be offered as sacrifice for the manifestation of...its power!
056	Aaahh! Aaaaaaaggggggggghhhhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0028
057	Now! Take this feeble old man's life!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0023
058	Nngh! Aaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
059	Aaaaghhh! I...!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0024
060	Heh... Hahahahahaha! I must thank you, Jin! The Discarnate Power will finally take form this day!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0023
061	Y-you...!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
062	At last, Wadatsumi will rise again, reborn as the ultimate nation! We will avenge the disgrace we tasted all those years ago!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
063	The Discarnate Power will charge rampant throughout the world! Wadatsumi will rule over its ruin!
064	Now, Mikaboshi, stone of demonic powers, lend us your strength!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
065	Jin...!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
066	Yomi!
067	Yomi! Your father, your family—Jin killed them all! My death, and all of the Shiba Senko's casualties are his doing!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
068	N-no! You're...lying!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
069	Let the chagrined rage of the dead flow through you! Remember the hatred that once corrupted all of Wadatsumi!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
070	Argh! Aaaaagggghhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0026
071	The Mikaboshi is...!
072	Yomi?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0028
073	Yomi!!!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
074	Leafah! Jin! No! I-I don't... I don't want to...! I finally got to—!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
075	Unngh... Grraaaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0025
076	Yomi...?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
077	Urgh...! Wh-what is...?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
078	...
079	Ngh! Wh-why?! H-how...?	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
080	Rraaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
081	The Mikaboshi was swallowed whole?!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
082	Those of you that can still move, take the wounded and get out of here! Get as far away as you can!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
083	B-but what about you, General?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
084	I will stay here. I must see this fight through to the end, for the future of this country! Now, go!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
085	You should leave, too. You don't want to get dragged into this.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
086	I can't do that.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
087	Grrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!
088	Ngh?!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0022
089	This power...! At this rate, Yomi will—!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0021
090	Huaaahhh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0032
091	Argh! I guess it won't work unless it's Sumeragi... Ngh?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
092	WRAAAAAAAAAGH!
093	Argh! Ngh... Yomi?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0043
094	Ghurgh! Leafah! Leave now! This is a matter to be solved between siblings!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
095	I told you...I can't...do that!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
096	Huuuaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
097	Jin! What'd we say about protecting ourselves?! Do I have to do everything around here?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
098	Nnnnnngggghhhh!
099	Ren!
100	Am I fashionably late?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
101	You found Sumeragi!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0009
102	Impressed? You just about ready to welcome my meddling?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
103	What?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0006
104	You keep saying you'll let me help you out, but you just keep picking up the pieces yourself. You're trying to carry too much.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
105	If your hands are too full, you can't take the one I'm holding out to you, and I can't trust you to watch my back, either.
106	...
107	Is there any way out of this?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
108	Not anymore.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
109	Great.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0044
110	Ren.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
111	Yeah?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
112	Get out of here.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0041
113	You saying I'm holding you back?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0037
114	I'm sorry to be selfish like this.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
115	You're trying to get killed by your sister, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
116	You're the best kind of outrageous! I love it!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
117	Hmph.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
118	So are you.
119	As I suspected, that's what you intend.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
120	Was it written on my face?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
121	This is unacceptable. I can't have the brother of my new friend dying on my watch.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
122	Will you lend me a hand?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
123	All right...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
124	I'm trusting you to watch my back, though.
125	Nngggghhhh! Graaaaaaarrrgggghhhhhh!
126	I guess this is all Sumeragi can do in its incomplete state.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
127	In order to breathe life back into Sumeragi, we need to—!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0026
128	I know!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
129	I don't!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
130	Two different powers were forged from the demon's horns. One was the Mikaboshi, the cradle of demonic power. The other was Sumeragi, the black blade that can exorcise demons.
131	We can breathe life back into Sumeragi by using the blood of someone related to the head of the Black Star Clan.
132	This sword is our only hope. If we don't get its true power to manifest...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
133	Sumeragi was made to counter the Mikaboshi in the event of its misuse.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
134	Since we don't have a royal family anymore, the Kagomurasaki Clan has been in charge of its protection until now.
135	But if its corruption spreads throughout the world, an even greater exorcising power will be needed.
136	We of the Black Star Clan have prepared for that day by devising a technique to power up Sumeragi using our own blood.
137	To unlock the demon's power without it backfiring—that's the super important role I was given by my clan!
138	Nngh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
139	Ren! Why would you...?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
140	Following rules and traditions can be interesting sometimes!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
141	I'm actually kinda having fun right now! Yep. Bleeding is super fun.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
142	All right! It's time for my demon exercise!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0010
