001	It was fortunate that I was near the tunnel opening.
002	Wolves could never have done this. The tunnel exit was definitely broken through by the wolves but the rest of the tunnel is way too cleanly dug to be done by claws.
003	There is no way they could have planned this.
004	The rest of the villagers are holed up in the village hall and it seems that this is the only breach into the village.
005	Let me go check in on them.
006	Siegfried! We have gathered everyone in the village hall and barricaded ourselves in. It will be safe here till the ceremony is over and the Divine is able to come down into our world again.
007	Stay in the village hall and stay safe, I'll close up the tunnel and be right back.
008	You can go without worry, we might have aged but we are more than capable of protecting this place!
009	Come back safely after you close that tunnel, you hear?!
010	Leave it to me.
