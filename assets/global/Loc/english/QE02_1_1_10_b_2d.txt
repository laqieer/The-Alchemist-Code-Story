001	Im-impossible! He single-handedly destroyed the Alkaroid that we were no match against together?!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0021
002	So much for a peaceful solution, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0018
003	Things rarely go according to plan. You're from the Don Taras Family, correct?
004	Agh! Wh-what the—?!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0027
005	Calm down, guys. You were the ones who abducted the little lady, weren't it?
006	The fact that the Alkaroids attacked you is more than enough proof.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
007	Wh-what are you talking?! It's just the mayor cracking down on us!
008	We don't know anything an abducted girl!
009	A crackdown... Is that true?
010	N-no, it's a lie!
011	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
012	Th-there's a rumor going around that the Don Taras Family abducted Miss Fiona Elester!
013	Argh! Anna, you're gonna regret that!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0029
014	Oh...whaa!
015	Don't worry. As long as they know I'm around, they won't do anything to you.
016	More importantly, thanks for telling me.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0034
017	N-not at all! You're the one who saved me! Is there anything I can do to repay the favor?
018	Nonsense. You've given me enough already. You've given me all the courage I need.
019	Oh...
020	Come on. Let's go, Alkemono! Our princess awaits us!
