001	No. I cannot accept it.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0015
002	Please! Oh, please! I ask only that you wear one of my coats—just one!
003	There is a magic to the words you speak when you lead us! Your powers are so wonderful, Lady Annika! All that you are is so splendid, and yet...!
004	And yet I cannot focus on a single word you speak! So please, please, slip on one of these coats! I beg of you!
005	Enough. I refuse to drape myself in cloth. Now, I am going for a walk. I will return when the winds will it.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0039
006	No! Lady Annika...!
007	Ugh... Why must people try to make me wear clothes?	VO_annika.annika_sys_0022
008	To cover the patterns that adorn my skin would be to sully them.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0031
009	These marks maintain the sanctity of my very being. I see no reason why they should be wrapped in cloth and hidden from the world.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0022
010	All my cures are made with love! They are of the finest quality! Don't forget to dote upon your vendor, the oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1001
011	Heavens! It's Little Miss Margaret!
012	Yoo-hoo! Look this way!
013	A merchant? Everyone is crowding around the stall. I suppose I might as well go and have a look.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0004
014	Thank you very much! Do come again!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0037
015	Oh! She has no patterns like mine, yet she is showing quite a lot of skin... It must be so that she can pick up on the flow of energy in nature!	VO_annika.annika_sys_0024
016	Hi, there! What can I do for you?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
017	I am not a customer. I was only thinking that your clothes are very nice.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0003
018	Oh? Well, thanks!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0011
019	You enjoy the feel of nature on your skin, do you not? Just as I do.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0044
020	Umm... Sorry, but as you can see, I'm kinda busy selling my wares right now. Could you let me get back to work?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
021	Very well. I will wait until your business is concluded.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0006
022	N-no, you see, what I was trying to say was... Oh, what have I gotten myself into here?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
023	Hey, you! Who said you could set up shop here?! If you wanna run a stall 'round these parts, you've gotta pay the fee!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
024	Oh, my! Is that so? I had no idea! How careless of me.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0036
025	Hold on. What are you saying, sir? This place is for everyone.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0012
026	What, you a friend of hers or somethin'? Well, if one of you doesn't cough up the coin quick smart, I'm gonna knock the both of you into next week!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
027	Hmmm... This man radiates bad energy. He must be cleansed.	VO_annika.annika_sys_0016
028	I...have no idea what that means, but I think you might be right. Sometimes you just have to get your hands dirty.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0030
