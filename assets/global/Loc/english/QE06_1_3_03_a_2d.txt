001	I take it they were tougher than you thought.
002	I figured I'd take them out before they could try to hinder our plans, but they were...tenacious. They won't be a problem, though.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
003	Even if I am killed, there is still another to succeed me, after all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
004	I'm pleased you think so. Is there anything else I can do for you?
005	No, not really.
006	Where are you going?
007	I'm going to do as demons do. Weren't you the one who said that would be fine?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
008	...Yes. Off to go searching again?
009	I've decided to hunt some pesky foxes first. It will do double duty of accumulating more corruption and hastening the return of our king. Ah, and I should capture that girl with the special powers.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
010	Oh, so you found one of what you'd lost?
011	Hmph, you are a cheeky one. Anyway, are preparations ready?
012	Of course.
013	Then I shall hunt those foxes, and then take my time capturing the girl and the castle.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
014	So then this is it?
015	Is that not also what you planned? How annoying.
016	Anything I can help you with?
017	I don't remember ever teaming up with you. We're just doing what is best for ourselves, am I wrong?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
018	...I suppose that would be best.
019	Tch! Nothing new or useful! Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've read almost everything here at least once before.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
020	But I do remember there being something interesting. Now, where was that written...
021	There you are, Captain Ugachi.
022	Azami. What do you want?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
023	Please spar with me.
024	What?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
025	I couldn't do anything. I even...fainted before the Discarnate Power.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0018
026	You struck it once with your sword.
027	Just once! And only with your help, Captain Ugachi!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0029
028	That's all I could do against the bane of my parents...of my clan! I can't stand how weak I am!	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
029	Azami...
030	I feel the same.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
031	Captain Ugachi...
032	I will kill it next time. This I swear to myself.
033	Going through all of these records is diverting in itself, but sure. I can teach you a thing or two.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0047
034	Thank you!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
035	I see. The lord of pure-blood demons, the Discarnate Power	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
036	Yes. We drove it away once, but we are currently having trouble finding a more permanent solution.
037	Hmm. Why has it showed itself now?
038	That is unknown. However, it did seem very interested in one of our recruits.
039	Really? And what is the name of this recruit?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
040	Her name is Amane.
041	Hmm. I believe there were some records regarding the Discarnate Power in Greed Dike's archives.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0022
042	We shall investigate the Discarnate Power's intentions on our side as well.
043	That would be greatly appreciated.
044	We stand at a very critical moment in history. I expect you to give all you have to restore Wadatsumi to what it should be.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
045	Understood!
046	All is for Wadatsumi.
047	...
048	For Wadatsumi's peace...and justice.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
049	My everyday life... Something worth protecting.
050	Why am I troubled over this?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
051	"This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."
052	"I still believe."
053	"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"
054	This voice and vision. This warm voice was saying, "This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."
055	And believing in its "peaceful days."
056	What am I supposed to do...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
057	Aaaaaaaah! It's not like me to be so low-spirited! I hate this!
058	I should get my body moving in some way. That should help clear my thoughts!
059	I'll beat these wandering thoughts into submission!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
