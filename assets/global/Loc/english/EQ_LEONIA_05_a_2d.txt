001	Even when alone, so long as someone is there to see you shine, you're a star!	VO_laura.laura_sys_0007
002	Now, keep that chin up! Be proud of your starry shine! For, one day, you'll find your very own glow!
003	You got it, Mistress!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0005
004	...
005	While I must acknowledge your sincerity and strength, you ought to know that I am no less sincere and strong.	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0007
006	Th-then...! You're really...?!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0005
007	So long as someone is there to see me shine, I must do everything I can to make them happy...	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0005
008	Having been tasked with the security of this event, I will do everything in my power to preserve that wish of hers!
009	Wait—what? Security?	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0025
010	That is why I cannot allow myself to be defeated by you!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0032
011	Arghhhh!	VO_alfred.alfred_sys_0028
012	Whoo! Way to go, Leoniaz! You did it!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0024
013	Ahh... It is done.	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0010
014	Not quite.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0039
015	You...!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0012
016	I cannot forgive any insolent fool who would dare approach the sweet and adorable Shayna. En garde!	VO_laura.laura_battle_0010
017	What?! I keep telling you people, you've got it all wrong!	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0026
018	Just kidding. I never had such illusions about you, my dear. You are no insolent fool.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0008
019	What? Then why...?	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0025
020	Why, but you look so strong! Who could blame me for wanting to test your mettle?
021	I haven't felt this thrill in a long time. You have my respect.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0046
022	I see... You're not planning on backing down, I take it?	VO_leonear.leonear_sys_0022
023	You are no ordinary woman, that much is plain. For Shayna...and for my own pride, I will do what I must to bring you down.
024	Excellent. Here I go! Prepare to be bewitched!	VO_laura.laura_battle_0012
