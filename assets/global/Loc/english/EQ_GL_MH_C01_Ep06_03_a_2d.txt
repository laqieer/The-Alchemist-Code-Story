001	Damn you Zheng Yi! Is this what you meant by providing them with a means to a better life?
002	Taking in children so that they can become disposable pawns for your ambitions?
003	They died with honor, fighting for a future they believed in! They fight today, in hopes that no one else has to!
004	Ohhh? Is that what this looks like to you?
005	This... this boy... here all alone...
006	What about HIS future, dammit? Did he not deserve a place in this so called better future of yours?
007	Would it be better had they remained orphans on the street? They would've died a dog's death long ago!
008	Just another wretched body on the street... None would bat an eye when they're dead.
009	But I will remember them for the sacrifice they've made this very day!
010	Each and every one of them...
011	Sieg!
012	You must get a hold of yourself!
013	These guys are in way over their heads for that devil!
014	We have to try disabling them... They're too young to go like this!
015	It will be quite the challenge, seeing as they intend to lay down their lives for him.
016	A debilitating field!
017	Teach, you're a genius!
018	Oh, I know how to handle children. I've had years of practice, after all!
019	Go on, dears. I'll take care of things on this end.
020	Alright, this'll make things easier to get to Zheng Yi.
021	Soren, stay close to us.
022	I'll watch our backs, so don't worry.
023	Let's go.
