001	Squeak! Squ-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0002
002	Don...I'd like to keep casualties as low as possible until we reach the Beckrams' mansion.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
003	It might take longer, but I think we should take roads that are less likely to have Guard Droids in wait.
004	Fine. I'll leave it to you. More importantly, what are you planning on doing with them?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
005	With who?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
006	Ronnie and the little lady. We're heading to the Beckrams' home base. I think this is where you should draw the line.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
007	Yeah...I see what you mean.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
008	You gotta be kidding me, Don!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
009	You said that an act of clumsy kindness would only serve to stain the recipient's resolve. Have you forgotten your own words?
010	Ah...! Well, I meant it when I said it, but, in this case...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
011	Didn't you say that everyone must pave their own path?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
012	This is my choice. You won't deny it, will you?
013	No, but...their home base is infested with Guard Droids...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
014	I still haven't discovered the truth behind my father's death!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0017
015	I don't think I will ever find out until we obtain the Sacred Stone Belphegor!
016	Please...take me with you!
017	But...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
018	I thought both of you had the policy of never turning down the request of a lady!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0013
019	You do realize that we're both women, don't you?!
020	Ack...	VO_taras.taras_battle_0020
021	Please!!!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0041
022	There's nothing more frightening than women in this world. You're right about that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
023	Utterly. I wash my hands of this.	VO_taras.taras_battle_0017
024	Yes!!!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0009
025	Tsk! Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
