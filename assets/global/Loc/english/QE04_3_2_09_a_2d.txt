001	I've generally grasped what you are thinking. But...why was it necessary to send just the two of them?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0045
002	There's Lisbeth as well... Wouldn't it have been best to send her along with them?
003	There was no such need. If Saga continues to rely on the power of outsiders, its people will never be able to overcome a crisis on their own.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0039
004	I understand what you're saying, but...both Tina and Mocca are indispensable to Saga right now.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
005	What if something were to happen to them?
006	Then something happens to them. It'll simply be a matter of implementing other measures. Strategies are only effective when you've doubled or tripled the possible outcomes.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
007	Both of them have been gifted with the lost power of the wind. If we lose them, don't you think it will spell doom for the future of Saga?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0016
008	One who cannot overcome the trial cannot save Saga... That much should be obvious to you.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
009	...Tehre! The two of them are not your pawns!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
010	Yes, they are my pawns. They are the pawns I will wield to save Saga. They are the ultimate pawns that appeared to me when I had none.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
011	Tehre, you...!	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
012	You're uncharacteristically incensed, old fox. Are you that invested in those two? You should've lent them a hand then.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
013	Of course, I considered doing that, but...with you involved in all of this, I thought that doing so may have irreversible consequences.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0016
014	A wise decision. I have placed the two of them under surveillance.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
015	If I were to have determined, at any point, that you had a hand in things, I would've forfeited any possibility of attending the Sprite Trio Discourse. Now...you still have a fighting chance.
016	Do you never trust in others? Don't you think it's presumptuous for one like to you claim the title of Sprite?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0017
017	What is the point in trusting others?! Look at what happened to Alia as a result...he was murdered!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0013
018	...Tehre, you...!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0027
019	I thought he would ignore the law and allow Alia to live!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0019
020	Alia, who broke the law in order to protect Saga... He killed him!!!
021	...From that point on, I stopped holding expectations. The only thing I believe in is results. That is why I will protect Saga in the way that I see fit!
022	So...you wish to shoulder Alia's portion of the burden, huh? You were the fondest of Alia...and...you still haven't forgiven Fuu.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
023	What is there to forgive? All that matters is the result. Thus...I move only based on the outcome of matters.
024	That is my way doing things.
025	In other words, you wish only to handle things in your own way. Heheh. We, the Sprite Trio, are truly a stubborn bunch.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0011
026	Hmph... Yet, you came here. This tells me that you have placed your faith in the return of those two.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
027	...Indeed. Although I am worried, I have entrusted the burden to them. All things considered, aren't you doing the same?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
028	No, not I. Of course, the ideal outcome is that the two of them return successfully. However...if they are to fall, I still possess another option.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
029	In other words...I have the key to unlocking the power of the wind... You're just not aware of it.
030	...?! What do you mean, Tehre?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
031	...I mean that those two are not Saga's only hope!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
