001	Look at you! You've got this sparring thing down! This is great! How about...this?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0008
002	You handled that one well, too! You're pretty good, you know that? Your injuries seem to have healed well.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0009
003	I could say the same of you, Carla. I'm glad we're on the same side. You're stronger than I thought.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
004	I think you're amazing, Balt. I could never fight like that, myself.
005	It looks like we're evenly matched at the moment! Let's have a little break and then go one more round.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
006	All right. I'm up for it.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
007	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhhh!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0032
008	What is this power?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
009	Carla, stop! You can't control it yet!
010	Ngh....!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
011	Carla?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
012	Heheh. I guess that didn't go so well. What am I gonna do?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0011
013	That power of yours is too strong. You must be careful.
014	By the gods... What was that?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
015	It's just this power I have. It's kind of "hrmph," but I know if I do it right, it'll go "bam"!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
016	But it just won't go "fwooosh" like I want it to. It just ends up going "floop."	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
017	I...didn't understand any of that, but I do know that if you keep pushing yourself you won't be able to move... Please don't make me worry about you.
018	I know, I know, but if I master this power, I can use it to help you protect the desert!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
019	I need to learn to control it. That's why I can't afford to be down—ngh! Crap, I still can't stand.
020	I understand how you feel. I still need to get stronger. I never want to experience such hopelessness ever again.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
021	I see... So you've got a lot on your shoulders too, huh? Let's go another round when I can stand up again.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
022	Carla... You're going too far. Just being able to stand doesn't mean you should keep sparring.
023	I'm sure that when you have something you want to protect, you'll be able to control that power of yours.
024	What do you mean?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
025	It's just a hunch. Now, then. I'm going to go do some shopping at the oasis near here.
026	Oh, wait, don't go yet! I'll go with you once we've gone another round.
027	You can't even stand! If I wait for you to finish, it'll be too late. I'll be fine on my own.
028	Are you certain? I've heard rumors lately that the villages near here are being raided, one after the other.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
029	Hahah. I'll be fine. It's not far.
030	Balt, take care of Carla for me while I'm gone, all right? I'll see you both later.
031	Is this oasis nearby? Will he really be all right on his own?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
032	Yeah. We usually go together, but we've never been attacked before. I'm sure he'll be fine.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
033	To be honest, I'm a little worried, too, but worrying about it won't help anything. So let's go another round...in a bit.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
034	All right.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
035	Tch... What's with these guys?! They wouldn't answer our questions, and now they're rebelling!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
036	This is proof that there are survivors of the Sephira here. There would be no reason for them to resist, otherwise.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
037	Enough! They've tried to cheat us, right?! That means we can crush them! Right?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0017
038	True... I was hoping that we could be discreet, but if we cannot gather information that way, we may have to change tactics.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
039	I must say, this request from Greed Dike has really piqued my interest. The survivors of the Sephira, said to possess more Alchemia than ordinary humans...
040	If we can capture them, we may find ourselves one step closer to achieving the manifestation of Veda.
041	We may also find something related to the great tree, Sephiron. I'm sure Sol will be pleased.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
042	All right! Let's get rid of this scum and head back victorious, gifts in hand!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0009
043	Don't forget that we're here only at Greed Dike's request. However, for our own purposes, I won't deny us the chance to make a brilliant show of destroying them!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
044	That's what I like to hear! Huh...? Hey! Who's that bastard sneaking around over there?! Come here!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
045	...!
046	Where do you think you're going?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
047	Neun!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0003
048	Why did you stop me?! I could've killed him in a second!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
049	Please try making use of that space between your ears every now and again. We have already destroyed most of the villages in this region. We need a new source of information, see?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
050	Hmph. So we'll use him as bait?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0044
051	Let's follow him. I'm sure he will lead us to another village.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
052	All right, but now that I'm all worked up, I'd better get to have some fun soon!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0045
053	We will find the survivors of the Sephira...so let us make quick work of these insubordinate fools!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
054	Haa...haa... Did they say Greed Dike?! W-with a whole country behind this...I have no hope of doing anything on my own!
055	Think, Hawk! At this rate, the desert will be...! I have to do something!
056	...!
057	What're you rushing around for, Hawk? Is something wrong?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
058	We have to leave. Now.
059	Wha—?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
060	Did something happen?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
061	I saw the people who are going around destroying villages. They'll be coming here next.
062	I see... So those weren't just rumors, huh? I'm sorry, Hawk, but I can't just run away.	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
063	I have to protect the peace of the desert. If I run away now, that's just, you know...negligent.
064	These aren't people you want to fight! I saw them. They destroyed the oasis in an instant!
065	Greed Dike is involved in this somehow, too. I heard them talking about it. There's nothing we can do about something on that scale, not by ourselves.
066	You hear me? We can't do anything!
067	What difference does it make if an entire country's behind this?! With my power, there's no way I'll lose to them so easily! Where are they now?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
068	......
069	Hawk, tell me! The desert is in danger, right?	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
070	They were west of the oasis. We should still have some time, but they'll be here soon.
071	West. Got it!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
072	Hawk?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
073	Balt... Take care of Carla.
074	Hawk...!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0026
075	Ankh! Haa...haa...
076	Hawk?! What's the rush? Is something wrong? It's rare for you to have business with me.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0027
077	There's no time. I'm only going to say it once, so listen carefully. You're the only one I can trust!
078	There are people targeting the survivors of the Sephira, going around from village to village and oasis to oasis, destroying them! If they aren't stopped, soon the entire desert will fall!
079	I want you to reach out to all the merchant guilds. They must come together for the sake of the desert!
080	So please, hurry! These people are incredibly strong!
081	I'm not sure that I can get them together so quickly, Hawk.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0020
082	We won't stand a chance unless every fighter in the desert faces them together! You must gather everyone who can fight! I'm counting on you!
083	Wait! Hawk, what are you going to do?	VO_ankh.ankh_battle_0019
084	I'm going to the court. I'm going to ask them for reinforcements.
085	What?! That's ridiculous! You've renounced your claim to nobility! The court will never accept such a request from you!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0027
086	Each community protects itself. That's the unspoken rule of the desert!
087	The notion of everyone protecting the desert together would never even occur to them. I'm not sure they'd even take a moment to consider it! It's much more likely that they would simply ignore you!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0042
088	You'll never know unless you try! I know that deep down inside the people of this desert are hoping for a peaceful home!
089	That's why I've been trying to restore the desert. I believe that my work is the beginning of a movement toward that future!
090	So I have to do everything I can! The desert will never change unless there is someone willing to take that first step!
091	B-but...!
092	You fool! How dare you set foot in this court after throwing away your status as a member of the nobility?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
093	Our verdict is unchanged. If we offer up the remnants of the Sephira, then this will all be resolved. I see no problem.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
094	I've told you over and over, that's only a temporary solution! If we keep relying on such measures, the desert will be destroyed!
095	Enough! How dare you come here and criticize our way of doing things after forsaking us?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
096	You should be ashamed of yourself for being so fickle!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
097	Please, wait! Hawk, are you telling the truth?	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
098	Of course. That's why I swallowed my pride and came back here. Please... You have to help us! This isn't about nobility or guilds!
099	It's bigger than all of that! Everyone in the desert is in danger! That's why you must—
100	I will say only this. When we feel that we are in danger, we will offer up the remnants of the Sephira as we have been asked. That is all!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
101	What do you intend to do, Hawk?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
102	I'm going to do everything I can to protect the desert. That has not changed, and will not.
103	Even if it's just those who support you, Nefertiti, you must have them come to our aid! I'm counting on you!
104	......
105	Carla!
106	There was no sign of anyone in the west, so we turned back halfway. Hawk, you lied to us!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
107	Haaa...haaa... Where are those troublemakers?! Hey, you! Have you seen anything?	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
108	M-me? I'm not sure. Have there been any troublemakers, Lucian?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
109	No. We've passed through several oases and villages on our way here, but we haven't seen or heard of anyone like that.	VO_rusia.rusia_chara_1002
110	Are you sure someone isn't playing a trick on you?	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0031
111	No, that can't... Wait, don't tell me you...!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0021
112	Why would you lie?! Aren't you the one who wanted to protect the desert?!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
113	It was for that express purpose that I lied.
114	You told me to figure out what it means to protect the desert on my own, right? Well, I have my answer! I'm going to fight, too.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0013
115	So where are they?!
116	I told you, these aren't people you want to fight! You don't have a chance!
117	If they're that strong, then that's all the more reason that I should fight! With Balt there to help me, I won't lose so easily!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
118	You need to run!
119	What are you saying? This is where you planted the seeds for the crops you care about so much.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
120	We need to protect them, don't we? Or are you such a coward that you'll let them go so easily?
121	Crops can be planted again, but a human's life is not so easily replaced.
122	I don't care what you say about me. All that's important to me is that you survive!
123	I thought you wanted to protect the desert. Or was that a lie, too?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0021
124	Carla, please.
125	I can't believe it. I looked up to you, but it turns out you're nothing but a coward!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
126	...!
127	What?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
128	Hahah... That's right. I am a coward. Run away so you live to fight another day. It's a smart way to live.
129	So long as you're alive, things will be all right. That's why, even if you stay, Carla, I'm leaving. I don't care if I'm the only one running away!
130	Hawk?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
131	Are you serious?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
132	I am. I have absolutely no intention of losing my life because of your stubbornness!
133	Hawk! F-fine! I don't care where you go! Just leave already!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0022
134	Haha... I will.
135	Hawk!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
136	Leave him! Who cares what happens to a spineless guy like him?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
137	But...!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
138	I...believed in him. I...really...liked him. So why...? Why?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
139	Wait here. I'll be back!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
