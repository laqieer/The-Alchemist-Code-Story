001	Why were they so mad? Chasing me all over the place like that...
002	Now I don't even know where I am.
003	Oh, another room... *cough* With the same smoky smell. This definitely isn't incense...
004	...So I said not to worry. I'll have enough of them rounded up by the end of the week.
005	Heheheh. Children are ten a penny in the slums. Give them some food or toys and they'll all come running.
006	And if they don't do what I say, well... Who cares what happens to a bunch of orphans?
007	(They're kidnapping orphans?!)
008	(Are they the same group as the raiders at the village?)
009	Boss, there's someone here!
010	Hey, it's a kid!
011	Nosy little pipsqueak, huh?
012	Eh, no matter. Catch him and throw him in with all the rest.
013	Yes, Boss!
