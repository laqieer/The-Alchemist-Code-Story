001	You want us to deal with the Fallen?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
002	Yes. After seeing what you all are capable of, I'd like to ask you to lend us your power.
003	If the Fallen keep multiplying like this, the villagers will be forced to evacuate in the near future.
004	You must have noticed already, but the villagers and the people of the city live completely different lifestyles.
005	The people here work hard, day in and day out, living in fear of the earthquakes.
006	I don't want these people to suffer more than they already do.
007	Hmm...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
008	I think we should help!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
009	If there's something we can do that will help all these people, shouldn't we do it?
010	I agree. The teachings of the Sephira say that our powers exist to rid the world of corruption.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
011	It may be as you say, but this complicates things. Those who fight here cannot also search for Icona.
012	The people of the village are capable miners. They'll be able to help you with that in your stead.
013	Truthfully, they'll probably be more effective at finding the scouting team than a search party made up of people with no sense of the area would be.
014	That certainly makes sense.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0045
015	I'm fine with that. Even with a map, knowing the area makes a huge difference.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
016	This village... It might be where we were born. To lose it would be a tragedy.
017	I understand. We'll do what we can to help.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0037
018	Thanks!
019	The Fallen are in the tunnel up ahead. Looks like they're nesting where the locals say the Stones of the Gods are.
020	It's possible that the inspection team left some signs of where they were heading. It's worth a look.
021	I see. Lead the way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
022	This is the mine of the Stones of the Gods...
023	There's so much magil I can barely breathe... It almost reminds me of the arboreal altar.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
024	Really? I don't feel anything.
025	Me neither. I guess us people of Acedia aren't sensitive to magil.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
026	Ambrosia said the same thing, didn't she? Something about how you have no talent for it?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
027	Don't remind me!
028	There are so many Fallen... Yet none of them are reacting to our presence. Is that...normal?
029	Good question... As far as I know, Fallen attack every living thing before them, but...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
030	Well, there's no point sitting here wondering. Let us purify them before they make it out of the mines and attack someone!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
