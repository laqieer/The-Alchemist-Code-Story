001	Zweite Squall!	VO_melty.melty_battle_0004
002	...
003	You okay, Melty?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
004	Y-yes, everything's fine!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0039
005	I can't help but feel worthless and weak since I'm always being protected by you all... I wish that I could stand next to you and fight for myself.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
006	That's not true. You fight just fine with your magic abilities.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
007	Sure, but that's not the point!
008	As someone with royal standing, I should be the one protecting everyone, but instead...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
009	You're all fighting for me right now...
010	Melty...
011	I'm not sure why you're freaking out about this. People at the top of the food chain have their own ways of fighting.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
012	You should think more about that if you're really a princess.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
013	My own way of fighting...
014	...
015	What's wrong, Naofumi? Something bothering you?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
016	Yeah...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
017	It feels like they're getting more restless the further we head down the road... I wonder if something is upsetting them.
018	The reason for their disturbance may be just ahead.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0006
019	You're right... It looks like these monsters are running more rampant than the ones we've already seen.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
020	I wonder if it's because the wave's coming soon...
021	Yes... The monsters here have sensed the presence of the monsters from the other world—your world. That must be agitating them.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
022	Monsters are getting more agitated the closer we get to the village... And Balloons are heading straight for it...
023	Could it be that the Wave will occur...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0031
024	...
025	Naofumi! There you are.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
026	Melty.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
027	It hasn't been too long since Raphtalia and Filo left this village. We need to catch up with them now!
028	No... We need to stop looking for them for now...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
029	What? Why?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
030	We both need to stay here and prepare to take on the Wave.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
031	...
032	H-hold on, what are you talking about?!
033	I'm sure those two want to see you again as soon as possible, so...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
034	It's not like we'll never go looking for them. I simply said to stop for now.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0001
035	But why do we need to stop?! Explain yourself!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0026
036	You're the one who said we can't take the Wave on without them! So why are you changing your mind now?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0018
037	...We're out of time, aren't we?	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
038	What are you talking about?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
039	The time frame you gave us for the next Wave is drawing closer. Have we figured out where it'll occur yet?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
040	I think we have.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
041	How did you figure that out?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
042	The Balloons are heading for the village, but they're not the most intelligent of creatures.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0006
043	Whatever's attracting them here must be speaking to their instincts... They must be sensing something connected to our world.
044	Waves are the rifts of different dimensions from which monsters pour out of. The calamity of our world... The Balloons sense it.
045	In the same way, monsters of this world who are sensitive to that presence must get more agitated as they get closer to it... Just like the monsters who are getting closer to this village are.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
046	In other words, the Wave will be occurring in this village.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
047	What?!
048	We're too late—the wave's coming any minute now. We won't be able to evacuate the villagers in time if we go looking for those two now.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_battle_0019
049	What are your friends supposed to do in the meantime, then?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
050	The Heroes must suppress the Waves, meaning they'll always find their way towards them. They'll figure out where I am once it starts.
051	Raphtalia and Filo will come here eventually once the Wave occurs.
052	You sure have a lot of faith in them.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
053	I guess you could say that...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
054	(That's why he wasn't in a rush to find them... I can't believe I jumped to conclusions like that...)
055	...
056	Um, Naofumi, I'm...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
057	S-someone, please help! Monsters are in the village!
058	What?!
059	Th-there's so many of them! And everyone is freaking out!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
060	I don't blame 'em. It's no fun having someone barge into your home like this.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
061	We're not gonna let 'em get away with it, though.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
062	Here they come!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0020
