001	Hey, why did you become a Paladin?
002	Because I wanted to save the world, of course. I assume everyone here has the same wish. You feel the same, right?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
003	Yeah. I also love being in this gathering of goody two-shoes so much I can't stop smiling.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
004	What's that supposed to mean?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
005	I'm complimenting you. Just accept it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0006
006	Believing in an ideal and sticking with it is a gift.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
007	Huh?
008	(I'm jealous that they wholeheartedly think they wanna save people.)	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
009	(Everyone here says the same thing. Their eyes are shining with it.)
010	Well, I guess these are the kind of things newbie Paladins talk about.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
011	Is that guy's hair pink? We've got some flashy haired people around here...
012	Oh, that's Magnus. He's amazing. I heard they poached him from the Wratharis army.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
013	I'm sure he gave up his position in the army in order to become a Paladin and protect the world, too.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
014	Huh. ...Huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
015	He just...yawned.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
016	You're so impressive! You used to be in the Wratharis army, right? I heard you were headhunted directly!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
017	It's not that impressive.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
018	No, I think it's interesting, too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
019	What's with you? You came out of nowhere. It really isn't interesting.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
020	No, there's something interesting about it, all right. You going out of your way to join Holy Order is really something.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
021	You should make more fuss about that. You should be bragging that you're a Alchemy genius.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
022	...
023	Although, I guess being a genius isn't rare here, what with the Holy Guard drawing in geniuses from all over the world.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
024	You'd get a better salary ascending the ranks in the army, though, right? So why'd you join the Holy Guard?
025	...
026	Come ooon, tell me.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
027	What's with you? Are you trying to start a fight?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
028	No way. I'm just having fun. I like talking to people.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
029	Come on, you can relax around me. You have to have fun in the present; no one knows what the future might hold.
030	I promise that talking to me won't be as boring as talking to the goody-goodies, at least.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
031	!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
032	You're kind of a pain, aren't you?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
033	People tell me that all the time.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
034	...
035	Fine. Let's make a bet, then.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
036	If you draw this ace of hearts, I'll be buddy buddy with you. Simple, right?
037	Gambling, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
038	You're not good at gambling?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
039	It's not that; I just don't like it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
040	...
041	But I kind of like that you've got the guts to cheat so brazenly.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
042	Well well well, I'm surprised.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0046
043	You're the first to see through my sleight of hand. Didn't think you'd stay sharp-eyed even over something so inconsequential.
044	Hahaha! I like you! You're really not a boring goody two-shoes, just like I thought.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
045	Seems like things are going to get a little more interesting around here.
046	Oi, you over there! What are you flapping your gums over?!
047	Oh crap!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
048	Lounging around right before the first day of training...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
049	I came here to be your instructor and I won't tolerate such behavior.
050	Oi, you two! Come talk to me after training!
051	Damn, he's going to be keeping an eye on us from now. I meant to lay low in the beginning.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0016
052	My condolences.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
053	He's going to be watching you, too, you know?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
054	But this makes things more interesting, no?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
055	You're a troublemaker, I see.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
056	People tell me that all the time, too.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
057	Shall we stir up some trouble, then?
058	Hey now...	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
059	I'm just joking. Let's work up a sweat, shall we?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
