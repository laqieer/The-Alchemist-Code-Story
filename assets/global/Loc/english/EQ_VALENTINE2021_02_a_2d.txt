001	You know, I do get where you're both coming from—I really do!—but even if you learn something from this inadvisable jaunt, wouldn't opening up sales for Rainbow Cacao to the public be...extremely difficult?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
002	I mean, people are getting seriously ill just from eating chocolate made with the stuff. It's going to take a lot more than positive thinking to get the laws overturned.
003	Hmm. You do have a point. But as I was saying before, I really don't think Rainbow Cacao is all that bad overall. There's so much more to be gained from it than the court would have you believe.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
004	Such as?
005	Well, each of the cacaos has a disparate effect. Red enhances passion, blue calms, yellow makes one more honest, green grants courage, orange makes one friendlier, purple has a charming effect, and brown is...just tasty!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
006	None of those things is inherently bad; it's just that their effects are really powerful, so if they're not used properly or carefully, they can be hazardous. But that's true of many things.
007	Granted, Purple Cacao's ability to attract monsters doesn't do much to further my case...and, technically it is rather poisonous...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0011
008	But still! Purple does not represent the lot, and I believe the other cacaos are very much safe for general consumption if properly prepared!
009	Come to think of it, I guess Noah and Emma did say that eating some Green Cacao gave them the courage to make up with each other after their big fight...
010	So I guess you're right. There are potential benefits to be had.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
011	There you have it! And from the sounds of it, there are lots of people who are practically frothing at the mouth to get their hands on some.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
012	Even literally frothing at the mouth, perhaps, having acquired their cacao from the black market with no idea how to use it. Which is why I—
013	...
014	Aah!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0042
015	...
016	Excuse you? Are you not even going to apologize for running into Lizzy? That's bad manners, you know!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0012
017	Wait, Margaret. Something's not right.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
018	Urgh...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
019	?!
020	Are... Are you okay?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
021	I-I'm...fine. Leave me...alone.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0012
022	You are most certainly not! You're pale as a sheet, drenched in cold sweat, and your breathing's all over the place!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
023	We can't just leave her like this. It's probably best if we take her to a doctor.	VO_charis.charis_battle_0019
024	No...please. I don't want...to go to...a hospital. I'm fine...so just... Uuuoogh...
025	I don't think you're in any position to decline medical attention, little lady!
026	No worries. I can look her over right here.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0037
027	Hmm... You're showing symptoms of poisoning. What have you eaten recently? I can smell something sweet on you. Do you still have it?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
028	Sweet? Oh, you're right! It smells like chocolate, in fact. Which I'm guessing means...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
029	Just as I thought! This is chocolate made from Rainbow Cacao, without a doubt.
030	Aha. Well, that would certainly do it.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0045
031	Poisoned by chocolate! To think so many would fall victim to such a thing.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0045
032	Rainbow Cacao is a mystifying substance indeed, to cause such severe reactions.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
033	Little girl, I'd like to check the inside of your mouth, now. Open up and say "ahh," please.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
034	Hmm, okay. Well, the good news is, you're going to be just fine! I happen to have some medicine on hand that should fix you right up. Let's see... Ah, here it is.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0044
035	You're going to feel a little pin-prick, but do bear with it! It'll be over before you know it. Hehehe!
036	Huh. So she actually can treat people.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0010
037	Of course! Lizzy's incredible. Like I said before, she's the one who cured my illness. I wouldn't be here today were it not for her.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
038	Hey! It's going to be all right. I will find the cure!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
039	She was like a goddess to me then, coming down from on high to save me... And she still is, even now!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
040	A goddess, huh?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0011
041	Oh, excellent! That one worked nice and fast. Next, I've got some medicine for you to drink. It's a little bitter, but it should finish the job. Open your mouth once more, please.
042	Any change? That should've taken effect right away as well. No? How very odd. I was sure it would! Let's try this one next, then.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
043	I don't know about you, but it looks to me like she's just having fun experimenting on that poor girl.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
044	Of course she's not! Pr-probably...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0029
045	No, wait, I can stand by that! She's not. I think she's just gotten a tiny bit excited because she's never encountered these sorts of symptoms before.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
046	Lizzy's the type of person who takes any and every illness seriously and tries her very best to cure them all. There's no way she'd ever derive pleasure from someone else's suffering.
047	All right, here comes the next one! This one goes up your nose, so try not to sneeze it out, okay?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0032
048	Uoorgh...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
049	Just a tiny bit excited, you say?
050	...
051	Well, thank goodness her symptoms have subsided, if nothing else. We should ask her how she came to be in possession of that chocolate once she wakes up.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
052	I can't believe the effects of Rainbow Cacao are so severe. If she hadn't literally run into us, things could've gone very badly for her.
053	Yeah. She could easily have lost her life. We'll have to find ways to counteract those effects before we even consider trying to put it out on the market.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
054	Hey. I analyzed the chocolate the girl had with her. I can hardly believe how fascinating Rainbow Cacao actually is!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
055	Consider my interest in it well and truly piqued now. I feel like I could definitely make good medicine with it, and I'd love to run some experiments if the possibility should present itself.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
056	How can you even think of medicine-making and experimenting after someone was just suffering so much right before your eyes?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
057	Hmm? What do you mean? She's stable now, so there's no further need for concern, is there?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
058	I-I wouldn't go that far...	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
059	She hasn't woken up yet, so I think it's a little too soon to...say things like that.
060	What? Did I say something wrong?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
061	...
062	Aaah! Someone, help!
063	Quickly, everyone! Let's go!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0021
064	What?! Why are there monsters here? And they're headed our way, no less!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
065	Oh, could it be because of the chocolate? When I analyzed it, I found high amounts of Purple Cacao.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
066	I'd say that's a safe bet, then! There's even more of them now. They just keep coming!
067	Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0003
