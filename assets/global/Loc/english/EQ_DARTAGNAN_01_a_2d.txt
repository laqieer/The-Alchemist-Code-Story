001	Wow! Wow! Wow! There are normal people and machine people...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0024
002	Something is moving somewhere all the time. This city...
003	So this is Slothstein!
004	Yes.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
005	In recent years, development has been rapid, making this country's magic and technology the most cutting edge.
006	A country of metal and machines, it is unlike our country of Envylia. However, its essence remains the same.
007	Ack... Captain, you always speak in such a difficult way.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
008	Hahah. Sorry. However, I want you to know many things, D'Artagnan.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
009	You have chosen to live as one of Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard while carrying the savage blood of Saga.
010	That again? My homeland is Envylia.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
011	Well, come now! The world is a large place. There are many countries! Anyway, this country is one of the stranger ones amongst them all. What do you think?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0011
012	It's completely different from Envylia, but, maybe because of that, it's really fun! I like how it never sleeps!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
013	I like it! I think I might be able to fall in love with this country!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
014	I see, I see. Well, then perhaps in the future, you will serve as the bridge between the two countries.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
015	Heheh...Captain...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0050
016	Please, wake up! Vice-Captain!	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0023
017	Huh?! What's going on?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
018	Like I said, if you sleep here, you'll catch a cold! Furthermore, my dignity...!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0012
019	Yawn... Morning...morning? Good evening?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1002
020	Yes, yes, it's long past noon. In fact, I thought you were on vacation for a while starting from today, Vice-Captain.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0030
021	Huh...I'm Vice-Captain? Me?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
022	Ah, come on...she's still half asleep...
023	Mmm...I'm okay! My eyes are open! I'm awake!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1005
024	By the way, where's the Captain?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
025	The Captain is making adjustments to the alliance between Northern Pride and Slothstein.
026	So I'm on vacation from now... Wait, will our knights be all right without me?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0045
027	Hahah! Actually, with you and the captain out of the way, we'll be able to get much more office work done.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
028	Oh, really? That's great news!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
029	Wait, were you just totally disrespecting me right now?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
030	You always make snap judgments without carefully thinking things through!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0012
031	Did you know that you've been called the 'fastest and least contemplative knight in all of history'? You should think things through a little more.
032	Huh? But it's cool being me.
033	Anyway. It's your vacation, so just spend your time lounging around your room.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0030
034	Actually, that sounds pretty great...no, no, wait! I'm supposed to be going back to Slothstein!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
035	Again? Next time you go abroad, a little more of an advance notice would be great!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0025
036	If I did that, someone would try to tag along.
037	Of course! Recently, there's been a lot of suspicious activity in Gluttony.
038	It's an allied country, but I can't afford to let you go alone.
039	But I wanna travel alone!
040	V-Vice-Captain?! We're still talking—	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0021
041	Get off my back!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0028
042	Sigh. They're all good people in the Guard, but sometimes they're way too over-protective.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
043	All right, I'm gonna quickly get ready and get out of here! I wonder if Amis is doing well!
044	Wow, it's already noon! It took pretty long even at my pace.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1005
045	Was it called Slothstein railroad again? If only that spanned the entire continent, getting around would be much more convenient!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
046	Hey, D'Artagnan! You're back already?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0024
047	Hey, old man, it's been a while! Do you have any new inventions?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
048	You really should be asking someone like Amis instead of an underling like me.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
049	Hmm, I see...so where's Amis?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
050	Well, around this time, she's usually...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
051	Megistos! You've misappropriated the budget again, haven't you?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0022
052	Looks like she's right in the middle of dishing out a reprimand.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
053	Aah...
054	Listen, Amis. This is a necessary expense. The weight of our current turret is a problem. We can't load it onto our airships, so...	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0030
055	How does that excuse taking the expenses from the Power Division's budget?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
056	For starters, if it can't fly then you can't call it an airship.
057	It's because the Power Division's development is being delayed. It's got an abundant budget, but it's moving along at a snail's pace. Can't I just transfer a little of the budget to us?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
058	No! Do you know how much pains I've been taking with budget allocation for each department?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0014
059	Yeah, preach it! Stop causing problems for Amis!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
060	Listen. We're putting together an improvement plan.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
061	Unlike the Power Division, who still has no idea regarding the source of failure, ours is a much more constructive use of the budget.
062	Your excuses suck!
063	Argh! Shut up, D'Artaggy! Did you come here just to stir up problems again?!	VO_megistus.megistus_battle_0022
064	Oh! Oh! You said it again! You called me that weird name!!!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
065	First of all, you're an outsider. How did you even get in?! What's security doing?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
066	I'm not an outsider! The old security guard says I'm like his granddaughter and gives me cute little sweets!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0010
067	So you sweet-talked your way in!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_1019
068	Are you causing problems for Amis again? As someone who follows the herd, you should be ashamed of yourself.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
069	Your logic is as beast-like as ever. Listen, we're technicians. We do have rank, but it's not an aristocracy.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
070	An air...stock...sea? Is that one of those boats without sails that are always floating around in Sloth's harbor?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
071	That's a steam boat! Are you one of those...what are they called again...idiots?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0030
072	Huh?! Why did you suddenly call me an idiot?! I may not be smart, but I'm not an idiot! You're just a big cannon-carrying idiot!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
073	Just listen to how idiotic you sound!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0001
074	...Heheh.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
075	Hey, Amis! What are you laughing about?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
076	Sorry. I've never seen you get so worked up in an argument that doesn't have to do with your 'baby girl'.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0035
077	Hey there, D'Artagnan. Sorry you had to see all of that.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
078	Not at all, Amis. You're always cool in my book! Unlike a certain somebody.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_1040
079	Yeah, I get the hint.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
080	So what brings you here today, D'Artagnan?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0001
081	Um, sightseeing? I thought you might be inventing something cool again.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
082	Seriously, what kind of tourist waltzes their way into the Slothstein's Central Technology Bureau?	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1006
083	Also...oh yeah!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
084	There was something that caught my interest during the joint military practice between our knights and Slothstein.
085	Would you like to talk about it over tea?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0045
086	I was just thinking of taking a break.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
087	Yeah! Sounds great!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0024
088	Megistos, would you like to join us? We still have to talk about the budget.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0001
089	No thank you. I prefer to cover myself in grease than attend fancy tea parties.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1006
090	Amis is going out of her way to invite you! You're never gonna get a girlfriend with that attitude.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
091	Unfortunately, I've poured all my love into my baby girls.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
092	Jeez. That sounds wrong on so many levels...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0029
093	That sound! Is something exploding?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0027
094	Hm? Hey, what's the matter?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
095	Aghh?! Ack.. Someone, help! A prototype Guard Droid has gone rogue!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
096	What?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0027
097	Gone rogue?! But we've got the maintenance man coming in every week without fail!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_1019
098	Let's think of the reasons later! Right now, let's focus on rescuing the injured, Amis.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0014
099	Ye-yes! You're right!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0025
100	Megistos, can you evacuate the people that are all right and, if you have time, use artillery to hold it back.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0002
101	A-ah all right...I don't mind, but what are you gonna do?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0004
102	I'm going to go stop the rogue machine.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
103	Huh? On your own?! Isn't that a little risky?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
104	Don't worry. I'll be fine. Besides...the Scarlet Flame Guard will never stand by and allow innocent people to get hurt!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_1040
