001	Beautiful, isn't it?
002	Truly a marvel! A masterpiece so brilliant even I could not fully comprehend its abilities!
003	Uh huh, fascinating... Truly.
004	When we first discovered Atropos within these ruins, it was of such advanced decay that we were unable to discern its functions.
005	We decided that a rudimentary extraction of its functions in a surrogate container would be the safest choice.
006	A prototype replica, if you will.
007	And that would be the first Atropos you unleashed upon us?
008	Indeed. And what do you think of it?
009	Grotesque. In every sense of the word, tasteless, like the man who made it.
010	What do you know of our hopes for the future?!
011	Stand down, Asuka. We cannot blame them for not seeing the bigger picture.
012	Forgive me, my Lord... I spoke out of turn.
013	There is nothing to forgive Asuka.
014	My Lord...
015	Siegfried... what of Shion? Is h...
016	Shion's fine. Just taking a time out... No one else dies today.
017	That includes the both of you.
018	Surrender yourselves. This foolish plan of yours will not bring salvation to people!
019	Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it!
020	History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.
021	The way I see it, the only real mistake is the one which we learn nothing from.
022	I refuse to stand idle and watch the world burn itself when I am fortunate enough to be born with enough power and wealth to make a difference!
023	Atropos! Activate all remaining Constructs!
024	[ ACTIVATING ALL CONSTRUCTS. ]
025	*WHIRRRRR!*
026	Just how many Constructs are there?
027	Siegfried! Roxanne, leave the Constructs to me!
028	You got it Teach!
029	I've got your back Sieg! We'll stop them this time!
030	Stay close to me Soren. I could sure use your help.
031	Atropos... Eliminate all who would stand in my way.
032	[ ELIMINATE ALL DESIGNATED HOSTILES. ]
033	My Lord... Is this truly the only way? I do not wish to...
034	It's us or them Asuka. They've made their decision.
035	If they will not stand down... then they leave me no choice!
