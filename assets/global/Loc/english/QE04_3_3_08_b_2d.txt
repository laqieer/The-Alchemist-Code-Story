001	Tehre! We're back!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0002
002	......So, you've returned. Well done. You can retire for now. I'll relay further instructions to you.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
003	Got it! Tina, Mocca, see you later!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0005
004	Tehre, as promised...we have obtained a token from Asena. Here it is.
005	Well done. You returned faster than I expected.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
006	Seeing Asena's state, we understand well what you are referring to. We were naive...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
007	If you understand then that's all that matters. Regardless of the delay, it is still not yet too late.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
008	We can restore the Wind Matter and relieve Beelzebub from Asena's care.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
009	I don't think there's any need to kill Asena.
010	We will do whatever we can to restore the Wind Matter. So, please...Tehre, reconsider your position on this matter.
011	Well then, how do you intend to restore the Wind Matter?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0031
012	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0047
013	You say you will protect the future and restore the Wind Matter. Noble words. But exactly how do you intend to go about accomplishing these tasks?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
014	We-well...we're still not sure, but we'll do it somehow!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
015	Hmph. In any case, as promised, I will attend the Sprite Trio Discourse. Now, hurry back home and tell Voda and Fuu.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
016	Please wait, Tehre! Why did you position Gluttony soldiers at that location?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
017	Why do you wish to know?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0006
018	Would it have been more convenient for you if we hadn't returned?
019	If we had engaged that number of troops head on, I doubt we would've made it back alive. Who knows what would've happened if Rega hadn't been there?
020	Yet, he was. And, as a result, you have returned alive. Shouldn't that be enough for you?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
021	I am asking you what the purpose of it all was!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
022	I am painfully aware of why you sent us to Asena.
023	However, I do not understand why you sent the Gluttony army! For the sake of Saga's future, it is crucial that we hold the Sprite Trio Discourse!
024	Yet, it almost seems as if our return was an inconvenience for you!
025	The two of you have still not mastered the power of the wind. I am sure you learned a lot from seeing Rega fight.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
026	Rega has better mastered the power. Was it not a good opportunity to become aware of this?
027	...Was it all only for that reason?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
028	Only for that reason? Wouldn't you agree that restoring the Wind Matter is a crucial task? How can you sum it up as something so insignificant?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
029	I will compliment you on having brought back the token. However, your power is still lacking.
030	The power of the wind that the two of you hold is not enough to restore the Wind Matter. I would recommend you start by facing this reality.
031	In fact, would I be wrong in assuming that, without Rega's help, you wouldn't have been able to pass the trial?
032	...!
033	Hmph. I guess I wouldn't be. Never mind. Now we must first hold the Sprite Trio Discourse. Tell Voda, Fuu...and all the people of Saga.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
034	Tell them that, in accordance with the law of Saga, we will hold the Sprite Trio Discourse. We will take Saga's future into our own hands...and witness its rebirth!
