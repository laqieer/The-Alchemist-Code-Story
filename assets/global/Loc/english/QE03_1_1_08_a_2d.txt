001	Wh-what is going on?! I feel power overflowing within me!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
002	I just gave you some of my power. You have to be strong in order to take out that monster, right?
003	You gave me your....power?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
004	I'm not exactly sure how it works, but there's one thing that I am sure of.
005	Both of us want to do something about this situation...right?
006	!!!
007	To be honest, I hated this class. The monsters are dangerous, but I didn't want to hurt them.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003

009	Humans and monsters can fight together, right?
010	Then...it'll make me happy as well if you can master that magic.

013	I won't thank you, you know!
014	You don't have to!
