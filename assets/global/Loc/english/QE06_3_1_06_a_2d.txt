001	Answer me! Was Greed Dike involved with the Scarlet Flame Guard incident?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
002	We were.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
003	!!!
004	If it makes you feel any better, I was unaware you would be exiled to Wadatsumi. I was thrilled when I heard of it, of course, but that was not my doing.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
005	You were involved, though. And that's all I needed to know. That makes you my enemy, and an enemy to all the others who gave their lives for nothing.
006	Don't tell me... Did you get him mixed up in all this, too?!
007	Zeke Crowley, you mean? What makes you think that?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0044
008	It only stands to reason, if your end goal is the secret art of Kagutsuchi.
009	Heh. You give me too much credit, perhaps. As I said, I never expected you to be here. That part was just a pleasant surprise.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
010	Besides...there's no point involving myself with the dead.
011	What?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
012	Zeke Crowley. He's dead.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
013	D-dead? Zeke?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
014	I suppose you'd have no way of knowing that, given how closed off Wadatsumi is. But it's true. The one known as the great sinner is dead and buried, along with his precious Envylia.
015	It...can't be... And, what do you mean, "great sinner"?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0020
016	I'm afraid it is. And you two had a child, if I recall. His name was...Logi Crowley, was it not?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
017	Logi! Don't tell me he's also...!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
018	Not quite. But now that Zeke is dead, the only two people who know the whereabouts of Kagutsuchi are you and Logi.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
019	And variables are best eliminated.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
020	......
021	You do have my condolences, for whatever that may be worth. But I'll admit, my gratitude extends further.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
022	...
023	Now, then. I think we've done just about enough talking for one day.
024	Oho? I thought for sure you'd be too despondent to parry such an attack. I'm rather impressed!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0044
025	His death... Were you a party to that as well?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
026	Perhaps. What if I told you I was? What then?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
027	You look down on everyone. You try to manipulate everything.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
028	Just how many lives have you trampled underfoot?!
029	I don't know. And I don't care to find out. All I care about is my research...and its results.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
030	And Wadatsumi, of course. All is for Wadatsumi.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
031	How is any of this for Wadatsumi?!
032	Because it's a land that barely anyone even gives a second thought to. Whether it's invaded or threatened by demons, few will even turn their heads to look.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
033	So if we can use Wadatsumi to further our agenda, isn't that a better fate than letting it be forgotten altogether?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
034	No! Not at all! That's absolute madness!
035	Where is this rage coming from? I understand your anger over what happened with Zeke...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
036	But what do you care of Wadatsumi's fate? It's not even your homeland!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0003
037	No matter how much you may care for its people, you will always be an outsider here. The affairs of this country simply are not your concern.
038	An outsider? Not my concern?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
039	I'm the First Squad Captain and Commander of the Blade Fox Corps! You certainly understand that much, don't you?!
040	I see. This is unexpected. I might even go so far as to call this a variable.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0045
041	Failures from research and experiments are all the results of unexpected variables. I do so despise variables.
042	But this being, modeled after the Discarnate Power, yet boasting regeneration and immortality alike... What shall I call it, I wonder? "Dismortant," perhaps?
043	My Dismortants should be untouchable. Unstoppable. And yet...I am forced to admit that there do exist variables which could unravel all my best-laid plans.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
044	The Kagutsuchi...
045	The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi and Treasure Blade Sumeragi, as well. Who knows what effect they'd have on a demon's body?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
046	Should you really be running your mouth like this? Aren't you worried?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
047	Certainly not. After all, as I said...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
048	Ngh!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0022
049	Variables are best eliminated.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
050	We've already entered the operational phase of the Dismortant experiment. I can't let it end in failure.
051	!!!
052	Don't worry. You're just first on the list. All others who dwell in Wadatsumi will follow suit soon enough.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
053	Wh-what?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
054	What need does this land have of humans, when Wadatsumi can thrive so much greater as a demon country populated entirely by Dismortants?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
055	...!
056	Let's put an end to this...gracefully.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
057	......
058	Struggle all you'd like, the result will be the same in the end!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
059	I think you've made one fatal mistake here.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
060	What?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
061	The Scarlet Flame Guard may have been purged and dismantled, but that doesn't mean its fire has ever truly been extinguished.
062	You think I want to protect Wadatsumi just because I'm a Blade Fox?
063	"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved."
064	?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0006
065	"There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard."
066	"Respect none who wield the sword without heart."
067	And..."Dedicate your sword...to the pursuit of...justice"!!!
068	What...is this...?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0026
069	Coming to Wadatsumi, I learned and was made aware of a great many truths.
070	Among them, that I must never hang my head in shame, no matter how many people dear to me I may lose. There's too much left for me to accomplish.
071	Too many people to protect amongst those I've met in Wadatsumi...
072	So I will not lose here this day!
073	(Logi... This is for you, too!)
074	I don't care what kinds of nefarious tricks you have up your sleeve. You will never break this iron will!
075	You must be out of your mind!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0012
076	?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0027
077	I assure you, she's not.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
078	Jubei!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
079	We'll talk later. Right now, there's work to be done.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
080	Yes, there is. I can see the fire in your eyes.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0038
081	The Scarlet Flame burns bright as ever!
