001	You did nothing wrong. You killed no one. Anyone would consider you innocent.
002	Thus you cannot help but blame those who have done wrong or aim to exterminate them the minute you see them.
003	You are pure and your enemies are vile. Therefore, anyone who stands against you is a target fit to be killed.
004	But then, what happens when that target's blood splashes back upon you, staining you for all time?
005	Perhaps those around you who could be considered pure might see those bloodstains and revile you.
006	"You have killed," they might say. "That is a crime deserving of death."
007	Even though you have done no wrong, only sought to eliminate those who have.
008	So you considered fighting evil some other way.
009	You take a break.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
010	Beds of Ice?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
011	Painless, fair, gentle, and humane... At least, it has always been considered to be.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
012	As far as punishment of the high elves go, at least.
013	What?!
014	Dark elves are forged by murdering their fellow high elves, are they not?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
015	They are transformed by the blood, Alchemia, and souls of the high elves they kill, marking their bodies with the evil deed they have done.
016	That's why high elves could not easily devise a way to execute those high elves who committed grave sins.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0022
017	The executioner would become a dark elf, you see. It wouldn't be fair.
018	Thus they adopted the Beds of Ice as the preferred method of execution.
019	It is a penalty of eternal sleep induced by Phantom Arts.
020	The bodies are stored here in this basement where the sleeping herbs grow to ensure eternal slumber.
021	So beautifully.
022	"In particular, without ********** *** *** ** ******* ****** **** *****, only the infliction of ******* ******* can allow for * ****** ***** **** *********..."
023	That inscription! It was...!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0025
024	"In particular, without committing the sin of killing fellow high elves, only the infliction of eternal slumber can allow for a nation built upon integrity."
025	"For high elves are long-lived and methods of punishment such as imprisonment and other common forms are not very effective."
026	"Without an effective deterrent to crime, the land grew ever more lawless, until the invention of the Beds of Ice."
027	But then... Why did everyone disappear?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0031
028	Are you asking me, your own pupil?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
029	Why?!
030	Have you no idea at all, having lived alongside us...?
031	What...?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
032	Those who attack with the confidence that they are doing nothing wrong, are in fact the ones in the wrong...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
033	But if they acknowledge that they have done wrong, they become painted as evil. So they fight harder in order to paint their opponents as the evil ones.
034	But that's...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_battle_0019
035	It's just as you dreamed it.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
036	...
037	When those who do not age pursue a noble existence, the longer they endure, the more they hold corruption in contempt.
038	It became clear to me that I was no different from those foolish high elves, so taken with their own egos.
121	Unable to forge bonds with others...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
039	The longer one lives, the more apparent it becomes that their own race is just as corrupted as the others. The more polished their opponent on the surface, the more clearly they see themselves reflected.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
040	Papa said that those who did wrong had to be made examples of.
041	He said that was the best way to show others that they shouldn't do the same things, that they shouldn't do wrong.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0030
042	As we grow desensitized to large stains upon our souls, we begin to focus on the small ones, growing overly sensitive to the pettiest of stains.
043	The Beds of Ice began to be used to punish ever pettier sins.
044	Luxury, pleasure, abundance, illness, lust... All these and more became considered corrupting sins.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
045	Those who strayed even slightly from the status quo were sentenced to execution.
046	As people were sentenced to execution with increasing frequency, the call came for the upper classes and royalty to be subject to the same punishment in the name of equality.
047	After all, the people love a good show.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_battle_0019
048	Apparently, such a show was the height of entertainment to high elves grown tired of tedious centuries upon centuries.
049	Extinguishing the corruption of others without hesitation started to cause them to then question their own purity, wondering if they themselves should not be executed...
050	Until the only one left was a young queen too green to know the difference between right and wrong. A triumph of better nature. A happily ever after...
051	An endless beating of innumerable wings against the walls of the palace.
052	Vermin?! They made it all the way to the palace?! Wasn't there a barrier around it made by the high elves?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
053	Papa will die soon.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
054	What?!
055	Only Papa...and myself...were left here in the village. I put Papa under the spell of Beds of Ice that was handed down to me myself.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0039
056	It was what Papa wanted after committing the sin of sending so many to the Beds of Ice. He decided he had to pay.
057	Even in his sleep, he strives for the end of his life.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_battle_0019
058	What are you saying?
059	I inflicted the sleep of death upon my own Papa. I killed him, a fellow high elf.
060	In the near future, I will become a dark elf myself.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0027
061	Not you, Your Highness!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0028
062	The unwavering barrier that has persisted eternally around this village is a product of the power of the high elves.
063	As Papa's power fades, so mine does in turn. The barrier has already crumbled. This will soon become a feeding ground for the horde of insects.
064	Wasn't the whole point of these Beds of Ice to prevent that?! To avoid killing your own race?!
065	It was. However, it would appear that we high elves do not possess the foresight or wisdom we thought we did.
066	It only became apparent when those who had carried out the Beds of Ice sentence began turning into dark elves one by one as the centuries passed.
067	They were transformed by the blood, Alchemia, and souls of the high elves sentenced to the Beds, their bodies marked with the evil deed they have done as the slumbering died in their sleep, whispering their curses as they passed.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0029
068	No matter where they might be, those who inflicted the sentence would be assaulted by the dregs of magic remaining in those seeking souls, converting them into dark elves.
069	Papa, too. His soul seeks to turn me into a dark elf.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
070	No...!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0025
071	Why did you do it?! If you knew that would be the outcome, then why...?! What do you want of me?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0021
072	I want you to rest.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0039
073	I put my all into creating a place where you could. I converted the corpses of all those bugs into visions of high elves to give you a sense of ease in this country.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
074	They were so well behaved, my citizens... Weren't they?
075	I would never cast an illusion on my old friends of this village.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0025
076	The one I spelled was you. Only you.
077	It was all an illusion. The delicious food, the decorations throughout the village and the castle, the figure of that friend of yours that you saw in your dreams...
078	Didn't you find the scent lovely?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
079	Such a powerful, large-scale illusion is no simple thing to maintain for so long...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0020
080	I achieved it by never sleeping.
081	Then...! That's why I no longer shared in your nightmares!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
082	Yes. Because I never slept. I wanted you to feel reassured that there would be no more nightmares.
083	But you wouldn't go to sleep with me, so I eventually reached my limit.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0027
084	The illusion dissipated and the blizzard blew the magical scent away...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0022
085	Even though I was so close...
086	C-close...?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_battle_0019
087	You would have slipped into sleep alongside me...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
088	Your Highness... You can't mean... You cast it on me?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
089	Yes. Before you slept last night, I cast Beds of Ice upon you.
090	All those tens of hundreds of years, I fought against dark elves and built up a resistance to magic!
091	Ah, of course. No wonder you managed to stay awake for so long. You really are something.
092	You're getting sleepy, though, aren't you? You can't shake off that sleepy feeling unless you sleep... Even if you are resistant to magic, eventually the lethargy will take hold of you...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
093	Nng...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
094	There is no way to break the hold of the Beds of Ice. Soon eternal slumber will come for you.
095	How long must I go on like this?
096	For four hundred years, I have watched over the sleep of my brethren. Won't you let me sleep?
097	Is it unfair that I wish to cast off my loneliness and go into sleep with someone by my side?
098	You...tricked me...?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
099	I only wanted for us both to be happy.
100	I pretended not to know the truth, played to the preferences of the person I like...
101	I refrained from the things I thought you'd dislike, fussed over my hair, put on make up, did my nails, practiced smiles in front of the mirror...
102	Acted naive, but dangled my true intelligence strategically to intrigue you...
103	Met your gaze in the mirror and then averted my eyes, covered my mouth shyly, touched you gently... All of this...
104	All to draw your attention, to be a reflection of what I thought you wanted.
106	Because I just happened to show up at a convenient moment? Just so you could comfortably sleep beside someone?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
107	How cold of you.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
108	I can't... I can't sleep, not yet!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_battle_0019
109	Why not? You've said time and again how tired you are.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_battle_0019
110	That was just...!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
117	That's why I worked so hard to design a perfect country that would fulfill your dreams, so that you could sleep soundly.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
111	But, Your Highness, I... I want to be with you tomorrow, and the day after, and...
112	It's hard to sleep when you're worried about something, right? I studied extremely hard, just for you...
113	I just... I just wanted a place where I wouldn't have to fight, where I could live without being exhausted. The kind of place I gave up on long ago, where I could wake up happily in the mornings...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0020
114	If I had that, it wouldn't matter if I was tricked! I thought all that mattered was that we were together!
115	Exactly. It's all right now. You don't have to live with such exhaustion anymore.
118	No, you're wrong! That's not it, Ainanna! I'm trying to say...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
119	I won't leave you alone, so please don't leave me either!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
120	Ainanna!
116	Let us go to sleep together, without waking ever again.
