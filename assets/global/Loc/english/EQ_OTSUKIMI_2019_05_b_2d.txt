001	This is it!
002	Aaaaarrghh!
003	Now, give back our silver grass!
004	This time it's actually just simple theft! You're not getting away with this!
005	Evelika... You were holding a grudge, weren't you?
006	Why would you want to steal them anyway?
007	We wanted the children of Real Heaven to have a good time... We needed this to set up our own moon-gazing...
008	We don't have any money and can barely afford a meal for them... Only the moon comes free.
009	...
010	Evelika... What do you want to do?
011	Haaa...
012	It's not fair, bringing kids into this.
013	Y-you're going to forgive us?
014	Well, it's only a plant. We can just go get some more.
015	But you have to promise you'll make sure the kids have a good time!
016	Th-thank you. Thank you!
017	Hazel, Tamamo... I'm sorry about everything tonight.
018	I think I tried to make it my responsibility to make this thing go well. I'm sorry!
019	You're fine, Evelika! You did it because you cared!
020	I think I could have explained things better early on, too.
021	You seemed so reliable, it made me feel like you'd be fine if I let you tackle this project alone. I'm sorry...
022	Sorry, Evelika...
023	Hazel...
024	Oh, hey! Look! The moon's so huge!
025	Oh, wow... It's so beautiful.
026	Hehehe! I should go get Mikoto! I bet she'll be so surprised!
027	(Odd, I didn't think it was beautiful earlier, but now...)
028	What a shame we never knew how beautiful the moon was back then.
029	Yeah... But now we get to see it.
030	Yes... Like hope, the moon will never fade away.
031	Oh, no!!!
032	Wah! Wh-what is it?! You just totally just shattered the pleasant atmosphere!
033	I remembered another very important part of moon-gazing!
034	Another important part?
035	Ahem! It is said that the thirteenth-day moon is second in beauty to only the full moon.
036	In Wadatsumi, it is believed that to celebrate only one of the two is considered a great insult to the moon, and brings bad fortune as a result.
037	So! Moon-gazings come in twos!
038	So you're saying...
039	Let's do this again next month!
040	Yay! We should get a whole party going!
041	What games and food should we prepare? Anything round, I guess?
042	Is something like that really still considered a moon-gazing? Isn't that just a party?
043	Oh! We should get a bonfire going, too!
044	So it's going to be a whole festival, it seems.
045	Sounds like fun! We can even invite the kids from Real Heaven!
046	Right?! We can have those guys from earlier help out with the food stands!
047	Are we really going to organize a whole festival?
048	Getting Real Heaven involved... I'm sure some unwanted riff-raff will show up, too!
049	Not a problem!
050	What? How can you be so sure?
051	I won't give up as long as my hope hasn't faded away!
052	Do you think that's going to be some kind of magical cure-all phrase for me? Heheheh!
053	Fine, I'll play along. You are my partner, after all.
054	The moon is so much more beautiful when I gaze upon it with you.
