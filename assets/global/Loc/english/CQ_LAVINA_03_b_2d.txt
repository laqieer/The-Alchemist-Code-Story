001	Hmmm... What a delicious, buttery smell! I can practically taste it from down here! Isn't it divine?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0024
002	Um... Wh-where are we going?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
003	Ravina, suppressing your magic uses up a lot of energy, right?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
004	R-right.	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
005	Magic requires mental energy as well as physical energy, you see. Hence, in order for you to suppress your magic, it is necessary for you to keep up your sugar levels.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
006	Really? So that's why you're always talking about sweets.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0045
007	Sweets are efficient, and so the logical choice. More importantly, they are ever so tasty. I hope they'll be ready soon—I can hardly wait!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
008	So...sugar helps you control your magic, huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
009	...
010	Ravina? What's wrong?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0005
011	M-maybe if I eat more sweets, I'll be able to make it through the afternoon without falling asleep.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
012	Well... It's something you're predisposed to in the first place, and everyone has different body rhythms. You don't need to push yourself.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
013	No!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0039
014	Wh-what do you mean, no?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
015	I do need to push myself. I want to push myself until I can control my magic with ease!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
016	If I can manage that, then I'll be able to avoid causing trouble for you and Michael.
017	I...I really don't want to cause you two any more trouble.
018	Ravina, don't lose sight of your goal.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
019	My goal?	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1011
020	Sugar should help you suppress your magic, but it's just an excuse, you know?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
021	Huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
022	The main reason I eat sweets is because they make me happy.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
023	Happy?	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
024	If all you're thinking about is controlling your magic, or other stressful things, you won't be able to appreciate them.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
025	That's disrespectful to the divine substance that is dessert!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
026	I-I'm so sorry!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0035
027	I'm just kidding!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
028	H-huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1011
029	Hey, Ravina? Did you know that it's a grave sin to eat sugary things at this time of night?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
030	R-really?!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0004
031	Well, it is terrible for the waistline. That's why I brought you with me—so that we could share the calories. I hope you don't mind.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1021
032	Huh? Why would I? I don't mind at all!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
033	Why not?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
034	Wh-why not? I love spending time with you, Lofia.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
035	Hmmm... I see.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
036	All right. From now on, I won't mind anything you do, either.
037	L-Lofia!	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
038	Here you go! Freshly baked pancakes with maple syrup for the two young ladies!
039	Wow! It looks so good!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
040	Mmmm... I haven't been here in a while, but these pancakes really are the best. Soft, warm, and fluffy, like little clouds of joy—and that maple syrup is just divine!
041	Ah...umgf... This is happiness.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
042	Y-yeah! This is...umgf...so good! Delicious!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
043	These pancakes are just so good. They're making me feel all warm and fuzzy for some reason. Hehe.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
044	(It must be because I'm here with Lofia.)	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
045	(I bet these pancakes wouldn't taste as good if she wasn't here.)
046	(I love her so much. That's why I'm feeling warm and fuzzy. I want to be with her forever!)	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
047	All right, Lofia!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
048	Hm? What is it?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0005
049	I want to get better at controlling my magic!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
050	Because I... I love you and Michael so much. I never want to leave your side!
051	But I've still got a long way to go. If I want to keep up with the two of you, I need to try harder!
052	That's the spirit! I'll lend you all the help I can, Ravina.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
053	Th-thanks.	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1006
054	Well, if you're going to be pushing yourself, you will need a lot of energy. Let's finish these pancakes while they're still nice and warm!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
055	Right!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
