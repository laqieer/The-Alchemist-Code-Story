017	Using Alchemy, we could dive into this blade's...let's call it, Memory Realm, and summon Celis once we're inside.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
018	That way, Celis could teach you her sword techniques in person!
019	Wait. Do you really think that could work?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0042
020	I hope so. We don't have any other options left.
001	But we have no idea what using Alchemy like that might do to you!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0003
002	I told you, there's no other way! Logi must learn Kagutsuchi, one way or another.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
003	...No matter the cost, huh? You do realize just how much strain this is liable to put on your body, right?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
004	And you still wanna try it?
005	...I do. For the sake of Wadatsumi. But only if Logi is also okay with it, given...his own connections that will come into play.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
006	...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
007	Receiving direct instruction from Celis will mean coming face-to-face with her... Talking to her. Are you ready for that?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
008	I thought I should ask, because...I'm not sure I would be, if I were in your place.
009	To be honest, I don't know how ready I am. But if I don't do this now, I'll never master the art of Kagutsuchi.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
010	Besides, you're proposing this at your own peril, and you're doing it to honor her wishes, aren't you? For Mother...and for Wadatsumi.
011	I'm fully prepared to learn the sacred art, of course. But what I'm not as certain of is whether or not if I'm ready to know her will...to inherit her wishes.
012	But you already saw the past, right? So you already know all about that stuff.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
013	I did. And...I understand, sure. But understanding the events is not the same as inheriting the will behind them.
021	I need to be able to experience it. To feel it. Only then will I be able to carry out those wishes, and wield this power. And only when I'm doing it will I know whether or not I'm ready for it.
022	Does that mean you're in?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
023	Yeah. Let's do this, Amane.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
024	Thank you, Logi.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0034
014	Dear Celis... I know that even in death, you still think of Wadatsumi. Believe in your wishes. Believe in your son's wishes. Let your memory guide you here...	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
025	The air! Something's happening!
026	It's just like when we dove into Mikaboshi's consciousness. Except this time, we're forcibly interfering with the object's memories through Alchemy.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
027	This stands to be a lot rougher.
028	There's a power pushing back against this unnatural intrusion against causality. It feels like it's trying to force me out.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
029	But we can't give up! No matter how much the world tries to correct itself, I will keep grinding away...
030	...until we break through!
015	I will unravel the thoughts and emotions hidden within this object.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
016	Connect with us! In the here and now!
