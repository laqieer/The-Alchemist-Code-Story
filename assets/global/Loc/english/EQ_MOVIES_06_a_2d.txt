001	Are we going to have Kasumi fight the Destrolurk?
002	That's what the rest of the Resistance who witnessed the battle last night were saying.
003	It seems that Kasumi was likely able to amplify her powers of light through the Demon, dispelling the Darkness. Still...
004	She was in a trance the entire time, and doesn't remember a thing... It doesn't even look like she knows how to control her powers at all.
005	Regardless, I think the Resistance have a point.
006	We've all but used up the Alchemia Capsules we had stored after last night's battle. We don't have any other...
007	I want to do it.
008	Kasumi...
009	Even now, I still can't believe that I have such power within me, but if there is something I can do here...
010	Edgar...
011	Let's meet with the others. We will strike the Destrolurk!
012	I'll do everything I can! What about the villagers?
013	Now that our base has been discovered, it's too risky for any of us to remain. They'll be evacuated to a safe house not far from here.
014	Oh!
015	You're really going to go beat the bad guys?
016	I am!
017	Here... We worked together to get these for you. There're some berries, and fruits... Go get those meanies, Kasumi!
018	Those Demons of Darkness don't stand a chance!
019	Th-thank you! I'll do everything I can to do you all proud.
020	Are you done with your goodbyes? We need to get going. There's no time.
021	R-right!
