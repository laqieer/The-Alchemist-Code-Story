001	Sabareta...I'll find you at all costs! I will not allow Agatha to get swept into this conflict!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
002	Diaaaas!
003	...Logi.
004	Dias, wait! Listen to me!
005	What do you think you're doing? How could you let Sabareta take Agatha so easily?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
006	No! Sabareta isn't a bad person!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
007	He was just using Wratharis's deep sorrow and channeling it into the rage to fight.
008	What he really wants is to change this sorrowful world born from Alchemy!
009	This sorrowful world...born from Alchemy?
010	Isn't that what you want to do as well, Dias?!
011	All this time, haven't you been telling me that you want to change this world?
012	If we can unite together with the same goals...I'm sure we can change this world!
013	That weak mindset is why you couldn't stop them.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
014	...Huh?
015	You couldn't stop Agatha's reckless actions! And you couldn't stop father's change of heart!
016	Dias, you're mistaken! Dad...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
017	...Wait.
018	This lot needs to be taken care of first. Tell me what you have to say after that!
