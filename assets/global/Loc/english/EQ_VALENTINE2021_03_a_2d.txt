001	Hyaaaaah!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0032
002	Phew... That's all of them.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
003	I can't believe the chocolate the girl ate was made with Purple Cacao. It's no wonder her symptoms were so bad!
004	Purple Cacao is the most potent and difficult to use of them all. And there's no known way to neutralize its poison when working with it.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
005	It's unconscionable to think that anyone would use it to make and sell chocolate! What kind of deviant would even consider something so flagrant?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0017
006	I don't know, but it sure was a waste of perfectly good Purple Cacao. At least I was able to get a truly fascinating medical exam out of it.
007	Lizzy... That girl was in a really bad state. You shouldn't talk like that.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
008	I fail to see why not. She's the one who chose to buy and eat the chocolate. I can't imagine what could've possessed her to do that.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
009	That is a good question. Her uniform identifies her as a student from the School of Magic, so she should've been well-acquainted with the cacao's many dangers.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0045
010	Well, she should be waking up soon, if Elizabeth's prognosis is anything to go by, so how about we get the story straight from the horse's mouth?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
011	Glad to see you're okay. So, how are you feeling? Can you tell me who you bought this chocolate from?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
012	...
013	I'm not trying to scare you, but you were in critical condition. If Lizzy hadn't treated you, your life could've been in serious danger.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
014	We have to find the source of that chocolate so things don't get out of hand—so more people don't get hurt.	VO_charis.charis_battle_0019
015	I know you don't want to get anyone in trouble, yourself included, but it's really important that you tell us where you bought it. Please.
016	I don't know where he is right now. He's a traveling peddler.
017	A peddler?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
018	Okay. And why, exactly, did you buy the chocolate from him?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0006
019	I got a really bad score on one of my tests recently, and it made me think maybe I'm not cut out to be a witch...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
020	Then...somebody told me there was a peddler in town who sold chocolate that can grant wishes.
021	("Somebody"?)
022	I found him, and he recommended this particular chocolate to me.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0031
023	He said that in order to become a proper witch, I needed to be both magnanimous and composed, and that Purple and Blue Cacao could help me with that.
024	But because it was black market chocolate, it had high concentrations of cacao, which meant it'd be especially effective, but also have even worse side effects.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0012
086	He said I wouldn't be able to become a proper witch without going through at least a little pain and suffering, though.
025	No wonder you didn't want anyone to help you at first. But you must know that Rainbow Cacao is contraband for a reason, right?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0044
026	Yeah. I've been taught how dangerous it is. We all have. But the peddler said that if I could withstand its effects, it'd make me stronger.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0005
027	He even told me that all the elite witches knew this and worked to get it banned from public sale so no one could become as strong as they are.
028	He was so convincing, I... I just...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
029	Fell right into his trap. What an awful man.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
030	I don't really get it, though. Why would you be so desperate to succeed as a witch that you'd be willing to eat something you knew was probably poisonous?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
031	Because there's no point in becoming a witch at all if you're not one of the elite! No one'll ever listen to you otherwise.
032	What do you mean?
033	She means that a witch is only as powerful and influential as she is successful.
034	Powerful enough to ignore all the citizens' requests for Rainbow Cacao and hold a monopoly over its distribution, for example.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0030
035	I see...	VO_charis.charis_sys_0045
036	I understand why you bought the chocolate. But I hate to tell you, eating it will not have any lasting effect on your magnanimity or composure.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
037	What? But...isn't that what Purple and Blue Cacao are supposed to do?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0025
038	It is. But the effects of Rainbow Cacao are temporary. Sure, purple will increase your charm, and blue will make you calm...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
039	But the components of the cacao aren't absorbed into the body, which means its effects won't last beyond when the material is...expunged from the system.
040	Ugh. So it was all for nothing...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0021
041	That peddler was just lying from beginning to end! What an awful man, indeed!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
042	I might embellish my wares a little to gain more interest, but I'd never outright lie about any of them. Especially if it would put my customers in danger!
043	I used to say the thing I hate most is when a merchant doesn't know the first thing about what they're selling and is too lazy to look it up...but dangerous misrepresentation is on a whole other level!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0010
044	This seems to have struck a chord with you. You're spot-on, though.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0010
045	Yes, Margaret's absolutely right. The very least he should have done is explain the actual risks and the actual effects of the cacao.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
046	Even I provide a thorough description of the side effects when I prescribe potentially dangerous medicine to my patients.
047	Granted, people don't really seem to want to take it after I do, but it's the thought that counts, right?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0011
048	...
049	That is ethically sound, if...nothing else.
050	I bet it's because of that peddler that so many people in town are getting sick.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0044
051	Still, it's strange...
052	What is?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
053	Well, despite all the chaos that chocolate's causing, the peddler is presumably still selling it, or else there wouldn't be so many new cases. It's surprisingly brazen.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
054	Oh! That's a good point.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
055	I'm going to patrol the area. If there really is still someone out there hawking chocolate, then there will most likely be other people nearby suffering its effects.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0004
056	This could be a good chance to gather some intel on his source, too. You two go on ahead without me and try to find this black market the court mages were talking about.
057	Wait, but—	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
058	Don't worry about me! I'll catch up with you soon enough.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
059	Whoa! Just like that, she's gone! She does not mess around.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
060	We should get going too, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
061	Oh, right!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
062	...
063	......
064	Margaret? What's the matter?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
065	Huh? Oh! Nothing. Nothing at all. Why do you ask?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
066	Well, usually, you'd be so much more excited and energetic. Seeing you all lost in your own head is a sure sign something's wrong, I'd say.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
067	Ahaha! I'm not lost in my own head! See? I'm just as chipper as ever! Big smiles, all around!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
068	Are you, now? If you say so. If there is something bothering you, though, please feel free to talk to me about it. And if you're just tired, I should have the perfect medicine to take care of that.
069	Hehe! Thanks! That's my Lizzy: always so thoughtful and caring!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
070	...
071	(Lizzy really is a thoughtful and caring person, and she even went out of her way to save me despite the fact that I was a total stranger to her. She really is like a goddess to me, but...)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
072	I don't know about you, but it looks to me like she's just having fun experimenting on that poor girl.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
073	...
074	(Is that the sort of attitude she had when she was saving me? I was unconscious at the time, so I really have no idea what was going through her head...)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
075	(And I love Lizzy, so I personally don't mind being her guinea pig if she needs one...)
076	(But if she's actually using strangers who are suffering as test subjects for her experiments—and enjoying it, no less!—I don't know how to feel about that.)
077	(And it can't help but raise the question: why did she save me in the first place?)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
078	(What even am I to her? Does she see me as a little sister? I'm the one who started that whole "We're sisters now" nonsense, so it might just be me who thinks of her that way.)
079	Margaret? Margaret, are you listening to me?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
080	Oh, yes! Of course I...am?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
081	What the...?! Why are we surrounded?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0020
082	I just told you. The chocolate I took from the girl is attracting all these monsters to us.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
083	You weren't listening to me at all! Margaret, what's gotten into you?!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0022
084	Aaah! I'm so sorry! I can't believe I totally tuned you out! But...this really isn't the time for that, is it?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0035
085	Grrrrraaaaarrrrrrrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
