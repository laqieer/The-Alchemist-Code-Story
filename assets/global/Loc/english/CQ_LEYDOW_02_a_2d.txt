001	Ruffians!	VO_reidow.reidow_battle_0010
002	Hahaha!	VO_reidow.reidow_battle_0011
003	Heheh... I am doing this for the greater good. Eliminating waste that would defile that which I value most in this world...
004	E-eek!
005	Hahahahaha! So you're still alive! Perfect! I still have some feelings I need to work out...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0010
006	Aaaaaaarghh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
007	Yikes!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
008	Hahaha! Foolish scum!
009	...
010	Hahaha! Hahahahahahahahahaha!	VO_reidow.reidow_battle_0011
011	Ack... I have to clean up the trash a little bit, for Reida's sake.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0043
012	I may not have much longer left to live, but at the very least I will take scum like you with me when I go!
013	That is the only thing that I can do for Reida... The only legacy that I can leave behind for her.
014	I don't want to die! I'll kill you first!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
015	Hiding, were you?! Vermin! Urgh... Ack...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0012
016	Get away from him!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0032
017	Aaaargh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0043
018	Reida?!
019	Reido, are you alright?! They didn't hurt you, did they?
020	N-no, but... What are you doing here?	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0004
021	Reido, isn't this enough?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0007
022	Wh-what?	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0025
023	It may be selfish of me to think this when your health is so poor, but...
024	I am grateful to know that you would expend what is left of your life for me, Reido.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0011
025	What is it that you need from me now? Tell me.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0005
026	I...
027	Don't be shy. Anything.
028	I just want to give you anything and everything you desire.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
029	Reida...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0016
030	Thank you. I do not need anything more today.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0033
031	Understood. Please, for my sake, would you return without me?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0004
032	Reida.
033	Yes, brother?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
034	Have you been following me this whole time?
035	...
036	I told you, Reido. I will always be at your side.
037	Now... Please, if you would.
038	So...you knew I had gone.
039	Haha. You're a force to be reckoned with, Reida. I just can't keep up!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0007
040	I have always thought that I was just a burden, but...now... What is this feeling?
041	Now! Get ‘im!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
042	How dare you interrupt this moment! I was feeling something wonderful!
043	Hmph. It looks like I hadn’t finished wiping out all of you rodents, after all. Well, luckily for you, I'm in a better mood now.
044	I'll get to killing you immediately!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0010
