001	Wh-what is that?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
002	A tower of light?! Is that the legendary Tower of Babel?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
003	That must be the legendary tower His Excellency has done all this for.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
004	Finally, the time has come.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
005	Now, my friend, descend before us!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
006	Haa... Haa...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
007	Th-this is...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
008	Glorious, isn't it? This is the legendary tower sought by the most powerful people in this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
009	Wha—?!
010	Before you stands the ancient herald of the greatest of alchemists, the true form of the Tower of Babel!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
011	Orion!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
012	You should be honored to be present at this historic moment, Lord Commander.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
013	The glow of divinity... The Alchemy Source awaits me at the end of this light.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0046
014	Don't you understand that what you're doing could destroy this world?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
015	Of course. None who are without power will be left alive.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
016	Why, you...!
017	If everything will come to an end, then so be it. I will be the founder of a new nation built on the ashes of the old.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
018	So survival of the fittest is the code you will enforce upon this world? You're no different from Sol!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
019	Sol? Hmph, I should be offended to be seen in the same light as that whelp. Still, I will concede that he and I may seem the same to those who can only comprehend the superficial process of restructuring the world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
020	From ancient times to the present, humans have evolved and their civilizations have made spectacular advances to follow suit.
021	Yet, even after such advances, humans continue to fight amongst each other. Why do you think that is?
022	Are you trying to say it's because our civilization is not grounded in the "survival of the fittest" ideal?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
023	Exactly. The sinfully proud notion that the weak must be treated as equals of the strong is what causes all of the tragedy in this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
024	There will always be strife without clear, incontestable differentiation between the weak and the strong!
025	How can you believe that?! A world where people are segregated can only cause more conflict! Isn't that obvious?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
026	You are wrong. Those with true power will lead and those without will follow. This structure, if enforced properly, will leave no room for conflict to arise.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
027	If that whelp was advocating for such a world, then he had the right idea.
028	Is that truly your ideal world?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
029	The world I dream of lies beyond anything that whelp was able to imagine.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
030	Beyond...? What do you mean?
031	I dream of a world in which we have overthrown the gods and freed ourselves of their rule.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
032	The gods?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
033	Nnrgh...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
034	You still live? You are not as weak as I expected.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
035	Huh?
036	Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
037	Ugh... Wh-why are you here?! I-I told you...n-not to follow me!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
038	I'll do as I please! Let go of Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
039	N-no... Stay back. He's...out of your league.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
040	I'm well aware of that! I met him in the palace and saw his power for myself!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
041	Does this Lord Commander have difficulty learning?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
042	Can you not see it was such foolish bravado that resulted in the death of Cadanova, the Flame Dragon King?
043	You're wrong! It was Captain Cadanova who taught me that a strong heart is the most powerful weapon one can have in times of distress!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
044	I believe he is watching over me now, and I know it was his teachings that got me through the fight against Sol!
045	Hmph. I take it your overconfidence comes from your luck in defeating that whelp.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
046	I must say, if you were having trouble with him, then you will certainly be outmatched here.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
047	What are you trying to say?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
048	Sol said you might equal his strength after getting your hands on the Alchemy Source.
049	An equal? To him? Is that what the whelp thought? Hahahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
050	What's so funny?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0012
051	The only reason you could best Captain Kudan is due to his wounds from the battle against the Templars!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
052	If we were to fight you together—!
053	I-it wouldn't make a d-difference...if I were at f-full strength.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
054	What?
055	I-I'm telling you! Leave! Th-this man is f-far beyond your level!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
056	Has he already attained Nimul's powers?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
057	N-no! We simply underestimated...the caliber of those who are fit to be called...a Vessel of Reincarnation!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
058	What?!
059	Hahaha. "The only reason"? I am in no way overconfident of my strength. If I ever felt Sol would become a threat, I would have immediately moved to subjugate him.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
060	Do you mean you've always had power surpassing that of Sol?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
061	It looks like there's still some time until the manifestation of Nimul. Since you're here, perhaps you can provide me with a little entertainment.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
