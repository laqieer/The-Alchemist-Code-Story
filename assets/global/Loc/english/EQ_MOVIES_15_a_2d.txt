001	It is time for the Cyclical Ritual. Place the sacrifice upon the altar.
002	Skwee...
003	Take this creature's Alchemia, borne by blood...unto the womb of the Sacred Stone.
004	Skreeee!
005	(Now I see...)
006	(Somehow...I was watching this... Transcending the bounds of space and time...)
007	(I wanted to help...but I thought it was just a dream.)
008	Skreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
009	You hate us, don't you? You despise people for what they did to you...and for not letting the dead rest in peace.
010	Goooooooooooooong!
011	Of course... Let's go together! Fly!
012	Kasumi?!
013	I... I'm going to do what I can!
014	Nnnghh!
015	No! Even with all her powers, Kasumi can't do this alone!
016	Let's help her!
017	Gwooooooooooooooooaaaarrrrgghhh!
018	Urgh!
019	Kasumi!
020	Thanks, Liz! Thank you... All of you!
021	I love you all. I love this world!
022	You gave me hope, and so...with the warmth it gave me...
023	I will go on!
024	Kasumi, what...?!
025	Whiiii! Whiiiiiin!
026	Through coming to this world, and meeting all of you...I feel like I was finally able to find myself.
027	Thank you, Tina, for showing me the truth, and being honest with me about how you felt.
028	Liz... Thank you for being my friend. I'm so, so glad I met you!
029	Kasumi...!
030	Edgar... I will do my best to live freely, just like you showed me.
031	And I want you to keep being yourself, even if that means showing off—but don't you dare let any girls cry!
032	Y-you idiot! You're not meant to make me cry!
033	Grrrroooooooooooooong!
034	It's time for me to give my life for the sake of this world! No... For whom this world exists!
035	For all of you, whom I love from the bottom of my heart!
036	I'm going to save you now.
037	This life... Everything has been leading up to this moment. I am going to do this for myself!
