001	How did you get here?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0003
002	You mean, because you sent your Dismortants after me so that I wouldn't make it? I'd think the answer should be quite apparent.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
003	I cut everything to ribbons.
004	What?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
005	It took more time than expected to exterminate them all, but Lady Celis was counting on me.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
006	Therefore, I knew I had to make it here, come whatever may.
007	That's the long and short of it.
008	!!!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0027
009	Cut everything to ribbons? Umm, how many were there?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
010	I stopped counting after ten.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
011	Is she for real?!
012	I'm going to say, maybe?<br>Anyway, Jubei, you say you were entrusted with a mission?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
013	I'll keep this brief.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
014	...!
015	That is the general report I was entrusted to deliver.
016	That was the Blade Fox's purpose...from the start?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
017	Celis...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
018	Tell me, then. What has become of Lady Celis?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
019	My being here is all the answer you need, is it not?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
020	You fiend!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
021	So, you cornered her and ran her down. But I would surmise you did not stay to witness her last moments, and thus her fate remains at least somewhat uncertain.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
022	What?
023	...
024	This is a matter of pure conjecture on my part, but from my observations, Judius is a man who only trusts verified results.
025	As such, his answer to my question speaks more than the words themselves would suggest, since he did not confirm but merely imply Lady Celis' demise.
026	Oh! So, you're saying that if the results aren't certain, he'll kind of dodge the question.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0045
027	That is my theory, yes. So, tell me, Judius... Am I correct?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
028	Hmph. She hasn't made it back here, and that's enough of a result for me. For all intents and purposes, it's the same as being dead.
029	Best not to undersell the strength of one's determination, lest you be caught flat-footed.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
030	Nonsense!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0012
031	There was a time I shared your outlook, you know. But a certain someone relieved me of that misconception.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0007
032	I wasn't sure how to improve my bladework, and that person told me this: swinging a sword is not merely a matter of technique or practice, but for whom you wield it—for whom you fight.
033	If you've found a person to fight for, then even should their heart turn to that of a demon, you will retain the resolve to defend them to the bitter end.
034	Even if others malign you, you will become as strong as you must for the sake of that person.
035	I learned all of this from the very person I fight for.
036	And she is the one who entrusted me to come here. So for that purpose—for Lady Celis—
037	I will crush all of your research to dust. And if my power is not enough, then I will draw power from all those who've been cut down before me, no matter how I may be perceived for it.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
038	I'm not sure I understand...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
039	My squad was captured by demons. I was on my way to save them.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
040	I wanted to let them die not as demons, but as people, even if it meant censure for breaking the corps' rules.
041	That's horrible! So your expulsion—	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
042	Rules are rules, and I broke them. Who would believe that they had turned to demons without even being bitten?
043	That was his doing too, then, wasn't it? How could you, Judius?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
044	I was merely testing practical field applications. I will accept accolades for the results, but there is no call for reproach.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
045	!!!
046	Amane. Azami. Go outside.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
047	But—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
048	I'll catch up as soon as I've finished with these demons.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0007
049	Do as you wish. I'll simply take this opportunity to study your techniques.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
050	Like everything else, I'm certain they'll be mere child's play next to the sheer power and tenacity of the Dismortants!
051	Off with you! Now!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
052	!!!
053	Let's go, Azami.
054	But—	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
055	Can you clear a safe passage?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
056	Of course!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
057	You intend to fight me and the Dismortants by yourself? That's suicide, you realize. Have you given up, then?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
058	You know nothing of the Blade Fox.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
059	Oh?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
060	Did you think we hadn't considered the possibility of our headquarters being occupied by demons?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
061	Ridiculous! You intend to bring down the entire building?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0026
062	If we don't destroy all of the Dismortants, then our actions are truly meaningless. I intend to make certain we finish what we started, and leave no stone unbroken.
063	It won't be as easy as all that, I'm afraid!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0018
064	I'll do whatever it takes to finish off every last one of these creatures. And that goes double for you, Judius!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
065	The demon called malice is running rampant over Wadatsumi, and I see its root inside you.
066	As the successor to the Black Star, I will excise that demon with my bare hands if I must!
