001	Uhh...mmm... Where am I?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
002	There was a big explosion right after I was thrust away...huh?! Where's Edgar?!
003	The door doesn't open! What happened to everyone?! Somebody, open the door!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
004	Don't worry, aye! I'll protect you, Fiona! I'm right here with you!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0007
005	Allie! You're safe!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0002
006	Aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
007	What a relief! What about Edgar and Ethan?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
008	I'm not sure. They may have gotten caught up in the explosion, aye.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0031
009	No...!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
010	The gunslinger is safe.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0010
011	Who's there?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
012	It's coming from the roof! Aye, it's right above us!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
013	Ed-Edgar is safe?! And Ethan...?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
014	The thing you saw on the train was a decoy. As far as I know, the real Ethan is still being held at the Beckrams.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
015	A decoy?! So...both of them are still alive! Um...who are you?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
016	It doesn't matter who I am.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0010
017	The train compartment is split in half! Aye, head to front!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0027
018	Come. Let's go...before the Beckrams' men swarm this place.
019	?!
