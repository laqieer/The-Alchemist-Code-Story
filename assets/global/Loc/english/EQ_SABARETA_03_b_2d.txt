001	Sabareta! We've occupied the village!
002	Of course. If we match our strength, there's no village we cannot liberate!
003	Amazing! We've hardly suffered any casualties!
004	This is the power of Alchemy! With the Philosopher's Stones, we can also wield Alchemy!
005	Yes. We'll use this power to regain the majesty of proud and honorable Wratharis!
006	This we will achieve in the not very far future!
007	Hurrah!!!
008	Where's Vanekis? Have you found General Neville's keepsake?
009	There's been no report yet. I believe Lady Vanekis is searching the General's manor.
010	Bad news, sir! Soldiers from Envylia have laid an ambush in General Neville's manor!
011	What?! No! Vanekis!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0026
012	Vanekis!
013	Sa-Sabareta..! N-no...! Don't come!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
014	Agh! You dogs! Hold on, Vanekis!
015	He-here, the sword...take it!
016	So, this is General Neville's Ice Snake. Well done, Vanekis!
017	G-go now...quickly.
018	What...?
019	You're wounded!
020	I-It's too late to save me. I'll just be a burden to you.
021	Unfortunately, as your commander, I'm the one who gets to decide that. Caesar!!!
022	Aghhhh!
023	Vanekis!
024	Th-this is pointless. What if there are casualties?
025	Regular humans won't hurt them. You know that, right?
026	I...failed you, at the very end.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
027	... ...	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0019
028	Don't worry, Vanekis. Your sacrifice will serve to increase our power.
029	So...I-I'm also going to become a Philosopher's Stone, huh?
030	You knew about it?
031	I'm an informant. Don't...underestimate me.
032	I-I'm happy...I could help you...in some way.
033	B-but, even if it were just for a moment... I wish I could've witnessed,
034	the ideal world that you will create.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
035	You will. Your soul will continue with us.
036	Is someone there?
037	Over here, Sir.
038	Vlad's at the front. Bring the black knight here without him noticing.
039	Did that informant die?
040	Yes. However, as you can see, we've obtained the sword Ice Snake.
041	General Vlad, I give this sword to you.
042	What...?
043	Please use this Philosopher's Stone to revive Neville.
044	The one most suitable to pour their humiliation, suffering, and bitter anger into the Philosopher's Stone...
045	It's you, General.
046	Very well.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0006
047	All of you, listen up! The time is ripe!
048	We Knights of the Royal Order and the Lizard Brigade will together begin our counterattack against Envylia!
049	You are the sword of proud and honorable Wratharis! Do not fear death, for we wield Alchemy!
050	Even if death finds you, your souls will remain with us!
051	Like General Caesar the Demon Flame, you will be resurrected even in death and return to tear those dogs of Envylia to pieces!
052	Hurrah!!!
053	Glory to the people of Wrath! Wratharis! Wratharis!
054	That is how it should be. An army that does not fear death...this is what I was seeking.
055	The blood you shed will turn into Philosopher's Stones.
056	It will all be used to resurrect the ancient weapon.
057	I will never stop until we achieve a life of peace!
058	Now, let's go! A new history begins today for this continent!
059	Hurrah!!!
060	Twenty years ago, our Kingdom of Wratharis was destroyed!
061	Long we've laid low, hidden in the forest, quenching our thirst with swamp water!
062	But, at long last, those days of hardship are finished!
063	With the power of our wrath, we will destroy the tyrannical, traitorous Kingdom of Envylia!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0032
064	Hurrah!!!
065	It's all gone according to plan.
066	Yes. For three years, I've continuously stored my power within the Philosopher's Stones. Finally, this day has come.
067	With three years worth of Alchemia, Neville's strength will be immeasurable when he is transmuted.
068	Reporting, Sir! Envylia's scouts appear to be heading this way!
069	General Vlad, I leave this to you.
070	Very well. Go and fulfill your purpose.
071	All right. We begin!
072	I can see Vlad clearly from here.
073	Wh-what's this? Someone's infiltrating Ford Aldrin!
074	Who are those brats?
075	That blue flame coat of arms...!
076	Arghhhh!!!
077	In-inconceivable! How can two brats like you trample on the hopes of Wratharis?!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0018
078	However, you have only stoked the flames of rebellion! Our wrath will become a fire that engulfs the continent.
079	Feel the power of wrath.
080	I summon you, hero of Wratharis...with all the life left in me. Hurrah!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0032
081	... ...
082	Burning flames of wrath...the blue flame coat of arms... It's just like that day.
083	Death to Zeke and Patrick! Destruction to Envylia!
084	So...Vlad, you've finally given up the ghost.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
085	You sacrificed your power and ultimately your life.
086	I witnessed how brilliantly you succeeded in transmuting Neville with your last act.
087	And, now, you are one of my pieces on the board.
088	Soon, I'll resurrect your soul from hell with this Philosopher's Stone.
089	Lo-Lord Sabareta, General Neville has...been defeated!
090	What...?!
091	So, House Crowley's brats have somehow managed to obtain Alchemy.
092	Hehe...hyahahah!!!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
093	The descendants of those who turned into religious dogs and hunted down Alchemists have now gained the forbidden power.
094	Again, the power of Alchemy appears to attract conflict in this world!
095	Is it glory that awaits them, or ruin?
096	The wheel of fate has begun to turn. The era of chaos begins!
097	With anger rooted in his heart, one man attempted to change the world.
098	His unwavering will brought about the utter devastation of this world.
099	The wheel of fate he set in motion, even now continues to move the destiny of many.
100	Is it dazzling glory that awaits them, or ruin steeped in despair?
101	That answer rests in the unknown future.
102	Agh...! Where am I? I'm back here again?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0028
103	Heheh... How ironic for an Alchemist to be transmuted.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
104	Well, someone went through the effort to resurrect me. Depending on their reasons, I may lend them a hand.
105	Well then...tell me about your naive dream.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
