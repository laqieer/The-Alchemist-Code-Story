001	So this is what it's like inside the ship that can cross the Barrier. It's even more impressive in person!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
002	We don't have time for that! What're we gonna do now?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
003	That Cursed Beast is starting to wake up!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
004	...
005	Nimul, I have ordered the Sephira Guard to begin preparing for battle, as you asked.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
006	But...surely...you don't really intend to fight the Cursed Beast.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
007	What?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
008	No. It's not time for that yet.
009	We are going to board the airship and pursue the fleeing Guardian Dragon.
010	What? Why? The Great Nidhogg has fled.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
011	Surely you do not intend to squander Emmel's efforts! She has bought us the time we need to seal the Cursed Beast.
012	Emmel did what was necessary to save the Sephira. At the time, that was the right thing to do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
013	But at this rate, we're not going to be able to seal Beelzebub...the Cursed Beast of the Gula Belt Region.
014	Huh? But... The avatar of that dragon, Asena, or whatever... She gave you her powers, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
015	So if we use those—
016	Matter... The crystallization of the four elemental powers of nature that slept within the Guardian Dragon.
017	Those powers serve to enhance the purification powers of Sephiron herself. It is thanks to them that we were able to seal the corruption of the Cursed Beast beneath the earth for so many years.
018	However, the Matter is incomplete. The majority of the dragon's power still sleeps within the beast itself.
019	So we have no choice but to go and retrieve the rest of it from the fallen Guardian Dragon.
020	I suppose that explains why the dragon asked you to slay it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
021	How are things going on your end, Yna?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
022	Fortunately, my forge on the village outskirts was intact...including all of the arms and armor I left behind.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
023	While the hands of the inexperienced may not be able to draw out their true worth, they should serve to supplement our efforts somewhat.
024	Adaleigh. If we start our pursuit now, whereabouts will we be when we catch up with the dragon?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
025	Huh? Oh, right. Let me see... From the looks of things, I think we can trap it before it reaches the Great Forest.
026	Your ship must be fast. I could use one myself.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0044
027	How can you be so flippant at a time like this?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0014
028	Waginau... What's got you so angry?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
029	Don't be so callous! Our reliance upon the Great Nidhogg is second only to that we lay upon Sephiron.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
030	Yet you talk of slaying it as if it were a common boar! Do you realize how our soldiers' morale is flagging? Do you think the village elders are going to support you after this?!
031	It must be done, Waginau, lest the world crumble at our feet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
032	I...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
033	Things are already in motion. The world waits for no one. It is far, far too late for us to stop now.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
034	Ngh... I suppose that this, too, is the way of the world.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
035	Then this destruction... Our destruction... Is this our fate? Are we meant to just accept it?
036	No.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
037	Nimul...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
038	Fate isn't something we are given. It's something we must all carve out with our bare hands.
039	...
040	You need to understand this, Waginau. Everything in this world is dependent upon our own personal choices.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
041	Our choices... I...see.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
042	Nimul, even when faced with a desperate situation like this, you stare resolutely forward.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
043	Yeah, I'm something of an oddity. When everyone is down, I feel like I want to start laughing and never stop.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
044	You're strong.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
045	I simply have faith that anything is possible.
046	Lord Nimul!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
047	What is it? Did something happen to Emmel?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
048	No, she's still sound asleep, my lord.
049	Tell me what happened.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
050	A large number of Fallen have appeared around the temporary shelter where the villagers are taking refuge.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
051	The guards are doing what they can to hold them back, but these Fallen are far more powerful than any we have encountered before. Perhaps the awakening of the Cursed Beast has something to do with it.
052	Alright. We need to get them to safety. Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
053	Ready when you are!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
054	Adaleigh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
055	Hold on! I'll be back in a sec. I've just gotta go mobilize the Engineer Soldiers I've got in the hanger...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
056	Yna?
057	I have been working on creating arms that can combat the corruption for some time now... This is an excellent opportunity for me to test them.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
058	Good. Let's go!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
