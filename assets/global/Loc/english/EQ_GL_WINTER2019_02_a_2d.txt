001	Watch your back!
002	Huh?!
003	Woah, thanks for the save.
004	Don't mention it. Monsters around here are pretty aggressive.
005	Hi there, my name's Blair.
006	I'm Soren. It's nice to finally meet you.
007	Oh? Have you heard of me?
008	Roxanne constantly gushes about the craftsmanship on her guns.
009	Good to hear she likes them!
010	Let's head back to my workshop, my automata are digging the snow pits and I'll come back later once they're done.
011	*grumble* How are these guns so worn down?!
012	Urgh, that Roxanne. I wish she would try gun maintenance at least once, repair materials aren't cheap for these.
013	You all must have been fighting a demon or something to get it to this state!
014	Heh, funny you would say that...
015	A-anyway, what's with the monster situation in the village?
016	It's been going on for a few days now.
017	I don't think the monsters are the ones actually at fault for the stolen and broken tools though.
018	What makes you say that?
019	Well, after examining some of the footprints I've noticed most of them are fox prints.
020	And among the monster sightings? Not a single villager mentioned anything about foxes.
021	Huh, that's interesting. I don't suppose you can build an animal trap to lure and capture these foxes?
022	That's a great idea Soren! I'll build one now.
023	Sounds good. I'll help wherever I can!
024	Minutes pass, and with the trap built, Soren and Blair head out to the woods.
025	Let's hope the noise from this toy trap will be enough to attract them.
026	Hopefully the foxes don't tear up the toy too much, I still have to return it to my kid neighbor.
027	(That toy is most definitely gone. Poor kid...)
028	Oh! There they are!
029	Wait, those aren't foxes! They're fox spirits!
030	The foxes are getting away!
031	No time for that now Blair, the monsters are coming! Prepare to fight!
