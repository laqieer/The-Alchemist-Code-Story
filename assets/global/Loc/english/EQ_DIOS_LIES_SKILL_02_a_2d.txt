001	This forest is swarming with monsters and vermin. I'm surprised you made it so far on your own.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
002	I've been here before, so I thought I'd be able to handle them all on my own.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
003	Well, I guess they don't stand much of a chance when you use your alchemy.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
004	But it must take a lot out of you to cast one of your spells. It's not like you can keep casting them one after another.
005	Um...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
006	Lisbeth, don't just stand there daydreaming. Something could take you by surprise.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
007	R-right...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
008	Well?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0045
009	Hm?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
010	Which way are we heading? You've been here before, haven't you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
011	Um...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
012	Don't tell me you don't remember.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
013	N-no, I do! It's this way! I think...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
014	You think...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
015	I came here with Alma and Rebecca last time. We were chatting the whole way, so I didn't pay much attention. We had a blast, though!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
016	That's...not what I'm worried about.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
017	We climbed the rockface using some rope, and skated on the ice... It was so much fun.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
018	That was the catalyst to us becoming good friends.
019	This forest will always hold a special place in my heart.
020	I see... Sounds like a wonderful memory. Good friends should be cherished.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
021	Yes, definitely!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
022	If we tiptoe across, we'll find ourselves at a field of Stub Rules.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
023	The ice does seem solid... You're sure it's safe?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
024	Yes, watch me!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
025	Hey! Lisbeth, be careful!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
026	Just like Rebecca showed me... Easy does it...
027	See?! I made it across! Alma! Rebecca! It's all thanks to you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1029
028	We're almost there. I'm positive that at the end of this path...is the ice mirror that reveals the one you love.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
029	...
030	(I wonder who Dias might see in the mirror?)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
031	(He did say that there's someone who is very special to him. It must...be her.)
032	(My chest...kind of...hurts.)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
033	Huh? Where are we?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
034	Hm? Dias? Where did you go? Dias?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
035	Ugh... What is that weird smell? Smells kind of sweet and tang—urgh... It reeks! I think I'm going to be ill...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
036	Lisbeth...	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0002
037	Wh-who is it?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
038	Y-Your Highness! Why are you here?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
039	Lisbeth... What do you wish to attain by giving him Asmodeus? Do you hope that he will love you in return?	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0002
040	What?! N-no, that's not it at all! I just...wanted to be of assistance to him...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
041	Even if he won't love you back?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0044
042	...!
043	Your feelings are unreciprocated. He does not love you.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0002
044	To he who desires the Sacred Stone, you are nothing but a tool to be used and discarded.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0007
045	...
046	Why do you waver, Lisbeth?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0006
047	You allow these uncertain feelings of yours to cloud your judgment. For 200 years I have protected this ancient relic, and you dare to bequeath it to an outsider?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0013
048	My... My feelings aren't uncertain! I've thought about it again and again! This is the decision I came to after considering all possible outcomes!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
049	Hahahahaha! Very well... If you are certain, then is it eternal love you seek?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0044
050	If this man does not return your affections, you will find no flower at the end of your journey, nor shall you ever even hope to escape from these woods.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0003
051	I...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
052	Such hesitation...and yet you claim yours to be true love, Lisbeth?	VO_venus.venus_battle_0007
053	She's too strong! I'm...going to die!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
054	Lisbeth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
055	Are you all right?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0050
056	Dias...? Where has...Her Highness gone?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
057	Hmm? Oh, it seems the weeds growing here have a hallucinatory effect.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
058	H-hallucinatory?! Then, none of that was real? Well, that's a relief.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
059	(The smell has faded. Has he been watching over me all this time?)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
060	(Actually...come to think of it... He's always been like this. He's helped me so many times before, too.)
061	(I want to return the favor!)
062	(There isn't even a hint of uncertainty in how I feel anymore!)
063	Lisbeth! Here it comes!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
