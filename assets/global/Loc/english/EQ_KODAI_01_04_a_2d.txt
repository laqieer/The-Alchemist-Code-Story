001	Eek!
002	Oww. Bad landing!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0042
003	I wonder where this is. Schmeier said I should go out for a while, but...
004	I don't know this place. What's this white stuff on the ground? It's not dirt.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0031
005	It's cold, and it turns to water in my hand.
006	Grrrrrr...!
007	Oh, hello! You're a...wolf, right?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0019
008	I'm Lil! Can you tell me where this—?
009	Grraaaarrgh!!!
010	Eeek?!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_battle_0022
011	"I call upon mine arcane powers—"	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_battle_0007
012	Arf?!
013	Huh?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
014	You there! What are you doing?!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0012
015	It's dangerous to be outside the boundaries of the town at this time of year! There are monsters about!
016	Oh? And who are you?
017	D-didn't you hear me?! It's dangerous out here! Ugh, just stay back!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0016
018	Grrrrrr... Grragh!!!
019	Eek!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0027
020	I'm not scared... I'm not scared! If he can do it, then so can I!
021	Why are you shivering?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
022	For the love of...! Can you please just lie low until I'm done here?!
023	Focus my magic... Prepare the incantation... All right, I can do this!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0032
