001	*Pant*	VO_yuen.yuen_battle_0001
002	Ugh…Dammit!	VO_mafia.mafia_battle_0022
003	Lord Ewan, who on earth were they?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
004	That was quite an impressive scuffle. Leave it to you to find your footing in the mines, Ewan.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
005	Mei Fang! Wait a second? Where have you been?
006	You were too busy dreaming up weapons to notice I was gone.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
007	I went to gather information about the monsters--their origin, etc. Something was bothering me.
008	Bothering you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0006
009	Remember how we said these monsters aren't originally from this area?
010	Essentially, they're forest-dwelling creatures that rarely enter human settlements. So, something seemed suspicious from the jump.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
011	At the same time, we heard a group of bandits set up their hideout in the forest--a little too coincidental, don't you think?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
012	Oh dear… Now that you mention it, yes.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
013	The bandits cut down trees and drove the monsters out every night by setting fires.
014	Fearful of fire, the monsters sought refuge in the nearest dark, damp habitat--the mine.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
015	So, these people are the reason the monsters were driven to the mine…
016	Hmm. But why would they go out of their way to make a hideout in the forest? Seems like a pain.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
017	They knew where the monsters would go and what would likely happen.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
018	Precisely. Their goal was to indirectly shut down the mine and monopolize the sale of Felicitite.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
019	They'd then sell at exorbitant rates to craftsmen. All the while mining freely by exploiting the monsters' weakness.
020	Knowing that fire repelled the monsters, the bandits were able to manipulate them with impunity.
021	Contrast that with the miners and security guards who were killed after provoking the monsters…	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
022	...Their petty greed got people needlessly killed.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
023	…It's always like this. A handful of brazenly selfish crooks cause the people at large to suffer.
024	…It's unforgiveable.
025	Ewan…	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0018
026	Sorry, Lucia. Felicitite will have to wait…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0036
027	…
028	…Hey, Ewan. Why do you have a glow about you, all of a sudden?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
029	Hm? What do you mean?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
030	Until just now, I didn't think you had any sparkle whatsoever. But now…
031	You're saying I was gloomy…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
032	It's just, you're all aglow now! As much as the bride and groom and the miners!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
033	Come on, tell me! What made you start shining like this?
034	Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not sure. It's not like I consciously changed anything.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0011
035	But, hey! If you think I'm aglow, then…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0005
036	It must be because I'm doing what I want to do--not as a soldier...but as myself.
037	…You know, like the way you do things.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
038	We're here. This is the bandits' hideout.
039	Huh? Who the hell are you?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
040	We heard we could buy Felicitite here.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
041	Oh, customers! Why didn't you say so? In that case, this is our current rate.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
042	You've got to be joking. It can’t possibly be that expensive.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0017
043	If you don't like it, find another seller. I doubt you'll have any luck, though.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
044	From the looks of it, the mine's been closed thanks to those monsters.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
045	You don't say… Then how'd you get your hands on any?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0044
046	!
047	Your greed has robbed so much from so many. And for what?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
048	I can't allow such unjust harm to go unpunished.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0013
