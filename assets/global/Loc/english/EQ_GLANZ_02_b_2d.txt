001	Here it is! So this is that Philosopher's Stone everybody's after?
002	Wait... What's this?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
003	It looks like that stone Rochelle found at the ruins...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
004	The same! Heh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
005	It's probably not exactly the same thing, but it definitely came from the same place.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
006	Damn you!
007	Don't move. Who's behind all this?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
008	Give up. You're in over your head. You can't even begin to imagine how powerful the people involved in this are. Don't you dare think you can get away with—
009	We aren't the ones who need to be worried.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0010
010	Eek! Y-you thieves!
011	Look who's talking. We have plenty of evidence of your deeds.
012	Ngh! Dammit!
013	You all right there? Are you hurt?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
014	I-I'm...fine. Uhm... Thank you.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
015	Are you sure? You're unusually...not energetic. I know things didn't exactly go as planned, but at least you can report good news to your chief.
016	No! I mean, I am happy about that, but...
017	I just wish I was stronger.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
018	Ishuna...
019	...
020	You really are honest and straightforward.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0007
021	What?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
022	There's a kind of strength in believing so much in someone else, you know.
023	Well, I do appreciate what he's done to keep the Unicorn Knights going.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
024	Right, Rochelle?
025	I guess?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
026	Okay, fine, I'm alone on this one. I'm going to report our success to Chief.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
027	If you would, please.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
028	Oh, and thanks Glanz, Rochelle! Maybe you two can train me sometime?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0033
029	...
030	Grrr... Rawr!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
031	Whoa! What's gotten into you?!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
032	Believe me or don't, but the more Izzy focuses on Chief, the less I belong.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
033	What? What are you—?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
034	Mixing white and black just makes gray. I cannot sleep when it's gray. It's dirty.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
035	But...I'm calm now.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
036	Okay. By the way, Rochelle, can I see that stone you picked up at the ruins? I want to compare it to what we found in the mansion.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
037	If Glizzy wants it, Glizzy can have it.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
038	Thank you. Hmm... They really are made the same.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0033
039	The same! Heh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
040	Wait... If we combine them... Is this...a key?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
041	He's looking for some key for the ruins. He doesn't even know what it's supposed to look like, but he wants me to find it. Outrageous, don't you think?
042	Could it be...? I suppose I could ask Freed next time I see him.
043	Calm now. Calm and...sleepy...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
044	Wait, hey! Don't curl up to sleep here!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
045	Glizzy is my pillow. It's been decided. G'night.
046	Did you really just go to sleep?! Oh, please, no...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
047	So she trusts me, huh? But if she could see these hands the way I do... I'm the exact opposite of what she thinks of me.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
