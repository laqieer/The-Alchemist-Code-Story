001	Pl-please, no more! I have a family that I care about very much, so please excuse me!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
002	Hey! Hold on!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_battle_0021
003	Seriously. I just asked him to help me a bit with my experimentation research.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
004	I wonder if it's not also the role of a soldier to help me out with my research.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
005	Oh well. I guess I'll have him help then.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
006	Oh, there you are! Hey, Decel!
007	Elizabeth...I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.	VO_desel.desel_battle_0019
008	Not to worry!  It'll finish right away. You just need to taste this delicious medicine. Okay?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
009	I refuse.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0039
010	Decel, I've used your favorite mockle seeds for the taste!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
011	It's not a matter of that.
012	If you drink it and submit a report, I'll be able to reward you from the research fees!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0041
013	No thanks.
014	If you insist, I will do anything for you, Decel.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0002
015	I won't.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0040
016	What?! Why won't you drink my medicine?! I'm asking you so much!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0017
017	Look. Just once, I caved in and drank it after you begged me.
018	The report from that day was really good! It's really different when you use someone who has medical knowledge.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
019	I was walking the fine line between life and death for a week after that. I did it for the sake of preventing other casualties, but...
020	You haven't learned anything from that time.	VO_desel.desel_sys_00030
021	Come on, this time it's gonna be all right! Okay? Okay? Pleeeeease!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0011
022	U-um... Excuse me, Lord Decel, but it's time soon.
023	Apologies. I'll go soon. I told you, didn't I? I'm busy. I've been called into combat.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0035
024	In that case, I'll give you this muscle strengthener as a bonus! Ah, I might as well add this magic enhancer too!
025	I've seen that medicine before. I heard that you gave it to a soldier, and his diarrhea wouldn't stop for a week.	VO_desel.desel_battle_0019
026	You can hardly call that a side-effect.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
027	Awww! Hey, wait!
