001	...
002	He doesn't look like he's lying...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
003	Indeed...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
004	Still, it's strange. His true loyalties should be with those knights we are facing, and yet...
005	If he speaks the truth, it means he deserted his army, or even—	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
006	He must have his own reasons, fellow countrymen or not. We all have our own goals.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
007	I mean... Maybe... But...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
008	(I feel like there's sorrow in those eyes... Am I just imagining it?)
009	Andechs? The honorable knight that reports directly to King Arius?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
010	Why would you point your sword at us?! You joined the pacifist faction or something? Running from war is a coward's move!
011	What do you think you're doing?! Protecting the scum of the Invidia Belt? Swinging your blade at your compatriots?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
012	Do you bear no loyalty to your own kingdom?!
013	Haaah... I had far too much time to think about those things on my journey over.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
014	Are my actions truly just? Aren't I just dragging my pride and convictions through the mud?	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
015	That said...
016	Seeing you all fighting here somehow cleared my head. Finally, I thought, I don't have to keep hesitating! I know what's the right thing to do, if you catch my drift.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
017	You can't be serious—!
018	Though you are knights as I am, to me you may as well be strangers! Don't involve civilians in your war!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
019	Agh—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
020	Trampling another's peace for your own glory and victory... When did the Ira Belt Knights start walking down the wrong path?
021	Wait, you're an Ira Belt Knight?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
022	Hey now, no need to put your guard up. Didn't I just fight at your side?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
023	Let's leave the questions and incredulities for later, shall we? Keep your eye on what's happening right in front of you. We're trying to prevent a tragedy over here!
024	Ah... You're right. Understood.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
025	Wow, that was easier than I thought. Well, that's fine, as long as you don't give in that easily to everyone, little lady.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
026	That's because humans show their most genuine side when surprised.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
027	Happy I gave a hand to a bunch of good folk then.
028	Gnh! We've already achieved the most important thing! Let's fall back!
029	Huh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
030	...They just left? What a safe and uninteresting move. Who is leading these knights?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0022
031	Looks like the situation has settled down a little... So you better start telling us what your deal is. You look just like these Ira Belt fellows.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
032	Ah... Well, it's a bit of a long story, but...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
033	Emmel! Are you all right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
034	Nimul!	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
035	Let's clear up all the loose ends first. Then we can gather everyone and I'll tell you my story.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
