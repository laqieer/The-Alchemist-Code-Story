001	That light...it's similar to the one I saw when I wandered into this place. I'm off.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0025
002	Noct, what should we do?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1001
003	There's no point in staying here.
004	It appears we have no choice but to follow after her.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0045
005	Let's do it.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
006	Dude, I guess this is goodbye.	VO_prompt.prompt_chara_1010
007	It appears so.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
008	It was fun while it lasted!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0033
009	Fun? What part of this was "fun"?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0014
010	Um, all of it? Right, gotta snap a photo!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1031
011	... ...
012	Try occasionally reminding yourself that you're not alone, Mr. Knight.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0007
013	Next time, I'll prepare you some of our local cuisines.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0024
014	See ya!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0008
015	...Try and get along with your dad.
016	... ...
017	...What's the matter?
018	Prince...can I ask you one thing?
019	Hm?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
020	What did you mean when you said that I hadn't betrayed my father?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
021	...Your old man was the one who taught you your beliefs, right? All you've done is chose a different method and path from him.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0011
022	That doesn't mean you betrayed him.
023	...!
024	(That's right. Let them call me Blood Wolf as well. I am Zeke's son. I will stay true to his beliefs.)
025	(I might as well shoulder father's title as a traitor.)
026	The light is vanishing.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0015
027	Let's get on with it.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0002
028	Catch ya later!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0008
029	Goodbye.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0007
030	Prince...!
031	...Hm?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
032	Thank you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0033
033	I didn't do anything. The decision was all yours. See you around.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0023
034	(Father...I will follow the path I believe in...just as you once did.)
035	(I spent a brief time with them, but I enjoyed it. It was almost like the old days.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
036	(Well, I'm off then. I must obtain the "absolute power" that will bring happiness and joy to this world.)
