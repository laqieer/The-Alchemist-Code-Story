001	Here's some pocket money for a job well done!
002	Thank you Miss Roxanne!
003	(Mmm... Blair is destroying the Droids faster than I anticipated...)
004	Soren, how many of those Droids are left?
005	Less than 20, those Droids have no chance against Blair's arsenal.
006	No good, we're going to run out of time.
007	Bring back the remaining Droids, let's move to Plan B.
008	Now hurry back, we wouldn't want Blair to get suspicious!
009	Ok!
010	Blair's going to find out sooner or later about this ridiculous scheme.
011	Which is why you're going to increase the alchemic power on the remaining Droids!
012	We're nearly done gathering the materials for her new look, so let's keep at it!
013	*sigh* (Siegfried, save me...)
