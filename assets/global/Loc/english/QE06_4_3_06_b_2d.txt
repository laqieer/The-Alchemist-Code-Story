001	...
002	...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
003	Edgar?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
004	If we want to pick him off, we have the chance right now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
005	N-no! That would be so cowardly!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
006	Amane. You need to save your energy. And, Edgar...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
007	We're already wounded. Tamba may well wipe us out if he attacks us again.
008	We should strike while we have the chance.
009	Do you really think that's what anybody here wants?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0003
010	If it means none of this will have been in vain... If it means I can protect my friends... If it means no sweet ladies have to cry, then...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0004
011	Yeah, I'm okay with being the bad guy. It's just, somebody has to say it! Striking him while he's down is the best tactical decision we could possibly make right now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
012	Edgar, stop.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
013	Forgive me, Amane.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0033
014	...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
015	Calm yourself, Edgar. Put the gun down.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
016	Tamba might be an immediate threat, but he's not our true enemy.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
017	Were we to kill him now, we'd just be playing into the hands of the one pulling his strings.
018	And that's something we must never abide.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
019	We may call ourselves a Demon Elimination Corps, but that doesn't mean we stain our blades with the blood of those who don't deserve to be slain.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
020	But, I thought you hated demons!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
021	I do. But what good would killing Tamba now do, as he stands on the edge of repentance?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
022	No, peace is the only way to bring about change in Wadatsumi.
023	Only then can those who've fallen be truly vindicated.
024	I do know where you're coming from, Edgar. When Lady Celis died, I almost lost the will to follow in her footsteps. But...it's important not to lose sight of the big picture.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
025	I will wield my blade for all those who live in Wadatsumi...be they human or demon.
026	And you don't think you're gonna regret that later?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
027	Never.
028	...
029	Edgar?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
030	Hey, I know when I'm beat. I got no comeback to all that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
031	This seems a little erratic, even for you. Why...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
032	I have no horse in this race. Sure, I'm no longer an outsider either, but, well...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
033	I'm not exactly one of the parties involved. So I needed a way to objectively figure out what the best course of action was.
034	What do you mean?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
035	I'm saying I'm not from Wadatsumi, and I'm not carrying any secret royal blood like Logi. So, uh, yeah, this isn't really my choice to make, you know?
036	I just needed a way to make sure it was the right choice, one way or another. And this seemed like the quickest way to do that.
037	I see. You were trying to evaluate the situation in your own...unique manner.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
038	Yep. And mission accomplished on that, for sure! I gotta say, you all really showed me just how deep your resolve goes!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0004
039	As a fellow visitor to this land, I sympathize with you, Edgar.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0005
040	Even looking in from the outside, it's just...so painful to see what's happening here.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
041	And that's exactly why we have to watch over Tamba now. Painful or not, this is the moment that decides everything.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
042	For if all the threads can once again be tied back together, we can finally restore Wadatsumi to the way it once was.
043	All right, already, I gotcha! I trust you all know what you're doing.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
044	Please, Tamba. Please remember! Remember what it was you wanted to protect!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
