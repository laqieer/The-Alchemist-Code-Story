001	What?! The Mikaboshi?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0025
002	It's been taken from the inner sanctum. Based on the techniques used in its extraction, I believe the perpetrators must be from Wadatsumi.
003	Which raises the question: Are you familiar with a swordfighter who uses ink techniques?
004	...!	VO_judius.judius_battle_0019
005	Of course, reasons for clinging to the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi are few, in terms of mass appeal. There's simply not value in it for the general populace to warrant any grave concern.
006	And it has no effect on me personally, either, as I have no connection with it.
007	However... I believe its absence will have quite an impact on you, no?
008	...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
009	Another variable, then.
010	Whether you run the numbers over and over, or simply rush things out the door...
011	Even the best laid plans have the potential to fail.
012	I must apologize to you, Judius. Some of this was due to my own clumsiness.
013	We've already lost the Sacred Stone Mammon. Without even the Mikaboshi now, Greed Dike will be unable to continue holding the other nations back. So this is not merely my problem.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
014	Yes, yes, of course. However, we can hear it...
015	The cries of a new Mammon, coming ever closer.
016	...
017	With your plan falling through, however, that would mean all that research and development has just been a waste of time for Greed Dike.
018	And you wouldn't want that, now, would you?
019	Of course not! Without my research, we could never have achieved military rule in the kingdom. Even Orion couldn't pull that off.
020	I'm quite proud of what my research has accomplished, I'll have you know.
021	Then prove it. If you wish to live in Greed Dike, you must do everything you can for the good of this nation.
022	...Yes, I believe that was implied from the start of this conversation.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
023	When I was young, my parents were cheated by someone they thought to be a trusted friend.
024	They lost their house, their money, and finally, their lives.
025	"We owe it to them," they said. "They've been so good to us!" That's what my parents always used to say. They trusted in things that couldn't be seen, and wound up with nothing.
026	While my life was threatened as well, I managed to escape. No one pursued me. I suppose they just didn't think I mattered much.
027	The point is, nobody truly cares about stolen purses. The perpetrators always get away with it.
028	And it makes sense nobody cares. Everyone had their own matters to attend to. They can't be bothered fretting over someone else's misfortune. It's the only way to survive here.
029	That's why I wanted to prove that military rule could be accomplished entirely through known quantities—as opposed to variables.
030	That's why I needed to study, plan, and experiment as much as possible.
031	To do so, I needed time... Time to take care of any unknowns, preparing for every eventuality and building the strength we'd need to make sure no pesky variables would ever slow us down...
032	Even if it meant becoming a demon myself.
033	There was one who tried establishing military rule by killing a god.
034	That quickly fell apart, unsurprisingly. I could have told them, trying to take care of an unknown variable as big as a god is never a good idea.
035	Only that which can be proven is reliable enough to work with. My research alone will save Greed Dike.
036	That's why no variables can be allowed to exist.
037	I'll use whatever I deem necessary to eliminate them: Demons, humans...
038	Even The Sun King himself, whom Greed Dike adores so.
039	If it will help me attain military rule for this fine country, no price is too high.
040	...
041	Feeling irritated, are we?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
042	What a question! Do I seem irritated?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
043	A bit.
044	Nothing has changed. We must take care of any unknown variables. Particularly anything that could change the tides.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
045	On that, we are in agreement.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
046	You should be more introspective, perhaps. Focusing too much on your goal is bound to give you tunnel vision. You're liable to slip on a leaf.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
047	Don't deflect. You're the one in trouble here.
048	Oh, come, now! It was a joke. We're allies, aren't we? Lighten up!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
049	If you wish to claim that a joke, then fine. I won't push the matter.
050	All is for Wadatsumi.
051	Yes. There is no place in Wadatsumi for humans, or for the malice they bring.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
052	We will create a powerful nation of demons. That is our only desire.
053	We must have that body, and I must be strong.
054	There is no need to worry. We will have plenty of opportunities. And if not, we will make new ones.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
055	...
056	Variables... An interesting concept.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
