001	(I wanted to cleanse this tainted world.)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
002	(Whatever the reason, whether out of patriotism or personal beliefs, the world keeps getting more and more corrupted.)
003	(So I refuse to love or be a part of this stained world.)	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0010
004	(—That is what I thought.)
005	Nothing. None of our teams have found what we're looking for.
006	That can't be... According to the professor's research, the Philosopher's Stone lies within these ruins.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
007	After all you've done here... I am sorry.
008	It's nothing. The stakes are too high for regret. We must do all we can to find some way of protecting this world from potential destruction. It's only a shame we didn't find anything here.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
009	Yes... However, something here is a little strange. It almost seems like it was here, but was taken by someone else...
010	...
011	Are you about done?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
012	Yes, that is enough for today. We should head back.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
013	Before you were at my side in battle, today you are my escort through ancient ruins. We seem to find our way to each other. Could this be fate?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
014	Nonsense. This is just a job among other jobs.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
015	Must you sign a different contract each time? Wouldn't it be easier to just join the order? I could put in a good word for you.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
016	For me? Please don't. You're Wratharis's secret weapon. I wouldn't be able to live up to a recommendation from you.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
017	That is simply not true. I know full well what you are capable of.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
018	You're quite adept at coordinating with others in combat. It's very comforting to have you fight alongside me.
019	You think too highly of me. I'm just a mercenary.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
020	So humble. Or self-effacing?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1001
021	...
022	I just think it would be convenient if I was able to speak more frankly about what we are doing here.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
023	As in, for example, about the true goal of this mission that I was not informed of?
024	Exactly.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
025	...
026	There are not many, even among the knights of Wratharis, that can fight shoulder to shoulder with me. Wratharis is in desperate need of capable warriors.
027	Besides, I do believe we make quite agreeable business partners.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
028	I'm happy to hear you say that, but I'm content with where I am now.
029	I prefer to not make long-term contracts. I hate to feel tied down, so I have no intention of associating myself with any particular faction.
030	This must be how it feels to be dumped.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
031	Sorry.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0035
032	Oh, don't be. I merely wanted to try my luck. Still, would you mind telling me what makes your conviction so immutable?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
033	...
034	I just do not want to be involved with or be part of this world.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
035	Glanz? I want you to know that I meant it when I said it's comforting to have you fight alongside me.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0002
036	I know. Still, you're plenty powerful without me.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
037	That is true, but it is also true that there is strength in numbers.
038	If you say so. Hm? What is that?
039	...
040	Are you all right?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
041	Grr... Rawr!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
042	OW!!!
043	Glanz?!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0025
044	Th-this kid just bit me?!	VO_glanz.glanz_battle_0019
045	Hmm? What is going on here?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
046	That's what we want to know! You just bit my hand! What is with you?!	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
047	It's very unwise to wake a bear from hibernation. Of course you end up getting bit.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
048	What? What are you talking about?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
049	You're not icky-sticky. I like that.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
050	Huh?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0025
051	Rawr!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
052	Aaaagh!
053	What?!
054	Icky-stickies right when I wake up. I hate that. I'm gonna beat you all down.	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0010
