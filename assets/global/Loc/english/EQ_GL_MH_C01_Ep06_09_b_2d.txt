001	Agh- I can’t...move!
002	It can't end...like this...
003	Siegfried! Roxanne!
004	...!
005	[ Resistance is futile. ]
006	[ You are a threat to my plans, child of Sakris. ]
007	[ I cannot allow you to live. ]
008	Wha... ???
009	After all, humans themselves are inherently flawed. We cannot trust ourselves to make impartial judgments.
010	That is why the Constructs were created in the first place.
011	What if the project falls into the wrong hands?
012	The Constructs learn, my friend. They learn who is friend and who is foe.
013	At the very least... They will substitute a good percentage of human casualties.
014	The lesser of two evils.
015	In a way, we, too... are playing Creator with these Constructs...
016	Weren't they created in our own, flawed image?
017	Flawed...
018	Zheng Yi, your perfect world will never come to pass.
019	[ Because you are here to hinder its birth! ]
020	[ Because your actions hamper the dawn of the ideal era! ]
021	This cycle will never end!
022	The Constructs learn from human desires... And human desires are flawed...
023	The Core itself, perpetuates these flawed desires!
024	But unlike them, humans can change!
025	The Constructs as they are now will only make matters worse!
026	[ SILENCE, TRANSGRESSOR! ]
027	?!
028	Zheng Yi!
029	Zheng Yi, my love... You've done... *cough*... enough!
030	[ Y... You! ]
031	Have you forgotten what you stood for?
032	Will you cut down a child to prove your ideals?
033	[ SILENCE, WOMAN! You dare go against... your Lord? ]
034	I have stood loyal by your side through the most trying of times...
035	Even now, I still do.
036	But I cannot allow you, my beloved, to walk down a path from which there is no return.
037	[ You dare.... betray me...? ] Hnng...!
038	[ If you will not... obey... ] Ngghhh... S... Stop...!!! [ I will c... cut you... DOWN!]
039	[ AARGGHHH...!!!]
040	Zheng Yi's attack stopped mid-way. Somewhere deep within him, Zheng Yi is fighting to wrestle control back from Atropos.
041	[ NO! ] Shion... I beg you... [ TAKE HER... ] and LEAVE!
042	Zheng Yi... you...
043	I will not leave you behind, my love! Never!
044	Look at what it's done to us... to you!
045	Despite all our efforts... all we have done with it thus far was to hurt more people.
046	The Core... this machine. It would never be able to accommodate the shifting tides of human emotion.
047	Yes, emotion makes us susceptible to desire... and ofttimes, with desire comes ruin.
048	Is that not what the dark temptation of Alchemy has done to our countries?
049	AARGHHH!!!
050	[ WARNING: ALCHEMIA ENHANCEMENT DESTABILIZING IN CONDUIT. ]
051	But you are stronger than that, Zheng Yi!
052	The orphans we rescued and trained... the intricate navigation of political battlefields...
053	You carved your own road in this world.
054	Atropos... The Constructs... They do not, and will never, rule you.
055	Atropos!!! Let him go!
