001	The resurrection of the Deadly Trio... Is such a thing possible?
002	Of course. Do you have some keepsake of both General Caesar the Demon Flame and General Neville the Ice Snake?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0005
003	Keepsake?
004	We can transmute more accurately by offering a sacrifice which their soul dwells within. Do you have anything?
005	I have one of Caesar here...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
006	Is that...?
007	Caesar's Shadow Blade. It's the sword he used until his end.
008	So, this is it!
009	Heheh. It's perfect. This will do. First, we'll resurrect General Caesar the Demon Flame.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
010	Oh General Caesar the Demon Flame! Answer the anger and sorrow of us whose native land has been trampled on. Return to us!
011	Aghh...
012	It burns... My body burns... Who has summoned back my wrathful soul?
013	Caesar? Caesar, is that you?!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0004
014	Vlad! So, you survived. I never expected to return to this blood-soaked world.
015	I'm sorry, Caesar.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
016	You have nothing to apologize for. In fact, I'm grateful to you.
017	If you hadn't survived, I wouldn't have had this chance to return.
018	I won't forget Blood Wolf Zeke's acts of destruction! I'll personally kill him myself!
019	Caesar, look at what you've become. Can you still not erase the rage you felt when you were alive?
020	My rage remains because of what I've become.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0010
021	My body has rotted away in the flames of wrath.
022	Yet, my anger and hatred towards Envylia continue to burn eternally!
023	I understand, Caesar. Let's have Neville assist us as well.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
024	Sabareta, I accept your proposal. We'll use the Deadly Trio's wrath to set fire to this rebellion!
025	I'm indebted to you. Now that that's decided, we must quickly resurrect General Neville.
026	Neville's keepsake Ice Snake was apparently returned to his place of birth.
027	However, I hear that land is currently under the jurisdiction of Envylia's aristocrats.
028	That's no problem. Come on, let's awaken the last of the Deadly Trio!
