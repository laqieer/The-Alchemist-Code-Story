001	Insensitive to illusory magicks. Good.
002	Now, show yourself to me, my little helgwn.
003	Ready, little one?
004	It's time to go.
005	Mmmhh...
006	Big Sis...not coming?
007	Eira, how are you feeling?
008	Blair says the patrols have been drawn away for some reason.
009	Some altercation where Roxanne's mansion is—was.
010	Once Siegfried gives us the go-ahead, we'll be making a break for it.
011	It seems the fates are on your side.
012	You're sure you're not coming?
013	I mean—I don't mean to impose. Eira would feel more stable around you, I think... But of course, it's not—
014	I understand. There is something I would look into.
015	For the moment, however, I believe Eira will be safe in your hands.
016	Morrigan's eyes flicker over to Soren, which seem to search his face for something.
017	...You haven't changed in the slightest.
018	Give Blair my regards when she returns, won't you?
019	Until we next meet.
020	Be safe, little one.
021	Morrigan rounds the corner and stands silently before a large, heavily reinforced cell.
022	Her fingers graze the padlock on the gate before her form dissolves into shadowy wisps, appearing on the other side.
023	Its sole occupant jolts at the intrusion, confusion knocking her out of her reverie.
024	...You're...
025	How did you...
026	Simmering, seething beneath your skin. I see it burn, but you are unharmed...for now.
027	I don't...
028	Little helgwn, made to bend and break for your masters.
029	Is this what you truly want?
030	...I hate riddles.
031	Yet you've stayed your hand. Do the guards hate you, or fear you?
032	...
033	Why are you really here?
034	I came to see the one who torments Eira's memory so.
035	Red narrows her eyes, a sliver of crimson in the darkness.
036	You're here to kill me.
037	Do not misunderstand.
038	I merely wished to know more about Goetia's warhound.
039	A fox and a hound...both victims of their circumstances. How fitting.
040	Your masters do not like the way you hesitate, it seems.
041	You will never be free, even from your own mind...as long as you remain here.
042	Do you understand that, little helgwn?
043	...!
044	Free...
045	Enough, Red.
046	Don't waste your breath on prey.
047	Berith...
048	(Ah... This aura. Familiar, somehow. Or merely a trick of mine own memories?)
049	(Such bloodlust...)
050	I'm going a little loopy here, Red.
051	I want to see blood!
052	Ugh...!
053	Berith... No!
054	...Crush.
055	Kill...
056	*sigh*
057	As you wish.
