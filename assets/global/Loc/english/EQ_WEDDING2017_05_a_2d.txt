001	All right...as practice for Eve's wedding...what do you think about having two models?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0031
002	Nooo.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0039
003	Um, um... You could be a teacher for the children of Wadatsumi and Saga...teaching them the proper customs of another country...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
004	Really, it's fine...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0003
005	Come on. Why are you turning down everything? Do you want to actually get married then?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0013
006	... ...
007	Please...stop. That's not what this is.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_battle_1028
008	But...you wanted to wear the wedding dress and become happy, right?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
009	Huh...?
010	Ah...so you were watching me, Aswald...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0016
011	That's not what it is. It's fine. I'm satisfied just wearing it. Really.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0017
012	You seem to have completely misunderstood the situation, so I'll explain it to you properly.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0035
013	Seriously! We're in the middle of talking! I won't forgive you!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0013
