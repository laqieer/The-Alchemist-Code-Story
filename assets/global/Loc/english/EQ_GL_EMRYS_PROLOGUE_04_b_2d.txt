001	This should hold you!
002	*gurgles foam....*
003	What the...?
004	He's gone.
005	What sort of street slasher is determined to die before they can talk!
006	Cause of death, lethal poison, hidden in a false tooth.
007	This level of discipline or fanaticism and their coordinated attacks indicate training or indoctrination.
008	Pupils dilated ... Evidence of psychoactive drugs, possibly mind-altering...
009	Abnormal muscle density implies growth hormones or long term stimulant use.
010	Multiple needle marks on the arms... Wait!
011	These marks are the same as the corpse at the other site!
012	Relax, I'm not your enemy.
013	I'm not very good at fighting anyway.
014	...
015	In fact you have my gratitude for attempting to help my associate over there.
016	Your associate?
017	Yes, he was just a contract staff we hired to check on our properties for our organization.
018	It's a shame. Sigh... Wrong place, wrong time...
019	I suppose I'll have to find a replacement.
020	Did the manager send you?
021	I heard your initial assesments of our friends over here.
022	What conclusions have you drawn?
023	The assailants and the corpse at the other site are very likely from the same group or related.
024	Judging from the earlier fight, they are well trained and precise with their strikes.
025	Thus these gentlemen here are not the culprits and the possibility of in-fighting are ruled out.
026	There is at least one other killer.
027	Bravo my good sir!
028	Very astute of you. You have no idea how much I truly appreciate your competence.
029	So what's your play here?
030	There are usurpers who seek to climb the hierachy and that will not serve my employer's "interests".
031	They hide within the pecking order and conduct their treachery in secret.
032	The one who enlisted your help is merely the most prominent of them, but he has emboldened many others.
033	He has been really slippery and refusing to come out to meet anyone.
034	But since you are an outlander, he thought he could get some outside help while keeping his hands clean.
035	He has given you an empty promise that he clearly does not intend to fulfill.
036	I on the other hand will offer you an honest bargain.
037	And what do you have for me ?
038	....
039	!!!
