001	(Incredible. She's fighting toe-to-toe with the Ruinmaker, on her own?)	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0009
002	(But...something doesn't seem right. She's not acting like her usual self.)
003	(It's as if she can see nothing but the Ruinmaker. It's a familiar feeling, and I don't like what it implies...)	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0016
004	I'm impressed. I did not expect you to put up such a fight. Envylia seems to have many warriors with great mastery of the spear.
005	I'm honored to receive such high praise from the renowned Ruinmaker of Wratharis.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0006
006	It would be an even greater honor if you'd let this spear do its job and run you through, however!
007	I don't quite understand. You seem to hold a great deal of animosity toward me, specifically. But why?	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0016
008	Why? Hmph. Perhaps it's because the words you speak have a familiar cadence to them.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0029
009	I don't understand. What's that supposed to mean?
010	You dare speak of bringing an end to war? You, who do nothing but wreak havoc and destruction wherever you go?! It would be laughable, if it weren't so tragic!	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0010
011	Oh. I see.
012	You took from me my muse...the one person possessing the wherewithal and aptitude to actually end this senseless war.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0005
013	You roam from battle to battle, killing hundreds, and yet you dare speak those same words he did?!
014	I cannot abide such hypocrisy!
015	Hng! This technique...	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0019
016	Ha. Recognize it, do you?
017	It's the same technique he used. He was the one who spoke the words you now so flagrantly expunge from your mouth. The only difference is, he actually meant them!	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0004
018	(I've fought this spear before. That man I felled many battles ago... The one I later learned was a royal prince of Envylia...)	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0031
019	(Though he was no match for me, he was a skilled warrior nonetheless. So this girl must be—)
020	Master! We've been ordered to retreat. Fall back immediately!	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
021	Understood. Move out, everyone! There's nothing more for us here!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0037
022	Oh, no you don't!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
023	I-it's fine, Priscilla. We must prioritize helping the injured.
024	Ahh... Yes. You're right.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0037
025	Nothing more for them here, she says...	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0030
026	I suppose for her, the battle is over, isn't it?
027	But not for me. There is no end in sight for me.
028	I've been fighting this same battle since that day.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_battle_0025
