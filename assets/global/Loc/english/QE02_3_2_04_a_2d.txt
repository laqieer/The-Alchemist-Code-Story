001	Fiona, are you all right? Tired, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0018
002	No, I'm fine. More importantly, Edgar and...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
003	They're fine, aye! Both of them just passed out! They weren't seriously hurt!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
004	Does that mean that man had no intention of hurting them?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
005	Aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
006	A small, but fine bodyguard. Here, eat this.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0010
007	Hmm...!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0016
008	Don't worry. There's no poison in it.
009	Squeak! It's apple and grapes. Aye, there's no sign of it having been tampered with.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
010	I'm sorry. I could only get my hands on this. Please eat it.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
011	Are you a knight from Envylia's Blue Flame Guard?
012	I used to be. Right now I'm nothing more than a mercenary hired by the Beckrams.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
013	Did Alvarez order you to bring me back?
014	Those were his commands, but I have no intention of following through.
015	Then...what do you want with me?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
016	I'll be frank with you. I'm looking for the Sacred Stone Belphegor. I want you to tell me where it is.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0015
017	...!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
