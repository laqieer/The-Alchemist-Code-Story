001	We've dealt with the biggest fish! Now all that's left is—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
002	You shouldn't get too excited. It leaves you vulnerable!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0014
003	Not if I have anything to say about it!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0001
004	Hmph.
005	No way! Did you just see that?! She cut through magic! Magic! That's so unfair!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
006	Not only that, but she's a bit too small to effectively target.	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
007	We definitely didn't have to worry about that with the Cursed Beasts, at least!
008	An unfortunate consequence of focusing too much energy on fighting opponents so much larger than yourself.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
009	You've become far too used to your opponents being giants!
010	I wonder how many of you have ever actually killed a person before.
011	Taking a life doesn't require flashy techniques, nor even any great amount of strength.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
012	You simply need to change your tactics based on the strengths of your opponent. If you can't even grasp such simple strategy, can you truly call yourselves Sephira?
013	I don't appreciate you implying that my people are savages!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
014	How's this?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
015	Well, well! You pick things up fast. But you don't have the guts to kill me.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
016	Then we'll just keep on fighting you until you stop fighting back! Waginau!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
017	Right!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
018	Oh, dear. Have you all forgotten about me?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
019	Urk...!
020	I didn't ask for your help.
021	Don't say that! This isn't about you, anyway. I just felt inclined to jump back into the fray.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0010
022	Daphne!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
023	Right!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
024	Tch!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
025	This won't work either?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
026	...
027	Don't get carried away. Your human body may lose its ability to sustain itself if you overdo it.
028	Quite an inconvenient power this is, then!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
029	You. Do you plan to use that technique again?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0003
030	...!
031	Not that it matters. Time for you to fall!
032	Gn..rk...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
033	Waginau!
034	You're putting up a better fight now than you did when we were on top of that tower.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
035	However, it's still nowhere near enough to defeat me.
036	Nng... What...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
037	This is the end of the line, descendant of the Sephira.
038	I don't think so. In fact, I find that idea quite disagreeable.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
039	Oh, for the love of... How many little surprise extras are going to show up here?!
040	Ignacio...?
041	Hello, Child of God. I expect you're not particularly happy to see me after everything that's transpired.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
042	But I urge you to think of all that as water under the bridge. Just consider me another one of your shields. I am at your disposal.
043	Understood. Thank you, Ignacio. Can you use your gun to cover me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
044	...
045	I really can't stand these two.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0030
046	Hmm? A gun that can throw magil into disorder? That's rather concerning.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
047	Any normal person would at least be comatose as soon as they were hit with one of my bullets.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0022
048	The two of them were raised from the dead by Ouroboros and given physical forms created with magil.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
049	They don't die like normal people. They can only be stopped by overwhelming them with the most powerful attacks possible.
050	Or maybe if we cut off their limbs so they can't do anything anymore.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
051	That's...another option.
052	(Gruesome, but...should we try it?)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
053	(No. The time isn't right for that. It's possible that Ouroboros is still watching.)
054	(We're going to have to stick with surprise attacks.)
055	I have a proposal.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0001
056	Hmm?
057	We should retreat. The odds, as things stand, are not in your favor.
058	Your greatest strength is your mind. You learn about your enemy, test your hypotheses, and then rinse and repeat until you get the result you desire.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
059	That's how you defeated all the Cursed Beasts.
060	At least, that seems to be the case, as best as I'm able to judge. And it's worked out well for you so far. But I think you may have reached the limits of that particular stratagem.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
061	Retreating now would just expose our backs to a dangerous enemy, though, wouldn't it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
062	I told you. You can use me as your shield.
063	You're saying... You'll stay behind and keep them busy for us? By yourself?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
064	Are you concerned for my well-being? On that front, let me assure you, I will not be alone. In fact, I've recently run into an old man who was simply dying to volunteer as tribute.
065	Hey! Who're you calling old?! And stealing my spotlight... I was gonna jump in and generously offer to give you the opening you need to get outta here, but nooo, this joker had to go and beat me to it!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0004
066	Quence!
067	Tch.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
068	You all should know what we're capable of. Snakes like us won't die so easily. We'll buy you enough time to clear out.
069	But...with the magil as it is, Space-Time Manipulation is—	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
070	Remember, unlike you two, I can also use magic.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
071	...That's true.
072	While you're on your way out, you should pick up my boss. She's outside healing your friends.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
073	I'm guessing you'll want her with you.
074	Your boss? Shahel?
075	Uh, no? Your sister, man! Just get the heck out of here, all right?!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
076	Oh! A-all right. I hope I'll see you again soon!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
077	How unwise. You think the two of you will be able to keep us occupied here?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
078	Two? Where'd you pull that number out of?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
079	Quence, what are you...?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0025
080	You'd better get going, too.
081	Quence, answer me! What—?!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
082	As one last favor to my former boss, you know? Geez, I'm such a bleeding heart sometimes.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
083	Your chances of survival just went down drastically.
084	Eh. Wasn't planning to make it out of here alive in the first place, so that's fine. Anyway, I've still got this jerk with me!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
085	Yes, this "jerk" still has his responsibilities to the garden he's spent all these ages tending.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
086	In any case, if we're at this stage of things, I am the most suitable person to stand on this battlefield.
087	Shahel...
088	Long time no see. The lid's been lifted from the hell pot, and the steam has wafted your way.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
089	The two of you are no match for me.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
090	But we can buy a little time. We might just be mere pests buzzing around you, but we shan't be so easily swatted down.
091	...
092	Nothing to say in response? It's almost like you don't like me or something!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0005
093	Of course they don't. I'm betting when they were alive, you made sure to be as big a nuisance as you could be.
094	Hahaha! You are not mistaken in that.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0008
095	Hmph. Honestly, a dragon slayer and a shield maiden? I'm too old to be dealing with this crap.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
096	I think I'm actually jealous of you, ex-boss. Even if you die, you'll just come back again, right?
097	Ha! Let me fill you in on a little secret, Quence.
098	This body of mine...will be my last. I used all my remaining resources to make my children.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
