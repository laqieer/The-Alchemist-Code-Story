001	Ngh! At this rate, even the ground beneath my feet can't be trusted!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
002	(I need to do as I did in Invidia Belt, and create footholds for myself with ice!)
003	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"
004	Okay, then...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
005	What?!
006	Whoops. I may have struck that a bit too hard. Sorry about that!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
007	Y-you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
008	Shall we continue where we left off?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
009	?!
010	Haa... Haa...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
011	Don't... Don't you understand?! If you keep doing this...you'll fall too!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
012	And?
013	(Does she even know what she's saying?!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
014	It would hardly be my first time falling from the sky. Though I must admit, it hurts so much that death may be preferable.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0010
015	Well, I have no intention of finding that out for myself!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
016	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"
017	Here's a little souvenir for you. Do enjoy!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
018	What? Why would you drop your shield?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
019	I didn't drop it, I threw it. And that's not to say I don't have a use in mind for it!
020	Gnrgh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
021	(My body... It's... I can't move! Is this it for me?)
022	...
023	Hmm. If you were an average human, you'd definitely be dead by now.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
024	...
025	Ehh. I might as well finish you off.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
026	...
027	Nngh... Wa...gi...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
028	Honestly! Why is it that every time I'm gone, I come back to find you in the most dire possible situations?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
029	Here, Adaleigh. You can see it, right?
030	Of course! Now, hold there, just like that. I've nearly got it.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
031	You good to go, old dog?
032	Yes, though again I remind you, I am neither old nor a dog! Now, start the countdown, please.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
033	All right. You ready? Three...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
034	Two...
035	One... Now!
036	...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
037	Ngh!
038	Got it?!
039	Yep. Worked like a charm.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
040	Excellent! Then that's where we'll touch down!
041	...
042	How's Nimul?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
043	Alive. No serious injuries. However, he seems to have lost the cores of the Cursed Beasts.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
044	Oh! That's not good.
045	Incidentally, Waginau, where have you been all this time? You look, shall we say...different?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
046	It's a long story. Let's prioritize getting everyone back together first.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
047	Yeah, that's probably a good call.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
048	(He looks...older?)
049	What? Is there something on my face?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
050	Ah, no, it's... It's nothing.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
051	Wha—?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
052	I suppose it stands to reason we couldn't get away quite that easily.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
053	Wh-whoa! What the heck was that?! Something flew into us from above!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
054	Warning. Starboard engine damaged. Unable to maintain altitude. Prepare for emergency landing.
055	Everyone hear that? Hang on tight!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
056	Nnggggggggggh...!
057	The dragon warriors, the serpents, that would consume this world are engaged in mortal combat with one another.
058	What?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
059	Hey, uh, Shahel?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
060	Yes?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
061	If my eyes don't deceive me, there's an airship about to crash-land right on top of us.
062	Uhhhh...?
063	Everyone, get behind me!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
064	Wh—?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0026
065	Eeek?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
066	Mira! Nyx!
067	Hold steady, Daphne!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
068	But the two of them are—
069	Look. Beyond the smoke. Do you see it?
070	See what? I don't see—	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
071	...	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
072	It's... Umm...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0027
073	Oops again! Broke something else. Why is everything in this era so fragile?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
074	But on the plus side, we seem to have landed in the middle of a battlefield, so I'll count this as a win.
075	Who are you?
076	That shield... No, it... It can't be!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0014
077	My, my. You have the same shield as I! Are you an Invidian warrior yourself? How fortuitous.
078	I am not quite as spiteful as Matia, but I am rather curious about the state of that which we've passed down for future generations.
079	...What?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
080	Ha!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0032
081	Ngrk... The power behind that strike...!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0022
082	It's not exactly enough to judge the entirety, of course, but you certainly did well to withstand my attack. Not a bad first impression.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0044
083	Um... Thank you?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0033
084	However...
085	You default to defense a bit too quickly. If you're perpetually on the defensive, it's only a matter of persistence to bleed your stamina dry.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0003
086	What? Th-that's not true!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
087	Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. It is, after all, my role to attack, so I'm grateful for any advantage I'm given.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
088	What?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
089	I see.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0045
090	You are a capable warrior.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
091	You aren't from around here, are you? We don't really call ourselves warriors much nowadays. We prefer to be called knights.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
092	All right. Have it your way. It matters not.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0005
093	...
094	(What's her deal? She really does speak like she just stepped here directly out of the past. And moreover...)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
095	(I'm absolutely certain my sword passed through her neck, but she doesn't show the slightest sign of injury!)	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
096	Though I must say, by the standards of warriors, you are both fearsome indeed. I shall grant you a boon.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0023
097	I face you now with all of my strength. Come!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0012
098	Thanks, I guess. Are you ready, Daphne?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
099	Yes. I don't think I could do this on my own, but I believe the two of us can take her.
100	I was thinking the same. I'll leave the defensive side of things to you.
101	Got it!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
