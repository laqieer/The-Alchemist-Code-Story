001	I guess this is about it for today.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
002	Yeah. The people living around these parts should be able to go about their trade without fear now.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
003	This really is a harsh environment, isn't it? Monsters, bandits, not to mention the blazing sun.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
004	You would have to be pretty tough to live here.
005	It is thanks to that fact, though, that we've not had to suffer the invasions of other nations. To them, we're not worth the effort to conquer.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
006	Well that's, uh...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
007	I know. It's all a matter of perspective.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
008	The fact that you Blue Tongues are able to work so openly, is partly thanks to the lacking value of the land. 
009	...
010	So, did you find what you were looking for?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
011	No. We're asking around when we can, but... Sorry, we may have to trouble you and your guild for a little while longer.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
012	Not a problem. Your presence is of great benefit to us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
013	Hmm...
014	In the desert to the west of here, there is a small town by the name of Bandit's Nest.
015	Bandit's Nest?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
016	It's essentially where all of the scoundrels in the area gather. A sort of a slum.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
017	If you can't find what you're looking for in the light, look for it in the shadows. I don't know what it is that you're looking for, but sometimes it's necessary to take some risks.
018	Thank you. We'll check it out.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
019	...
020	Logi Crowley. He seems to be deeply involved with the fate of many.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
021	I must observe him some more, to see whether my fate is intertwined with his as well.
022	Urgh! They must be shamans from Saga!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
023	This is beyond us! Let's get out of here and regroup!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
024	Wait!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0004
025	Don't go after them, Tina. We should check on the carriage.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
026	Oh, right!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
027	Hey, are you all ri—?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
028	Tina? Th-this is the seal of one of Gluttony Foss' nobility!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
029	Th-thank you. You saved me.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
030	Thank you so much, travelers. Had you not been here, I don't know what would have become of me.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0034
