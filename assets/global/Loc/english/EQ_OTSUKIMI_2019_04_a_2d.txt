001	Yah!
002	Whoooaa!
003	We've got you now! How dare you ruin the dumpling tower I built!
004	Give us the dumplings back! Why would you even do this?!
005	...
006	W-we were just so hungry...
007	We figured as much.
008	Well, I guess it couldn't be helped.
009	Wait, what?! Why?! We're letting them go?!
010	I mean, they didn't do it out of malice.
011	Yeah, they were just hungry.
012	This can't be right! Theft is wrong!
013	Well, I forgot to tell you something.
014	Ahem...
015	To tell you the truth, moon-gazing isn't just about eating dumplings while looking up at the moon.
016	The Gods told me of a custom honored during the event. It's called Moonlit Burglary.
017	It's where children try to steal as many dumplings as they can during the event.
018	The more dumplings successfully stolen, the better the fortune.
019	So everybody should be smiling, even if dumplings are stolen.
020	There are some households that go as far as to give away dumplings to children in the neighborhood. Doesn't that sound fun?!
021	It does! So much fun!
022	So, they didn't actually do anything wrong in terms of the rules of this event.
023	Why is this the first time we're hearing about this?
024	Sorry, I forgot about it until now.
025	B-but, Carol went through all that trouble to make them for us...
026	I'll just ask her to make some again. Oh! Or I could ask her how to make them so we can do it together.
027	Oooh! That sounds like fun!
028	That's not fair! We worked so hard to get everything ready, and they just show up and... And...
029	We haven't had any of the dumplings ourselves yet!
030	Oh no, Evelika, are you hungry? I'm sorry I didn't notice. There's this really good cheese dog stand right around the...
031	That's not the point!
032	And just so you know, cheese dogs aren't that great! They don't even match the theme of the night!
033	Come on, Evelika. You don't have to be so mad. Let's just have some fun tonight!
034	...!
035	Evelika...?
036	Did I... Did I not look like I was having fun?
037	I just wanted to make sure this moon-gazing went perfectly.
038	I was having so much fun getting things ready with Hazel...
039	Evelika?
040	...
041	Evelika!
042	...!
043	Wow, emotions are running high. Is the smell of the purple dumplings getting to you or something?
044	I'm sorry, but we don't have enough to share.
