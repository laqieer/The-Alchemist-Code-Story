001	...All right. That should do it. The barrier looks like it's all right now.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0030
002	Good job, Mikoto! It looks like there wasn't any damage to the village. I'm glad everything turned out all right somehow!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0007
003	Yes. It's a relief. That being said, I wonder why the barrier was torn so easily.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
004	The barrier is supposed to keep bad people from entering here, right?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_1029
005	Yes. Its immense power is completed by my presence in the shrine.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
006	So, when you said that bad things would happen if you left, you meant to the village, not to you?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0044
007	Yes. My power protects this village and all of Wadatsumi. That is why I cannot afford to leave this shrine.
008	Ohh. The reason why the barrier was easily broken was due to the disturbance caused by my overt interest in the outside world...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
009	... ...
010	My immaturity has placed my father, mother, and everyone else in danger... Tamamo, is something wrong?	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0018
011	The fact that you have to stay here forever for the sake of everyone else...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0022
012	It's too much for you, Mikoto!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0018
013	......
014	Oh dear. I must return to my room soon.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0014
015	...Mikoto! You're interested in the outside world, right?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0002
016	...If it means the safety of everyone, then I...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0039
017	If you just leap across the barrier, you could see the outside world, you know? I'm sure no one would get mad...not even the Gods.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1004
018	......
019	There are a lot of fun things in the outside world. Don't you want to go to a festival with me?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_1029
020	It's fine, Tamamo.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0016
021	Mikoto...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0018
022	I would be lying if I said the outside world didn't interest me, but this shrine is where I belong.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0030
023	But don't you hate to be trapped in this place forever?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0021
024	I may have been...trapped. However, from now on it is my will for me to remain here.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0031
025	Your will...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0029
026	Yes. For the sake of fulfilling my role as Shrine Maiden...no, for the sake of all those who rely on me, I wish to remain here.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
027	When I was going around the grounds with you, Tamamo, there was something I noticed.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0003
028	What was that?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0006
029	When I found out that this incident had occurred and had caused damage...it made me very sad.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
030	It made me realize that, even though I don't meet my parents very often, they worry about me...
031	If something were to happen to me, they would be devastated. And I, too, if something were to happen to them.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0018
032	You said that you didn't want anyone to suffer.
033	Yeah. Just the thought of suffering makes my chest hurt.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0004
034	I'm the same. It would make me very sad for my parents, the villagers, or anyone in Wadatsumi to suffer.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
035	But, but...there are a lot of people in Wadatsumi. And they place all of the burden on you...!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0021
036	It's because I have just that much strength.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
037	Still, Mikoto...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0018
038	The power I possess is immense and must never be abused. That is why I cannot leave this shrine.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0016
039	Today my reasons changed slightly. I won't leave this shrine because I want to protect those that are important to me.
040	...I see. All right, I understand, Mikoto.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0004
041	I'm sorry, Tamamo...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0036
042	No. It's okay. It looks like it's goodbye then, Mikoto.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0039
043	...!
044	Right. You come from the outside world, Tamamo. There's no reason for you to stay here.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0018
045	Yep! There are a lot of different places I need to visit!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0007
046	U-um... This seems like an awfully cheerful goodbye.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_chara_1010
047	Of course! After all, I'm gonna go visit a lot of different places, and then come back and tell you about it, Mikoto!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0037
048	...! I get to talk with you again, Tamamo...? But now that the barrier has been fixed...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
049	Well, I'm not human. Besides, when I first came here, the barrier was perfectly in place.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0039
050	Huh, really?! If the Gods knew about it, they should've told me!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
051	Eheheh. That's why I'll be able to come and see you! I'm gonna travel all over the outside world in your stead, Mikoto.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0023
052	...All right! I'll be looking forward to your return!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
053	I wonder how Tamamo has been since then...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0007
