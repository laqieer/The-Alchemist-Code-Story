001	...
002	Hmm, I suppose that will do for today. Let's leave the Demon Calming Ceremony there. That was good work.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
003	Lady Yomi, you did very well.
004	Why is it necessary for us to do this?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
005	It's necessary in order to suppress the power that lurks within you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
006	All of Wadatsumi's people are descended from demons. Among them, one clan has a particularly strong lineage—and that is our clan, the Kagomurasaki.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0005
007	Demons used to devour humans. It is said that they did this in order to harvest their Alchemia.
008	So that's why the Alchemia, or Chakra, in our bodies is like this?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
009	The Discarnate Power responds strongly to hatred. At present, the actions of one man are forcing all of Wadatsumi to face the hardship of invasion yet again.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
010	Discarnate Power responds strongly to hatred. At present, the actions of one man are forcing all of Wadatsumi to face the hardship of invasion yet again.
011	His intention is to make your emotions unstable, and thereby force your power to manifest.
012	No!
013	For breaking his oath and spilling the blood of his blood, he is the enemy of all of Wadatsumi.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
014	The invader, Jin.
015	J-Jin!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
016	By the gods! Th-this demonic energy!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
017	This is proof that evil has been growing within you, Lady Yomi. That is why the Demon Calming Ceremony is necessary. Please understand.
018	That's right. This may be uncomfortable, but it is for the sake of all Wadatsumi and the world at large.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
019	The Discarnate Power is the source of all corruption. Should it manifest, this world will be overrun by demons.
020	Well then, Lady Yomi, you must be tired. Please return to your quarters and have a nice, long rest. We shall take care of the clean up.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
021	I don't see any of the soldiers from Greed Dike.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
022	They left several hours ago. We told them repeatedly that we have no intention of handing over Sumeragi or yourself, my lady. For the moment, we are safe.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
023	Yes, you are far too young to take on such responsibilities, so they have been chased away.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
024	Right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
025	She's gone. She couldn't possibly be aware of our plan, could she?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
026	I'm sure she has her suspicions, but I don't think it's possible that she knows everything.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
027	As for Sumeragi...
028	I have relieved Lady Yomi of its care, and have stored it safely away.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0005
029	I told her that I was worried about her condition worsening, what with those soldiers from Greed Dike barging in.
030	I will milk Lady Yomi's usefulness for all it is worth, until the very end...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
031	...
032	Wait!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0001
033	Yomi...?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
034	What? You have something to say? You already kicked us out.
035	We haven't finished our discussion.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
036	Well, it was finished for us, thanks to those old geezers. I guess you can't expect to communicate with heathens.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
037	Heathens this, heathens that.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0021
038	We are taught that Wadatsumi is a heretical land, plagued by evil ideas.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
039	Evil ideas?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
040	We are taught that it is a land of fanatical heathenism and savagery, a land where violence is used to encourage adherence to tradition.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
041	It is said that they will happily kill even their own blood for breaking tradition. Just like you are trying to do now.
042	How dare you! You're the savages who are all too happy to turn a blind eye to your past!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0012
043	What?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
044	You took our country from us!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0013
045	That's...!
046	The past won't change just because you make some pretty little speech about holding hands!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
047	...
048	Who would happily kill their own blood?! No one!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
049	Wh-what?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
050	It is simply that what must be done will be so! They cannot be forgiven!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
051	Otherwise we cannot move on!
052	I have to kill that man. As the head of the Kagomurasaki Clan, in accordance with the oaths we have sworn, and for his crime.
053	Yet I cannot kill him if I don't hate him.
054	Oh...
055	That's just how it has to be!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
056	I...see.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
057	Leafah, listen to me. It doesn't matter how many strong techniques you master—what's important is that you don't misuse them.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0002
058	It's meaningless if you only use them for the benefit of yourself and the country in which you were born.
059	What? Then...for what purpose do you train?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
060	I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
061	Join hands...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
062	It shouldn't matter which country you were born in, we're all people of Babel, right? I'm sure we can understand each other!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
063	...
064	The world doesn't rule people. People create the world.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0044
065	Their suffering, sorrow, ire, joy... These burdens overlap, and when they connect...that is how the world of humans is made.
066	Leafah. When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
067	If you do that, the answer you seek should come to you all on its own.
068	Hmph. So even now I cling to the words of she who sought a different kind of peace.
069	What is it?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
070	N-nothing...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
071	So...you have your own burden to bear.
072	Of course I do.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
073	You live in Wadatsumi... I suppose it is obvious.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
074	Even though you're still so young...
075	I could say the same for you, right?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
076	I'm not a child.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
077	Wha—? Huh? I didn't say that you were a—?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
078	Don't treat me like a child! I just have a baby face, so I look younger than I am!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1006
079	Wh-what are you talking about all of a sudden?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
080	It's just my face! My face!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_2003
081	Okay! I get it already! I didn't mean anything by it!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0022
082	You called me the Baby General, didn't you?!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1003
083	I did not! How would I even come up with something like "Baby General"?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0016
084	Hey! I knew it! See, you just said it again!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
085	Wh-what is your problem?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0029
086	Hmph.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
087	Do you feel better now?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0022
088	I guess I...lost my composure for a second there.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
089	Obviously.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
090	I'm...sorry. Please forget everything that just happened.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0036
091	It seems that we both have burdens to bear.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
092	I can understand why you wouldn't believe me, considering what Greed Dike did to Wadatsumi in the past.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
093	And I'm young—well, I look young—I mean it's just my fa—!
094	Enough of that already!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0022
095	I'm not enough to gain the trust of the people both in and outside of Greed Dike.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
096	But you're the General, aren't you?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
097	In name only.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
098	I was appointed General as a symbolic gesture to mark the start of a new Greed Dike that is to be projected to the rest of the world. That's all.
099	In name...? Symbolic?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
100	At present, our nation is adopting the principle of transparency, and laying bare the sins of its past. We are working to atone for the mistakes we have made in order to earn back trust.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
101	So they wanted a young person for the position of General, to emphasize the rebirth of Greed Dike.
102	Still, I can't stand not being taken seriously just because I'm young. Age doesn't matter when it comes to caring about your country.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
103	I was saved by the strength of this nation, and I was supported by its righteous justice.
104	That's why it's us, the new generation, who want to restore faith in our proud nation as quickly as possible.
105	I want to encourage the people who have lost faith in us, and bring smiles back to their faces. That's what drives me!
106	I might be young, but I'll take on any and every responsibility in order to rebuild this great nation. It's us who will be in charge of the world from now on, after all.
107	Even if we're ridiculed for being young. Even if we embarrass ourselves. It's still us.
108	...
109	I won't try to force you to trust me. I just want you to understand.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
110	But I'm a heathen...right?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
111	I knew that there were people still troubled by the past, driven by their anger.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
112	I was ignorant, but I didn't try to understand or to learn. I just stood in your way. I realize that now.
113	...
114	For that, I am sorry.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
115	Grrrrrrraaaaaaaawwwwwwwwww!
116	Uhoh. We've been surrounded.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
117	When did they—?!
118	Yomi, where is Sumeragi?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
119	I...I left it with the old-timer.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
120	There's a lot of them... Think we can handle it?	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
121	I rarely ever used Sumeragi in the first place. I'll be fine with just a short sword.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0022
122	Let's call a brief truce and join forces. How about it?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
123	...
124	I...still can't forgive you.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
125	I understand.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
126	I'm not at liberty to help you.
127	I-I see...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
128	That's why I need you to understand that this is just temporary...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
129	But you can trust me to watch your back for now!
