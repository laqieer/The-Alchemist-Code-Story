001	Last one...! Uh-oh.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0004
002	This is...a lot of guards. There's no way that we can slip past all of them.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
003	What is it, Tsuru? You think I look more determined than usual? Well...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
004	I guess you’re right. I feel like my entire body is brimming with resolve.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
005	I just know I’ve got this one in the bag.
006	I have to get in there before Chat Noir. I’d better figure out where the valuables are stored, first. Come on, Tsuru!
007	Here we are... Right behind this door.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
008	Whew. Very well done. I should have expected that your skill with a sword would be more than a match for all those guards.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0044
009	Honestly, I was really dreading trying to infiltrate this place alone.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0030
010	I'd been hoping for someone at my level who could make it easier for me to get in to appear... And here you are! Wishes do come true!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
011	Is that why you were looking for me? Well, your easy ride has come to an end. I won't let you steal everyone's money.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0010
012	Very good. I like that look in your eye. I really feel like I'm getting an authentic Night Fox experience! I'm so glad that I decided to come to Wadatsumi!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0023
013	I appreciate you helping me come to terms with the legacy of the Night Fox. Allow me to repay you...with my sword.
014	Interesting offer, but I am afraid that I will have to take a rain check. After all, I'm no fighter. Just a simple phantom thief.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0011
015	Besides, I got what I was looking for. I'm only here for this.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
016	A...gold coin? That's it? That's what you've done all this for?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
017	Yep. Just this one coin. It might not seem like much to you, but its value is immeasurable to me.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0004
018	The gold coins of Wadatsumi are engraved with a unique pattern, using a special technique that has been passed from generation to generation.
019	I'm very interested in the artistic value of this coin; I’ve always wanted to see one for myself.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0008
020	And that's why you came all the way here?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0003
021	Exactly. Like a romantic hero, I traveled across the world to obtain this one, tiny treasure!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0005
022	Romantic...hero? Okay, then. You certainly are unique.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
023	Really? Well, the feeling is mutual. I certainly have no interest in laying down my life for anyone else.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0025
024	I-I...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0012
025	Everyone is different, I suppose.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0010
026	Hah! This trip has exceeded all of my expectations! I managed to get what I came here for, and even had the opportunity to meet the fabled Night Fox.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
027	How wonderful for you. I will admit that you were not what I expected, either.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
028	It's certainly admirable that you want to protect your teacher's legacy, but be careful not to let it hold you back.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0005
029	It's best to be yourself, whatever that means. Don't let your hands get tied before you come into your own as a thief.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0010
030	Be myself... That's good advice.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
031	Well, now that my business in Wadatsumi is done, I suppose it’s back to my world travels.
032	Isn't it wonderful that both of us were able to get what we wanted tonight? I look forward to meeting you again out on the road somewhere!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0008
033	There he goes... I guess there are lots of different kinds of thieves out there. Out on the road... Hmm...
034	Tsuru... What do you think? Do you think there might be need for the Night Fox outside of Wadatsumi?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0002
035	I bet my teacher would be proud of me if I made people all over the world happy!
036	I might even get to meet Chat Noir again. That might not be so bad.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
037	Let's do it, Tsuru! After we return this money, let's go explore the world!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
