001	I wonder where the Gluttony troops are right now.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	According to Mocca, there's a high possibility they're stationed at Port Nahema. It's quite a distance from the Forest of Rukifojio.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
003	How does Mocca know that?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
004	All trade with other countries is carried out through Port Nahema.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
005	In other words, it would make the most sense for the Gluttony troops to be there.
006	Also, Port Nahema is in the territory of the Tehre. It's Saga's base for trade where people from various countries and tribes come and go.
007	I see. Since they're merchants, they use the port as a base for their trade. But that almost seems like they're cooperating with Gluttony.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
008	I still don't understand the relationship between Gluttony and the Tehre faction.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
009	However, we are much closer to the Water Temple than they are. On top of that, I know this area like the back of my hand.
010	We can't afford any further delay against the Gluttony army. I'm going to do everything I can to change that future.
011	Yes. I wonder if Voda will listen properly to what we have to say.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
012	Voda is a calm and generous individual. She is not someone who would discard what we have to say for no reason. I'm sure it'll be okay.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
013	You're probably right!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0038
014	It's strange. I never knew such feelings existed within me.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
015	What's the matter, Tina?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
016	Mocca is a strange man...and he's strong.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
017	What are you talking about?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
018	I've never thought about all of Saga before.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
019	More to the point, I never thought of joining hands with those from other factions.
020	Even as chief...I thought it was normal to only think of the Toxotes tribe.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
021	That's completely understandable. I wouldn't suddenly start thinking about all of Lustburg either.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
022	Even as the blight within Mocca's body continues to grow, he thinks first about Saga.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
023	Besides, when Mocca says something...no matter how difficult it may sound, I feel myself wanting to overcome any obstacles that stand in our way.
024	It's like I feel a natural surge of courage.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
025	I think the only person I've relied on like this in the past...was my father.
026	Huh?! Wait...are you saying you have feelings for him?! Are you in love?! Eeeek!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
027	What...?! That's not what I meant!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
028	Tina, you're blushing!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
029	It's true that sometimes we can do our best because there's someone we're in love with. It was the same with me.
030	(Dias...I wonder if he's doing well.)
031	Yes...that's why you don't have to feel embarrassed, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
032	...! I told you that's not the case!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0050
033	Ahaha! You're so adorable, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0008
034	Enough with this idle talk! Let's hurry on ahead!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
035	Tina! Behind you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
036	!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
037	Glurrr...urrp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_b
038	We're surrounded! And such numbers... How have the Jam infiltrated so deep within the forest?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
039	Ack! We can't afford to be wasting time here!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
040	Here they come, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
041	Out of our way! I am determined to protect Voda...and the future of Saga!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
042	We're pressing onward! Hold on, Mocca! I promise to bring you Voda!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
