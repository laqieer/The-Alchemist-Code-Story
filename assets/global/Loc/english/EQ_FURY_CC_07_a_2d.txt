001	A story I had long forgotten. A tale from our youth about a sin that required atonement, of the mistake made by a powerless girl and a girl who knew not of power.
002	It had been a day like any other. The war continued to rage on the island, and the two of us were sooty from its fires, fleeing for our lives.
003	I don't want to die!
004	Young Ikasa was much more afraid of pain than she would be in her later years. Her wounds were very deep, and I didn't know what to do.
005	It hurts, Button! It hurts so bad! Make it stop! I'm so scared! I don't want to die!
006	H-hold my hand! Just squeeze my hand, okay?
007	Deep in the forest, where the spirits of Wadatsumi were enshrined, amidst curls of smoke and raging fires, I sat by her side and fervently prayed.
008	Hang in there! You can't die—you can't!
009	You've just gotta say the magic words!
010	It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine!
011	Those are the magic words! Just say them! It doesn't hurt!
012	I...remember.
013	It was all my fault, Ikasa.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
014	My little spell became your curse!
015	That's why you didn't leave me.
016	That's why only I could kill you.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
017	Would you be so kind as to tell my fortune?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
018	Certainly.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0037
019	Ahh, how exciting!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
020	Yes, I see it. The message I have for you is as clear as day. "I will never in this lifetime read your fortune."	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
021	Well, that's rude.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
022	Thank you for coming to my little shop. I hope you enjoyed your stay.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
023	This won't do. How can one enjoy the occult without mood? Without atmosphere?
024	Thank you for coming. I was happy to serve you. The door is right over there.
025	I am concerned about the future.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
026	So you believe fortune-telling is all about finding out what is to come?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
027	Is it not?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
028	I trace the threads of fate from your past. I sift through forgotten elements of what came before.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0002
029	Now, are you really willing to show me all of that?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
030	Well...
031	You never talk about your past, Drei. Nor have you ever been willing to discuss your outlook on the present or future.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0003
032	You do not speak lies, but we both know that you are always lying by omission.
033	Now, I don't mind a mysterious man who won't share his past, but I won't let him into my bed.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
034	How titillating.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
035	I'm good at that.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
036	However, to be clear, I am not here to ask about myself.
037	Oh? A lover, then?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0004
038	For the past several years since its collapse at the hands of Greed Dike, Wadatsumi has been in a temporary state of peace.
039	Now a shrine maiden who escaped that chaos has wandered into Lost Blue.
040	I've heard about her. Nothing good, though.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
041	A demonic occultist who curses and murders all those who approach her.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
042	How awful.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
043	She is planning to climb the Mystic Tower Veda alone. Did you know that?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0006
044	Sol would know about her by now, then.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
045	Yes, yes, yes! That's exactly the point.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
046	So it is her future that you are concerned for?
047	Not hers, but the Templars'.
048	Really? How sweet.
049	This girl will likely be invited to join our ranks in the near future. However...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
050	What sustenance can a faded flower provide?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
051	I see.
052	You're talking about the time when she was...blossoming.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
053	Don't make me remember! Let me forget!
054	You have done well to climb to this point.
055	My head is going to burst! I can't take it! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!
056	I will give you power.
057	Just let me forget! Take it away! I just want to forget!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0020
058	Once you have offered up your voice to me.
059	Won't you let me forget?
060	All the dead, all those who I killed. All those who died, and all those who came to kill me.
061	All of my foolish dreams, my illusions of peace. My naive ideals, my escapist fancies of forgiveness.
062	All of those beautiful landscapes—the seas, the skies, the flowers—and the smiles I saw along the way. All of you, and all of me as I was.
063	Just let me forget! I want to forget!
064	Why do you suffer so?
065	Surely such a price is a small thing to pay for power. Besides, it is already done.
066	Your oblivion is mine.
067	...
068	The fifth...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
069	I was robbed of my ability to forget.
070	But Wadatsumi is gone.
071	I was unable to forget a single moment of my past.
072	Sh-she put a spell on me!
073	She made me feel all icky!
074	Yeah! It was gross!
075	All of the memories I had wanted so desperately to forget resurfaced. They played out in my mind in perfect detail—and would continue to do so for all eternity.
076	K-kill her! Kill her before she kills us! Kill the traitorous heretic!
077	Kill her! Slit her throat!
078	All of the hatred I had experienced, all of my sins, my pain, my stupidity...all of the tragedies I had witnessed...
079	The knight with her cannot be killed! The shrine maiden has enslaved a departed soul! It is blasphemy!
080	Get her! Hunt her down!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
081	It was as if it was all occurring again, in a single moment, right before my eyes.
082	Everyone has it within themselves to forgive! I'm sure we can all make peace! You're good people! I believe in you! Nothing is beyond your understanding—not Wadatsumi, or magic!
083	And we... Wadatsumi truly didn't know that Alchemy was forbidden!
084	So you see? No one has done anything wrong!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
085	Like the illusions I could perform with my magic rites, these visions mingled seamlessly with my reality.
086	Our journey's over, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0028
087	My family's rotting corpses.
088	They had been strung up cruelly, left to die horrible, painful deaths. All in the name of retribution for their use of forbidden arts.
089	They were unrecognizable piles of skin and bone. Black birds circled overhead, eyeing their remains, while flies swarmed them, and maggots writhed on their rancid flesh.
090	Father! Mother! Granny!
091	I took them in my arms, and my ears were filled with a horrible wriggling and buzzing.
092	No... This can't... Aaaaahhh!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
093	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!
094	Rejection. Contempt. Prejudice. Betrayal. Panic. Neglect. Ignorance. Abandonment. Blame. Vilification. Anger. Assassins. Lies. Disapproval. Madness. Flies. Corpses. Maggots. Blood. Writhing. Buzzing.
095	I'm sorry for scaring you. I'm sorry for making you suffer. I'm sorry for making you cry.
096	I'm sorry for killing you. I'm sorry for hurting you. I'll kill you properly. I'll do my best to help you die. Please die in peace. Please don't scream.
097	Please, just...
098	Just...end it. Please.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
099	Ikasa! Ikasa! Ikasa! Where have you gone?!
100	It's...all my fault. I cursed you. I couldn't save you.
101	Where are you? Where are you, Ikasa?
102	I have too many memories! I'm buried beneath them and I can't find you! I can't see you!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0020
103	Where are you?
104	Wh-what's this?!
105	The top.
106	I will never forget that sight.
107	World's end...
108	Where I can look down on everything...on the whole wide world.
109	You're supreme ruler of the castle up here, Button.
110	Ikasa...
111	"They call me the Obliviated. No matter how many times I die, I always come right back. You get where I'm going with this, right?"
112	I can search for you here. My memories of you are here, Ikasa.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
113	I can remember you from here.
114	When I'm afraid and in pain and I feel like I'm going to die...
115	When I need you, I can...!
116	Unforgivable savagery!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0040
117	Ngh!
118	She was trying to call a disaster down upon us from the top of that mountain!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
119	Down with Wadatsumi, the filthy traitors!
120	Kill her! Get her! Slit her throat!
121	Umm...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
122	Such outrageous folly!
123	Get her! Hunt her down!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
124	Wadatsumi's shrine maidens are the root of all evil!
125	Do you think you could...
126	Justice was—and remains—ours!
127	We will bring down the evil shrine maiden. For justice!
128	...shut up for a second?
129	Urgh!
130	Bow your heads! Keep your eyes in front!
131	Aargh!
132	Oh, Ikasa... My memories are so loud.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0022
133	The more I kill, the stronger my rites become. Isn't that what you told me?
134	"When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people."
135	Listen to the people. Listen to them scream in the throes of death.
136	"I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences."
137	Let's all join hands. We'll link all the corpses together and perform a curse of rebirth.
138	"I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences."
139	Let's create a world from the corpses of the people who spout justice. Pile them high and flat.
140	Urk!
141	That is how we will achieve true peace!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0010
142	For are we not all one?
143	Ikasa. This time I will be the one who sets out into the rain to find you.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
144	And this time...I will be sure to ask you that question.
145	"What about me?"
146	Hm? What about you?
147	"Don't you have something to say to me?"
148	When I'm afraid and in pain and I feel like I'm going to die...
149	Will you please shake my hand?
