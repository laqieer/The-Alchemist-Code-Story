001	Ridiculous pests. We don't have the time to spare on them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
002	It won't take much time deal with this nuisance, Lord Zahar. Don't fret. We'll handle this and move on, as we always do.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
003	That's true.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
004	(Zahar... He's so anxious...)
005	(We still don't have the items we need, nor do we have the strength we thought we'd have by now.)
006	(There's just too much we're lacking to make his wish come true.)	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
007	(That fact casts a cloud over my heart, making my soul tremble.)
008	Grr... Graaahhhhhhh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
009	Zahar!
010	(With absolute power, he snuffed out that foolish man's life. Zahar had truly become the King of Darkness.)
011	(That sight was no fairy tale... It was real... And his imposing majesty showed me a dream I had never dared to have before.)
012	(He made me see the possibility of a world without oppressors or oppressed. A world where all people could stand on equal footing. I saw the figure of the savior that would bring that world to reality.)
013	M-mister Cleric, where are you taking us? What are you going to do to us?
014	There is nothing to fear, children. You're headed somewhere wonderful. You'll have a nice, hot meal and a warm bed waiting for you there!
015	Is that not wonderful? You're going to be happy there. And I'll be getting... Heh!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0007
016	You scum.
017	Ngh... Agh...?!	VO_mafia.mafia_battle_0021
018	You people drenched in your own selfish greed disgust me. I cannot stand the thought of breathing the same air as you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
019	Cleric?! You! How could you?!
020	Get the children in the carriage! Don't let them escape!
021	So you're all in on it...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
022	Ugh...?!
023	Aghh!
024	Get over here! Stop squirming!
025	No! Let me go!
026	Shut up and do as I say!
027	Aagh!
028	Get on your knees, dark elf. I'll take it myself.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
029	Ngh...!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0019
030	Grrr...! Aaaagh! Grrraaaaaaagh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
031	I will annihilate all those who dare oppress another.
032	A-ack! N-no, please...!
033	Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!
034	Every. Single. One.
035	P-please, wait...! No!
036	Are you hurt? Everything is all right now.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0003
037	U-uh... Huh?
038	There you go. You're free now.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
039	Uh...
040	You arrogant, selfish scum! What makes you think you deserve to be where you are?!
041	(This king walks a path of darkness.)
042	(He will rid the world of the false light that envelops it and the debauchery it calls justice.)
043	(He will usher in a new world order where none will be shackled by poverty or wealth.)
044	The moon that engulfs the darkness shall become our king. Here and now, our salvation, our wish shall—
045	...
046	Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
047	The world must change. We have to eradicate this world of these damn sadists. All of them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
048	...
049	Here. A piece of stained glass.
050	It was part of a window on this building. It was beautifully designed, and I broke it.
051	It's so beautiful.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
052	...
053	(Creation founded by destruction. The great destroyer.)
054	(There is no doubting his strength. As long as his will remains true and steadfast.)
055	(As long as... As long as everything comes together, our dream will be realized.)
056	Until then, I will...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0010
057	What was that, Letitia?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
058	Nothing. We're almost there, Lord Zahar.
059	Right. Once we make it through here...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
060	(Zahar does not change. He can destroy even my concerns and fears before they get their claws in me.)
061	Ah, there you are, Zahar.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
062	Corpse!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
063	None shall hinder our path! You are a pest that must be dealt with. This is where you die!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
064	Hmph! I'd love to see you try! Letitia!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
065	I'm with you, Lord Zahar!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
