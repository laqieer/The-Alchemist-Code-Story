001	What's the situation? Is there any word from Kamui?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0002
002	Nothing yet.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
003	What is going on down there, Kamui? At this rate, we'll be running out of ammunition soon!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
004	Wait, what is that?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	What? What do you see?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0006
006	The Jam! Flooding out of that tree!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0029
007	Were all the Jam lying dormant in that tree this whole time?!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0021
008	No, they are multiplying!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
009	Multiplying? At that ridiculous rate?!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0012
010	We'd need ten times the supply we originally had to deal with all the Jam!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0042
011	If they continue to multiply...we'll be doomed!
012	When Saga was nearly overwhelmed by the Jam, they were multiplying much like that.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
013	So...if the same thing is happening here as well...
014	You don't mean... Kamui failed?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0021
015	I don't know, but we should get away from here as soon as possible.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
016	We don't have any means of standing our ground against those numbers. We need to get some distance between us while we can—before they turn their attention toward us!
017	Too late. I think they're looking this way...	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0025
018	P-prepare for battle!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0012
019	Adelbert?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
020	There's no time! If we attempt a retreat now, we'll just be engulfed from the rear!	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0029
021	Fine! We'll have to slow them somehow with what drying agent we have left! Gather what we rationed out to the troops as well!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
022	Aw man, I knew this was gonna suck.
023	Kamui, Logi... Please be okay!
024	Agh! There's no end to this!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
025	Only deal with the ones directly in your path! Forget the others!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
026	Right!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
