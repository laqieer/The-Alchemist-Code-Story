001	Voda's death...under the Gluttony army...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
002	Yes. It is of the utmost urgency that you prepare reinforcements.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
003	Hyahaha... Are you telling me I should spur my own faction into action over something so unreliable as foresight?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
004	How absurd! Stand down, Mocca.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0011
005	It's far from unreliable! Tina, the 45th chief of Toxotes, was given this power as a gift from Asena.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
006	Toxotes, huh? One who belongs to Voda cannot know the validity of a power that was gifted to one by Asena.
007	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
008	Don't you understand that, if I were to send reinforcements without a formal request, it would cause the balance between the three factions to collapse?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
009	But...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
010	With the power of the wind now absent, we cannot risk any further collapse in the balance.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
011	Any confusion within Saga would play right into the Gluttony army's hands.
012	I won't say that I comprehend the motive of the Gluttony army...but Voda will be fine.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
013	You're far too young to be worrying about the Sprite Trio!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0014
014	So...if a formal request for reinforcements were to be made by Voda...would you respond?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
015	...Hyahahahahah! Are you saying that old fox would ask for my help? Impossible! That's absurd!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0023
016	Tina has gone to Voda and is supposed to bring her here. If she succeeds, please respond to her request.
017	There will be no need for a response from me. The earth will rise and the heavens will crumble before Voda asks for my help.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0050
018	Were I in her situation, I, too, would request that woman's help.
019	Such a debt would cause the very balance of this land to collapse.
020	How can you speak of balance?! You were the one who caused the balance of this land to collapse in the first place!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0013
021	...What did you say?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
022	You are the one responsible for killing the Wind Sprite Alia, destroying the people of Alize, and eradicating the power of the wind!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
023	...I will not forgive any further insolence.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
024	I merely speak the truth!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0010
025	You have no right to speak to me in such a manner! Watch your tongue, you little brat.	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0013
026	I am a descendant of the very people you destroyed!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
027	Why did you raise us? What are your motives?!
028	I owe you no explanation.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0016
029	...Even if that were true, it doesn't change the fact that you destroyed Alia and robbed the Alize of their land.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
030	You, the great Fuu, valued your own interests over the peace of Saga.
031	I'm certain you know that's what they say of you in secret!
032	While traversing the various lands, I heard such talk over and over again!
033	Let the ignorant say what they like! It was all done for the sake of Saga!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
034	But we are all ignorant...even those of the Fuu faction! That doesn't make sense!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
035	Or did you, in fact, destroy Alia...and the people of Alize...in order to serve your own interests?!
036	Silence, you little brat! Speak any further and I'll separate your neck from your torso!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0013
037	Do you intend to sever Alia's bloodline again, Fuu boy?	VO_voda.voda_chara_1002
038	...Voda! What are you doing here?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
039	I'd like to hear a little more about that as well. I've long been puzzled by why you did such a thing.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
040	Now is the time for all of Saga to overcome our past and unite. For this reason I, the Water Sprite Voda, have paid you a visit.
041	Come now, boy! How about you tell me exactly what happened back then!
