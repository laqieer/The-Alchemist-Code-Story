001	Fjrrreeeeee?!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
002	Did it work?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
003	Kamui! It worked! We were so in sync!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0009
004	Yeah, somehow...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
005	(But it certainly wasn't easy. To think that my duty as a Sephira to purify corruption could be so difficult...)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
006	It seems that I still have much to learn...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
007	Heheh...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
008	Malta?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
009	What do you think? If you ever have any trouble again, just remember that you've got me to help you like I did today!
010	No, that won't happen. I'm going to get strong, strong enough to protect everyone.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
011	Kamui... You don't have to shoulder everything on your own, you know—	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
012	Malta!
013	Kamui!
014	That's...Hisham and Isidore? Why are they...
015	I was so worried, so I snuck out!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
016	Yeah!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0008
017	Hehe. If father finds out, he's going to be so mad at both of you.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
018	Uh, if you could get him to let us off the hook...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
019	Well, what do you think we should do, Kamui?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
020	K-Kamui?! I'm sorry I couldn't just sit quietly and wait at home!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0026
021	I was just super worried about both of you!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0011
022	I beg you, Kamui! Please help an old pal out!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
023	Hmmm.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
024	Let's discuss this when we get back to the village.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
025	(That's right, I'm going to get stronger. I have to.)
026	(That's the only way to protect the happy, peaceful life I have with my friends and family.)	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
