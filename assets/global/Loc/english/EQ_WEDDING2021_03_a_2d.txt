001	Ugh! There are so many monsters on this path. Chihaya, help me out! Let's get these creeps!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0013
002	I have an idea! I can use my dance to stifle the monsters' movements.
003	Hah!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0007
004	Thank you! Okay, let's finish them all at once. Woohoo!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0033
005	?
006	Is the effect of the dance wearing off!?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
007	(I wonder if being distracted by things is affecting my dance's power...)
008	If that's the case, I'll try one more--!
009	Gyaaah!
010	Oh no!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
011	Chihaya! Watch out!
012	Hiyah!	VO_shayna.shayna_battle_0025
013	Shayna!
014	We've already come this far! Time to wrap this up! Haaah!	VO_shayna.shayna_battle_0013
015	Pfew... Somehow that worked out. Chihaya, are you okay?
016	I'm... I'm fine.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0004
017	But it's because of me that you're hurt... I'm so sorry.
018	Don't give it a second thought! It's just a flesh wound!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0006
019	But...
020	Don't worry. You can't let the fear of getting hurt keep you from fighting, right?
021	Besides, I can think of this wound as a badge earned for protecting you. Nice, right?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
022	Oh! You really are strong.
023	Hehe! Thanks!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0033
024	Anyway, are you okay? Do you feel unwell?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0001
025	Why do you ask that?
026	It's just that your dancing was so different than usual.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
027	Normally, it's wondrous in how you seem in total control down to your fingertips. Something seemed to be missing this time.
028	...
029	I...I'm sorry! I didn't mean to be rude.	VO_shayna.shayna_battle_0020
030	You weren't. It's nothing like that. As expected, the eyes of a trained warrior cannot be deceived.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0030
031	You're correct. My movements lack their usual finesse. I think I've been distracted by many unimportant things.
032	I'm truly sorry for the trouble I've caused as a result.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0021
033	You have seemed a little off ever since talking about the fair.
034	Could there be something about weddings that upsets you?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0006
035	...
036	You said that marriage was the road to a happy life. The beginning of a happy life for two who love each other.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0003
037	Y-Yes, I remember saying something like that.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0006
038	I'm not so sure that's true.
039	The dance I performed at a wedding was more for uniting houses than the happiness of lovers.
040	Of course, I do not believe that all marriages are unhappy, but...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
041	I can never forget the look of sadness and resignation I saw in the eyes of a bride when I performed at her wedding.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
042	I danced my heart out in prayer for everyone's joy. It was meant to strengthen the bond of the couple.
043	But I'm not certain that's what she was hoping for.
044	Yet that sort of thinking is fruitless. That's just how marriage in Wadatsumi is.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0030
045	At least, that was what I saw, so I continued to dance wishing for the couple's happiness.
046	But seeing everyone dedicate themselves for the happiness of others at the fair, I couldn't help but wonder...
047	Maybe it isn't always best to work hard for others' happiness, and... But I shouldn't think like that.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0018
048	Chihaya...
049	It was the same as when I wished for the recovery of Wadatsumi.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
050	I performed my dance as best I could to bless the hearts of the people of Wadatsumi.
051	I'm overjoyed to see the smiles on the happy faces of those who've come from all over to see the dance.
052	But I do not think it likely that my actions were best for Wadatsumi.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0021
053	...
054	But the people of Wadatsumi smiled when they saw you dance, right?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
055	Isn't that pretty great?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0001
056	Huh?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
057	Various things occurred to me thinking how I like to make fans smile, like how hard it is to get everyone to smile.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
058	But you did that by pouring your feelings of wanting to make everyone happy into your dance.
059	...
060	There are many different situations, but you wanted to cheer people up and were able to make them smile.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_1050
061	Your dancing is amazing!
062	Shayna... Thank you.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0033
063	I was just thinking... Don't you think we're a lot alike?
064	You mean us? Me and you?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0006
065	Yes! You did do your best to make others happy, correct?	VO_shayna.shayna_chara_1001
066	I also want to do whatever I can to make my fans happy... Yes! We're definitely the same!
067	W-Well, I... I don't think I'm strong like you are.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0022
068	Besides, what I did was--
069	Stop! What are you doing!?
070	!
071	That voice... Did it come from that studio up ahead!?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0019
072	Oh no! It looks to be under attack! We have to go help!
