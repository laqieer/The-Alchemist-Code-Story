001	According to our intel, Selim is waiting in the shrine's northeast sector. Toritoh, which way should we go?	VO_roy.roy_sys_0001
002	This way! Trust me, I was raised in that area.
003	She's right! I can sense Amestrian alchemy in that direction!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0004
004	Ughh! The pain... It feels like my chest is being hollowed out...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0022
005	That is the pain from the soul being torn away. Seems the people of this world can feel that as well. I thought of these beings as inferior. How interesting...	VO_pride.pride_sys_0023
006	Selim!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0027
007	Prepare yourselves, invaders!
008	This is our glorious leader you see before you!
009	Bow before the great Selim!
010	Listen to me! There is nothing glorious about him! He's the real invader, and he's just using you! He used all of us!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0015
011	It's too late. You can't reach them anymore. They've made their decision to follow me, like lambs to the slaughter.	VO_pride.pride_sys_0030
012	I have them, and the Dimensional Gate, in the palm of my hand!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0010
013	Wha... No! This is—	VO_roy.roy_battle_0022
014	It can't be! Is that...Amestris?!	VO_riza.riza_sys_0029
015	Urghhh... It hurts!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0018
016	Stop! If you open the Gate any further...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
017	Scream, human! Appreciate how wonderful it is to have first-row seats to the destruction of not just one, but two worlds!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0007
018	We're taking the Order down one member at a time, but—	VO_roy.roy_battle_0019
019	This is taking too long! At this rate, we won't reach Pride in time!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
020	You have some gall to even try! Come now, my sacrifice... Open the Gate!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0010
021	Urghhh...!!!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0043
022	Toritoh!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0023
023	Th-the Gate is opening...! Amestris is getting closer!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0029
024	So many bright lights... Are those...the souls of the people of Amestris?	VO_riza.riza_sys_0027
025	Haha... Hahahahahaha!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0008
026	Quit laughing, you third-rate villain!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0017
027	Ngh?! Wh-what?! My Phantoms...were transmuted?!	VO_pride.pride_battle_0025
028	Ignoring me and attacking my little brother? Disgusting. You'll never rise above third-rate like this!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0012
029	Edward Elric?! The Fullmetal Alchemist?!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0020
030	Ed!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0026
031	Al! Oh, hey! The Colonel's here, too...and the Lieutenant!
032	I don't really get what's going on, but I'm going to take you down, Selim!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0016
033	He jumped through the Dimensional Gate on his own, without even knowing what was on the other side?	VO_pride.pride_sys_0021
034	He's even forced the Holy Order to completely break ranks! This is ridiculous! If this continues...	VO_pride.pride_sys_0027
035	If I could just open the Gate...
036	Why won't it open any further?! My transmutation circle should have absorbed all of the souls by now.	VO_pride.pride_sys_0027
037	N-ngh...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0022
038	Hm... I thought I had already taken your soul.	VO_pride.pride_battle_0019
039	But you had other plans, I see. You're using your position as a sacrifice to defy me?!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0012
040	You think your human determination can match the strength of the Dimensional Gate?!
041	Don't underestimate me. I won't let you take my soul! There are still a thousand things I have left to do in this world!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
042	Impertinent human!	VO_pride.pride_sys_0019
043	This is our only chance! Hey, Shor—I mean...Blondie! Edward! Ed! Hey, you!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
044	I'm also Ed! The name's Edgar L. Leonhart! Your brother, Alphonse, is a good friend of mine. Could you help us out here?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
045	Yeah? Thanks for looking after Al for me. I don't hate the idea of two Eds, either. Let's do this!	VO_edo.edo_sys_0033
046	Let's take that Selim brat down!	VO_edo.edo_battle_0015
