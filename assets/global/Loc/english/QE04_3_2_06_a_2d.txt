001	Ack... The Jam's corruption has reached as far as Asena's fountain. I wonder if Asena is safe...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	Is this the place?! What a beautiful fountain... I've heard the stories, but I never expected it to be this beautiful!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0046
003	O great Godwolf—
004	As thou forgiveth the corruption that spreads through this world, offer thy claws, hide thy fangs...and appear before us now!
005	......
006	Asena...!
007	Pleased to meet you. I never expected you to be so divine... What's the matter, Tina?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0024
008	Nothing...it's just that something appears to be different from the last ritual. Something appears to wrong...but what is it?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
009	What the...?! What's happening?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
010	Ack...! Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
011	Tina...stay close to me!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
012	What is...the meaning of this?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
013	Tina...my beloved daughter...it's been a while. Have you been well?	VO_adne.adne_favorite_1009
014	Fa-father...?! Why...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
015	...Have you lost weight? You must be pushing yourself too hard. Ever since you were small, you always tried to shoulder too much.	VO_adne.adne_sys_1023
016	Come over here. Let me hear your voice. Come now!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0011
017	...Father!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
018	I'm back now, so it's okay. I'm so proud of you for coming this far. You don't need to shoulder everything anymore.	VO_adne.adne_sys_1047
019	You're still young...and you have your responsibility as chief...
020	Try to take it easier. What you need, right now, is to find peace in your heart.
021	Let us, once again, coexist with the nature of Saga. Let us live peacefully with our tribe. Now, come to me.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_1009
022	Yes...! Father...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
023	Wait, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0015
024	What are you doing?! That warmth...it's my father! My father came to see me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
025	No...Chief Adone is...already...Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
026	I'm coming to you now...father.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
027	Even if you walk away...I am sure someone else will handle this task. Now...it is time for you to rest!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0037
028	?! ...Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
029	Ack...?! Hey! Wake up, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
030	It's impossible for you to shoulder all of Saga on your own!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0010
031	...Huh? Father...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
032	Leave the future of Saga to someone else...and let us rest now, Tina!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0011
033	...No. My father would never say "it's impossible" or "leave the future of Saga to someone else!"	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
034	...Hyaaaahhh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
035	Tina!!!
036	That was not...what my father wanted! My father entrusted the future of Saga to us... That's why...that's why I...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
037	I will overcome everything that stands in my way in order to fulfill his wish! ...Reveal yourself! I will not have you insult the memory of my father any further!
