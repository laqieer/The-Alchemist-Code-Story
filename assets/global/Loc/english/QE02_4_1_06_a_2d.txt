001	It deflected my attack?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0024
002	Careful! Behind you!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
003	Ack...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
004	I was in a complete blind spot, but it still managed to deflect my attack. Is it predicting my movements?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
005	I'm impressed you anticipated its attack. I truly regret having to take you out.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0024
006	How about it? It's still not too late. Will you join me?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0044
007	Don't make me repeat myself!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0040
008	Watch out!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0042
009	Agh?! Agaah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0027
010	You shouldn't underestimate me.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
011	The Alkaroids we have created accumulate past experiences that are reflected in their current actions. Step by step, they evolve.
012	Agh... E-evolving?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0021
013	Yes. And it's not limited to individual droids.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
014	By sharing information...all Alkaroids can evolve without personally gaining experience.
015	Sharing information?! Wait, are you talking about the Messiah?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
016	Hmph. It appears you finally understand.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
017	Are you telling me that you completed that horrifying research?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0022
018	You created an extreme form of artificial intelligence that allows countless machines to sync together?!
019	Agh! I-I don't really get what's going on...but it seems like it'll be troublesome to let this drag on.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
020	...!
021	I'm gonna finish this here and now. Let's talk after!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0012
