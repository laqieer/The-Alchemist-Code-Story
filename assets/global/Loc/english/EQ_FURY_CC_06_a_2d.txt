001	Prayer didn't help. The magic words were ineffective. I was powerless.
002	Yet somehow, even then, I continued to pray for peace.
003	Wadatsumi was obliterated by Greed Dike in a single night.
004	Shortly thereafter, every single shrine maiden and citizen of Wadatsumi who had escaped to the continent was captured and summarily executed.
005	The few remaining resistance forces in Wadatsumi had called for peace and amity, but were refused, and so had attempted to flee.
006	I remain in Wadatsumi even now. I still believe in a future where we will be able to join hands with our Greed Dike invaders. I still fantasize about the idea of an absolute justice...
007	Despite knowing that it is a sham.
008	Wish I could've had a proper bath.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
009	It's too cold to be bathing in rivers right now.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
010	Hm.
011	You're not peeking, are you?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0002
012	No.
013	Tomorrow's the day when everything comes to an end, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
014	Yes.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
015	Tomorrow, we'll be executing our plan to wipe out Greed Dike.
016	They're an enemy who will not try to listen no matter what we say.
017	So we have to fight.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
018	I...
019	Yeah?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
020	I just wanted to cast a spell of happiness on the world.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
021	No matter the crime, there would be forgiveness. They would have a chance at being saved.
022	I thought that it would mean peace. We could join hands, forget our hatred, and understand one another.
023	I was a child. I didn't know darkness. I was naively cheerful. An artless, common fool.
024	But that was your idea of true peace.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0003
025	Ikasa...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
026	Yeah?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
027	Can I join you in the river?
028	Button...
029	I'm afraid of dying.
030	Button. Hey. Look at me.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
031	Yes...?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
032	...
033	Don't come any closer.
034	Y-you're...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
035	I will never forget that sight.
036	Ikasa's body was...broken.
037	Her skin had turned a ghastly color, and her wounds remained unchanged.
038	Her fallen skin clung to her in twisted lumps. Her broken bones jutted out grotesquely, resetting themselves at awkward angles.
039	Pretty horrible, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
040	This is why I only show the skin on my face, but even then I've gotta put makeup on to look...normal.
041	Wh-why?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0021
042	I can't lift my sword too well anymore.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
043	But I'm okay. It doesn't hurt or anything.
044	There's only one right answer.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
045	A way to survive?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
046	A way to kill them off.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
047	Wh-what?!
048	And your magic rites are going to make it happen.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0003
049	I-I can't. It's not enough. My magic can't stand up to the armies of Greed Dike!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
050	You once told me that your magic rites impact your vision, hearing, and sense of touch.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
051	That when you master them, you'll lose even your sense of pain and reality.
052	That you can use your memories to make illusions feel real. To materialize them.
053	Yes, but...my talents aren't fully developed. That's why I went on that study trip to begin with.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
054	Your prayer will make it real. Your rites require fuel in the form of a concrete image.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
055	That's why you had to see the world. The more you saw and heard, the more you would be able to do, and at a higher quality.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
056	The number of your experiences is directly linked to the strength of your rites.
057	You mean...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
058	This time, you're going to pray for death.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
059	I-I...
060	In order to do that, you're going to need to experience more death. The greater the number of deaths you observe, the more powerful your rites will become.
061	Wh-what?! O-observe...death? I don't... I-I don't understand!
062	To be blunt...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
063	The more you kill, the stronger you'll get.
064	No...!
065	They call me the Obliviated. No matter how many times I die, I always come right back. You get where I'm going with this, right?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
066	Wh-what? I-Ikasa... No! I... I can't!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
067	Help me die.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
068	Kill me. Over, and over, and over again.
069	N-no! I-I...!
070	Lady Button.
071	What are you all doing here? I-I thought you were resting.
072	We want you to use us as well. Use our deaths to empower your rites.
073	Wh-what?!
074	The wounded can no longer fight. If we are doomed to die, we would much rather it be as part of a rite for peace than at the hands of our enemy.
075	Th-this is insane!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0027
076	Y-you're asking me to k-kill...everyone?! To survive alone? How... How is that in any way the right answer?!
077	How is that peace?!
078	Come morning, all of us here—the people of Wadatsumi, the soldiers, even you and me, Button—will be destroyed by the fires of war.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
079	We have no choice but to wait for death, but there is hope for your survival.
080	Ungh...nnghh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
081	I'll be right here by your side—and so will they.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
082	Y-you're all going to...to disappear!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0020
083	The more you kill, the stronger you'll get.
084	You're going to live.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0003
085	Let us die for that.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
