001	Yes! We destroyed the Rayvner! Rena! This world is back to normal!
002	Thank you for defeating the Rayvner.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0007
003	Huh? Rena? Where are you?
004	Thank you...goodbye.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0033
005	What...?
006	Huh? Was I just talking to someone?
007	Mm? Uhh... What was I doing?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
008	Oh, Chloe and <p_name>! Where's the Rayvner?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
009	We've already defeated it.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
010	Huh? I see...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
011	What?! When?! Hey! It's not fair! You two got to have all the fun!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0046
012	But, the world was saved, so I guess all is well that ends well.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0008
013	I guess.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0007
014	It seems like it's time to say farewell.
015	Mm... I feel a little sad. Well, we've only known each other for a short time, but I had fun!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0011
016	I don't know if we'll meet again...but I won't forget any of you!
017	I won't forget you either. Take care.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0004
018	Be well, everyone. I won't forget any of you either!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
019	Oh. It seems like we'll be able to get back to our own world soon as well.
020	Yes, but...
021	Are you not happy?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
022	It's not that. I feel like I'm forgetting something important.
023	Really? Nothing like that comes to mind.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
024	Well...as long as it's just my imagination.
025	I guess this is goodbye. I won't forget you, <p_name>. Be well.
026	You too...Chloe.
027	Thanks!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
028	(What is it? Something is bothering me.)
029	(I can't remember.)
030	(But something is strange.. It's as though someone is missing...)
031	(Who?)
