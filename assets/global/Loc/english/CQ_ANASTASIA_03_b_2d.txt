001	Scatter, you vermin!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0012
002	Strange. There are too few...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0017
003	Lady Anastasia!
004	Are there reinforcements?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0005
005	Indeed! The rear troops are under attack and require assistance!
006	I'll head there immediately. I can't afford for us to lose any more troops.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0038
007	The amount of enemy troops here... I guess these aren't reinforcements, but the main army.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0045
008	I'll scatter all of you! Hyaaah!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0011
009	Watch out! Behind you!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0028
010	?!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0027
011	Aghh!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0027
012	Idiot! Why did you defend me?! I told you, didn't I? Getting hurt is part of my job!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0020
013	I'm...sorry.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_battle_0021
014	Fung Liu!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0021
015	Look what you've done. I'll avenge my comrade's death by spilling your blood across the battlefield!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0013
016	U-um... Sorry to bother you when you're getting worked up, but...I'm all right.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
017	What? Bu-but that wound...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0026
018	Oh, of course...it would be fatal in most cases, but...I'm a zombie.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0050
019	Huh? Anyway, tell me about it after I take out all the enemies around here. You better not die before that.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0003
020	I see. So you're moving even though you're already dead.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0018
021	I'm sorry I didn't explain it better.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0035
022	I'd like to say that's impossible, but having seen the way that you are...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
023	Long ago, I was also created to fight.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
024	But...with all the time that's passed, I've learned many different things.
025	Things such as small moments of happiness and friends that will stand by your side.
026	I don't enjoy hurting others, but I've decided to fight for the things that are important to me.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
027	Ultimately, it works to my own benefit.
028	... ...
029	Fighting in order to protect something allows me to unleash the most strength.
030	That's foolish. It's all pointless if it causes you to die like you just did.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0018
031	Don't worry. After all, I can't die.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0039
032	That's not very funny. ...Heheh.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0011
033	I...wasn't trying to be.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
034	Of course. My apologies. You may be right.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0035
035	I feel like my means and purposes seem to have reversed.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0030
036	I should be fighting in order to protect something, not for the sake of fighting.
037	Yes. It was like seeing my younger self in you...and I felt like I had to do something about it.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0006
038	Thank you for making me realize.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0033
039	Right. Let me repay you. Recently, I've started doing engravings. I'll make an accessory that will suit you.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
040	I would...love that. In return, I'll knit you something.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0048
041	It'll take a bit of time, so...please don't die until then. Promise me.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
042	Right back at you. Heheh. It's a promise.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0008
