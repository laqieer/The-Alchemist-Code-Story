001	We need to defeat the keeper of this ruin to get that jewel.
002	You mean Sis can't go back unless we get it?
003	...
004	I suppose there's nothing I could say that would keep you from heading towards that thing alone, Macherie?
005	Hahh... Hahaha...
006	Honestly...
007	(How can I defeat an opponent that my blade can't pierce, while also keeping Macherie and Jayme safe?)
008	(Could I defeat it if I was alone? Probably not...)
009	(Then what should I do?)
010	(Until a little while ago, I wouldn't have even thought about fighting unless it was an assignment.)
011	I told Jayme that hesitation would only dull his blade, but look at me now...
012	Setsuna, there must be something I can help you with.
013	I cannot allow either of you to come to harm.
014	This is my trial to overcome. I cannot let you do this alone!
015	Besides...
016	What?
017	Shouldering a burden alone is no different than torturing yourself!
018	Macherie...!
019	(She is willing to confront me about something I am trying to keep her from doing. She really is a tough one.)
020	(I shouldn't allow myself to be dependent on them, but it would be wrong of me not to trust in them.)
021	All right, Macherie. Fight with me.
022	Your ability to see beyond sight can help me see through things that I wouldn't be able to otherwise. It might help us find a way to defeat this thing.
023	Right! Thank you, Setsuna!
024	Still, if it gets too dangerous, I want you to take Jayme and get out of here.
025	Jayme, make sure you look after her, all right?
026	Got it! I can protect Sis!
027	Good answer. The three of us can do this together. We'll be fine.
028	(With these two by my side, I can finally...)
029	Grr...garhh...grrraaaaaahh!
030	Setsuna, here it comes!
031	Right! I'm counting on you, Macherie!
032	Okay!
033	I will show you what I can do!
