001	Hm...Huh? I'm...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1006
002	Kyahahaha! This is...good. A surprising result...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0027
003	Ooooh!!!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0025
004	No...you can't do that!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0014
005	Ouch! No...Celliers...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0043
006	Uh...?	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
007	That doesn't match you, you know? Not at all...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0027
008	Mie...likki?? Oh, there's blood...!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
009	Celliers, you don't like going out, in fact, you were afraid...but kind and beautiful...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
010	But, but...I'm a monster. I was made this way.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0018
011	That's not true! It'll be okay...after all...Celliers...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0018
012	We became friends, didn't we?
013	There are a lot of things that I want to show you.
014	The winter forests...the summer clouds...and, in the autumn, even more flowers bloom...and...and...
015	After the rain...a rainbow appears in the sky...
016	I would like you to see many, many things such as this village...the forest...so...so many things...
017	Ah—
018	(How strongly those words reverberate in my chest? How many times have her words saved me?)
019	Does she realize herself? When she says I'm sweet and smiles at me, it's her who's really sweeter than anything...)
020	I see... Thank you, Mielikki...	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0018
021	Hohoh... So this the latest piece, Celliers! Why it's a stunning piece of crystal craftsmanship.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
022	Th-thank you. Um, I still have a long way to go, but...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0033
023	Don't be so modest! In fact, I'm tempted to turn it into our town's specialty product!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
024	O-oh...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0050
025	All right, I'll go take it to some merchants and get their opinion on it.
026	Thank you.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0041
027	What are you doing, Celliers?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
028	Well, I thought I would come up with a means to support myself, but just about the only thing I can do is make crystal.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
029	Mielikki, are you looking after your flowerbeds today as well?	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
030	Yes! Hey, hey, some new flowers bloomed!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
031	Celliers, come and look!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
032	Yeah. I'll drop by next time. Oh, that's right. Here. This is a present for you.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
033	Wow! A crystal butterfly! Oh...but I thought you didn't like bugs?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
034	I've gotten a little more used to them. It's part of living in this village.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
035	People really do change after all. Recently, I feel it myself.
036	All right then! Can you help me with my flowerbed?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
037	Sorry, Mielikki. Butterflies are one thing...worms are still off the table for me...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0035
038	Right now there are a lot of them in the flowerbeds...
039	But you said you could change, didn't you?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0026
040	I did, but I can't change everything right away.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0047
041	Then when?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
042	Umm, well...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
043	Oh...	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1003
044	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1009
045	Well, um...it's not a big deal, but there's a rainbow across the sky over there.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_1047
046	Oh, you're right! It's almost like your eyes, Celliers!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
047	...You think so?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
048	Yes! When your eyes are under the sun, they sparkle like that, you know?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
049	I see... A rainbow, huh?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
050	(I still don't know anything. I'm naive, weak, and still so unstable...)
051	(But I'm sure that, one day...I can puff my chest up to my old friends.)
052	Celliers! If you don't hurry I'm gonna leave you behind!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
053	Yes. I'm going now, Mielikki.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0004
054	(Now, I feel like I can believe that.)
