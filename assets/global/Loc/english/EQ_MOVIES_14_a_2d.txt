001	Liz! You're...flying!
002	Heheh. Alchemia is back, so I can finally show you my Broom Ace in action! And don't worry about me—I feel fine!
003	I'm so glad you're all right, Liz!
004	I felt your compassion in my heart, Kasumi! You gave us all another chance!
005	I'm going to protect you and all the world! After all... You're my friend! I care about you!
006	L-Liz!
007	Aaaah! Hey! You've gotta be careful!
008	I feel the same way, Liz! You're my friend, and I care about you! You're so important to me!
009	Kasumi!
010	Liz!
011	Whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!
012	You may have your Alchemia, but nothing has changed.
013	This world will be restored once more to its truest form. I am going to put an end to the twisted way of this world!
014	Nothing's changed for me, either. Tears will be shed at this world's funeral, there's no doubt about that...
015	And I've sworn not to let that happen! No more tears, ever again!
016	Ngh!
017	I know that there was once light within you.
018	Without even realizing it, we might have come to be far too dependent on you—no, on Alchemia itself.
019	But even that was so that we could protect the people we care about! To save their lives! I want you to know that!
020	Tch! As if we have not been used by evil before!
021	So long as this world goes unmade... The nature of humankind will never be righted! Nnrgh!
022	Tell me... For what purpose did you fight when you were alive?
023	Tch!
024	Huzzaaaaaaahh!
025	Aaargh!
026	It was for the sake of this world, wasn't it? Or... No. Was it not for the sake of the people who live in this world?!
027	You...!
028	You know, not everyone lives with noble thoughts like that.
029	Most people's heads are filled with mundane stuff, like... What am I gonna eat tomorrow? Or... I wish I could date that girl...
030	But a world full of stuff like that is still a thousand times better than a world with nothing in it!
031	We don't want your desire to protect this world to have been in vain!
032	We will see to it that your wish is carried on! So please...open your eyes, Setsuna! Wake from the nightmare that holds you!
033	Nngh!
034	Aaahh!
035	(It's that...pain again!)
036	(Ohh... So that's it!)
037	(Everyone is wishing desperately to live longer, to survive this... And I can feel their pleas resounding within me!)
038	It's the same for me... I want to be free to live out my life however I care to!
039	Kasumi!
040	Goooooooooooooong!
041	The Demons of Light...! You did it, Kasumi!
042	To live on! To live freely!
043	Impossible! This light...! She cannot be... An Alchemist?!
044	No! I will not accept it!
