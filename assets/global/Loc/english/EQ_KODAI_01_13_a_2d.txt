001	Rrgh! How is my power not enough?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
002	Rrrooooooooogh!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0001
003	I can't even scratch her! There are too many layers of magil protecting her!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
004	...Guess it's time to see if this works, then!
005	Groooooooaaah!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0019
006	She's faltering! It's working!
007	Snap out of it, Claybelle! You, more than anyone else I know, should be able to get ahold of yourself!	VO_zafilys_transform.zafilys_transform_battle_0002
008	Aaaaaaahhh!!!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0002
009	Agh!	VO_zafilys_transform.zafilys_transform_battle_0021
010	N-no! Th-the magil is infecting...my body!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
011	Urrrrgh!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0028
012	Rrraaaaaahh!!!	VO_clabul_transform.clabul_transform_battle_0021
013	What...?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
014	That's no dragon form. That's not even indigenous to this Stratum! What an abhorrent—
015	Grooooooaarrrgh!!!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0002
016	I-is she controlling the weather? The very nature of this Stratum?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
017	This is just like before!
018	Like the avatar of the Shell of the World... It's the power to manipulate the world itself!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0020
019	How can Claybelle wield such a power? What did that high elf do to her?!
020	No... This is no time to be letting my mind wander.
021	I thought I'd head toward the Envy Layer—to Melvillei's domain.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0027
022	I must stop her! I will not fail again!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
023	I will fulfill my duty as the Guardian Dragon!
024	Claybelle, I don't fully understand what's happened to you...
025	But I will not let you destroy this land, nor the people in it whom you love so much!	VO_zafilys_transform.zafilys_transform_battle_0003
