001	So why exactly are we in a graveyard?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
002	What about the Guard Droids?! They're just around the bend!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0001
003	My men are taking care of them. It won't be a problem.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0006
004	I'm not sure if I share your confidence.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
005	I gotta say; I've never visited a graveyard during the midst of a battle.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
006	Hey, massive-armed idiot...it's high time you told us what's going on.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
007	Mr. Taras...it was you?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
008	... ...
009	Huh? Little lady, are you crying?! Hey! What did you do to her?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
010	No. This is...my father's grave.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
011	Your old man's...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
012	Yes. Every time I came here, there were fresh flowers laid out. It was you, wasn't it, Mr. Taras?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
013	Don comes here three times every week.
014	Shut up, you idiot. I'm gonna beat you to a pulp!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
015	I-I'm sorry!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0036
016	In my mind, Mayor Edward is still mayor of Redington City.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
017	If we're gonna start an all-out war here inside his city, it's not right if we don't apologize to him first.
018	Taras...!
019	Tsk. Out of all the things I expected from you before infiltrating our enemy's base...this is absurd.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
020	What did you say...?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0012
021	I said it's absurd. Who goes around respecting someone who's already dead?
022	I-it's so absurd that...sob...you're making me cry, idiot!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
023	Not good! The Guard Droid's are crossing over the fence!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
024	I-I'm sorry I'm late...sob...Just watch...I'm gonna fulfill my promise to you!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0019
