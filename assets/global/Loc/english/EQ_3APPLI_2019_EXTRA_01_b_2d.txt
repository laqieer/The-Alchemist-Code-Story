001	Cause I don't wanna run into any more naked girls!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
002	You'd better not, you little imp!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
003	This incident has really hammered home for me the dangers and instability of our Space-Time Manipulation.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
004	We're going to need to do something about accuracy.
005	Good point. Wouldn't want to end up accidentally creating another alternate universe!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
006	That's strange. It sounds like we're actually agreeing for once.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
007	I thought about it, and your logic checked out.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
008	Space-Time Manipulation definitely requires the setting of specific coordinates, in addition to precisely systematizing the technique and limiting its parameters...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
009	I don't wanna think about this anymore! You're giving me a headache.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
010	I've started thinking about it again.	VO_nix.nix_sys_1017
011	You know. "For the future of this world..."
012	Urgh! I'm so sick of hearing that phrase!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
013	So we fight in tandem with them, eternally, perpetually, endlessly; within the finite bounds of time itself.
014	And we cannot help but wonder... For what? Why do we fight?
015	Pfft. Heheh...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
016	What?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
017	Just leave it to me. I'll take care of everything!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
018	I'm going to go fix things!
