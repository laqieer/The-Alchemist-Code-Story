001	Huzzahhhh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0004
002	So it's true... Our Spiritbonding and the powers of purification have weakened.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
003	It must be because Sephiron has been consumed by the corruption.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
004	The power of the Sephira people is nothing less than the blessing of Sephiron. We are only able to cleanse ourselves of corruption because of our connection to the source: the great tree itself.
005	Huh?! Does that mean Waginau is as useless as a bag of rocks right now?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
006	Listen here you little imp! I am the Captain of the Sephira Guard! My training has not been so pitiful that something as trivial as this could slow me down!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
007	That being said...
008	Regular Sephira warriors will likely struggle to go up against the corrupted beasts.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
009	We cannot afford to count them among our number in our hunt for the fallen dragon.
010	I'm afraid I have to agree.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
011	Beelzebub's miasma has already begun encroaching upon the land around Sephiron.
012	At this rate, it's unlikely that the soldiers will be able to get the villagers to safety in time.
013	No problem! We'll just leave some of my Engineer Soldiers behind to—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
014	We can't. We will need every last one of your Soldiers to go up against the fallen dragon.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
015	Especially considering the state of our warriors.
016	But, then... What are you saying? We can't just abandon them!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
017	Of course we can't. There is, however, something we can afford to abandon.
018	Huh?
019	A-abandon the village?! Begging your pardon, Chief...but have you lost your mind?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
020	No... I can assure you that my senses haven't left me yet. We are no longer under Sephiron's protection, and the Cursed Beast is on the brink of awakening.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
021	I want to save as many lives as I possibly can.
022	S-still, Chief...the Cursed Beast will follow us wherever we go! That's the way of—	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
023	I have no intention of resting on my laurels and waiting for the advent of my own destruction. I will reclaim Sephiron for our people. I'm just going to need some time.
024	You know that there's a place to the south of this region where Sephiron's protection has always been weak...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
025	You mean that barren wasteland that was swallowed up by a sandstorm or some such?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
026	The reason that the fallen dragon fled to the Great Forest of Suga might not have been entirely because of Emmel's prayers.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
027	I'm thinking that the corruption prefers to devour the most vibrant and lively regions first.
028	Oh! S-so, if we flee to the sands in the south...!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0009
029	You'll be safe from the corruption...at least for a little while.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
030	In the meantime, we will work to grant the last oracle of the Great Dragon Nidhogg and seal the Cursed Beast.
031	I understand, Chief. I'll talk to the other villagers, make them see the right of it, and then we'll all start heading south.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0045
032	The last oracle of the Great Dragon... Cleverly put, Nimul.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
033	It's not a lie. In fact, it's unavoidable.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
034	If we abandon the village... One day, we will lose access even to our Spiritbonding powers.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
035	We have some time before then, and if I can complete my new technique...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
036	Anyone will be able to wield those powers, just as we do now. No—they will be even more powerful.
037	Spiritbonding will no longer be limited to the roots of Sephiron. It will spread across the entire world.
038	Then, and only then, will the Sephira finally be able to break free of the All Mother's cradle... Fly the nest, so to speak.
039	Wouldn't you agree, Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
040	But it... It would not be the blessing of Sephiron.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
041	I see... You're still conflicted.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
042	I... I have never viewed the way of the world so negatively as you, Nimul.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
043	It might have burdened us with our sins; it might have meant that we had to suffer a terrible punishment... But under the protection of Sephiron, we were able to live in peace.
044	That is why I cannot fathom... Why is this happening? Why does it have to be like this? Where did we go wrong?
045	...
046	So...I do agree. There is nothing else we can do.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
047	As the Captain of the Sephira Guard, I will do all I can to save as many lives as possible. To that end...
048	I will do anything it takes. Yes... Even if I must commit the taboo of slaying our Guardian Dragon, I will reconcile myself with the burden of that sickening sin!
