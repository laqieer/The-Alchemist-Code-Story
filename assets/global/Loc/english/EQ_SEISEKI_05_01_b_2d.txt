001	Wadatsumi Expedition - Departure Date<br>Holy Guard - Headquarters
002	I remember something I need to do. You go on ahead.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0035
003	Saga... I haven't been here since the wind shrine. It's good to see you're doing well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0001
004	You...
005	You are captain of the honorable 4th Regiment. There is no need for you to be hiding like that. Do you have business with me?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
006	What's going on? Wait...are you really at the center of the Holy Order?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
007	Heheh. I told so, didn't I?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
008	... ...
009	Lord Commander, what did you talk about?
010	I heard that a large-scale plan was underway, so I came to give my blessing.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
011	Your blessing? While dragging that many individuals behind you?
012	It just means it's that important to a mission. For us of the council as well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
013	Am I to assume that you're aware of the plan as well?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
014	Of course. However...I heard that your 4th Regiment has been removed this particular mission.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0038
015	No matter how much you search, I cannot you tell about it.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
016	Heh...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
017	Heheh... Well, that's just a front. if you want to know, then I call tell you. After all, we're friends.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
018	Tsk! Don't toy with me like that...just tell me!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
019	Don't get up all of a sudden like that. This time, the biggest goal of their mission is to destroy the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0016
020	The Spirit Stone Mikaboshi...?
021	It is a secret treasure that lies dormant within Wadatsumi. Its power is said to be equivalent to that of a Sacred Stone.
022	Wadatsumi's...secret treat?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
023	It's existence was thought to be that of something only told of in legends, however...the real artifact was found just the other day.
024	In some ways, you can call it the discovery of the millennium.
025	If it were to fall into someone else's hands, it will be a threat of the likes never seen before.
026	I understand. Currently, an equilibrium is maintained in this world due to the 7 Sacred Stones distributed throughout this world.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0038
027	Speaking of the power balance, the appearance of this new power source into extremely delicate equilibrium can give birth to new conflict.
028	Thus, at the end of our discussion, its destruction was ultimately decided upon.
029	How tragic...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
030	In other words ... the destination of this expedition is Wadatsumi? Why was excluded?
031	I know more than any knight when it comes to knowledge about Wadatsumi.
032	Hm.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
033	You could call this fate.
034	I was planning on paying the 4th Regiment a visit, but I hadn't expected them to show up instead.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
035	Enough with the intro. Get the main points.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
036	The reason you were removed from the expedition was due to my instructions.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
037	As the entire Holy Guard would be heading out, the Lord Commander proposed that he would take charge of the office.
038	You took us off?! Why?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
039	All of it is was for emergency insurance... I had no idea you would be selected.
040	Insurance...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
041	Didn't you say the same thing earlier?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0016
042	Should, the Mikaboshi fall into the hands of another...there will be no larger threat.
043	Those eyes...can you turn them towards a relative.
044	A relative? No way ...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
045	This matter may bring about a large effect on the outside world that will last for future generations. It must be turned towards the eyes of all people.
046	Among other things, under the pretext of absolute justice, that man carries an abnormal obsession for the Mikaboshi.
047	You saw me impatiently attempting to go about matters, and, worried about this, you made an appearance at my door, didn't you?
048	No...! Are you referring to the Lord Commander Zain!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
049	Exactly. That man is attempting to do all he can to obtain that absolute power.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0038
050	However...when it comes to Zain, each captain is too loyal to him. They will not suspect him.
051	He proposed that, in case of an emergency, one captain should be left behind in this land.
052	You scum! Are you trying to make me distrust the Lord Commander by sowing baseless doubts within me?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0015
053	Baseless?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
054	I cannot believe those words. Good bye.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
055	Hehe.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
