001	Day of Strategy Implementation<br><br>Midnight<br>Inside Forest of Wadatsumi
002	I'm sure about now Lord Zain and Kagura are taking a small group of soldiers and heading to the rendezvous point.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
003	That's quite the dangerous mission, even for the Lord Commander.
004	We need to quickly get out of this forest and meet up with them!
005	I am aware of that, Captain Yauras! But can I speak with you for a moment?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
006	What?
007	My subordinate? Or should I say comrade? Her name is Suzuka and she wants to talk with you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
008	I'm Suzuka. I would like to offer a word of advice.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
009	If you would like to reach the rendezvous point as soon as possible, then there's a shortcut up ahead.
010	If you would leave it to me, I will guide you there. Please take it into consideration.
011	Hmm. I see.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
012	Suzuka is originally from Wadatsumi and she knows this area well. I think you can trust her.
013	What proof do you have?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
014	Huh?
015	Even if she's from Wadatsumi and your subordinate, she's not a Paladin.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
016	She may be connected with the enemy. She could be telling us the wrong path in order to isolate us and have us ambushed.
017	We-well...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0011
018	For starters, the way she became your subordinate was way too suspicious.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
019	She appeared in front of Lord Zain when he was working and challenged him to a fight.
020	Why did you make that person your subordinate?
021	I-it's true...if you think of it logically...it's really suspicious, but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
022	Mistress?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
023	But I know this! Suzuka's eyes show no sign of deceit. She wouldn't lie!
024	You trust people too easily. Try to learn to be more cautious.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
025	No!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0039
026	What do you mean...no?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
027	I'm not very smart and I make lots of mistakes, causing those around me lots of problems.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
028	But...I am confident that I have an eye for people. I know for a fact that Suzuka is not a bad person!
029	It can't be helped that you don't trust Suzuka because she isn't an official Paladin.
030	Instead, trust me! For trusting in Suzuka!
031	Kanon...
032	Mistress...ohh...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0018
033	Hey, what are you crying about Suzuka?! Also, stop calling me mistress!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
034	But...sob...I can't believe that you would defend someone with an unknown past like me.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0019
035	I, Suzuka, will dedicate my life to doing my best! Even if I am the last troop, I will protect you, mistress.
036	You don't have to! I told you, just during this one operation, right?
037	Jeez. Seriously. Once she starts saying it, you can't stop her.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
038	Fine...Kanon and Suzuka. I will trust you. Show me this shortcut of yours.
039	Captain Yauras! Thank you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
040	I, Suzuka, will give it everything that I can!
041	Oh! Can I ask another question?
042	What is it this time?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
043	It's about Captain Kudan...
044	... ...
045	I know that our mission is in Wadatsumi and it is to follow after Kagura and Lord Zain after they enter a certain cave.
046	However, it caught my interest that, amongst the captains gathered, Captain Kudan's name alone wasn't listed.
047	Is he on some other mission? Or did they just forget to call him? We've just  left the port so maybe we can leave him a message.
048	Are you at it again? I don't have time to explain now, so I'm gonna have you be quiet for a while.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
049	Huh? He-hey...stop!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
050	Hey! What do you think you're doing picking up my mistress like that?! You're so rude!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
051	Look, just shut up and keep walking!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
