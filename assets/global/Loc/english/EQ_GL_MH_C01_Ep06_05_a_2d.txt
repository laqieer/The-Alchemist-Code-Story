003	Hey! Get them under control!
004	I-I can't! The monsters have gone mad!
005	Both of you! Get behind the arcane symbols!
006	And fall for your trap? You wish!
007	This is no time to be arguing, child!

009	The field will provide some sort of barrier between you and the hungry jaws of your Alchemia-starved monstrosities!
010	If you wish to see the light of day tomorrow, then I suggest you move, NOW.
011	Y-yes Ma'am!
012	What unruly beasts. This reckless experiment was doomed to fail right from the beginning!
013	Grrrr..... ROOAARR!
014	Hungry little beasties... One step closer and YOU will be my next meal instead!
