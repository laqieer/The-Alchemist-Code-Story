001	Not a single sprout. Not even a hint of one.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
002	I knew you'd be here. How many times do I have to tell you? It's impossible to grow anything here.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
003	You'll never know unless you try. Hawk's words, remember? There is no such thing as impossible.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
004	To give up before even trying is...what's that word...? Uh, negligent!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0017
005	I'm just sayin', you should focus on what's right in front of you instead of counting on something you can't predict.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
006	We won't be able to change anything if we think like that. Hawk entrusted us with bringing green life into this desert!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0015
007	That's true... I guess you're right. You do what you need to do, and I'll support you in any way I can.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
008	Carla, we got a report. Caravans crossing the desert are disappearing one after another!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
009	What?! Take me to the site! Let them know that the Sand Hawks are on the way!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
010	This is the area in question. Could it be monster attacks or something else targeting the caravans?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
011	There's no point in speculating. We'll have to capture the culprits in the act and find out what we can.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
012	If we were a proper country, we'd probably be able to deal with situations like this a lot more efficiently. We need laws that will encourage people to help each other out!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
013	That way, nobody would have to deal with their issues alone...like we did.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
014	If everybody in the desert stood up for each other, there would be fewer people who would have to go through tragedies like that.
015	It's a dream beyond a dream to turn this place into a country. The people of the desert have their hands full just trying to survive. That's why they need mercenaries like us.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
016	You're not wrong, but...we'll never know unless we try. Hm? What's that?	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
017	Hello there, Sand Hawks. What a coincidence.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0025
018	Ankh! If you're here, then...!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
019	Oh, hey. I see you dragged your butts out here, too.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
020	Rare to see a sloth like you getting his own hands dirty, Ryle!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0044
021	What's it to you? Stay out of this. I hate having to deal with unnecessary trouble.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
022	We're here on business, same as you. We don't take orders from you.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
023	Were you even commissioned to be here? You probably just rushed in, hollering on about peace for the desert or whatever.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
024	Knowing that you only work for profit, I'm sure you're only here to eradicate something getting in the way of you making more money.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
025	Seriously, talking to you is just...exhausting. Do you mind? We're trying to take care of things discreetly. Is it too much to ask that you please stay out of our way?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0029
026	We're only here to maintain the peace within this desert. As long as your business doesn't interfere with that, we have no reason to get in your way.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
027	This highway is a major trade route for us Desert Wings. It is a matter of utmost importance for us to rectify this situation or the whole enterprise will result in a financial loss.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0029
028	I cannot stress enough how inconvenient it would be for us if you were to meddle too much with our work here.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
029	We're here to maintain peace in the desert, and you're here to protect your profits, but we're all here to find the cause of the disappearances.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
030	We seem to share a same goal. Why not cooperate on this one occasion?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
031	Nah. That's too much effort. I don't care about maintaining peace, or whatever. To be honest, peace would kill my business... I'm having déjà vu. Didn't we just have this conversation?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0040
032	There's no way you don't care. We all live here together. We have to depend on each other. Isn't there some part of you that wants to see peace in this place?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
033	My hands are full managing my guild. You're always ranting on about things too big for your boots, like building a country or bringing peace to the desert, or whatever.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
034	Somebody has to do it. I'd rather get above myself than restrain myself to a tiny sphere of influence.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
035	You're entitled to your opinion, but please stop forcing it down my throat. I have my way of doing things and I will thank you to respect that in kind.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
036	Even if we face the same crisis, you won't stand shoulder to shoulder with us?	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
037	We don't even know what is happening here. Don't just make assumptions on your own that this a crisis.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0017
038	Well, I guess it makes sense that you would be a bit sensitive after what happened to your friend. Just be sure you're not letting your judgment be compromised by some personal grudge.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
039	...!
040	Ryle, that's enough.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0014
041	How's your garden coming along?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
042	Nothing yet.	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
043	Figures. Aren't there other things you can do instead of wasting so much time on something so futile?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
044	Cooperation requires some kind of incentive for all to participate. The reason the Desert Zone didn't last long as a country was because they lacked that.
045	If only someone could find some kind of incentive for people to come together... Meh. I'll leave that kind of thinking to you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
046	All I'm saying is...trying to appeal to sentimentality will not achieve the results you're looking for. Especially when it comes to a merchant guild like ours.
047	......
048	Master Ryle, are you all right? My apologies, but it seems that we have been surrounded.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0018
049	Carla, can you fight?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
050	Of course I can! What do you think we're here for?! If I didn't fight, I'd be—um, what was it again? Negligent!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
051	They must be the ones attacking the caravans. We'll get them and make them talk, gosh darnit!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0010
052	It seems that we've gotten involved now. What would you like to do, Master Ryle?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0029
053	Ugh. I wouldn't "like" to do anything, but it looks like I have no choice. We'll fight.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0022
