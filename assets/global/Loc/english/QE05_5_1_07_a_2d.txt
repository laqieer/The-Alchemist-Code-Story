001	...
002	Captain Dias, the messenger has returned.
003	And Northern Pride's response was?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
004	They...only said to "stand by"... This is the first time we've received such obscure orders.
005	What could the Lord Commander be expecting of us?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0016
006	I...see.
007	(As I suspected, Corpse have their filthy hands meddling in the Holy Guard's affairs.)
008	...
009	What's the matter? If that is all, you may leave.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
010	Should we...really not act?
011	What?
012	This country is falling into chaos. Mysterious monsters roam about and the citizens are fleeing like rats running from a sinking ship.
013	If we leave things as is, Gluttony Foss will fall as Envylia and Wratharis did.
014	Is our sword, our justice, not meant to be unsheathed for times like these?
015	...
016	I apologize. I spoke out of place. I will take my leave.
017	Justice...huh?
018	Seal the quicklime into containers and pile them into the carriage! Watch out for moisture levels! You don't want the carriage to catch fire!
019	Treat it like gunpowder! Be careful, but be quick about it!
020	We're fully loaded here, Kamui! We're ready to go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
021	Get moving as soon as you're ready! We'll need to be there in time to meet the Liberation Army!
022	Yes, Sir!
023	Tina, are you there?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
024	Right here! You need me to do something?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0006
025	The Blue Tongues will be busy delivering the supplies. Their defense will be up to us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
026	So you want me to scout ahead? Heh, I'm starting get used to how these things work.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
027	That's reassuring. Let's clear the roads of any monsters!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
028	Come with me, Tina!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
