001	Tch, Jam that mimics humans!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	Glurrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0006
003	Tina, watch out!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
004	Icicle Edge!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
005	Thanks, Lisbeth!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
006	What is this? Why would Jam take human form?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
007	Dang it! There's just so much we don't know!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
008	There's no point mulling over it! Let's find Georgios before more of them show up!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
009	Georgios! Is this Beelzebub? It looks like it's in some sort of cocoon.	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
010	Take this!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
011	Was that...the power of purification?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
012	This is just the beginning!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
013	At last! Beelzebub is mine again!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
014	What did you do just now?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
015	I poured my purification power into Beelzebub and severed its connection with the ancient dragon.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
016	It will take some time, but soon I will be able to wield Beelzebub again.
017	Once it is completely cleansed of the dragon's dominion, I will be able to reverse the preemptive curse.
018	What do you mean by..."reverse"?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
019	By severing Beelzebub's connection to the entity that bore the curse and infusing it with my purification power...	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
020	I can reverse Beelzebub's inherent nature...
021	Thus, I can change it from a "preemptive curse" to a "subsequential blessing." It is a feat only my clan can perform; not even Matter can achieve the same effect.
022	Now, I shall fulfill my life's purpose! Hyaaaaaah!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
023	But Georgios! Your life will be in danger if you use your purification power again!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
024	Fear for my life will not stop me from doing what must be done! Yaaaaargh!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0029
025	Georgios, are you—?
026	Georgios, heads up!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
027	...?! Ack!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0025
028	Hmph. Desperate to recover Beelzebub, are we?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
029	That's the tentacle we saw when the dragon was resurrected!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
030	Take this!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
031	I don't need help from the likes of you!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
032	Fine! We have to get out of here quickly, Mocca! Let's go!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
033	Glurrrrrrrrrrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_c
034	We're surrounded again! That tentacle's enough trouble as it is!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
035	We'll return to the outside via the opening in its spine! We've got Beelzebub! Let's get out of here!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
036	C'mon! No one dies on my watch!
