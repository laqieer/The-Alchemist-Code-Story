001	And so we ran and ran, dodging demons and townsfolk alike. From this time forth, there was never a moment of rest for either of us; we were forever pursued.
002	Who knows how many demons we may have felled along the way? Yet even as Sumeragi's sword became slicked with blood, the onslaught just kept coming.
003	And that's not even to mention the townsfolk...
004	Hey! It's those demon spawn! I hear they ran away from the castle! If we let them go, they'll probably kill us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
005	Then we'd better kill 'em first!
006	We were outnumbered on all fronts. After just a short while, our bodies were mottled with wounds. We were hated—scorned.
007	Yet our resolve never buckled, even when we were hounded to the very edge of our physical limitations.
008	Huff...huff... Wha—?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0019
009	Mikaboshi!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0025
010	Ngh!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0043
011	Sumeragi!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
012	So, this is it, huh?
013	What are you saying?! You can't give up now!
014	Or was that oath you made to me that day nothing more than a lie?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0027
015	Of course...it wasn't.
016	Then prove it!
017	The future that Mother and Father envisioned...will be realized. I know it. I can feel it. Lady Mitsuha...has the same vision, too.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0003
018	Even if I die...I know...someday...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0004
019	!!!
020	No... Nooooo! You can't die! I won't let you!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0028
021	Don't worry. I'm...not about to be killed by demons. I have an oath to uphold...after all.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
022	By my own will, I shall make this body into a sword!
023	Sumeragi!
024	The sword will drink up my blood, and the fierce resolve of man that I inherited from Father will be embedded deep within its blade...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0042
025	...along with Mother's tenacity to stand against the malice of the present-day demons, and against the very demon Malice itself.
026	With Mother's demonic aspect incorporated into it, the more demon blood it absorbs, the stronger it will become.
027	It will drink and drink and drink its fill of demon blood. And then one day, when it is engorged to the point of bursting, the blade itself will become a demon.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0005
028	My father's will, and my mother's will, and my own will... All will be placed in the hands of future generations...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0006
029	...and all you demons who kill, devour, and overtake will be hewn asunder!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0007
030	I offer up this body now, that it may become a Demon-Splitting Blade!
031	Even without magnificent horns like yours, Mikaboshi...I'm still your other half. So I wonder if I'll wind up taking on a form worthy of you...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0007
032	Sumeragi!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0018
033	This is goodbye. Until we meet...again...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0001
034	...
035	I didn't even have a chance to call out to him again. It was clear that he'd breathed his last.
036	I didn't know what to say. And before any words passed my lips at all, the demons swarmed onto Sumeragi's remains.
037	Sume...ragi...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0020
038	He... He was being devoured. I almost couldn't process that it was happening. I could barely process anything.
039	Why does it have to be this way? I just stood there, silently asking myself, why must I lose even his remains?
040	All I wanted was to live out my life with another person—with a partner in crime, so to speak.
041	"Even in death," we vowed. But that part of our oath was just lip service, as far as I'd been concerned. I wanted us to live together, and fulfill our oath together.
042	My beloved other half...
043	Why did you have to be taken away from me?
044	This is all wrong, I thought! It shouldn't be this way! It's just... It's too sad!
045	Even if it were too late, I had to fight back!
046	Don't touch him.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0019
047	I want to save all those who are dear to me.
048	We swore we'd see this through, even in death. And I'm not just going to stand by and let you eat away at the hopes you've so callously torn down.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0010
049	Sumeragi's body...and the will he's left behind within it...
050	I won't let them be taken away, too!!!
051	Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Tigris!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0032
052	Grrraaaaaarrgh!!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0003
053	I won't be killed by some heartless demon. I... I despise demons!
054	Demons must be eradicated.
055	There can be no recompense for what you've done to this land... For what you've done to its people... For what you've done to Sumeragi...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0013
056	You've taken everything from me!
057	Demons? Hardly. You are malice incarnate. A malice called Demon.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0042
058	You took my father...my mother...my brother...my life...our future...our resolve...
059	...No, wait. You haven't gotten those last two yet. And I won't let you. I won't ever allow you to take away the future we've envisioned, or our resolve to see it through!
060	With this eye, I shall bear witness to every heinous thing you do. I will behold your actions, and judge them accordingly.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0003
061	Even if it costs me my life...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0004
062	I shall not falter!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0005
063	This eye will root out all demons born of malice.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_1006
064	Even if I can't fell them with my own hand, I will reveal them for what they are. And to ensure you can take nothing further from me...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_2006
065	...this eye will drink up my blood and carry on my memory...so that even when the flow of time has weathered it into a stone...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0007
066	...you'll know well that my will—my resolve—has not and will never be faded!!!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0008
067	Let's go, Sumeragi!
068	...
069	......
070	Demons must be eradicated.
