001	What's all that noise? Is Zafeiris out there?
002	Lil, no! They're busy right now!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0025
003	Let's stay hidden in the mansion, okay? Come here!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
004	Hmmmmm? But—	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0021
005	No buts! We'll only get in their way.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0013
006	What...?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0025
007	...! Lil!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_battle_0019
008	Ah! Sia—!
009	Agh!
010	Target sighted. It's the child Ouroboros.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0006
011	Sia? No... You're bleeding!
012	Shall we eliminate her here?	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0031
013	No, this is still a part of the Primordial Serpent. A haphazard attack would only provoke the Shell to strike at us with that light.
014	Sia?! Get up! Umm, ummmm... Th-the blood! I need to stop the bleeding! Aaah!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0027
015	S-stop it! Don't hurt Sia! Please!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0036
016	If you don't wish to see her injured or killed, Serpent of the End, then choose your next move wisely. Come with us, and—	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0010
017	What in blazes do you think you're doing?!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0032
018	Curses! If we don't...eliminate the...Shell of the World, then...there is no...future...	VO_dragonman-y.dragonman-y_battle_0028_b
019	...
020	Well, they're clearly not about to back down. They're willing to die to stop you.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0016
021	The Genesis Altar... A testament to our sinful misdeeds. If memory serves, it can be found in the Pride Layer. That would be Ophioneus' territory, unfortunately.
022	If you're really determined to go there, you'd best be prepared to march over the bodies of countless former comrades along the way.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
023	I—	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
024	Shh! Listen. Behind the mansion!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0025
025	No! Noooo!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0043
026	Quence! What happened?!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
027	They snuck in from behind! They took Lil and Ambrosia!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0021
028	What?!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0012
029	Ambrosia, too?! Where did they take them?!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0042
030	Is this...blood?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_battle_0019
031	I... I couldn't do a thing. Nothing! Not even my most powerful magic could protect them! What good am I?!	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0019
032	I mean, I knew that humans and dragons were on a different level in terms of power, but I had no idea the difference was so...profound! What was I thinking?!
033	Lift your head up, fool. Don't beat yourself up over a single failure.
034	Claybelle...
035	You can always overcome the gap in immanent power between species through wisdom and cleverness. Humans have conquered beasts far superior to themselves time and again.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0016
036	Never stop thinking! All beings, no matter how seemingly omnipotent they may be, have a weakness that can be exploited.
037	Analyze, understand, and adapt. The repetition of these steps is what makes magic so potent. I've taught you this before!
038	...You're right. I'm sorry, Claybelle. It was a moment of weakness on my part.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
039	It's not like me to accept defeat so easily.
040	Blood was spilled here, but not much. Have the two of them merely been abducted, then?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
041	I guess now that you mention it, the dragon who took them did seem weirdly careful not to harm them any more than he had to.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
042	(Curious. From what the others were saying, I'd assumed their intent was to kill Lil, at any cost.)
043	(If so, then why would they abduct her rather than simply eliminating her?)	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0017
044	They may be dragons, but they're of low standing. Traversing among the Stratums alone should be a pretty strenuous and time-consuming task for them.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
045	The Genesis Altar... A testament to our sinful misdeeds. If memory serves, it can be found in the Pride Layer. That would be Ophioneus' territory, unfortunately.
046	Claybelle? Such magil... Be careful not to—	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
047	I know what I'm doing. There! I've detected traces of their magil!	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0019
048	Claybelle, let me come with you.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0041
049	With those wounds? Not a chance. You just stay here and rest. Don't make me any more worried than I already am.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0015
050	O-okay.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0022
051	Let's go, Zafeiris!	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
052	Right.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0034
