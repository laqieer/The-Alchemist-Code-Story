001	…Don't…speak.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
002	…
003	If you're awake, go--they're still fighting atop the cliffs. You mustn't be found here…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
004	…I guess this means my pupils lost. What a disgraceful end for their instructor…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0007
005	It's not over yet. Your troops regained their position. Now's your chance to join them.
006	I often lose sight of what's important when I focus too hard on my goals…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
007	Hm?
008	Lamia, I had forgotten about you for so long.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
009	…Priscilla
010	It was after I went to study martial arts in your country--before the war broke out.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0016
011	…yeah.
012	That was when I learned of what happened to my trainees. How they were wiped out.
013	The ones who managed to escape told me…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0022
014	...about a spearwoman adorned with poppies who led the Wratharis army.
015	They said you had mercy on those who fled.
016	…
017	I have no intention of fleeing.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
018	…Don't say that.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
019	Will you kill me like you killed them?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
020	…
021	…You're my friend.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
022	!
023	But I guess that's just an excuse…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
024	…Indeed.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
025	I could kill them because they didn't mean anything to me. But you... It's selfish--contradictory.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
026	Like admiring a beautiful flower, but then tearing it from the earth.
027	I've taken countless lives before, but I hesitate when it's someone I know. Always…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
028	…
029	What are those?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
030	…Flowers to place on their graves.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0022
031	…White flowers. Gardenias?
032	Yes, for my pupils--gardenias of fleeting beauty to mourn the dead.
033	You taught me that, Lamia.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
034	...I miss those days. Everything was lighthearted and carefree.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0007
035	Tell me. Do you hate war?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
036	Don't we all?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
037	I yearn for it. It's the only chance I can prove who I am…without the need for words.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0022
038	Yes, I remember you feeling that way back then, too--every time we crossed spears.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0006
039	I could say the same for you.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
040	No, not me.
041	When your blood boils, your back--
042	…Look away.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0015
043	All the Alchemia in your body causes the wing-shaped marks on your back to glow.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0016
044	They speak volumes without you needing to say a word.
045	…Those days are over.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
046	…Truthfully, I hate war, too. The fighting exhilarates me, but the deaths of my comrades--	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
047	It's a paradox I still can't figure out.
048	...I know how you feel.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
049	That's why I want to teach--to show my students how to wield power in order to avoid conflict.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
050	…How to...wield power…
051	You've got to forgive yourself for wanting to protect certain people and not others…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0022
052	Otherwise, you're just beating yourself up for no reason. There's enough negativity in war as it is.
053	You've got to learn to love yourself. I'm sure someday...
054	You'll be glad you did. But who knows when that day will come…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0016
055	…Priscilla
056	…. As you can see, lectures aren't my strong suit. I take too long to get to the point.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0007
057	…Teach me, Priscilla.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
058	What is there for me to teach you?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
059	I'm not sure how to "wield power," as you put it. But being with you like old times…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
060	You want me to be your...instructor?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0025
061	I don't know… That doesn't sound quite right…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0007
062	Then how about "friend?"
063	…Yes, "friend." That's the word.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
064	Yeah. I hope that's possible.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
065	Miss Priscilla! Are you alright? Please let us know that you're safe!
066	!?
067	My troops. They must have come looking for me. There's nowhere to hide on the battlefield.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
068	Priscilla…I…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
069	Go! You and I never met.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
070	But…	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0019
071	Imagine the instructor AND her pupils losing to you. How could I ever show my face? Just go.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
072	…I'm sorry.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0035
073	Someday when the war is over…	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
074	Yeah…you'll teach me more about flowers.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
075	…
076	…Farewell.
077	Farewell.
078	…	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0022
079	But the war isn't over.
080	Enemy sighted! She's below the cliffs!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
081	Out of my way!!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0004
082	If I let you go, my students--my friends--will be killed. I'm certain.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
083	I know I'll regret it.
084	We've got the Wratharis soldiers cornered. Face it! You're done for!
085	(I must live.)	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0018
086	(Until the day I can learn to love myself)
087	(I know I can learn…and then, I'll meet that special someone--)
088	The flowers I carry have yet to bloom.
