001	...
002	Welcome back.
003	...
004	Kudan?
005	I'm...so glad you're alive!
006	Same here.
007	Do you have any idea how much I...I...
008	Oh, come on. Don't start crying on me.
009	I'm not crying, you're crying!
010	Yeah, well... Did you call her Kagura earlier?
011	Yes. She is the daughter of the Queen of Wadatsumi.
012	So one who carries the Wadatsumi royal bloodline yet lives. Lady Kagura, I'm so glad to see that you are well!
013	There's no need to be so formal. I'm just another member of the Holy Guard now.
014	She fights as a Paladin of the 4th Regiment, of which I am the captain.
015	Hah! You're the captain?
016	Do you have something to say about that?
017	So you're protecting her, huh?
018	Well, you know...
019	Yes, he is.
020	And now she works under you... Fate works in mysterious ways.
021	I'm so thankful you're alive. There could be no better news than this.
022	I am unworthy, but I thank you, Lady Kagura.
023	She just said there's no need to be so formal. So, since that day, how have you—?
024	Um! Do you two know each other? You called Captain Kudan your brother just now, didn't you?
025	I guess you could say we're blood brothers. We swore an oath to each other.
026	What?!
027	Is it really so surprising?
028	Yes, it is! I can't believe what I'm hearing! Captain Kudan has a blood brother?!
029	I had no idea. What does that even mean?!
030	I didn't expect this reaction. Looks like you're still not that open with your friends.
031	Drop it.
032	How did you two come to know each other, anyway?
033	That's not important.
034	Oh, tell us! Please? Basheeny, you want to know, too, don't you?
035	I am interested.
036	See?!
037	May I?
038	Have it your way.
039	Please tell us!
040	Kudan came to Wadatsumi to study, as part of his training for the Holy Guard.
041	His powers were something to take note of, even back then. He was quite popular in Wadatsumi.
042	Those who saw his powers set up an exhibition match for him against me. I was just a member of a warrior family back then.
043	So you two fought, huh? Who won?
044	Hahah. It was a long time ago. I don't exactly remember.
045	There's no need to be so coy about it. That's a bad habit of yours.
046	Wait, you don't mean...!
047	Yes. I couldn't defeat him. Not even once.
048	Let's call it a day.
049	No! Let's have another round! I won't back down until I defeat you!
050	The sun's going down.
051	I don't care!
052	I have plans tonight. Besides, I hate fighting in the dark.
053	Another round!
054	Fine. Come on, then.
055	You're too straightforward.
056	What?!
057	You have no place to go, no back up, and no one to depend on.
058	I have strength.
059	That you do, but you're still focused on nothing but me.
060	Of course I am. So what?
061	You're turning a blind eye to everything else around you.
062	I bet you haven't even noticed the lovely sunset.
063	I've seen it before. Nothing new there.
064	You're a real drag, you know that?
065	It's the same sunset every day.
066	Ack...urgh...ack!
067	See? Looks different now, doesn't it?
068	Ack...! Kuza, you...! Urgh!
069	Ack! Urgh...! Ack...!
070	Heh. You need to loosen up!
210	Watch flowers bloom in spring. Skip work during the day and work nights instead in the summer. Make a campfire from dried leaves in autumn, and sleep in on the cold days of winter.
071	Appreciate the subtle differences in how wine can taste depending on the scenery before you. It's as simple as that.
072	What are you talking about?
073	I'm telling you why it is you can't beat me.
074	You're saying I should waste my time staring at the scenery?
075	You're not getting it. These things are fun because they're such a waste of time.
076	I'm really not getting this.
077	Take a long look at everything around you. You'll learn to appreciate it all in time.
078	...
079	The more time you spend with things, the more you come to love them. You wouldn't call love a waste of time, now, would you?
080	Heh. You love to hear yourself talk, don't you?
081	Though I may no longer have a family, I still have a home and a place I belong.
082	Every day I find something new to love. Our strength is meant to be used to protect those things.
083	Kuza...
084	Why did you become a Paladin?
085	To build a world in which people can smile freely. To protect the peace of Babel.
086	Are you serious?
087	You doubt me?
088	It's just that that's such a grand ideal and, well...you don't exactly look like the hero type.
089	...
090	That was a joke. You're supposed to laugh.
091	I... I'm terrified. I feel like if I let my eyes drift away from that ideal for even a moment, I'll fall into the abyss.
092	That's...quite a thought.
093	Are you patronizing me?
094	Not at all.
095	...
096	Still, your immediate objective is to be stronger than me. Right?
097	I'll defeat you. You'll see.
098	Maybe we can help each other grow strong.
099	I...suppose that's true.
100	Guess that'd make us brothers.
101	What? And here I thought you were sober.
102	I want to grow stronger so that I can protect the things I see around me, and you want to grow stronger for the sake of a grand ideal. Don't you think we share a similar goal?
103	I...suppose so.
104	Why don't we make an oath to solidify our brotherhood?
105	...
106	Not up for it?
107	Tell me something.
108	There are no secrets between blood brothers.
109	Which of us would be the older brother?
110	Hah! Hahahahahah!
111	Don't laugh! If we are to be brothers...!
112	I'll be the older brother, of course.
113	I knew it. You're drunk, aren't you?
114	Isn't it natural for the stronger one to be the older brother?
115	That has nothing to do with it!
116	Don't go throwing a tantrum, now.
117	Don't treat me like a little brother!
118	Heheh...
119	It's nice to have a new family member.
120	I'm not familiar with Wadatsumi's customs. What exactly do I need to do?
121	We just swear loyalty to each other as blood brothers, and then make an oath upon the blade.
122	I swing my blade for the sake of the people and land before me. Wadatsumi is my home to defend!
123	You really are drunk, aren't you?
124	Don't worry. I'll share some with you later.
125	I can't believe it. So you are drunk!
126	Come on, repeat after me!
127	I swing my spear to tear down all irrationalities and trample over all despair.
128	Let us pledge an oath to grow stronger together.
129	Right.
130	For whom do we make this oath?
131	For the people and their smiles.
132	...
133	Kudan? Come on!
134	For the peace of this continent.
135	We will dedicate our lives to this path we walk.
136	For justice!
137	Wow... That's some story. I didn't think people still did that. Kagura, want to make a blood oath with me?
138	Just like that?!
139	Soon after that, Kudan left Wadatsumi. Or I guess I should say, he was forced to leave.
140	Greed Dike invaded Wadatsumi.
141	Oh no!
142	I couldn't save anything back then.
143	That's not true. You saved Kagura's life. That's more than enough.
144	Let me just check that I understand this correctly. The weak get exploited. That's why Captain Kudan obsesses over strength?
145	Basheeny! Can't you word things in a way that's not disrespectful to your captain?
146	I'm sorry, Captain Kudan! I'll be sure to lecture him properly later!
147	Basheeny! Apologize this instant!
148	Did I say something wrong?
149	Just apologize already!
150	I'm...sorry. I guess.
151	...
152	We're with you now, Captain Kudan! We won't let you lose anyone ever again!
153	Even if you get enveloped in the darkest abyss, I will shine a light on you!
154	Airhead.
155	What was that?!
156	Where do you get all that baseless cheerfulness from, anyway?
157	I'm just saying what I think is right! Isn't it human nature to want to shine a light upon the dark and gloomy?
158	You think I'm gloomy?
159	Oh, um...
160	Can't you word things in a way that's not disrespectful to your captain?
161	Ahem... Right. I'm sorry.
162	Oh...!
163	Kuza...?
164	It's...nothing.
165	So what have you been doing lately?
166	Whatever I can for Wadatsumi.
167	Wadatsumi still suffers the tyranny of Greed Dike's occupation.
168	Civilians are being massacred and used to conduct experiments regarding the undying soldiers known as the Immortals.
169	That's horrible!
170	The Immortals? Then those soldiers from earlier were...!
171	Not only did they invade our home, but they've treated us worse than chattel.
172	No...!
173	This cannot be allowed to continue!
174	That's why there's a resistance working to change the current state of affairs.
175	A resistance, huh?
176	Yes, but Greed Dike is aware of our operation. If we were to make any large-scale moves, we'd have another invasion on our hands.
177	We won't let that happen!
178	Will you lend me your strength, Brother?
179	Of course. The fact that there are Immortals in Greed Dike and that Wadatsumi's Alchemia is being used to fuel them, coupled with your testimony... This is more than enough evidence for us to take action.
180	We can make this an official operation of the Holy Guard.
181	Let's report back to the Lord Commander. Then we should formally request the Holy Order for permission to support Wadatsumi.
182	Right.
183	Before we leave, I want to show you our hideout to give you a better understanding of what is happening here. Would that be all right?
184	Lead the way.
185	Follow me.
186	Please... Save...Wadatsumi.
187	...
188	I can no longer perform the dance...that you said you loved.
189	Chihaya.
190	So...let me at least...pray for you.
191	Chihaya!
192	I pray you will reach the heights you...have always aspired for.
193	No substantial information yet?
194	No, sir. What should we do?
195	Hmm...
196	We investigated every lead we have, but not a single trace of the archeologists was found.
197	If nothing turns up soon, we'll have to assume that they've destroyed whatever evidence there might have been to find.
198	Indeed... What do you make of this, Othima?
199	It is odd. If they were so careful as to not leave any evidence, why did they allow themselves to be seen?
200	You have a point. If their intent was to be thorough, it doesn't make any sense that they'd allow their Phantom to be exposed.
201	Are you suggesting that it was intentional?
202	It is a possibility.
203	What would the point of that be?
204	This whole thing could be a setup.
205	What if it was a plan to draw Captain Kudan to Wadatsumi?
206	Tch! Greed Dike soldiers!
207	We've lost sight of Kuza.
208	They must feel considerably threatened. Let's find Kuza first.
209	Here they come!
