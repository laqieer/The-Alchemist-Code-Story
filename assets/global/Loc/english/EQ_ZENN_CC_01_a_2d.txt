001	The more dramatic the stage, the less interested I become.
002	This world doesn't let people fix their mistakes in life.
003	Then what of us Templars? Are we simply gnats, unable to consider the needs of the world?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0012
004	Hmph. Have you affiliated yourself with yet another group? You are a man without honor.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
005	Yet another...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
006	That man was once a comrade in arms of mine...as a part of the Shadow Messiah.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
007	A man without honor, huh?
008	A fool can never be more than a fool.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
009	You dare—?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
010	A ruler needs to have the eyes to perceive what lies ahead, and use will and reason to guide the world down the right path.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
011	Hmph. Perhaps this is too much for someone who can only handle killing things that are right in front of them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
012	After all, you seem to have subordinated yourself to scum like the Greed Dike emperor. It's pathetic how content you are to be little more than one of his chess pieces.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
013	He often called me a fool, a murderer, and a lowly chess piece.
014	Are your last words finally coming to an end, Zahar? It's time for you to return to hell, old friend!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
015	Lord Zahar! No!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0020
016	Wha...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
017	What do you think you're doing?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
018	I believe that it's the heart that determines victory and defeat on the battlefield.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
019	And...?
020	I cannot explain it, except that seeing Zahar like this has forced me to reconsider where I stand in this moment.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
021	We share the same goal, supposedly... Yet I find myself unable to bear witness to this.
022	Once unshakeable of spirit...
023	This is the vow I made, and I swore never to turn my back on it!
024	I could never lose to someone who has given up on their own heart, and everything they believe in!
025	I became a deserter of my own heart.
026	The blade is...shuddering?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0027
027	Swords are more than just weapons. They carry within them the legacy our hearts most want to leave behind.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
028	You...!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
029	Not just those of the wielder, but also of the maker... I can hear the sadness contained in that blade. It remembers the heart of my father and suffers.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
030	Miss...Miuna...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
031	You're...Yogi Ku's...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0021
032	I'm not forgin' a sword for you.
033	Even my blade wept to see me fall.
034	I had no one.
035	Like a sword without a blade to bear, ever do I arrive a day after the fair.
036	Where there is a will, they say, yet I have all but lost my way.
037	Cry for peace in the depths of hell, yet only demons will heed thine yell.
038	But in this world, effort reaps reward. Some would yet restore your lost horde.
039	When the curtain rises, and the gong sounds, the story of the would-be samurai shall be unwound.
040	I am not destined to play the part of the hero.
041	I am strength.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
042	Greed Dike Royal Castle, Dynam Dionysus
043	You have been selected from among the many fine soldiers who protect our proud nation to serve at my side. You are to be elite tools at my disposal.
044	Yes, my lord! It is an honor!
045	As such, you may consider yourselves no longer bound by laws or reason. To protect our empire, our nation home, you will annihilate our enemies with impunity.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
046	You would do well to please me, for you are mine to command...my Intelligencers.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
047	Emperor Orion, if I could beg but a moment of your time...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
048	The audience has ended. Off with you!
049	Do you remember me, my lord?
050	Excuse me? You dare test me, whelp?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
051	B-begone with you, I say!
052	I am a patriot at heart, you see. As such...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0003
053	I cannot condone your rule, Emperor Orion.
054	Is that so?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
055	A-apologize at once! If you value your head, you will retract that comment immediately!
056	No. I don't think I will, thank you.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
057	You would throw the honor you have just been given back in our benevolent emperor's face?!
058	Yes. I would.
059	Hmph.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
060	P-please don't let this fool's insolence ruin the occasion, my lord! We are your faithful servants! We—
061	Go on.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
062	M-my lord?
063	Tell me your name, whelp.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
064	Na Zhu. You would do well to remember it.
065	Hahaha! Very well. Is there anything else you would like to tell me?
066	Yes. Your attitude appalls me.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
067	E-e-excuse me?!
068	As a soldier who fights for a love of his country, I abhor the idea of operating as one of your tools.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
069	Do you have a death wish?! You do realize that challenging our emperor is tantamount to—?!
070	W-would somebody get this upstart out of here?! He is a disgrace to our emperor! He is a disgrace to us all!
071	I like that look in your eyes, Na Zhu.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
072	Hmph.
073	In time, I am sure the fiery spirit and ambition that dwell within would have tempered your strength, transforming your iron will into one of steel.
074	But I very much doubt that misplaced heart of yours will still be beating when I'm through with you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0045
075	I always did enjoy a challenge.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0010
076	You will atone for your impudence in blood.
077	Greed Dike, Imperial Hinterlands
078	'Scuse me.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0016
079	What?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
080	You wouldn't happen to be hardline supporters of the false royals, would you?
081	Who are you? State your business!
082	Oh, no one special.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
083	A life marked by him will not survive the day. One sweep of metal, and their lifeblood will drain away.
084	Just the head of Imperial Security.
085	Wh-what?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
086	His name is a whisper on the lips of the dead.
087	I-I've heard of him! A warrior, born and bred in Greed Dike, but he wields a blade native to Wadatsumi... A katana, I believe it's called.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0022
088	He's the emperor's dog, that's what he is! At high noon, he comes for the necks of anti-imperialists!
089	Wait—don't tell me he's...?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
090	Yet even in death they invoke D. Lily with dread.
091	You've got it.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
092	If you're the head of Imperial Security, why're you wearing those foreign clothes? I suppose you don't have any decency, being one of Orion's tools!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
093	Traitorous scum!
094	Heh.
095	You're no better than a dagger, or a lowly mutt! I'm not afraid of you!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0012
096	He is a tool, this is no lie; he has no loyalties under the sky.
097	This isn't personal. I'm just here to fulfill my duty.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0030
098	Your duty? How dare you act so high and mighty! As if soaking the streets in rivers of innocent blood is going to do anything for this country!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
099	Like I said...
100	I'm just doing my duty.
