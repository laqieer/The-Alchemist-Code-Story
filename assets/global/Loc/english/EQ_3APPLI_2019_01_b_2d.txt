001	We've come so far! Don't you dare suggest that we stop now!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
002	I'm just saying, I don't think we should be risking the creation of parallel worlds for no good reason!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
003	The beginning of this incident can be traced back to the age in which the continent of Babel first formed.
004	How about a cook-off?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
005	Mira... Sometimes your leaps in logic are impossible to follow.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
006	A cook-off! You know, a cooking competition? A chef's greatest weapon is the cuisine they serve up!
007	I guess?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
008	Space-Time Manipulators like us employ space-time as our weapon, right?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0003
009	Your point is...?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
010	Those terrible, colossal creatures who ravage the land, threatening the entire world...the Cursed Beasts.
011	Humankind waged an ages-long war against these beasts, wearing down our forces considerably.
012	Seeing this, Mira and I applied ourselves to our research, and labored to create a new style of space-time manipulation.
013	We must go beyond Alchemy; beyond the bounds of space-time, past and future; beyond this very world...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
014	We will drag excellent warriors and potent military forces into our world. They will take care of the Cursed Beasts for us!
015	That's a terrible plan! Time must be correctly maintained! We mustn't mess with it!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0040
016	With things as they are, this world has no future. Time will come to a standstill. There will be no one to keep it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
017	This is your idea of a last resort?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
018	Failure is the mother of success—just like I'm your big sister!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
019	In other words, who cares if we fail, you're older than me and I should do what you say?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
020	Let's just give it a try!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
021	Well, if we're doing this, we're going to need...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
022	A grid, for one. That's configured and ready to go. A catalyst... I suppose we've got that covered, too. So, all that's left is for us to combine our powers and say the magic words.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0041
023	Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, that I may see you.
024	Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.
025	Now, come!
026	Chance Encounter.
027	We've done it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
028	Does this mean...our attempted magic is incomplete, but it activated anyway on the impetus...?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
030	Drawing various individuals from their respective worlds and bringing them together, only to sweep them all ashore upon a heretofore mutually unfamiliar plane...?
031	H-huh? Tinnie, could you, um, cut to the chase?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0031
032	Would you mind if I...?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
033	Not at all. Succinctly, if you please.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0041
034	None of this was foreseen.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
035	We don't even know how to make it home.
036	We've really done it... Oh, boy, are we in trouble!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0022
037	...
038	This has got to be a nightmare.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0030
039	I'd just finished a mission... I should be relaxing in a hot spring right about now.
040	Instead, I'm being chased around by some kind of monster before I even know what's going on.
041	Not to mention, I had a boy I've never even seen before crash into me... All while I was in the nude.
042	I wish you were here to help me...Sakura.
043	Next time, on Shinobi Nightmare—I mean, on "For Whose Princess Could Endure This Nightmare?"...
044	Do you know how I feel? Has my heart reached yours?
