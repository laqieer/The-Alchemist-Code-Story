001	No...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
002	...Alia.
003	I've told you everything. Are you satisfied now?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
004	... ...
005	That's why I asked whether or not you were prepared to hear this. I didn't want to add to the burden you already shoulder...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
006	Tamis...are you crying?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
007	No, it's just that...I'm happy.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0020
008	I now know with what resolve the Wind Matter has been handed down to me.
009	I'll do whatever I can to revive the power of the wind.
010	For Saga...for Alia...for Fuu...
011	And, of course, for you as well, Mocca.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
012	You mustn't worry yourself about anything further. This was all entrusted to me.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1019
013	I am the one who must protect all of this. I swore to Alia that I would protect Saga. I must keep my promise.
014	That's why I must be strong.
015	Not just me...but all of the Fuu faction must be strong for the sake of Saga.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
016	That's just the kind of conclusion I'd expect from you.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
017	But, hold on...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
018	Fuu, you were the one who, well...purged Alia, but you didn't destroy the Wind Shamans, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
019	In that case, why haven't there been any Wind Shamans besides Tina and Mocca until now?
020	I don't know the reason why, but, ever since Alia was purged, the truth is that no new Wind Shamans were born.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
021	That being said, Fuu, why did you keep quiet all this time?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
022	I was the one who was entrusted with this. This isn't your burden to carry.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
023	This is the result of my own actions. I should be the one to shoulder the responsibility for the promise I made.
024	You really are a stubborn boy.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0017
025	Still, shouldn't you have said something, Fuu?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
026	Far from it! As one of the Sprite Trio, I cannot afford to have any of you shoulder this responsibility!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0017
027	Exactly. I lack strength...I'm well aware of that! Yet, still, I am asking this of you!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
028	Didn't you ask Alia the same thing that night? Didn't you ask him why he hadn't told you sooner?
029	Right now, you are doing the same thing that Alia did. There really is no need for you to shoulder the responsibility and turn yourself into a villain.
030	What would you know about anything?!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0010
031	For the sake of the future...I'm imploring you not to repeat the mistakes of the past!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
032	...Tina.
033	Heheh. Tina makes a convincing argument, Fuu.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
034	I will not repeat my past mistakes! How many times must I tell you to make you understand!	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
035	Enough! How can you be so stubborn?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
036	You...! Who do you think you're speaking to?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
037	That has nothing to do with this! Having heard your side of the story, I want to help support your cause!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
038	You've waited this long to tell me...and now I feel like an idiot for having questioned your motives!
039	But you...right now, you're not listening to Alia's resolve...to our resolve...you haven't seen Tamis' tears!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
040	All you're doing is suffering on your own! That's why...we...!
041	Mocca's right! This isn't something for you to shoulder alone, Fuu! This is something that concerns all of us!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
042	You're not the only one who wants to protect Saga! All of us here feel the same way!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
043	... ...!
