001	Oh.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
002	Where...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
003	So dark... Why are we here?
004	Damn it all!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0022
005	Huh?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
006	Why did it turn out like this?! My theory was perfect! There might've been corruption, but there was also magil in abundance!
007	The conditions for returning to the time of creation should have been fulfilled! So why?!
008	Wait... Perhaps...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0004
009	Did that girl hide this reality from me?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
010	If this phenomenon was the result of my spell working correctly...
011	Then, is the start I was aiming for, the start of all our tragedy, outside of the Cosmic Egg?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0021
012	Damn it! Then it's impossible. I can't reach it!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0022
013	Which means that in order to return the world to its original form, I have to destroy the laws of those gods first!
014	That voice... Quence?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
015	...Tsk!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
016	So I'm not the only idiot who's fallen into this trap?
017	"Commence Space-Time Manipulation and Spatial Identification."	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
018	Huh? Eeeek!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
019	Where are we?!
020	The Shell of the World.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
021	Outside the survival zone of the regions—the omnipresent will of the gods, the foundation of this world.
022	This world...?
023	Yes. This is the place I dreamed of! Which means...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
024	You are that man's... You are Nimul's sister. The Vessel of Purification, the sacrifice of prosperity.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
025	You are a neuter flower only grown to protect the Gula Belt and then wither away.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
026	.........	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
027	No need to be so guarded. I have no intention of doing anything to you as I am now.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
028	Well, I cannot save you either. Not that you would have wanted that from me anyway.
029	...Did you fail?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
030	Could you not directly strike at the heart of the matter?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
031	Regardless, yes, you are indeed correct. After all the sacrifices I made, and after becoming a hapless villain, this is the result I have achieved.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
032	Laugh at me if you like. I cannot help but laugh, myself.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0022
033	Honestly... I've lost my way back once again.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
034	.........
035	You failed.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
036	How many times are you going to say it? Are you trying to make me cry?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
037	Then, shouldn't you try another way?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
038	Huh? What are you talking about?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0039
039	Lend me some of your power, Quence. For our journey, our goal...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
040	For our ideal of saving all of the regions from sin.
041	Are you serious? I belong to the Infinite Serpent, you know?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0047
042	I know.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
043	I'm an ally of Zafeiris, the one who played havoc with the Gula Belt Region.
044	I am aware.
045	I am the man who took the life of the Queen of the Ire Belt with whom reconciliation may have been possible.
046	Yes.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
047	That may be true, but we need all the friends we can get right now.
048	Besides, you killed Teres because she wanted to die in the first place, right?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
049	I...
050	I was sure she had not said a word about it to any of you.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
051	Yes, but I understood her. I was the same way.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
052	Wanting to sacrifice myself to protect those important to me.
053	I'm sure she felt the same. Or am I wrong?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
054	.........
055	What an awfully kind thing to say. Going to provide me with a way out of this, are you?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
056	Or do you truly believe in the goodness of humanity?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
057	What exactly have you seen until now? The magil Cursed Beasts control is the sin we humans produce!
058	That is the true nature of humans. Self-centered and egotistical. It's our innate instinct.
059	The world you dream of doesn't exist anywhere.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0004
060	That's why...
061	We have to create it.
062	A world where everyone spends their days smiling, a system where no one gets hurt. Even if I have to sacrifice myself, we will make it.
063	For your brother, who will live on even after you die?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
064	Yes, that's right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
065	This body has always been for that purpose. To take in all the corruption of this world and provide all humankind with the blessing of purification.
066	Nimul will surely build a better world on top of my sacrifice.
067	That is my hope. My wish.
068	You feel the same, do you not, Quence? You dream of a future for Ambrosia after you are gone.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
069	Did Teres not choose you for an accomplice because you foresaw the same thing as she did?
070	...
071	I admit I am surprised. I was the one who tried to recruit you in the first place.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0011
072	There's a limit to how fearless one should be, trying to convince me to leave the Infinite Serpent.
073	I thought you were just the target of Nimul's protective instincts, just a princess to be sheltered. But it seems that was a facade.
074	And now the truth comes out. Your wish. Not ours. Yours.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0008
075	Whatever, I'll take the bait. Do tell me what you think is the best way to save this world.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
076	You have to keep it a secret from Nimul, all right?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
077	Urgh! Just what you'd expect of a Cursed Beast! With it being this slothful, getting a hit on it should be—
078	...
079	Aaaaghh!
080	Hold the line! We are the soldiers Lord Kubera has entrusted with protecting the town!
081	Even if our bodies are broken, what lies before us is—
082	Aaarrrggghhhh!
083	How disgraceful.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
084	I am a Cursed Beast—an immortal, impure curse that invades this land.
085	I am a calamity that all who live despise. A virulent poison that causes all ambition to fester.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
086	And yet...
087	The time of glory is at hand! If even a small part of the power we have trained up reaches it, Lord Kubera will certainly—
088	Why do you not flee? Fearing death is the instinct of all living organisms.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0001
089	Why do you fight? Those who have fought before you have shown you that you are no match for me.
090	Unpleasant. Incomprehensible. You are all much too broken.
091	Therefore, you must be destroyed. You must be devastated.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
092	We have no need for such heresy in our divine world!
093	The town is being attack by the Cursed Beast?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
094	So it seems. My main troop is gathered here for the the dragon hunt.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
095	If Mammon is so inclined, it will keep it up until sundown, at least.
096	Now is not the time to be calmly dissecting things! We must hurry and aid them!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
097	No.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0039
098	We have something else that we must do.
099	What?
100	What will returning to town accomplish? Saving townspeople? Or will you use the power you displayed before to slay the Beast?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
101	That's...
102	Cursed Beasts are beings that you cannot defeat with pure strength alone. Even I have already acknowledged this.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
103	That is why I desire gear made from dragons, a power that can surpass the Beasts' strength.
104	Is this not the same for you?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
105	You are correct that we have no Gear of Judgement here, nor someone capable of wielding it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
106	And no matter how much of the Cursed Beasts' power Nimul may obtain, we do not have the resources needed to fully purify Mammon.
107	Nevertheless, we cannot use that as a reason for allowing the people of this region to be slaughtered.
108	That way of thinking itself is a mistake.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
109	What?
110	Our people are currently remaining in town to battle the Cursed Beast.
239	Those are clearly not people who are afraid of dying.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
111	They are fighting with everything they have.
112	Yet they cannot defeat this Cursed Beast. You know this, too.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
113	They are buying time. Just as the phrase suggests, they are paying for it—with their lives.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
114	What we must do now is not waste their fleeting defiance and fragile blades.
115	That's...!
116	Blacksmith Yna.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
117	Yes?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
118	Forge the Gear of Judgement with the aid of your master.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
119	There is little time. Complete it by sundown.
120	But who will wield it when it's done?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
121	I will.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
122	You?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
123	Am I inadequate?
124	Not at all...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
125	Then it is settled. Will you go along with this plan as well, Roh Ku?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
126	Heh. I have no objections. I am a little interested in the skill my apprentice has miraculously gained overnight.
127	Master, I...
128	There is no need to explain, Yna. We are blacksmiths who seek the truth hidden within iron and fire.
129	To me, you have become worthy of inheriting my name. That is enough.
130	I understand, Master.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
131	Sorry, Nimul, but I will make that gear after all.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0035
132	Yna...
133	It looks like the young blacksmith has decided. What will you do, traveler?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
134	You said that the townspeople are buying us time by fighting?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
135	Most likely.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
136	Then I...we...should launch the airship and head towards town to help buy that time!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
137	We have always fought to save as many people as we can.
138	I have no intention of deviating from that path now!
139	My people do not fear death or pain. What we hate is the shame of not fighting.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
140	And yet I should ignore our ambitions to save them?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
141	The power to do so is in our hands.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
142	Very well.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
143	I will needlessly save them even if they do not wish us to. To achieve the future you envision.
144	So...that is the secret of your power.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0046
145	Huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
146	I am amazed that you can hold so much greed within your thin frame... I've taken a liking to you.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
147	I will concede that that is also a strength. I shall not stop you. And my soldiers will not stop you either.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0038
148	Show me what you can do until I receive the gear the blacksmiths make and can return to the battlefield.
149	Of course, that's what I intend to do.
150	Sorry, Nimul. I'm counting on you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0035
151	Right. And I you, for the Gear of Judgment.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
152	I apologize for dragging you all into this when you came all this way to save us, but right now—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
153	We understand.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
154	You want to save this region just like you did ours, right?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
155	Then I have to help you out!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0007
156	It's the perfect time to pay you back for everything.
157	I suppose I'll help as well.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
158	A witch who can control magic with her bare hands is very valuable now that we have no Gears of Judgment, right?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
159	Very much so, Ambrosia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
160	And you...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
161	Do you detest me, Pursuer of Gluttony?
162	I do have much to say to you, and sins I want you to atone for.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
163	But we don't have the time for such things now.
164	I don't know what your intentions are, but if you truly want to be an ally as you say, I'll be certain to make full use of you, Zafeiris.
165	Very well then. This body that has mastered the dragon technique...
166	I will use it for your purposes this one time.
167	That is well and good, but won't it be I that is doing all the work?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
168	Of course. I currently have no body of my own.
169	In order to manifest my power in this world, I need a catalyst.
170	Right...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
171	That is good enough. Although, I am still unsure of my control.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
172	I am containing the corruption. You may use my powers to your hearts content.
173	.........
174	Huh? Waginau, how did you find yourself in such an interes...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
175	A difficult...situation? Is it fusion? Coalescence? Are there any side effects?
176	Your true priorities escaped you for a moment, didn't they?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
177	No, not at all!
178	Truthfully, I have a lot of concerns, but for now, let's focus on what we can do.
179	Minario, set the airship's course for the Avaritia Belt's city center!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
180	Roger!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0038
181	Let's get this show on the road! I'm not as responsible a driver as Adaleigh, so hold on or you'll go flying!
182	There they go.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
183	In order to save people. A reason that we do not value.
184	Power always comes to those who have a reason for it.
185	I shall never let all the blood spilled here be for naught!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0042
186	E-excuse me!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
187	Skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
188	Young blacksmith Yna's sister, aren't you? What is it?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
189	Um, I... I'm always being helped by others! Which is why...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
190	You want to be of help but do not know how.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
191	Yes. That's right.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0004
192	If that is the case, you should have gone with the travelers.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
193	That's... But I'm weak and my brother would have stopped me.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
194	Yes, I can see that you are weak.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
195	Oh...
196	Still...
197	If you have the will to fight, you should fight.
198	Huh?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
199	The word "helpless" is the conceit of the weak. At least, in this region it is.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
200	W-well, um...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
201	Listen well, girl. Avaritian soldiers do not start off strong.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
202	There were times when they too were shielded and protected.
203	Even you, Lord Kubera?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
204	Indeed. However, I desired power, the determination to battle things stronger than myself.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
205	That is the way of life we've carved out for ourselves here.
206	Fighting, growing stronger, overcoming. We take control of hardships and despair through power!
207	Our predecessors understood that there are things that we could not protect without doing this.
208	Greed is the true nature of man. If so, if we want for things from the moment we are born...
209	We must face it. We must fight against it.
210	So what will you do? What will you spend your life on?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
211	I...will...
212	Skrah!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
213	Eeek! The F-Fallen?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0026
214	But they seem different from the ones like me, back in town.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
215	This may be an effect of Mammon.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
216	They are nothing but mindless automatons born from the miasma of the Beast.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
217	They are beings different to those of us who fall to sin.
218	Grroogh...want...want...
219	...!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0027
220	Skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
221	Th-thank you, Luke!
222	The miniature dragon.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0044
223	After fighting that traveler, you have learned how to control the corruption?
224	And now you use it to protect her?
225	Skree skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0053
226	What an interesting bond. Is this the reshaped future that boy Nimul desires?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
227	Th-they're coming this way!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
228	They are nothing but wraiths that lack the will to fight and yet still contain want. What a pitiful existence.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0030
229	Fall back. These will take one swipe of my hardened blade.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
230	Huh? Um...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
231	No!
232	Hm?
233	I-I'm! I'm also from here!
234	I will do my best, too!
235	Skree skree!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_sys_0051
236	Heh.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
237	I have no interest in protecting the weak. If you are prepared to die, then follow me.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
238	Yes, sir!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
