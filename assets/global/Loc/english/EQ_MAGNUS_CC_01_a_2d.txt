001	I didn't think there really were allies of justice in this world.
002	After all, nobody helped me when I was starving. Where I'm from, everybody was so poor, they didn't have the means to help themselves, let alone anybody else.
003	But complaining wasn't going to fill my aching belly, and...pretty soon I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to do something to alleviate the suffering of those around me.
004	So, if an ally of justice wasn't going to come along and save us, then I would just have to step up and fulfill that role myself!
005	When I learned that our hard-earned taxes weren't going to come back to us, I became more determined than ever. I fought even harder to make a change and, eventually, those efforts led me here.
006	Without any further ado, allow me to present to you the newest members of the Holy Guard, who will be joining our ranks as of this year. Paladins, when I call your name, please step forward and say a few words.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
007	Look at all these fresh faces! Full of dreams of protecting the weak, saving the world, and fighting on the side of justice... So young, so inspiring.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
008	If you say so. Every fresh batch of new recruits looks exactly the same to me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
009	Oho! I wouldn't be so sure about that, if I were you. Take her, for instance.
010	Next, please step forward... Ryui!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
011	That's me!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0037
012	Hello, everyone. It's truly an honor to be standing here. I will be training night and day to prove my worth as a paladin.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
013	No matter what trials I may face, I vow to always devote myself to the cause.
014	She's certainly enthusiastic. Wasn't she the one you personally scouted?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
015	Yep. She shows promising talent, for one, and for another... Well. I had my reasons.
016	Oh?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
017	Ahem. Good! Now, we will shortly be holding a mock battle.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
018	The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to display the strength and range of your Alchemy abilities to your superiors. You would do well to make good use of this valuable opportunity.
019	On a different note, what is keeping those two? I did tell them that we would be getting new recruits today.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
020	Actually, I don't know why I asked. I have a fairly good idea of what they're up to.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
021	All right! This is my chance to improve my quality of life! Sorry, guys, but I'm not going to hold back!
