001	You don't know when to quit, do you? And I see you've brought a swarm of flies with you this time.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0030
002	Which means the research material here must be of particular significance.
003	Aaagh!
004	Was... Was that the last of them? Honestly, I've about had my fill of these interlopers!	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0022
005	Agh! Curses!	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0019
006	Yaaaah!	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0032
007	Urgh! Wh-where did you...?
008	You again!
009	I just can't seem to shake you. Come to finish me off?	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0011
010	Actually, we came to investigate a suspicious battle taking place near the Envylian border.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0002
011	In doing so, we noticed a sole combatant standing her ground against a ludicrous number of aggressors. We couldn't exactly ignore that, you understand.
012	You led your pursuers out to this remote location so as not to catch any civilians in the crossfire, didn't you?	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0030
013	And this... This is what you've been doing, constantly, since leaving the knighthood.
014	No matter where we go, we just can't seem to avoid hearing new rumors of the Ruinmaker's exploits.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0006
015	Is that so?
016	You asked me if I liked flowers. The question is, do you?
017	I do. They help me forget all the hate, if but for a fleeting moment.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
018	He loved flowers too.
019	And I'm sure for him as well, they served to help calm his nerves as he struggled, day in and day out, to find some means of ending all the war that mires this land.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0004
020	I know not from whence the hate you wish to forget originates, but I can at least be a comrade in arms, fighting alongside you to achieve our shared goal.
021	Interesting. I've underestimated you. It would seem you are true knights, of the most honorable variety.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0007
022	So, is your fight ended?
023	Unfortunately not. The struggle continues.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0016
024	I've destroyed the most crucial documents of those experiments, but some of the information contained within them yet survives...in my head.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0003
054	To put it simply, I believe I am the most volatile threat to peace now. As a result of my mission, I am being pursued, and this pursuit has the potential to incite great violence.
055	You don't seem the type to disclose any information even should you be tortured, though. But I suppose your pursuers may not be quite so convinced of that.
025	Well, there are also a few less critical documents I have yet to find. But the task of locating and disposing of those is about the limit of what I can still accomplish before the tides turn against me.	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0022
026	So that will be the end of your mission, then? I see.
027	Should I happen to come across any such documents, you may rest assured that I'll gladly burn them in your stead.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0005
028	Not for you, mind! But in the name of peace.
029	That would be greatly appreciated.
030	Lamia!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0025
031	You're here too?
032	I heard you were fighting around these parts.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
033	I've issued a general evacuation of the closest village. I figured this would be your preference, all else being equal...to keep the populace safe from harm, just in case.
034	And of course, it's my preference as well.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0006
035	Lamia...
036	No civilian has been harmed thus far, and all are now under the knighthood's protection as a precautionary measure.
037	You've done good work, Lamia. You've proven yourself to be a capable knight indeed.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0044
038	I owe everything to your guidance.
039	Hah! I barely taught you a thing.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0039
040	You fight a battle to bring an end to all conflict, and claim that you've taught me nothing? No, no! In my eyes, you are a jasmine.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
041	Which, in the language of flowers, means...?
042	A bringer of great happiness.
043	I fought by your side to end all wars, and in the time you spent training me, I came to truly understand the gravity of your mission.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0001
044	And I cannot overstate what a model student you've been, Lamia.
045	Perhaps I need not even put my final wishes to words, as I'm certain you have some inkling of what it is that I want you to do for me.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0003
056	But allow me to say it still: I want, more than anything, for you to be the one to remove this overt source of conflict from the world. I want you...to terminate me.
046	Wh-whoa, hold on a second, here! What do you think you're doing?!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
047	Stop, Lamia! She's in no position to put up a fight! If you do this, you'll be the one who—	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0015
048	It's fine, Priscilla. This is what I want as well.	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0020
049	But, that...!
050	Let's go, Priscilla. There may yet be hostiles in the vicinity.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0030
051	This is a significant moment for the two of them. We mustn't disrupt it.
052	N-no! If we don't, the Ruinmaker...Theresa will...!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
053	I appreciate everything you two have done for me. Now, come at me, Lamia! I'm ready!	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0007
