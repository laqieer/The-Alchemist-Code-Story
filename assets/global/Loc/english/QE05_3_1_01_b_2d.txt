001	I never thought we'd be tasked with slaying monsters after all this.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
002	That was quite a sight. Your leadership, your maneuvers—all of it was no less impressive than that of an official military force.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
003	And you are?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
004	Me? I suppose you could say that I'm a sort of guide sent by the guild.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
005	I'm not sure what you're looking for here, but the desert is a vast place. You'd be better off with a local guide.
006	Well, that is true.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
007	However, I feel like that would be asking too much from your guild.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
008	Don't worry about it. We were in need of some extra hands anyway.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0008
009	We provide you with supplies, and you provide us with an army. This is a win-win situation.
010	Come to think of it, I haven't introduced myself yet, have I?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
011	I'm Logi. Logi Crowley. And you are...?
012	Me? I'm...Isidore.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	It's nice to meet you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0007
014	Same here. Who knows, this may end up being a long-lasting partnership, for all we know.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
