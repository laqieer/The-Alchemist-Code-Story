001	Useless...
002	Taste THIS!
003	It's up!
004	This one's all yours, Godslayer.
005	Miss, and you'll WISH you were dead.
006	You'd like to see that, wouldn't you?
007	I'll show you why they call me Godslayer!
008	Eliza's cannons obliterate the incoming volleyball before it ever touches her.
009	...What the?!
010	That's not part of the...
011	...
012	Good work, Lucan, Alymere.
013	I concede defeat. All units, withdraw.
014	...My Queen? Are you all right?
015	That wasn't a direct blow to the head, was it?
016	Would I still be sitting here if it was? Ugh.
017	Obvious answers aside...you've done well. Both of you.
018	Now, I have things to get back to. You may spend the rest of your little "break" here...
019	But cause any further destruction and I'll revoke your access permanently. Am I understood?
020	I...uhh... What was that all about?
021	Did she just tell us to enjoy ourselves?
022	It would seem so.
023	I'm more surprised this turned out well at all.
024	And just who was responsible for goading her?
025	You say that as if you weren't the one who drew her face on in the first place!
026	It'll be too soon before I rid you from my sight.
027	You wish, sister. We're not done yet.
028	Lilith pulls a new volleyball and a marker out of her bag.
029	Round two?
030	*sigh*
031	As you wish, you naughty little sinner.
032	- Goetia, Lost Blue Sub Base -
033	Hmm... All right. That will be all for today.
034	I will send for Nesha later when the financial report is ready.
035	Understood, my Queen.
036	Eliza flips through the report and data assembled from the day's observations.
037	So it is true. The living weapons seem to be changing their hosts on a biological level.
038	In fact, it might even be symbiotic at this point...
039	My purpose is servitude, my lady.
040	Test subject "Red VI" has yet to be assimilated.
041	Statistically, where all previous hosts have succumbed to Berith's...appetite, test subject "Red VI" alone remains operational.
042	Hm. In that case, this "Red VI" should make for an interesting control case...
043	I suppose we should proceed with the redesignation sooner rather than later.
044	Now that the day's unpleasantness is over...
045	Eliza drums her fingers on the armrest, smiling at the thought of her stuffed toys.
046	Perhaps it is time for a tea party!
047	It's summer, so...maybe some refreshing iced tea?
048	They won't believe what happened at the beach today...
