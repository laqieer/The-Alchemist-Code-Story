001	After making sure to lock up, the trio make their way towards the location marked on the map.
002	Despite the clean sketching and numerous labels, they ended up walking in circles a few times before finally coming within sight of the area.
003	Haphazard ruins stand like lone survivors of a bygone era, a stark contrast to the overgrown wilderness around them.
004	How... how did Teach get this far without actually looking for it?
005	You say that as if you don't know her...
006	It feels really nice here... it's such a nice change from Slothstein.
007	You don't like the city?
008	I've only lived in a village my whole life, so the city was a little much for me.
009	I see. You prefer being surrounded by nature, huh?
010	I guess you could say that.
011	Meep!
012	Ehehe.
013	Roxanne watches Soren wander off toward the ruins, tracing his hand across its dusty surface and examining it.
014	Wonder what this is doing out here in the middle of nowhere. An old tomb, maybe?
015	Oh, that will definitely catch Teacher's attention. The more ancient, the better.
016	(That's weird... something about this feels familiar.)
017	Did you find something?
018	No... but...
019	Hey, Soren?
020	He wandered off... hey, don't go too far, you hear?
021	Man, he sort of resembles Teach.
022	Can't wait to see the look on her face when we find her.
