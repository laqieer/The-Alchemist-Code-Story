001	Whew! Looks like we managed to scare them off.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0004
002	...
003	What's that weird face for?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0001
004	(Weird face?)
005	N-no reason.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0021
006	You know something, don't you?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0025
007	Eek! W-well...	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0019
008	So it isn't snowing where the Maruda Tribe lives, either?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0003
009	That's right! Snow is essential to the Maruda Tribe's Winter Holiday celebrations, too, you know!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0002
010	That's why we're here. We came to see what's going on with the other countries, and to check out their Winter Holiday celebrations while we're at it.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0003
011	Oh!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0044
012	Now you find that it's not snowing here in Slothstein, either?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0030
013	It's really weird. What could be causing this? What to do, what to do?	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0001
014	At this rate, we won't be able to give the children of the Maruda Tribe the amazing Winter Holiday they deserve!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
015	Hmmm...	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
016	Tell me something, Klima. Is the Winter Holiday really so wonderful?
017	Huh? Well... I think so. It's an event for children, but I look forward to it every year, too.
018	I guess it's kind of like a festival? Everyone gets together to eat delicious food and celebrate!
019	That's right!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
020	Not only that, but Santa Claus gives presents to the children who were good that year!
021	Oh, my! How interesting.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0009
022	You've never celebrated the Winter Holiday before, Birgitta?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
023	No. I was never able to experience such festivals as a child.
024	Aren't you...still a child?	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0020
025	Oh? You think I can receive presents from Santa even at my age? He must be an extremely generous man.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0008
026	Huh? What do you mean?
027	Hey!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0002
028	Oh, you're back! What did you find?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
029	Everywhere is the same! There is no snow falling anywhere you go. That's awfully strange, isn't it?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
030	It's definitely weird, but we still have absolutely no idea about what's going on yet.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
031	Hmm...?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0044
032	Birgitta? What's the matter?
033	I felt the flow of Alchemia. It appears as if someone is meddling with things in the sky.
034	In other words, someone's keeping it from snowing?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0045
035	If we follow the flow of Alchemia, we might just be able to find out who is responsible for this.
036	Umm... What's going on? The weather isn't really one of my specialties, so I'm a bit lost.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
037	I know! Why don't you guys take care of that while we start getting everything ready for the Winter Holiday?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
038	I guess we won't be having our hunt for Santa this year... How sad.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0022
039	That is indeed disappointing.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
040	Keep it together, you two.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0030
041	Very well. You may leave it to us. Let's get going, shall we? This way!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
042	W-wait a minute! That's the way to the Maruda Tribe's village!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
043	The place where the guardians of the Winter Holiday live... I wonder what's going on over there?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
