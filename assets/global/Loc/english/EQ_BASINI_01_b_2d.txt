001	Sir! Look at this!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
002	Is this an ancient mural? I've never seen one in such good condition.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
003	(I recognize these designs from Lord Zain's notes. They match the descriptions of something discovered by the Crimson Dragon, Kaya: the 'Cursed Beasts'.)
004	(But that discovery made Kaya a wanted woman. And that means...we're in danger.)
005	Agh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
006	Damn it! Hold your ranks, men! Fall back, on the double!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
007	Sir!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
008	I'll guard our retreat! Go!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003

010	Who goes there?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
011	Carlotta?! But if you're here, that means...!

019	No! That isn't what I...!
014	Your motives are irrelevant. All that matters is that you threaten the order of this world.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003
015	...
016	Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
017	Irene...
