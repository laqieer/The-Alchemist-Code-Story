001	We're going to finish this today! Hyaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
002	All that's left is the wind core!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
003	All right! Let's follow through with the promise we made! We are going to be the ones to finish off the dragon and save this land!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
004	Wind's specialty is funneling power. I will use it to forge this wind into something that can obliterate the fourth and final core!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
005	Tina...
006	Mocca, get set! You, too, Tamis! Rega!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
007	Raaaaaaarrrgh!
008	The dragon's caving in!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
009	We don't want to get trapped under the rubble! Hurry to the exit!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
010	...! It's...stopped?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	What's happening? I thought we were finally done.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
012	...! Could it be Beelzebub?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
013	Beelzebub! That must be it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
014	Mocca... Tina... Am I missing something?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0006
015	It's simple. To truly end all of this...we'll have to head to the right place.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
016	The right...place?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0001
017	The heart of all cores. That's where we'll put an end to this.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
018	So this is where you've been hiding, Beelzebub!
019	I knew it. Beelzebub is animating the dragon in place of the cores!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
020	No matter. We can purify it now that we have the Wind Matter!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
021	We'll find a way to coexist with nature, at last! This time... Together... Once and for all...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
022	...
023	Asena...? Why are you protecting Beelzebub?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
024	Why's it...taking the form of Asena?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0020
025	Are you trying to tell us we don't have what it takes to protect Saga unless we can beat you?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
026	It's just an illusion—a shadow, and nothing more! We must free Asena from this confinement and let her rest in peace!
027	The obstacle we have to overcome to pay for our mistakes and set us on a new path is standing right before our eyes!
028	This is truly it! The last hurdle to saving Saga! The future is brimming with light! Let's grab hold of it with our very own hands!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
