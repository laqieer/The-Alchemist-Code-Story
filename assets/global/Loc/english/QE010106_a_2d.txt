001	Wait, Sabareta!
002	Let me talk to Dias! I'll do everything I can to persuade him that we need to stop needless conflict—
003	That won't be possible.
004	After all...he's already wiped out all of the Lizard Brigade's scouts.
005	What? Why would he do something so terrible?!
006	You should open your eyes a little more towards reality.
007	Right now we are at war. It's normal for enemies to kill each other.
008	That's terrible!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
009	Well, well...	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0030
010	You said you would protect those of us from Wratharis and stop this Dias brat. Were those words a lie?
011	N-no, they weren't!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
012	Then, instead of moping over what's happened, think of what we should do now.
013	...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
014	Let's hurry onward!
015	Our priority is to get to the gates of Castle Valderik and have an audience with the King!
016	Well, there you go. Honestly, you're one troublesome bodyguard.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
