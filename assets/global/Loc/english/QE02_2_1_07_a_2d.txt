001	Really not good! At this rate, they'll catch up with us! Come on, go faster!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
002	Hey, hey. You're asking for a miracle. I can't go any faster. In case you can't hear, my pal has been screaming in pain for some time now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
003	We're overweight, aye. It's pretty amazing that we're running at this speed.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
004	Edgar! There are Hounds closing in from the front as well!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
005	Tsk! Looks like we won't be able to out-maneuver them much longer.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
006	Bzz... Please...leave me behind.	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0011
007	What?
008	If you go straight ahead...you'll reach the Central Information Administration.	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0012
009	And what are you planning on doing?
010	Planning?
011	Bzz... I am a defective item that should be disposed of... I will surrender to my former fate and allow myself to be destroyed.	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
012	I see...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	You can't let it do that, aye! The Alkaroid helped us!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0015
014	To cut off a collaborator like that... You failed to move me!
015	Heh... You don't get it, do you? This android isn't our collaborator.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
016	How can you say that! Even if it's an android...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
017	You seem to be misunderstanding something, little lady.
018	Huh?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
019	It's trying to sacrifice itself in order to save us humans...
020	That's not called a collaborator. That's called a friend.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
021	A...friend?	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0014
022	Oh, Edgar!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
023	There's no way I'm going to leave behind a friend. Right, Alkemono?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
024	You've moved me, aye!!!
025	Do you have a name?
026	Bzz... My official name is AJ10.	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0015
027	Hey, hey. We're friends now. Official names aren't necessary anymore.
028	Right. Let me see... AJ10... Eijiten... Ejeten...
029	I've got it. From today you're Ejitan!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
030	Eji...tan...?	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0016
031	...So lame...	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0029
032	Wh-what?! How can you call a name like that lame?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
033	You failed to move me.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0022
034	Tsk! A-anyway...right now, you're our friend!
035	You're not defective nor should you be disposed of! Do you understand?!
036	Bzz... Unable to...understand...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0017
