001	Incredible! I see that the dragon who smote the raining boulders at the world's end is as powerful as ever.
002	You must have been underestimating me to presume any differently. We seven great dragons maintain the Truth of all dragonkind. You lot cannot hope to influence me with your weak manifesto.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0010
003	That may be true, but we can at least stall you for time.
004	You... No, you didn't!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
005	Another detachment was headed for Lady Schmeier alongside us. They are surely neutralizing her as we speak. It's a tactic we learned from those humans.
006	As long as we keep you preoccupied, the Dragon of Wisdom should prove effortless to capture.
007	A diversion! You conniving toads!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_battle_0019
008	Schmeier! Lil! Where are you?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
009	Hnng...
010	These must be members of that detachment. Did Schmeier do all this? Where could they be?
011	Y-you're late...Zafeiris.
012	Schmeier! Those wounds...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
013	I...messed up. Heheh. I guess I've lost a bit of my edge during this brief window of peace.
014	Fortunately, these shouldn't be fatal, though they do hurt quite a bit.
015	Where's Lil?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
016	As soon as I saw the raid coming our way, I put her through the Transporter and sent her out to the settlement where Claybelle lives.
017	You let her go alone?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
018	I had no other way of protecting her.
019	These are the coordinates where I sent her. Go, Zafeiris! Help her!
020	What are you saying? You're coming with—	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
021	Surely you've heard. Ophioneus has gone on the offensive.
022	Lil will not be ready in time at this rate. We need to expedite our plans.
023	She must go on a journey. She must see the world and those who inhabit it.
024	But she's still far too young to do this alone. She'll need a guardian to watch over her.
025	...
026	Come, now! None of that silent treatment this time! This is what you're best at.
027	I... I can't protect her.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0018
028	You leave this to me, and it'll turn out just like before, on the day of that great calamity. I'm certain I'll—
029	Don't doubt yourself, Zafeiris! You're more capable than any of us. I believe in you.
030	Please...take care of our little girl.
031	Wait! No!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_battle_0019
032	I'll handle things here. Go! Don't let our hope die off alongside our species!
033	Schmeier!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
034	What she needs now is experience. This journey will help her develop and learn.
035	So, please. I'm begging you.
036	All right. Let's get you on your way...
037	Lady Schmeier! Prepare yourself!	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0003
038	You lot really don't know when to give up, do you? Why must you be so uppity? Indolence is good for the soul every now and again, you know. You'd enjoy life a lot more if you took things in stride!
039	There's far too much at stake to be idle!
040	Lord Ophioneus has declared that the destruction of the Shell of the World is the only way we can complete the process of creation.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0004
041	We shall be the foundation for the coming new age of humanity. That is the atonement required of us, as the sinful predecessors to those who inherit our legacy.
042	We have perverted this world, and this is the least we can do to make amends!	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0006
043	I see.
044	So Ophioneus has chosen to bequeath this world to the humans altogether, instead of living alongside them in it.
045	In other words, he's chosen the path of our immediate destruction. He's given up.
046	And that is precisely why your research is regarded as an impediment to the end we seek.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0044
047	Giving free will to the Shell of the World... You are merely incrementing the obstacles that must be destroyed to achieve our grand design!
048	That's not how I see it. We both want the humans to inherit everything that we have to offer them. I just think Ophioneus' method is the exact wrong way to go about it.
049	So, of course, I'll be retaliating. You will not have her.
050	Then we will do what we must for the future we believe in.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0031
051	As will I.
052	Zafeiris... I'm counting on you.
