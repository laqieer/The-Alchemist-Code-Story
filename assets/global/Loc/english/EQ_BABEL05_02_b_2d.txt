001	Hey, Will?
002	Call me either Mister Will, or Wild Will.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
003	All right. Wild Will it is.
004	Wait, no, don't call me that. Knowing that I made you say it makes it embarrassing.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1020
005	Those guys who attacked you back there...they were using Alchemy, weren't they?
006	...
007	Do people use Alchemy against each other in this time?
008	What's going on with the Alchemy in this world?
009	You know, you haven't told me anything yet. This isn't shaping up to be much of a trade.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
010	I'm asking you for an advance!
011	Make favors, never owe them.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
012	Whatever... Mom.
013	Hey. What the hell is with you, anyway?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
014	You appeared out of thin air, you can't touch or be touched...
015	Ew! Did you try and touch me?! You slimeball!
016	Those strange clothes...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
017	Keep your eyes to yourself, you pig!
018	Are you a ghost? Some kind of supernatural phenomenon? This has gotta be an occult thing, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
019	...
020	I'm a time traveler. I came here from the past.
021	Wh-what?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0021
022	What could I say that would make you believe me?
023	It's not an easy thing to believe.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
024	You're telling me! I can hardly believe it myself.
025	I can't believe that this is the future we desired.
026	...
027	C'mon, answer me.
028	Huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
029	My first question.
030	You wanna know for whom Alchemy was created, or something like that, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
031	Yeah!
032	I'm currently searching for the answer to that question myself.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
033	And I'm not the only one.
034	What do you mean? Are you talking about Albea?
035	I'm talking about a guy who's a bit of a looker and sports the same hair color.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
036	Huh?
037	I guess you could say that means we've all got something in common.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
038	Oh?
039	You're a time traveler who came here from the past.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
040	If you don't know something, you go looking for the answer, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
041	You, y'know...travel.
