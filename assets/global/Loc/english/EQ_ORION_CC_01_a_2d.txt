001	Ngh... I can't fight back!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
002	(I don't do anything to stand out, but nor do I fall behind. I maintain a constant middle ground. But I wonder if that's really enough...)
003	The more I hope—the more I desire—the more is taken from me. Steadily, bit by bit, everything is stolen. All those who come in contact with Mammon are met with the same fate.
005	To become a vessel for Mammon, one must expect all excess wishes to be taken and discarded. It's like a form of self-discipline.
006	Unable to even die, all I can do is cover my ears and close my eyes to the truth of this world.
046	And indeed, no matter how many times I'm targeted and nearly killed, I physically cannot die. I am cursed to live on, through no will of my own, devoid of hope.
047	My life force is continually drained to sustain Mammon, and therefore, Mammon will not allow me to expire.
008	How am I expected to go on in the face of such an existence?
009	There!
010	I walk with death at all times.
011	How does it taste, Lord Orion?
012	Delicious. Your food is always the best.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0004
013	I'm glad to hear it. Please, eat as much as you'd like.
014	Much obliged. I believe I will take you up on tha—	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0033
015	Hngh...!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
016	Bleeeh! Hrp! Bluuuurgh! Poison...? But...why?
017	I've often happily dined with my attendant, who's served me well for many years.
018	But on this day, under the orders of some unknown party, she serves me with the intent to end my life.
048	Ack! Ghuh...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0019
049	Ngh... Hahh... Not again...
050	Please forgive me. This was the only choice I had.
051	Why?! Why must it be this way?!
019	Your mastery has improved.
020	It's all thanks to your teachings!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0007
021	You're quite talented, Orion. Which is why—
022	Ngh!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0022
023	...Which is why someone doesn't want you getting in their way.
024	The officer in charge of my martial arts training often complimented me during our sessions.
025	Then I learn that he had been hired to kill me, and was merely waiting for the right opportunity to do so.
052	Ah, i-it hurts! I don't want to die...!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0020
053	I'm sorry, Lord Orion. I was simply following my orders.
054	Ahh... It's happened again...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
055	H-how can you stand?! That wound should be fatal!
026	Each time I would extend my trust to someone who had treated me kindly...
027	I would be betrayed. And through it all, my body simply refused to die.
056	Over, and over, and over, my kindness and trust would be met with betrayal, and I'd find myself in need of killing those I'd previously trusted.
057	Who could possibly feel anything but despair upon realizing that this is all the future has in store for them?
058	But my despair was irrelevant. The fact remained that I could not die, for death is not what the Sacred Stone Mammon wished of me.
060	Successors to the Greed Dike throne are given an audience with the Stone on the occasion of their tenth birthday.
077	My name is Orion.
061	And when I turned ten, I too met with the Sacred Stone Mammon.
062	The emperor of this nation—a nation in which might makes right—employs Mammon's power to maintain his stranglehold. And on the day of my audience, Mammon saw something within me.
063	Wh-what...?
064	My knees nearly gave out from under me as the surprised cry of the emperor—my father—reached my ears.
065	Mammon liked my power. Mammon desired my power. So it was quickly decided that I was to become the next emperor. But simply choosing the next in line is not how this empire operates.
067	Mammon's greed for someone even more suitable than I forced a full-blown war of succession to unfold—a war of the backstabbing and poisoning sort.
069	But the outcome of this war was decided well in advance. For you see, I was thrown a bone, and granted immortality. This didn't make things nearly as easy on me as one might think, however.
070	I've felt the pain, fear, and sadness of death innumerable times.
028	Poisoning, abduction, backstabbing, assassination... Each time I would reach death's door, but was denied entrance.
029	Even still...if my shouldering of Mammon's torment could shield someone else from it, and bring a net happiness to those around me...
030	If it could save others from the pain of being deceived and killed through little more than the unreasonable orders of someone in the shadows...
071	If there is no escape for me from a future surrounded by despair, then perhaps this existence could serve as a single ray of hope to help mitigate that despair in others.
072	So I chose to endure this hellish torment and set my eyes firmly upon the light, that I may keep the anguish and dread too occupied to bother anyone else.
032	Hey, look! It's the little kitten, Orion! I can't believe he's still alive.
073	(Don't look at me, please...)	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
033	Well, would you look at that? It's the little spineless coward who runs around thinkin' he's fit to be emperor. No kitten can sit on the throne, so go back home to your milk bowl, boy!
034	(Don't talk to me. I'll just bring us both pain.)
074	In this kingdom of Greed, Mammon serves only to sustain the resident despair that permeates its every nook.
075	Sealing that within me is my purpose in life, and grasping at what little light of hope I can glean from that existence is all that keeps me centered.
076	If it means lessening the pain of others, then I would gladly sacrifice my essence to do so.
035	My sword!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0026
036	(Oh, a bird.)
037	(Already the time of year for them to be migrating. I just read about that yesterday.)	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
038	(It must be nice to fly freely through the air... Though there's no point in being jealous. That's a dream well beyond my reach.)
039	And that's a match! Our tournament winner is—
040	(It's finally over. Thank goodness. Today seems to have gone well.)
041	I object to this judgment!
042	?!
043	It is patently unacceptable.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
044	Whoa! Wh-what are you—?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0027
045	Don't talk back to me!	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0001
