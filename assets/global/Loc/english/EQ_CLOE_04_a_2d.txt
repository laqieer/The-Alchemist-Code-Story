001	...
002	You don't have to get up. Just listen. Please.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0003
003	If you were at your best, then you would be stronger than me. Without a doubt, you would have won. I still have a long way to go, after all.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
004	Right now, though, you can't beat me—and I think that's because you're lost, Chloe.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
005	However, I truly believe that you can overcome this. You're a strong person!
006	You may have lost sight of it, but I know that—even now—you hold a great sense of justice inside your heart!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0023
007	...
008	So I'm asking you to leave this to us! Please, stay here.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0036
009	Ngh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
010	Nina!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
011	I-I'm... I'm okay. I have to go!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0043
012	Don't overdo it! You're suffering, aren't you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
013	If you overdo it and get yourself killed, I... I'll...!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0014
014	Don't worry. I won't die.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
015	I have to lead the Scarlet Flame Guard in Sir Gerald's stead. This is no time for me to give up.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0011
016	If I couldn't handle this, I'm sure he'd laugh at me.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
017	Nina...
018	Besides, I'm sure that you're suffering more than I am. I have to do my best, for the both of us!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0031
019	What do you mean?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
020	Your friend... She may not be dead, but that doesn't change the fact that she's not here. It must be hard.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0018
021	Nina, you're...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
022	If someone is suffering, then someone else should work hard and help them.
023	We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
024	What about you? Sir Gerald, he...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
025	That's true. My heart still hurts.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
026	I gave up, though. If I stopped working hard just because I'm sad about Sir Gerald, he would definitely be very upset with me.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
027	I want to keep moving forward.
028	Besides, he was the one who told me that the scarlet flame in my heart will always be there to lift my spirits!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
029	Nina...
030	Okay, I'm off!
031	What should I do?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0022
032	Huzzaaaaaahh!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
033	Don't back down! We have the numbers! Let's overwhelm them!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
034	Tch... They just keep coming.	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
035	Victor! Look out!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0007
036	Whoa! You saved my hide, Nina!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0034
037	Don't get too close to their front lines! We can't risk breaking formation! Natalie, if you would tend to the wounded...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
038	I'm doing what I can, but there's too many of them! At this rate...!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
039	Don't lose hope! If we lose here, who is going to protect Envylia?!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0013
040	So long as the Blue Flame Guard is immobilized, it falls on us to protect all of Envylia!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0010
041	All right! I hear you, loud and clear!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
042	Natalie, I know it's hard, but please keep going! All soldiers who can move after being treated, return to the battle!
043	Now is the time for us to demonstrate our iron will and complete our mission! Let's show them the power of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0032
