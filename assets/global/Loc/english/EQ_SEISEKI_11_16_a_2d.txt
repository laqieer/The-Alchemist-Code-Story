001	Incredible. Any other person would be dead from so much blood loss.	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
002	How could he have been fighting in such a condition?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
003	What are you blabbering on about? If you won't make a move, then—!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
004	...!
005	What's the matter? Can't move?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
006	Wha—?!
007	Three minutes, huh?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
008	What a surprise. We thought you were making bold threats, but it turns out you were just pressed by your physical limits.
009	Heh, you still have no idea who you're up against. Fine, I'll kill you first!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
010	Ugh...! I-I can't...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
011	Your body cannot handle any more, no matter how hard you push yourself.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
012	Nonsense! Urgh!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
013	Don't you dare underestimate me! I am the sun that was born in the sunken city without light!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
014	I cannot lose! My destiny is to win!
015	Let me ask you this.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
016	What?!
017	You are holding your life together with nothing more than sheer force of will. What drives you to do so?
018	What are you fighting against?
019	Heh, all of you have lived such easy lives... None of you will ever understand!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
020	What do you mean?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
021	What I fight against...is this world that allows inequity to prevail! This whole world is my adversary!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
022	Nngh... S-Sol!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
023	The whole world? What are you talking about?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
024	J-just as Sol said... None of you could ever understand.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
025	Rejected by this world, we were not allowed to exist, let alone survive.
026	I bet none of you have ever had to endure such an experience.
027	Not even to exist?
028	The absolute justice you preach is nothing more than naivete. The world we will design will give everybody an equal chance.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
029	At least we will not try to compartmentalize people the way you all have.
030	Any and all people will live equally, as long as they have a strong will to survive. That is the fair world Sol plans to design for us.
031	In other words, a world defined by the idea of survival of the fittest.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
032	That may be the most natural way of life for all living creatures.       	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
033	However, that is a state that the existence of human society itself will resist.
034	What?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
035	Today's society is built on the idea that anybody can pursue a life of happiness.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
036	This world maintains a delicate cycle under that idea.
037	Your ideals are laudable, but if they were to be realized, they would be the downfall of society.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
038	You trying to say today's society is perfect?! A society in which the likes of us aren't allowed to exist?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0012
039	Of course we don't intend on abandoning you. There must be a way we can exist side-by-side and—!	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
040	Shut up!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0013
041	Oh, no! Captain Othima's spell was broken!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
042	Your kind is always the same! Spitting pretty words, but never really doing anything to change the reality!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0040
043	I've seen dozens of comrades slaughtered after falling for these honeyed words!
044	No! I really mean to—!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0022
045	We're tired of these lies! I will only believe Sol, and follow him as he fights on, for us!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
046	Us...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
047	He will never stop fighting for we who have fallen through the cracks of society!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0018
048	He never gives up! He's our light and our hope, the sun for all of us who were cast out of your world!
049	I will not let you get in his way!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
