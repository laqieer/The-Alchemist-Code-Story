001	I apologize for the misunderstanding, Colonel Mustang, Lieutenant Hawkeye. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions like that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0033
002	You, too, Suit of Ar... Uh, Alphonse, right? Wow. People from other worlds really do come in all shapes and sizes... Anyway, welcome to the Continent of Babel!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	Thanks, Ed...gar. It's nice to finally meet someone friendly here.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0007
004	...
005	Hmm... I expect this gorgeous lady over here isn't very talkative. She does seem like the aloof type.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
006	Don't you feel even a little bad for them, General Toritoh? You did put them in this mess, after all.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
007	No. My sympathy is hardly requisite.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
008	Sure, but if you're cool-headed enough to spout off words like that, couldn't you have just talked things through with them? Why break the ice with violence?	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
009	...
010	Per...haps.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
011	Hmph. Well, now we've all had a little breather, it's time for you to start answering some of my questions, Toritoh.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0031
012	Let's start with how you called us "Phantoms". What do you know about human transmutation?
013	Paladins don't give in under duress—but if that's all you want to know, then I am not opposed to answering. However, are you certain that you want me to answer that question?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
014	We've had nothing but bad experiences with human transmutation. It's only natural to be wary of those willing to carry it out so casually.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0022
015	First of all, the words "human transmutation" aren't quite applicable.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0002
016	Our alchemy draws forth the strength of heroes from other eras, allowing us to borrow their power by summoning their souls.
017	Phantoms gain physical forms as part of the summoning process.
018	The age and appearance of a Phantom is dependent upon their soul.
019	This process is quite different from the alchemy used in your world to bring someone back from the dead.
020	I see...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0044
021	In other words, the result is similar, but the approach is different. Interesting.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0044
022	Many things are possible within the theory of alchemy, creating a plethora of techniques...such as Phantoms.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
023	My duty as a Paladin is to safeguard alchemy. As such, I mourn the fact that Phantoms are most commonly used as tools of war.
024	No matter the time or place, it seems that alchemy will always be used as a weapon wherever applicable. Hmph. That must seem ironic, coming from a Phantom like me.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0045
025	There are...extenuating circumstances.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
026	Why am I not surprised? After all, they did put a lot of effort into bringing you here from a different world.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
027	Fire strong enough to blow a door to smithereens and a living, walking, talking suit of armor... The alchemy I've seen you lot use is really out of this world!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
028	The Holy Order is willing to sacrifice a great deal to get their hands on something from your world.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
029	The plan is to create a Dimensional Gate that will connect our two worlds.
030	I have been granted the privilege of taking part in this endeavor as the Blessed One of the Holy Order.
031	Huh. I figured you'd be more like the stubborn, silent type, but it seems like you actually have quite a lot to say about alchemy and the Holy Order.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
032	It is my responsibility as the Blessed One to learn of the role the Holy Order has played throughout history, and to understand its current place to better embody its will in the present.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
033	Blessed One? You don't sound very happy to have such a lofty position. Come on, show a bit more enthusiasm!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
034	I will take that under consideration in the future, if you think it would prove effective.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0005
035	Effective? That's not... Never mind. It's not important.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
036	A Dimensional Gate, huh...? That's way over my head...even if you are all here, right before my eyes...
037	This is hardly ideal. If only our souls were summoned, then what happened to our real bodies back in Amestris? Not to mention our minds! Would we even remain functional?	VO_roy.roy_sys_0016
038	Furthermore, if our worlds were to be joined together, I can hardly see it working toward our mutual benefit so much as to line this world's pockets, so to speak.	VO_riza.riza_chara_1003
039	Miss Toritoh, can I ask you something?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0001
040	What is it?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
041	I'm guessing you must've summoned others as well, not just the three of us.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0016
042	Was my brother one of the people you summoned? His name is Edward.
043	Whoa. His name sounds a lot like mine. You could always give me the big brother treatment, Alphonse!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
044	Um... Thank you for the offer, but I think I'll be okay.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0011
045	Edward... That sounds familiar.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0031
046	Hey! Who're you?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
047	...
048	Ed?!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
049	Oh, yes. He, too, is named Edward. He has been assisting us. I suppose he must have come to escort me back.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
050	Our progress on the Dimensional Gate is largely thanks to this one.
051	Heh.	VO_edo.edo_sys_0010
052	No, that's not him! Whoever that is, my brother isn't inside that body.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_battle_0019
053	I agree. The question is, who is that and what are they after?	VO_riza.riza_sys_0030
054	No need to pile on! Just one look at that guy and it's clear he's not one of you!	VO_roy.roy_battle_0019
055	Your instincts aren't half bad. I'm sure you must have figured out how dangerous he is, too. This isn't your fight anymore. You should escape while you still can.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0001
056	No, it's too late. I'm already a part of this. I'm not the kind of guy who would leave his friends behind!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
