001	We've arrived! So this is where the treasure is buried!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0032
002	Look at the ancient ruins here. I'm surprised that my network of information never picked up on this.
003	Wow. I guess there are some things that even you don't know, Vanekis.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0044
004	Oh, the range of my knowledge is really limited. After all, even though I researched the way to get here, I didn't know anything about those ancient ruins.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0016
005	I guess that's the way it is.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0045
006	Heheh. Yes, that's the way it is. All right then, let's look for the treasure.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
007	Hey...is that the treasure chest?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0002
008	Treasure chest?! Where? Where?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
009	I'm gonna get there first. Well then, let's see what this treasure chest is all about!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
010	Oh! Vanekis, hold on! These kinds of treasure chests are usually booby-trapped!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0021
011	Huh?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0025
012	Is this...poison fog?!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0042
013	Vanekis, don't move! I'll take care of it right away!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0027
014	Oh dear...I was so careless... I'm...sorry...Shenmei...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
015	Vanekis? Vanekis?! No. She passed out...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0021
016	I administered basic first aid, but I need to take her to a doctor immediately!
017	That being said, I don't know how to get back home... Wh-what should I do? At this rate...please...someone help...
018	Mm...mmm...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_battle_0026
019	Oh...Vanekis...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0021
020	Ack! Collect yourself, Shenmei!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0025
021	You're a captain! You need to protect the lives of your crew at all cost!
022	Vanekis, try to endure for a bit...
023	Hyaaahhhh!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0008
024	Mm... Wh-where am I...?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
025	Vanekis! You're awake!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0021
026	Shenmei...what happened to your face? You're covered in wounds...
027	Right...I got covered in that poisonous trap...and you carried me all the way to the town.
028	You seem to have properly regained consciousness. You're gonna be okay! What a relief...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
029	I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused, Shenmei. You saved my life.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0036
030	Come on...I'm the one who should be apologizing. I put my crewmate in danger. I've still got a lot to learn before I start recruiting more crewmates.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0022
031	Who am I kidding; I'm still a kid. I'm not sure I'm worthy of being captain...
032	I disagree. You did an incredible job in completing your duties.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
033	You saved your fellow crewmate. No matter what anyone says, you're the best captain in the world.
034	Thank you, Vanekis!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0034
035	You've got a nice smile. That kind of look suits you better. Be careful...I might just fall for you.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
036	Fa-fall for me?! Well, we're both girls and, um, we should follow the necessary procedures!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
037	Pst...ahahahah!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0008
038	Oh, you were kidding! Don't make those kinds of jokes!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0024
039	Sorry, Shenmei. You're so adorable, I can't help it.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0035
040	That being said, if you keep improving at this rate, I might really fall for you and join your crew.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
041	Whoa! I'm not forgetting that!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
042	One day, I swear I'll make you join my crew, Vanekis!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
