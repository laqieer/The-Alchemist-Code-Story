001	Rat-Killer...?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
002	Ughh!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
003	Finally, you're awake.
004	Wh-where is she?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0003
005	You shouldn't get up. You were out for weeks.
006	Weeks?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
007	You were at the Mystic Tower Veda, weren't you? The residual effects of being in another dimension muddied your consciousness. You shouldn't have been there for so long.
008	Where's the kid that was with me? The therian kid! Where is she?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
009	You should thank her. She carried you all the way here. You were far more injured than her.
010	I asked you where is she now!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0012
011	Not a clue.
012	What the hell does that mean?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0013
013	She disappeared a little while ago. She didn't say where she was going. You know how cats can be.
014	She...!
015	Tch! My body feels so frail.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
016	Well, like I said, you've been lying there for weeks. Of course your body will go numb. Here.
017	What's this?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0006
018	This might help make up for your reduced muscle mass. Just a bit, though.
019	Thanks.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0036
020	But seriously... Fighting your way to the hundredth floor of Veda, then jumping out the side; and this is the extent of your injuries?
021	Two horns... Red skin... You look like a—
022	Hm...
023	(Something's different... Lost Blue just isn't the same, somehow.)
024	Did you hear? He came back.
025	The kid went beyond the hundred and first floor of Veda.
026	Huh...?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
027	He apparently gained some weird new powers.
028	It's said that nobody can stand up against him anymore.
029	...
030	Finally, he has returned. The hero Lost Blue has been waiting for. The one who will bring us light.
031	The one who will become our Sun in this sky-less land.
032	It must be him.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
033	Dead Nine has been replaced. He's no longer our king or our law.
034	Don't look at me like that.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
035	You...
036	I figured you'd be alive. I haven't seen you in a while, so I was starting to get worried.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
037	Nice seat you got there.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
038	Isn't it? One of the corrupt authorities studying Mystic Tower Veda gave it to me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
039	Please. Won't you be our Sun? he says.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
040	You're not bright enough to be the sunny type.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
041	Aww, you don't think this smile is bright and shiny enough?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
042	Not when I can see a dark side to it.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0029
043	Heheh...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
044	So I take it you gained the Alchemy Source or whatever?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0003
045	No, the tower requires much more Alchemia to reach the top.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
046	But there was a little something that helped me get past the hundred and first floor.
047	What?! How?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
048	Uhmmm... My undeniable charm?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
049	Quit joking.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0012
050	[Mystic Tower Veda Fringe Dimension]	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
051	Beyond the hundred and first floor was literally another dimension.
052	Immersing myself in the topological space of the other dimension, I felt like I was being remade from the inside out.
053	Before I knew it, I had some odd new power conceived within me.
054	Though I had to pay a price for it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
055	A price?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
056	It's still not enough. The road to world domination is a long one.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
057	I want you to walk it with me, Dead Nine.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
058	Heh, you know what you have to do if you want me to follow you.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
059	Now don't be like that.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
060	I don't even feel fear anymore.
061	What...?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
062	That's what scares me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
063	Mmph!
064	Violence isn't always the answer, you know.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
065	(I'm scared...but...)
066	I can never lose.
067	For us unwanted outcasts to survive...
068	We have to change this world entirely.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
069	With the fire of violence, I will boil out the indolent masses that turn a blind eye to the injustice of this world.
070	And to do so—
071	—we need rules.
