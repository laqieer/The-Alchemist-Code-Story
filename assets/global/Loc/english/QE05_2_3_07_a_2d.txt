001	That power is...!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
002	Yes. I am one of the few who remain whose roots are the same as yours.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
003	What the heck, dude? You couldn't have said that earlier?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0039
004	In these distrustful times, I figured it'd be easier to show you rather than ask you to take my word for it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
005	I guess it explains why you knew Hawk...	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
006	Yes.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
007	I don't wish to cause you further pain, but if it is possible...could you tell me what happened to Hawk?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
008	Oh... Hawk must have left an impression on you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
009	Even now, I think about how I could have saved him...if only I had been stronger.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
010	...
011	He and I were following different paths. At the time, I thought it was for the best, but now... Perhaps I made a mistake.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
012	If only I had thought to bring him with me...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
013	Or if I had considered that his path might lead him to danger...I could have changed his fate, if only I had been more willing to lend him a hand.
014	That is why I wanted to speak to you, to accept whatever recrimination or bitterness either of you might have held against me.
015	No... Hawk was never the type to hold a grudge.
016	He was a passionate, straight-forward kind of guy. That was one of the best things about him.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
017	Ah...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
018	Now.
019	Wha—?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
020	Where'd that shot come from?! All I see around us is desert!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
021	They're probably using some kind of concealment technique. I'm just not sure how to pinpoint their location!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
022	Whoever it is, they're not alone! Who is doing this?!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
023	It must be the Corpse! They must be taking advantage of the mayhem that Greed Dike wrought to attack us!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
024	What?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
025	Are you serious?! We don't have time to guess at the politics of this mess!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
026	Well, if they're using a concealment technique, they probably aren't able to protect their actual bodies right now. So...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
027	What? You can do that with Spiritbonding?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0009
028	Aim for where the sand is floating in mid-air! We should take them out before the wind blows it all away!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
029	Right!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
