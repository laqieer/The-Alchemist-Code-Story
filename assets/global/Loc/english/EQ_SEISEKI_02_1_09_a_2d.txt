001	What are you talking about, Chihaya?! Why would we run away now?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
002	She's right! We came all this way to save you. We can't just pack up and leave!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
003	Don't come!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
004	Please...everyone... Forget about me...
005	Putting up a fight is useless.
006	...?! You...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
007	Pleased to meet you, Paladins of the Royal Guard.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
008	My name is Zangetsu! I have come for Chihaya, shrine maiden of the lost country of Wadatsumi.
009	So...it's you!
010	Discard your weapon and surrender. If you do it now, your life will be spared.
011	Bwahaha! What a fascinating remark! It's almost as if you think justice is on your side!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
012	You're trying to take Chihaya by force! There's no way you're on the right side of justice!
013	How about we forgo the discussion and resolve this with our swords?
014	Hmph. How foolish. You can't even read your opponent's strength!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0016
015	Yikes! He's summoning monsters!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
016	How dare you assume that the likes of you can stop me! This lot will be enough to finish you off!
017	They're coming!
