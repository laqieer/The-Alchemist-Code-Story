001	Numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0020
002	Hey, are you ok? Are you hurt?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0003
003	I-I'm ok... I got surrounded by those numa numa guys, but they didn't hurt me.
004	Numa numa... How strange... Do you think they were trying to communicate?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
005	Mer...
006	More importantly, what were you thinking heading into the forest alone like that!? 	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
007	I, but...
008	There are always more decorations, but there's only one of you! How could you do something so reckless!?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
009	...
010	Do you have any idea how worried I was!? Not to mention the trouble you put these guards through!
011	...Hang on.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
012	!
013	I understand how you must feel, but you should listen to what your son has to say.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
014	...
015	And you... Don't just clam up. You need to tell your dad exactly how you feel. 	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0001
016	...
017	...I wanted us to make the snow sculpture together.
018	Huh? 
019	But you just did everything yourself. You told me to just watch, but... I wanted to make it together.
020	I know you were doing it to try to win the contest for me, so I didn't want to say anything. But when I heard the decorations never arrived...
021	I just thought that if I brought them back, then we could finish it together.
022	...Even I could tell how dejected you felt.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0045
023	It's so sad to be left alone like that, even if someone is doing it for your sake.
024	...
025	I...had no idea that's how you felt. I was just so focused on the sculpture, I completely ignored your feelings.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0006
026	I know how much you love things from the Maruda Tribe. When I heard about the prize for the contest, I guess I got carried away trying to win it for you.
027	I know I'm always so busy with work that I never have enough time for you. I just thought that if I got you the perfect present, then I could still show you how much I care.
028	But I just ended up pushing you away instead.  I should have paid attention to how I was making you feel. I'm so sorry, Son.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
029	Papa...
030	...But come on. We need to get back to town!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
031	Yeah, you should. I want to take a look around here and then we'll head back too.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
032	There are other guards patrolling the forest, so the two of you should be safe to head back on your own. Be sure to take some time and talk things through on your way back too.
033	...I'm glad they could work it out. You can really tell how much they care for each other.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
034	Yeah, me too.
035	But even so, they still ended up having problems. 	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
036	I guess they did...
037	They were both thinking of each other, but because they didn't communicate, they ended up hurting one another. It seems almost unfair...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
038	I guess it just goes to show why it's so important to communicate your feelings and try to understand the other person's feelings too.
039	The other person's feelings...	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0019
040	No distractions. Come right back when you're done.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
041	...You just won't tell me anything, will you?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
042	...
043	I know I'm always so busy with work that I never have enough time for you. I just thought that if I got you the perfect present, then I could still show you how much I care.
044	But I just ended up pushing you away instead.  I should have paid attention to how I was making you feel. I'm so sorry, Son.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
045	...You're pretty amazing, Ravi.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
046	Huh? I am?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
047	Talking about things is hard. But you understood right from the start. I think that's pretty amazing.
048	...I'm not really sure what's on your mind, but I'm glad I could help you work through it.
049	Me too. So let's head back, already. No distractions, right?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
050	!
051	What is it, Rochelle?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0005
052	...I can hear something coming from deeper in the forest. Sounds like monsters...and beasts?
053	They're all really excited about something. Hearing it, it's like it's getting me worked up too. ...Kishaa!
054	Excited about something? Is something going on in the forest?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0004
055	I dunno. I'm gonna go check it out.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
056	I guess this is one of those distractions... I don't want to cause any trouble for the others back in town, but... 
057	Fun times spent with friends... That's what Ishi wants to protect. I have to make sure nothing interferes with that.
058	...Ok! Let's go, Rochelle.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
