001	Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...
002	Zero... So you ended up going with seven members?
102	I think about whether I'm worthy.
003	It's my duty to look like I know what I'm doing.
004	Make it seem like I foresee events and indomitably stand my ground.
005	Still, my eyes are always following others.
006	Following Vanir when he was around, and the Dead Nine when the King of Lost Blue appeared.
007	I unconsciously followed after those with power. Even now...
008	What would he do? If I were him, how would I live?
009	Footsteps approaching from behind... The pioneer's cross and those who are gone chase after me.
010	I gathered ten. Yet already some are gone.
011	Zwei is no more. I'm to blame for her demise.
012	Drei is no more. Though I have the power to shine as the sun alone, I betrayed him by surrounding myself with comrades.
013	I even suspect bringing in Füry was my attempt at atonement.
014	And Zechs...
015	A person's will is inherited, their dying wishes becoming the burden of another. I've seen it happen over and over again. I know.
016	To overturn the world.
017	I have lost so much chasing this dream, and caused others to lose so much.
018	How could I? I've not had to endure the sort of past that they went through.
019	All I've ever done with my life was fight my own poverty. How could I justify them losing so much for my sake?
103	I grew my knowledge, but I was still so empty. I used big talk to drag them along.
104	I can't help but worry whether if I was ever worthy of doing so.
020	...?! What was that?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
021	How goes the progress?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
022	Aaaaaagh! A monster...from below!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
023	Both of you are so odd, Nero and Vanir. How can you stand to wait?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0010
024	Run! Hurry!
025	Run where?! This place is all that we have!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
026	I've waited long enough! I cannot deny that I am excruciatingly bored!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
027	I provide a trial for those of you who might be worthy! Whether you like it or not!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0007
028	Grrrrrrrr!
029	What is with that surprised look on your face?
030	Eek?!
031	It is a simple thing to make quick pawns out of wild Phantom Soldiers wandering around Veda.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0008
032	What... Huh? N-no, I was just w-wondering how or why you're...uh...f-floating?
105	What a foolish question! To show off, of course!
033	Pitiful humans... Gaze upon my visage and despair! For it is I who shall determine your destiny!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
034	Such an impatient dragon...	VO_eins.eins_sys_0017
035	As soon as the Templars were gathered...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
036	I say we go back to bed.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
037	No. We will see...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
038	Now I alone stand before you.
039	Try and stop me, Sol.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
040	Vanir, do you come?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
041	Or do you wait?
042	Grraaaaaaaarrrghh!
043	Ah!
044	Grrgh! Aaaaarrgh!
045	It is not yet time for the end.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
046	Zehn.
047	The stage is not yet even set. How ill-mannered of them.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
048	I never expected to be lectured on manners by one of Lost Blue.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0022
049	I hail from another land. My family is elsewhere.
050	Then I do not mind if you were to run.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
051	However, this is the path that will lead me to the Truth.
052	...!
053	Have at thee, you rabble. We, the Templars shall send you to hell.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0015
054	Vier...
055	I know. The civilians are being evacuated as we speak.
056	Good.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
057	You don't have to tell me. I know how you like things done.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
058	Thank you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0035
059	Isn't it wonderful?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
060	Leg.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
061	Isn't that right, Acht?
062	On it.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0010
063	Urgh?!
064	Hand.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0004
065	Gyaaaargh!
066	Radiator.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
067	Gwaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh!
068	Please go, Sol.
069	Acht.
070	He's ahead, isn't he? Our first enemy.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
071	Yes... The one who counted ten...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
072	I promise to catch up.
073	Do I look generous enough to let you, human?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
074	Hahahahaha! I can infinitely summon the Phantom Soldiers of Veda!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0009
075	Much like a tower from which the chocolate flows ceaselessly for the purpose of covering strawberries! Hahahahaha!
076	Do you mean like a chocolate fountain?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
077	Yes! That! Ones at parties and such! I can make Phantom Soldiers flow as the chocolate do from those fountains!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0005
078	You are so loud.
079	What?!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0025
080	Grrroooooorghh!
081	A-asteroids?! Here underground?! I-i-i-impossible!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0026
082	Waaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_battle_0025
083	May you rest in peace.
084	Füry!
085	The evacuation is complete. The people of Lost Blue are safe. As is my store's sign.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
086	Well, aren't you the model shopkeeper.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
087	I will keep our family safe, so...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
088	We'll see you later, Sol.
089	I'll be back.
090	We will eliminate the remaining enemy forces.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
091	Leave it to us.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0038
092	Heheheh.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0007
093	You're quite resilient.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0016
094	Who do you think I am?!	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
095	Our enemy.
096	Though I am a mere fragment of my true self, I will not be bested by mere humans.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
097	Show me the indomitable will of humans as your little world falls around you. That is my pleasure, my delight!
098	Oh, I also like sweets, by the way.
099	The end of the world is inevitable, but...
100	You will not be the one to do it.
101	That is our job as the Templars.
