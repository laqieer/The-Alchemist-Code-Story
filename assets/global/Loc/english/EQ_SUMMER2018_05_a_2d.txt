001	Unnngghhhh... I-it's so strong! Wh-what kind of creature is this?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
002	I heard a rumor that an ancient weapon was sealed on this beach long ago, but I didn't think it was true!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
003	That doesn't make any sense! Why would that weapon wake up now?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
004	I can't be sure, but perhaps it has something to do with the concentration of Alchemy in the air.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
005	Not only did you summon those Phantoms, Liz, but we've been using magic left, right, and center—and so have all of the other students!
006	It's not so strange that something like this would happen!
007	Grrroooorrrggghhhh! Grrroooooaaaar!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_c
008	Unnnghh... It's no good! I gotta do something!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
009	H-hey! What are you doing?! Y-you can fly on your wand?! What the—?!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0026
010	Reckless as ever... That's our Liz!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
011	Hmph. I'd like her to keep in mind that we have to cover her back!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
012	Gotcha! All right, time to make you give back that doll!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
013	Wh-what are you getting all worked up about?! This isn't your problem!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0029
014	I was hoping that we could be friends, so I kept trying to catch your eye, and that's why I noticed that you were always cuddling that doll close to you! It must be really special to you, right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
015	Hmph.
016	Wh-what is going on over here?! Are you all right?!	VO_aisya.aisya_sys_0020
017	By the gods...a demon! It is extremely dangerous for her to be so close to it! We must do something quickly!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0026
018	I know! Get off my back!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0029
019	I hope you're ready! I'm going to take back my doll and Lisbeth both!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0032
