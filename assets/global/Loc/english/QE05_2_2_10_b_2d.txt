001	Haha... Hahahahahaha! More! More!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0023
002	No... How can this be? The stone's power should have been purified by Lord Waginau!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
003	Indeed. It was quite the effort to find a way around that! Now, thanks to the Alchemia I have collected, I have succeeded!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
004	You... No! You set the Jam upon the soldiers in order to take their Alchemia?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0021
005	Ah... So you've finally realized. It is nothing compared to what it was before, but with Waginau out of the picture, it's more than enough to destroy you lot!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
006	Urk!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0028
007	Nnghh?!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0022
008	Hahahaha, wonderful! Take more Alchemia; more and more and more! Until I have ascended to the skies!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
009	Huzzah!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0007
010	Do you not understand how meaningless your pitiful attacks are? What is the point of clinging to hope?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0020
011	Let me guess: you have some romantic notion that throwing your life away here is going to buy time for your little friends to get away. How adorable.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
012	What are you saying?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
013	It's about time, isn't it? See for yourself!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0031
014	What is this vibrating sound...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0028
015	Isidore! We've almost reached the Desert Zone!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
016	Great! We must get there as soon as possible, not just for ourselves, but for Kamui and the others!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
017	Ur...gh...	VO_malta.malta_battle_1028
018	Malta?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
019	Malta! Have you regained consciousness?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
020	Miss Malta?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
021	Where...are we?	VO_malta.malta_chara_1009
022	We're at the southern tip of Gluttony, near the border. We should be in the Desert Zone soon!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
023	I see... I'm sorry, but...who are you?	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
024	What...?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
025	That's not a funny joke, Miss Malta!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
026	I'm sorry, I'm just...trying to get my bearings. I'm... Who am I? Why am I in this place?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0036
027	No... It can't be. Amnesia? Could she really have forgotten Kamui, the village, and everything that happened?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
028	Kamui...? Who?	VO_malta.malta_chara_1009
029	No way!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0021
030	You... Just... Listen. You have nothing to worry about. I will protect you.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
031	My hands have been stained with blood, but I promise you that no harm will come to you as long as I—
032	Is this an e-earthquake?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
033	No... I sense that energy that makes me feel like my skin is on fire.	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
034	Wh-what?! Eek!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0025
035	A giant wave of the Jam?! Hisham! Get over here!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
036	Wh-what?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
037	Why did you think we waited so patiently for you to finish all of your preparations?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
038	No... No!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
039	How pitiful! You hoped to save them all, but failed! Yes! This is what I wanted! To see the total devastation on your face!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
040	Ceclidis!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
041	Yes! Let all that anger and hatred build! Who needs compassion?! Who needs light?! This is the true face of humankind!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0009
042	We are all just beasts pretending to be civilized!
043	Uuaaaahhh!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0011
044	Fall into the darkness! Fall and let your corrupted Alchemia feed my Shadow Excelsior!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0024
045	No! Kamui, no! Don't listen to him!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
046	Wh-what...? T-Teona?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
047	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0007
048	Tch!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
049	Urk?!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0022
050	Kamui... Are you...okay?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
051	Teona! Why?! Why would you do this?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
052	Wh-why...? I just...saw Hisham's crying face...in my mind...and then my body just...moved on its own.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
053	D-don't speak! The blood... Teona! Hold it together! Teona!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
054	Forget me... It's already...too late. You should...focus on the battle...now.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
055	I can't just give up on you! I can't... What do I do now?! What is the point?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0019
056	I...was a little jealous...of Hisham.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
057	Heh... I've been training...since I was a kid.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
058	My father was...so strict... I never had...anyone I could...count on to have my back. In that, perhaps...you and I are...similar.
059	Teona...
060	Don't...give up... Kamui, you...still live. Still breathe. Hisham...is waiting for you.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
061	Teona! You're the one who can't give up yet! You haven't died yet!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
062	It's...fine. There's nothing...left that I need to...do... Wait.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
063	There was...that one thing... That rematch with you... Hahaha... Even...at the end, I am...still a gladiator.
064	Come on, Teona. Let's have that rematch. I'll do anything, just don't let go! Teona!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0028
065	Th-that's...a date... Haha... Kam...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
066	Teona? Teona!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0019
067	Are you done yet? It is really beyond the pale for someone like you to keep me waiting like this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
068	You must open the door that bars you from the great Sephiron.
069	You have the power to do so.
070	I see... This is...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
071	Wh-what is this?! What is this light?!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0025
072	What's happening?!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0027
073	I...see... So I was swallowed by the Door of Truth...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
074	So you have remembered everything now?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
075	Yes... In the end, I wasn't able to save anyone or anything. Not Malta, not Isidore...not Hisham, not Teona...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
076	I...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
077	I meant, have you found the answer yet?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
078	Answer...? How could someone like me have any kind of answer? What meaning does my life even have?	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
079	What is this...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
080	This...warmth... Wait, I recognize it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
081	This is the warmth of Sephiron, which had protected us for so long.
082	Protector of the Sephira, last of your line, you have indeed lost all that you once had.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
083	However, there is still something left for you.
084	I can still live on... As long as I live, there is still a chance. This is not the end.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
085	There may still be survivors in the desert, hoping for rescue. I have to believe that! I cannot give up on them yet!
086	No matter how difficult or painful it might be, I must move forward. I swear upon Sephiron that I will save anyone I can!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
087	Is that your answer?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
088	You will choose compassion instead of hardening your heart against the world to protect yourself from pain?
089	Compassion...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
090	In that case, there is no need for a contract. Consequently, there is no reason for you to remain in this place.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0037
091	There is strength within you already. Strength that came from the great tree Sephiron, the ancient Door that has now been lost.
092	Strength...from Sephiron? This warmth is...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
093	Yes. The ancient shamans of Saga once called forth the ancient forest with their memories.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0038
094	In the same way, you will likely be able to call forth the forgotten legacies of those warriors who linger within the Truth.
095	That power is no longer one which can change the world. However, I suspect it is more than enough to change the lives of humankind.
096	Return from whence you came, Protector. Carry with you the hope that burns in your heart. It will lead you through whatever hardship and cruelty you must endure.
097	I shall take you where you need to be.
098	I'm...in the Desert Zone?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
099	Carry with me the hope that burns in my heart, huh...?
100	Then...I shall do as I resolved. I will go and protect any survivors I am able to find.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
101	This is the duty I now choose for myself. This is now what it means to be the Protector of the Sephira!
