001	"This is a message from the acting government of Wadatsumi."
002	"Good people of Wadatsumi, as a result of our negotiations with Greed Dike..."
003	"They have accepted our declaration of peace."
004	"Hence, there is no further need for either country to take up arms against the other."
005	"Wadatsumi will put up no further resistance. Greed Dike will halt their attack."
006	"This is a declaration of peace and amity."
007	"I repeat."
008	"Wadatsumi and Greed Dike have reached an agreement of peace."
009	"There is no further need for either country to take up arms against the other."
010	P-peace...
011	Then it's...over.
012	How can it be...over?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
013	I just want to forget.
014	After...all of that?
015	After I...killed...everyone?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
016	The declaration of peace was broadcast alongside the sunrise. It came before the battle had even begun.
017	Even as I stood there, staring at the piles of bodies that had once been my friends, throughout the nation voices cried out in joy, extolling peace.
018	I-I... I...
019	I-I thought... I was going to use...use their d-deaths to...to cast a spell of peace upon the world. I prayed...for survival...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
020	I prayed that we could...join hands. Talk it out. Find happiness. Find...peace.
021	B-but now...
022	E-everyone's...
023	The silence was deafening. I had no hand to hold. There was no longer anyone for me to talk to.
024	I-Ikasa! Where's...Ikasa?
025	...
026	Ikasa?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
027	Ikasa lay dead.
028	Ikasa!
029	Ikasa was dead.
030	Ungh...nnghh... No... No!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
031	Unghhh... Uwaaaaaaaah! Wh-why?! Wh-why did th-this.. Aaaaaaahhh!
032	At the time, I didn't understand.
033	Y-you promised! You said you...wouldn't...leave me...
034	B-but you did! You just...left. You didn't even...say goodbye. Why? Why?!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0020
035	Found 'em! The Wadatsumi Resistance is over here!
036	Ngh!
037	Surrender, cursed shrine maiden. Your country's pleas for peace have been answered.
038	...
039	There is no longer any need for us to fight. Will you comply?
040	...
041	Hey! Are you listening to me?
042	Hah.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
043	Am I listening?
044	Ahah. Ha...hahaha. Am I listening? Am I listening? Hahah! Am I listening?! Aaaahaha!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0009
045	Wh-what the...?!
046	Yes, I'm listening!
047	Peace? Ahah. No need to fight? Hahahahahahaha!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0008
048	Well, isn't that convenient!
049	Wh-what's⁠—?!
050	You didn't listen to what we had to say before, did you?
051	How many times did we beg to be spared? And how many times did you heed our cries?
052	What're you trying to do?
053	As I recall it...not once! You didn't show us an ounce of mercy! And yet...here you are now. Convenient, isn't it? Well? Am I wrong?!
054	Wh-what the hell is wrong with her?!
055	Ahahaha!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0009
056	Die.
057	Grgh!
058	Ugaaahh!
059	Die!
060	Urk!
061	Y-you fiend! This is a war crime! You're going to destroy this peace before it's even begun!
062	Aha...hee...hee hee hee!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0008
063	S-stop this! You'll be driven out of Wadatsumi!
064	Oh, yeah?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0016
065	How about you just shut up and die?
066	Nnrgh!
067	Die, die, die, die, die!
068	Hee hee. Ahah. Hee hee hee... Everyone's dead now. Everyone should die.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0008
069	...
070	What's that face for?
071	Now we don't have to fight, do we? That means peace, doesn't it? Now it's all over, isn't it?
072	Well? Isn't it?!
073	Are you listening to me?!
074	Ahah... Ahahahahaha! Hee hee. That's funny, isn't it? Isn't this funny?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0009
075	This entire world is one big joke!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
076	Whoop-dee-do, we're at peace!
077	Heed me.
078	Huh?
079	Thou who knows loss and intent.
080	Yes?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
081	Do you crave power?
082	Where are you?
083	Will you heed my voice, rare one?
084	Who are you?
085	My name is Nero. I am the darkness. That is all I know.
086	I am they who would break this world with truth. I am they who would twist the threads of fate. I am power incarnate.
087	Offer me your voice, and you will receive...a revelation.
088	This you must do, if you wish to obtain the power that awaits you on the alternate-dimensional floor within the tower that humans call Veda.
089	Hee hee...hee hee hee...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0008
090	So if I pay the price, you'll give me power?
091	Will you give me the power to right the wrongs in this world, even though I have nothing to offer you?
092	Because I really don't have anything. I have lost everything. I've killed everyone and everything I've ever held dear to me.
093	So? What happens if I can't pay?
094	Will I...break?
