001	Welcome to Slothstein! Ahh, I missed this place.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
002	I feel like Winry would really like it here.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0024
003	Edgar's country of birth...and where his bike was made, too.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0044
004	Well, it's an improvement on Northern Pride, but it's no paradise...	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
005	It's perfect. I can't help but feel like this is a wonderful country.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0024
006	This country has the same rhythm and feel that you and your bike have, Edgar. It's calming.
007	Oh, I see. W-well, I mean, that's fine, then. Haha...ahem. I'm glad that the General appreciates it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
008	So, um...about the towers... I kind of remember something tower-like being built around here when I was a kid.
009	When you were just a kid? Then...it's probably finished by now, right?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_chara_1007
010	I mean, it was over ten years ago. At least we know where it is this time, so we don't have to run around looking for it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
011	Let's make use of this time to prep and eat properly. General, wanna try a cheese dog? It's pretty popular around these parts.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
012	We've arrived... I can't believe this! It's been over ten years! How can they not be finished with construction yet?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
013	Ah... I guess it's about what you can expect from a country named after Sloth. So...the homunculus who guards this tower must be...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_battle_0022
014	It doesn't seem like he's going to come out on his own. This is a good chance for us to take out those guards first!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0031
