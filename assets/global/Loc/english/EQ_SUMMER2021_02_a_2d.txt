001	Have at you!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0006
002	Gaaah!
003	Pfew! We took 'em all down.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
004	Blimey... I'd rather not be doing all this fighting.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
005	If not now, we'd end up fighting them later. We are all after the same treasure.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
006	Even without knowing where the treasure is, it's not unusual for pirates to try to destroy their rivals.
007	All the ships seem to have a general idea where the cave should be, but no one is certain.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
008	That's why all the pirates are circling the same waters. Oh... What do we do?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0045
009	Even with Albea and the others handling security, if we continue on our current path, we're sure to battle more ships.
010	You're right. And if we make a misstep, we may reveal that we know where the cave is.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
011	That would make things very tricky. We best make haste there before that can happen.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
012	Uh, umm...!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
013	Yes? What is it, Su Yi?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
014	Well... I was thinking that we should keep on our current route, is all.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
015	But aren't we sort of taking the long way around? Aren't we taking too long?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
016	W-Well, the shorter way takes us through the path of many more pirates. And this way, we can avoid a lot of conflict.
017	And to those that see us, we may appear to be retreating in fear, so they'll let their guard down.
018	Besides... Given the current and the direction of the wind, we should get there must faster than expected!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0037
019	Very interesting. What do you think we should do, Captain?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0045
020	Of course, I place my trust in Su Yi. I've always relied on her judgment as our navigator.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
021	She thinks through things carefully and chooses the best route, so there's no reason for doubt.
022	...!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0009
023	Continue sharing your opinions, and I'll take responsibility for whatever happens.
024	O-Okay!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0050
025	Well, then... Steady the ship and onward we go!
026	(I see...)	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0045
027	Taken an interest in our captain?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
028	I have... She puts her full faith in others, and handles things differently than I. It's very interesting.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
029	I suppose she does.
040	The way you united the desert nobility is not something Xiao-Xiao could've done.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
030	She is often rudderless and restless. When we first go to a new city, if I take my eyes off her, she'll disappear somewhere.
031	And when she does turn up again, undoubtedly she'll be in hot water over her personal sense of justice.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0030
032	That does seem quite...problematic.
033	Oh, I don't know.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
034	She's the only one that can do what she does, so she's the only choice for captain of the Xiao Shenmei.
035	Is that so?
036	(What only she can do... I'm not sure what that is. Not yet.)	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
037	(But at least... Her crew trusts her through and through. It's remarkable.)
038	...
039	I guess there must be a great many types of leaders.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
