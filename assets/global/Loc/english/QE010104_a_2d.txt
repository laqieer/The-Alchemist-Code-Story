002	Listen, Logi... Power is justice. I'm going to carry my own brand of justice.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
003	In order to ensure that Yuffie's tragedy will not be in vain, I'm going to do whatever I can to protect Agatha!
004	H-hold on...Dias...	VO_logi.logi_battle_0021
005	Will you direct your sword...at father as well?
006	The man who welcomed me into his family when I had none to call my own?
007	Who saved me from the depths of despair and gave me love when I had lost everything?
008	Even now, I think of him as my real father!
009	Th-then...!
010	That's exactly why I must turn against him!
011	...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
012	Because I think of him as my real father, I want him to open his eyes!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
