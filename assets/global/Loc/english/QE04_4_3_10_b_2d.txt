001	It may all end here...but this is also where everything begins anew. No... We're the ones who'll set the beginning in motion! Let's do this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
002	Alia. Tehre. Fuu. Voda... Father! We're going to protect the Saga you've entrusted to us!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1006
003	O wind! Usher a new breeze upon this land of Saga! Haaaaaaaarggh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
004	Beelzebub's radiating light! What's going on?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	It's so pretty...and warm...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
006	Look! The plants... The trees... The land... Everything that was destroyed by the dragon is returning back to normal! Even the people have been brought back to life!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0046
007	Hey, Kiki! Adel!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0026
008	Kiki! Adel! Haha, stop! That tickles! Does anyone know what just happened?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0008
009	I haven't got a clue, either! Wh-what was that?!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0031
010	You did well. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0033
011	Tehre! You're alive!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0026
012	Tamis. Mocca. You've done me proud!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0034
013	Fuu?! But...how?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
014	Voda! How are you—?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
015	One day, you will realize that the world is full of mysteries... Especially when you've lived as long as I have.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
016	How is any of this possible?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
017	For the time being, let us return to the Wind Temple. We must seal Beelzebub before it becomes gluttonous again.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
018	Tamis, would you do the honors?	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1005
019	Yes, Fuu! I'll see to everyone's return with my new wind powers.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
020	So, what in the world happened?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
021	Do you remember when Georgios called Beelzebub a preemptive curse?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
022	Purifying such a curse can cause its effects to reverse.
023	Oh, that's right! He imparted some of his power of purification into it. Then...this was all his doing?!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
024	Not quite. The tempest you summoned at the end was the same power that the Sephirans once held. It was that which purified Beelzebub.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
025	This is the subsequential blessing! Everything stripped from us by the curse has been restored. Triggering the blessing...was my endgame.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
026	Georgios! Thank you for saving us all!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
027	We are only here because you proved that our faith in you was well-deserved. You have my gratitude.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0033
028	I'm so glad you're back!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
029	Hey, Mocca. Don't you think Saga's actually a really beautiful place?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0003
030	Yep. It really is, isn't it?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
031	Tina, thanks for everything! Without you, none of this would've been possible!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0033
032	You've been behind me every step of the way. I'm still nowhere near returning the favor! Besides, no single individual should take the spotlight for this.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
033	We seized this outcome together, and we all deserve to bask in the glory!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
034	Tamis, shall we inform all of Saga of your elevation to Alia at the next Divine Conclave?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
035	Yes, please do. I will do my utmost to live up to the name of Alia.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0004
036	Who would've ever thought there'd be four of us again? I'd wager Alia, too, is overjoyed at the prospect!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
037	Hmph. If you really have the luxury to reminisce about the past, you should be looking toward the future instead. Don't burden the young ones.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
038	There is still much work to be done. We may have neutralized Beelzebub, but the Jam remain.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
039	I'm aware! That's why we're here, putting together a plan, isn't it?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
040	Henceforth, not just the two of you, but all the people of Saga shall cooperate with one another and live in harmony with the land.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
041	Our role is to guide everyone. We must pass down what's happened here as a warning to future generations as well.
042	Excuse us...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0002
043	Tina, Mocca... Are you departing so soon?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0009
044	Yes. Tamis, take good care of Saga for me.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
045	Of course! The climate of the desert can change at a moment's notice, so you look after yourself, too, Mocca.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0037
046	The purification power of the Sephira may be able to completely heal Mocca's curse, but how we can even begin to proceed is beyond my comprehension.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
047	Where there's a will, there's a way. We can't just leave it to fester.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
048	But are you sure about coming along? What about your hawk friend?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
049	Badalf will be fine. I've already decided, anyway...that I'm going you pay back for all you've done for me. The only reason you have that curse on your arm in the first place is because you were protecting me.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
050	You've given me far too much. This time, it's my turn. I'm going to be right behind you, wherever you decide to go!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
051	Haha. You two truly share a wonderful friendship.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
052	Where is Lisbeth?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
053	She's begun her training. Young, she may be, but she's learning at an unbelievable rate—like a bed of coral thriving in water.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
054	Please, give her my regards, and tell her we'll see each other again someday!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
055	I will be sure to tell her. Do you have Beelzebub with you?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
056	I do...but are you sure I should be the one to carry it?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
057	It has been completely neutralized by the combined power of all four Matters. It is merely a stone now.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
058	Truthfully, it should have been returned to Gluttony Foss, but we can't do so until we figure out who should be its rightful owner.
059	With Georgios gone...there's no rush to give it back any time soon.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
060	I can't believe the gall in him. Even though he was brought back to life, he decided to go off on some journey alone, without even saying goodbye.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
061	We will leave it in your care for safekeeping. I hear the Sacred Stones are causing a ruckus throughout the other provinces.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
062	Use your foresight to see what is to come. You will surely understand what kind of role you alone can play.
063	It is said that the Sacred Stones are drawn to one another. They will lead you on your path, to new encounters and new horizons.
064	Yes, I'll make sure to keep Beelzebub safe!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
065	You, too, Mocca and Tina. Be well on your journey!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
066	Oh yeah!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
067	I wonder what Georgios is up to...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
068	Who knows? Maybe fate will see us run into each other again.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
069	Georgios... We're heading to the desert, based on a clue you gave us.
070	The Sephira, who we all thought to be extinct...may, in fact, still exist—just as you survived. We'll seek them out.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0038
071	We're going to find a way to heal Mocca's curse and pass onto your brethren the story of how a man like you fought proudly to honor them!
072	We're survivors. The next time we meet, we'll tell you all about our journeys...Georgios.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
073	Shall we set off?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
074	All right! To the desert...and beyond!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
075	Tina! Mocca! Good luck!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
076	Take care!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
077	See you again sometime, Rega! You too, Kiki! Adel! Off we go!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
078	Tina! Mocca!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
079	Lisbeth! We weren't expecting you!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
080	I came to see you off! Sorry, I would've loved to go with you, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
081	I have so many things to learn from Voda. I'm positive they'll be the key to saving Lustburg from a bind someday.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
082	Don't worry, we know you have your reasons...but this parting feels a tad strange.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
083	I know exactly what you mean: We're leaving Saga, while Lisbeth gets to stay in our homeland.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0007
084	By the way, you can stop your manly strut! We already know you're a girl! A rather pretty one, too!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
085	H-hey! What's wrong with how I walk?! Besides...it's not really something I can change on a whim, you know!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
086	Well, you should do whatever comes natural to you—just like how Saga's becoming one with nature.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
087	She's absolutely right! I'll take you all to the entrance to the desert! Hey... We'll all see each other again, won't we?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0038
088	Of course we will! We're pals, aren't we?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
089	Sorry, this is about as far as we can take you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
090	This is perfect. Thanks.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
091	I've got some unfinished business here!
092	A way to revive the Sacred Stones... It's not like I thought it was going to be easy...but this is getting ridiculous!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
093	The wind's getting dang dry.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
094	I've come here just as the stone urged me to.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
095	Can't say as that I've ever been to a desert before...
096	...
097	The time...has come.
