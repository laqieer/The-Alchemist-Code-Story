001	Haaa...haaaa...!
002	Urgh!
003	Goooooooooooooong!
004	Aw, jeez...
005	This is her power?!
006	So she never truly lost her powers, after all...
007	I think Kasumi must have looked into the hearts of the Demons and the Phantoms...and sympathized with their plights.
008	That's why Alchemia must have started coming back to the village—because Kasumi was bonding with everyone!
009	Kasumi isn't just any Light Alchemist at all. She sympathizes with the feelings of those around her and draws them close; she works to understand her opponent, without attempting to cause them any harm.
010	Kasumi...is the Resonant Alchemist!
011	Whiiiiiin!
012	Thanks, Flappy. I'm going to be all right!
013	Whiiii! Whiiiiiin!
014	What?! The Resonant...Alchemist?
015	We thought of nothing but defeating our enemies, so we summoned Phantoms, and ordered them to fight for us...
016	What are you saying?! It's far too late for— Nngh!
017	I don't expect to be forgiven, but I still want to apologize. I am sorry for my insolence.
018	Dias...!
019	Wh—?!
020	Please forgive me! Setsuna... I want you to keep training me, as harshly as ever!
021	...
022	Hmph... You've gotten good at running your mouth, haven't you?
023	We Phantom Soldiers were not summoned to fight...but to carry out the will of our summoner; to grant their dearest wish.
024	I have heard your wish, summoners... Loud and clear.
025	Zain...!
026	Grrroooooooooooooougghhhhh!
027	Nngh! Why...? Th-this pain...
028	Kasumi!
029	Grrroooooooooooooougghhhhh!
030	Let's go. This will be the final battle.
031	You won't order us to fight?
032	No! I'm not going to give you any more orders!
033	This world will be protected...
034	By those of us who live in it!
035	You heard 'em! So feel free to leave, or spectate—whatever you want!
036	Heads up!
037	Othima...?
038	I get to do as please, right? Well, that's what I'm doing.
039	Indeed. This battle is for our sakes as well!
040	Y-you guys...!
041	We will draw its attention. Take the rear guard!
042	From here on out...
043	It's our own wills driving us!
044	Embrace the light that guides the world!
045	Well, well... Looks like this is the end for you!
046	Upon my honor as a knight...!
047	I will show you my true blade!
048	Your time...
049	...is up!
050	Grrroooooooooooooougghhhhh!
051	Nnnnrghh!
052	Next! Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!
053	Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of malice!
054	Grrrroooooooooooooong!
055	Nnnghh! I-it's...calling...?
056	Kasumi! What's wrong?!
057	But this is... Then... That was you?
