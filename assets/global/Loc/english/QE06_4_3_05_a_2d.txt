001	I grew up hating humans. From the very core of my being.
002	And my sister should've been the same.
003	But one day, she changed. She no longer felt that way.
004	And she was so much happier for it. Her smile was so bright. So, I thought it was okay.
005	If a world that unified humans and demons could make Kaede smile like that, then I swore I'd do everything I could to protect that world.
006	!!!
007	But I didn't, did I?
008	I can't remember what happened after all that. All I know is that my hatred for humans slowly consumed me.
009	It was always with me, at my core. I may have buried it, but it was still a part of me all along.
010	I just ultimately wound up surrendering myself to that familiar feeling. And what I found at the end of that road was...
011	An even greater hatred of humans from another. A rage that desired to destroy everything. One that resonated with the rage I once felt, brought it back to the fore, and made it stronger.
012	What is it I wanted to protect? What was even my goal anymore?
013	I hated humanity so much, and yet...
014	I began to lose sight of who I am...of whom I'd become.
015	You know exactly who you are, though. You just won't admit it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
016	...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
017	I wonder what actually differentiates demons from humans.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
018	I don't have time for you or your stupid questions right now.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
019	Honestly, I think it all just comes down to diet and appearance, doesn't it?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
020	Shut up.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
021	There's only so much you can do about your appearance, but I've lived off human food for a long time.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
022	And I can tell you this much: Celis' meatballs were seriously the best!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
023	I said, shut up!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
024	I... I...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
025	You're being offered an olive branch here. There are people willing to help you. It's okay to let them.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
026	You are not to say another word!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
