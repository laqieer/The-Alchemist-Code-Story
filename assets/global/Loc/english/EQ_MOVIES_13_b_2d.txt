001	Haa...haa...!
002	Run, Kasumi! You must...reach...the Destrolurk!
003	Haaa...haaa... I-I...hope...everyone's...!
004	Grroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogghhh!
005	Ngh! This pain...! N-not again!
006	Nnnnnnnnnnrgghhh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
007	Nnrgh! This sensation...! It must be that girl!
008	This is...!
009	She's found a way...inside our spirits...again!
010	I see... So this must be...!
011	My mind is...unsettled!
012	Argh!
013	Grooooooooooooooooooouuuuuugghhhh!
014	The time of ruin has come.
015	This world will be ended...
016	...and so descend into peace eternal.
017	Bye bye!
018	May our pride follow you to your deaths.
019	Damnit all!
020	This is the end of all time.
021	Without our powers to aid you, you are but helpless fools, incapable of fighting back!
022	Darkness...take you!
023	No...!
024	Kasumi... Kasumi!
025	...
026	K-Kasumi! No! Kasumi!
027	...
028	(This is my town...)
029	(Is that...me?)
030	Kasumi... I'm so sorry. I...brought you this.
031	(Oh!)
032	(That's a photo of me at my school's arts festival!)
033	(She...remembered.)
034	Nngh... Ungh... K-Kasumi... If I had known things would...end up like this...
035	I would have let you...do what you wanted. I-I... I should have let you!
036	(M-mom...!)
037	So please... Please! Please open your eyes! I'll listen to you more... I promise! That's all I want... I just want to hear your voice again!
038	(Oh, mom!)
039	Nnrgh...
040	This is the end.
041	It's over. There will be no need to spill any more blood.
042	No... Not yet... It's not over yet!
043	Kasumi... Kasumi is still fighting. I can tell. That's why...
044	It's still far too early for us to give up!
045	You're going to keep fighting?!
046	Your true sword is stronger than that pitiful blade!
047	Ah!
048	How?!
049	How can you even stand?!
050	For the people... For the land... For the wind... And...
051	For my friends!
052	Ngh...!
053	My will is not so feeble that it would break so easily as this!
054	Heh... You told me not to show off, Kasumi...but that's just kind of man I am!
055	What the hell else am I supposed to do?
056	Never let a girl cry: that's my policy. And nothing in this world...
057	Is more important to me than that!
058	Nnrgh!
059	I might not be able to keep myself from showing off—but it's just like you said, Kasumi. I'm not alone. I'm with you!
060	I'll never let you cry again! So please, Kasumi... Open your eyes! For me!
061	(Edgar...?)
062	(He's been doing everything he can to hide the pain and keep on fighting. I'm sure the same is true of Logi and Tina...and Liz...)
063	(And even...my mom.)
064	(I didn't want to worry her, so I just did what she told me...)
065	(But that's not right.)
066	(I should have told her what I wanted! What I really thought and felt!)
067	This is...? Alchemia! It's coming back!
068	What?! This is your doing!
069	Edgar!
070	Kasumi!
071	That Darkness I felt within me earlier...that was my weakness.
072	I've been using my mom's words as an excuse to tell myself that I couldn't do anything.
073	But then...I met all of you, and you showed me that I have to confront my own weaknesses and hurts, and fight to live!
074	K-Kasumi...
075	I... I want my weaknesses, and my hurts, and all of my being to...to embrace you all!
076	I want to be there for all of you!
077	(Why does my heart still ache? What is this pain?!)
078	Begone with you!
079	Aaaaaahh!
080	P-Pegasus?!
081	Whiiiiiiiiiiin!
082	Flappy...? Is that you?!
083	Whiiiin!
084	Thank you! Thank you for saving me!
085	Kasumi!
086	Ahhh!
087	Liz!
