001	Ultimately, we weren't able to obtain any information on the Fallen. There's no way we can win at this rate.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
002	Sigh... Why am I partaking in this adventure? I wish I could be in Zipangu eating miso ramen.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
003	Have courage, both of you! You can't let the darkness cloud your mind!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0014
004	If the two of you become like that...you're going to break my heart too.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
005	With time, the sun is obscured by the moon, making it appear as a crescent moon today.
006	(...As the sunlight dims, it steals the light from everyone's heart.)	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
007	(Except for <p_name>'s...)
008	Everyone, it's only a little more until we reach the Twilight Zone! Chins up!
009	Why do you know it's just a little further?	VO_yuri.yuri_battle_0016
010	The Compass only shows the direction, right?
011	The strange thing is that...the longer I stare at the Compass, the more I seem to know.
012	Well, it could just be my imagination!
013	Hah... That's bizarre.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0008
014	But, well, if you say so, <p_name>, I'll choose to believe you.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
015	I thought you might be afraid to arrive at the Twilight Zone, Laevateinn.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0010
016	It's not that I'm afraid. It's just that I don't like to be thrust into battle without any plan, especially when we know we're up against a formidable opponent.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
017	If it comes down to it, we can just go into full demolition mode!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
018	You're right. The way that it is now, we just have to use everything that we can.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
019	Everyone, we'll soon arrive at the Twilight Zone.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
020	Prepare yourselves.
021	... ...
022	This is the Twilight Zone? From what you were telling us, I thought it would be a more pleasant place.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0026
023	Yeah. The air seems to be heavy and stifling...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
024	It used to have a much more refreshing atmosphere; a peaceful dimness. Now it only seems to arouse anxiety...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
025	Is it getting even darker? No, is this...fog?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0021
026	(Huh? The fog here is thick...)	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
027	This time you shall fall into the darkness!
028	Huh?! That voice again!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
029	Eeek!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
030	We collided with another ship?! I guess it can't be helped with this dense fog.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0028
031	We didn't collide with them; they collided with us!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
032	We won't be able to advance our ship like this! Let's move it aside!
033	We need to capture the captain of that ship then.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0038
034	Yes, let's go! Amaterasu, <p_name>, hold on!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
035	The three of them board the ship that struck them. However, in the dense fog, they soon lose sight of each other.
036	Yuri! Laevateinn! Where did everyone go?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_2007
037	Did you find an answer, Liz?
038	Oh, Mr. Ant...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
039	We insects...who are under the curse of Asmodeus... Do you really think we can be restored to our human form?
040	Y-yes! I'll...make it happen!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
041	Ack!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
042	Look at you, in a place like this...meddling in others' problems...surrounded by strangers...
043	Come now...Liz...when are you going to make us human again?
044	Uck... We-well...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
045	Are you telling us to wait, Liz? When we could die tomorrow? You're a cruel girl...
046	N-no...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
047	Well then...before I die...
048	Liz...first you shall die!!!
