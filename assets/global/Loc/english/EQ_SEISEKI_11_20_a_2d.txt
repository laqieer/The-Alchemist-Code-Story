001	Huzzaaaaahh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0004
002	Arghhhhhhhhhh!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
003	Haaa... Haaa... Heh. The Greed Dike soldiers are nothing without the Templars!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
004	Wipe the blood off your nose first, little frog.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
005	Sh-shut up!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
006	Revenge Crush!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
007	Wha—?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
008	We may have reinforcements, but there are still many Greed Dike soldiers left. Keep your guards up.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
009	R-right.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
010	Haaa... Haaa... There sure are a lot of them.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
011	Yes. It's a nuisance—but even with their numbers, we can take them out if we do it one by one.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
012	What's going on?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
013	What is it?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
014	It's just... The Greed Dike soldiers are...distracted by something. They've all started shouting at each other.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
015	Don't tell me that those guys are just now feeling the sting of my attacks!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
016	Wipe your nose.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
017	Oh, uh, thanks.	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
018	Everyone! I have a report!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0007
019	A report...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
020	It says that Lord Commander Kanon defeated Orion. It looks like the Greed Dike soldiers got the same report!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0006
021	Wh-whoa!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0046
022	L-Lord Commander Kanon? She did it!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0009
023	Ngh... Ughh...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
024	Hey, are you all right?
025	Y-yes... What's all this commotion?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
026	They're saying that your Lord Commander defeated Orion.
027	K-Kanon?! Nngh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
028	H-hey! Don't push yourself too hard!
029	Kanon... Is she...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
030	Well...that's...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0027
031	What? Spit it out already! If it was as simple as Kanon winning the battle, those guys would be a lot quieter!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0017
032	It's just... The report says that she's now in battle with Captain Kudan.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0022
033	What?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
034	Kudan and...Kanon?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
035	Why would they be fighting?! Can we trust this information?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
036	H-hey, don't kill the messenger.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
037	Kudan...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
038	I can't believe that man. He told me to protect you, and then he just up and left.
039	What?! Kudan said that?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
040	Captain Kudan has chosen a solitary path. It seems that he didn't want us to get involved.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
041	You mean...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
042	He's planning to sacrifice himself to shield us from the calamities that will befall this world.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
043	No!
044	He set out on a lonely path to obtain the power he needs in order to protect this world.
045	You're like his little sister. That's why he said goodbye to you first.
046	Kudan...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
047	Will you go?
048	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
049	He acts tough, but I'm sure that guy is thinking of you, even now. You're important to him.
050	You should be there to witness the end of this lonely battle he chose for himself.
051	But...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
052	Don't get complacent! The Greed Dike soldiers will never be defeated! Come and get it!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
053	I can't leave with the battle still going on.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
054	It's all right.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
055	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
056	Ngh...?!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
057	Wh-what is this light?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0027
058	That's...!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
059	The Tower of Babel is...fading?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
060	No! Emperor Orion?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
061	He couldn't really have been defeated...could he?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
062	It seems that the threat of Nimul's resurrection has passed.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
063	D-don't worry. The battle is...almost...over.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
064	C-Captain Yauras?! Seida?! Captain Othima?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
065	Their bodies are fading?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
066	Unfortunately... Th-this is...the end for us.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
067	We were summoned here by Emmel's soul. Nimul's resurrection has been stopped, and so...our mission...is complete.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
068	No...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
069	It's all right. You've got some fine...warriors assembled...here. You'll...be...fine.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0010
070	What? H-hey!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
071	It looks like it's up to those of us left behind to finish this. Leave it to us!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
072	Thank you. All of you. Rest in peace.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0034
073	I'm...not sure I like the way you put that. Kagura...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
074	Yes?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
075	Bud was right. Y-you have...a duty to watch Kanon...and Kudan's...battle.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
076	Let our will survive! You must make sure that...the next generation...knows how...the justice of this world...was upheld!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
077	Please don't go yet!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
078	The future of...humankind...is in your hands!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
079	It is your duty to...create a beautiful world where everyone has...the right to live!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
080	Make sure our...justice...r-reaches...the next generation!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
081	Wha—?!
082	Th-they're...gone!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
083	Thank you...everyone.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
084	We must remember them as they were.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
085	Indeed. So... What are you going to do?
086	Right...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
087	I'm going to go, of course. I owe them at least that much!
088	Captain Kagura...
089	Chloe, you're free to go, too.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
090	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
091	You're worried about your friend, right? Go on. Go to her.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
092	Th-thank you, Captain!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
093	Hey. You should go, too.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
094	B-but I...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0047
095	You're worried about Kanon, aren't you? If you can't concentrate on the battle, you'll just hold us back.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
096	Th-thank you!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
097	Here I go!
098	Kudan...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
099	This is the last stand. Ready, Kanon? Let's settle this once and for all!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
100	But...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
101	Don't worry. With Orion gone, the Greed Dike soldiers should pipe down. You should focus on sorting out our dispute first.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
102	Captain Kudan... Is there really no way to change your mind?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
103	Heh... I'm not sure that I believe in destiny, but I dare say it looks like fate has brought us to do battle here.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
104	Unfortunately, two kinds of justice cannot coexist in this world.
105	So you've made up your mind?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
106	I have. Let the outcome of this battle decide whose justice this world desires.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
107	Phew... I feel...kinda strange.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
108	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
109	I know it's silly at a time like this...but I'm reminded of when I first joined the Holy Order.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
110	If not for all that has happened... If not for where we are... It almost feels like I'm learning swordsmanship from you all over again, Captain Kudan.
111	What is this ridiculous sentimentality? We may have fought together once, but we were walking down completely different paths.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0010
112	Paths that have led us to this impasse.
113	Yes...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
114	Protecting this world is the duty of all of mankind, Captain Kudan. It's not right for you to be the only one to sacrifice yourself.
115	I'm doing this to save you, too.
116	You're wrong. Protecting the balance of the world is not so simple.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
117	You should continue to be a symbol for the people. If there is to be a sacrifice, let it be me alone.
118	I guess we'll never see eye to eye.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
119	Indeed. As knights, there is only one way to settle this. Let our blades decide this final battle!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
120	I'm ready, Captain Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
121	Kanon, here I come!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0009
122	Huzzzaahhh!!!
123	Take this!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
124	Too soft!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
125	Argh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
126	What are you doing? You should know that weak attacks like that won't cut it against me!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
127	I...remember.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
128	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
129	When you were teaching me swordsmanship... You always said that I lacked the thirst for blood.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
130	You certainly haven't changed. Your blade is still too indecisive. You can't expect to finish off your enemy like that.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
131	That's probably true, but this is how I... How the Lord Commander fights. This is the sword that the world wanted.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
132	Heh... That's the spirit. Now, come at me with all you've got!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
133	All right!
134	So, it seems that you can match my speed now.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
135	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
136	Wha—?!
137	Tch! It's impressive that you can keep attacking using that stance.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
138	Thank you.
139	Argh! You... You got me?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
140	Yup.
141	Ngh! It seems you've improved since we last crossed swords on Ramproad Mountain.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
142	I wonder if this is what Lord Zain and Captain Cadanova were like.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
143	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
144	I heard that when they were young, they sparred with each other on Ramproad Mountain, over and over, for training. It sounds just like us.
145	It does. However...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
146	Yeah... Unlike them, we've chosen different paths that lead away from each other.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
147	Paths that have reached a point of no return.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
148	Kanon, I'm done reminiscing. I'm not going to hold back anymore! Come at me with everything you have!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
149	All right.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
150	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
151	Huzzzaaahh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
152	Kanon! Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
153	Wh-what is this?! Is this really a fight between two humans?!
154	It's more like a battle between a god and a demon!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
155	Is that...Orion?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
156	S-so they really did it... They put a stop to Orion's ambitions!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
157	Ngh! These shockwaves are powerful!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
158	Why in the name of the gods are they fighting?! There's absolutely no reason for the two of them to go at it! Stop it already!
159	Y-yes, but...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
160	They're too evenly matched! How far are those two going to take this?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
