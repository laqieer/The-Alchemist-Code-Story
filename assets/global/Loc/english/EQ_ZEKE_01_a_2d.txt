001	In this campaign, the Blue Flame Guard will be moving out to quell Wratharis' final resistance forces!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0015
002	The rumors say that one of the Deadly Trio, General Vlad the Thunderer, is among them as well.
003	So let's brace ourselves for this mission, everyone!
004	Yes, Sir!
005	...We'll soon be in our first battle.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
006	Don't tell me you're nervous, Logi.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
007	Isn't that natural? As the sons of the Blue Flame Guard's captain, we cannot embarrass ourselves!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
008	He gave us proper sword training. You should have confidence in yourself.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
009	Well, that's true.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
010	Relax that tension in your shoulders, Logi.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
011	Father!
012	And Dias, I know you're skilled with a sword, but don't be overly confident either. You never know what to expect in battle, after all.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
013	I understand, father.
014	That's the spirit. I will leave the defense of Fort Aldrin to you two. I'll entrust half of our forces to your command. Use them as you see fit.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
015	Understood!
016	We'll definitely meet the expectations!
017	Listen to me carefully, both of you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0005
018	On this occasion, you'll be getting a taste of the battlefield. But don't get too caught up into it.
019	Keep a firm control over yourselves, and just do what needs to be done.
020	If you're able to do that, you'll finally be knights of the Blue Flame Guard, in the true meaning of the word.
021	Understood!
022	Also... as your father, I ask you to make it back alive, without fail!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
023	Yes, Sir!
024	...And they're off.
025	They both had a good look on their face. It reminds me of seeing you when you were young.
026	Heh, stop it. When I was their age, I was just a kid without any ideals.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
027	It seems like we have a bright future ahead of us then!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
028	...Possibly, yes.
029	The defense of Fort Aldrin seems settled, but what about the rest?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
030	In response to the uprising, the scattered pockets of Wratharis' resistance are gathering themselves.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0037
031	We will lead the remaining forces and take out each of these groups before they've consolidated.
032	Yes, Sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
033	We're almost there! General Vlad's formation should be right across this hill!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
034	Having stayed hidden for all this time, we will now once again reclaim our lands!
035	...I cannot allow that.
036	Is that Zeke, the Blood Wolf?!<br>What on earth is he doing here?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
037	...It's been 20 years now. We don't want any more bloodbaths. We just want to live peacefully as citizens of Envylia.
038	Surrender yourselves.<br>There's no need to spill any more meaningless blood.
039	Be silent, you bloodthirsty monster!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
040	Ready your weapons, everyone! We'll try to make it to General Vlad across the hill with as many as possible!
041	...Captain Zeke.
042	Capture them alive if at all possible. The Dawn of Wrath was concluded already a long time ago.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
043	Yes, Sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
044	Blood Wolf huh...
045	(It's true that I once hungered for blood on these plains. They even called me the Blood Wolf...)
046	Report to me about their forces.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0001
047	They haven't shown any big movements since the initial clash. However...
048	What?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0006
049	They've completely driven back our scouts.
050	Their morale is high, and there's no opening in their defense which we could take advantage of.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
051	Even though their territory is under attack? The Deadly Trio of Wratharis really does bring a strong spirit of unification.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0012
052	With the help of the Holy Guard, who would have deemed this possible? General Neville the Ice Snake is a smarter strategist than the rumors say.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
053	What shall we do? It could be dangerous to keep our troops in enemy territory like this.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
054	I suppose continuing this straightforward approach will just get us in trouble...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0030
055	...I want you to gather our best cavalry. Right now!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0001
056	Could you possibly be planning to go out there yourself?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
057	We don't have a choice. I cannot possibly allow anyone to continue violating this continent's ultimate principle, the Alchemist Code.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0005
058	...Understood.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
059	I will hunt Neville down. For the sake of peace on the continent, as well as for the honor of Envylia!
060	Everyone follow me!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0015
061	Whoaaa!
062	What?! It's the Blue Flame Guard! W-we're under attack!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
063	Don't stop! Keep on advancing! We're after their leader, General Neville the Ice Snake!
064	Urgh, stop them!<br>Don't let them reach the General!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0023
065	It's Zeke!<br>The Blue Flame's Wolf is coming at us!
066	Make way if you don't want to die!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0030
067	Captain Zeke, look there!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
068	...
069	Neville!
070	(...There's something strange about this. Why is there so little resistance?)	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0027
071	(I can't imagine such an infamous general would allow this kind of attack without any kind of plan.)	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0017
072	Press onward! Keep on advancing!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0016
073	Whoaaa!
074	General Neville the Ice Snake! I am here to...
075	Your hands are dripping with Wratharis blood! Let me give you a good reminder of that!	VO_neville.neville_battle_0014
076	Huh?! What is this?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
077	...Whoaaaa!
078	W-what are these things? How can normal soldiers be this strong?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0043
079	Could this be... Alchemy?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0026
080	You dog of the Holy Order! You're so sensitive to the smell of the forbidden art.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0007
081	I never thought they would have reached the stage of military utility!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
082	Hm! These soldiers were transmuted from Wratharis' blood and tears. You won't be able to kill them with ordinary weaponry!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0010
083	There's so many! Captain Zeke! At this rate, we may... Arghh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
084	Urgh!
085	I've been waiting for this, Zeke! I've been waiting for you to charge at me like this!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0023
086	Just like Wrath has its Deadly Trio, you are the main pillar of Envylia!
087	If you were to fall right here, let's see what happens to your army's fighting spirit!
088	Urghh, you...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0013
089	It's useless!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0007
090	Urghh, I don't want to die here!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
091	Arghh... Captain Zeke...	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0028_b
092	And there's a legion more where they came from.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0008
093	A-argh...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0043
094	I'll commend you for hanging in there, but I'll put an end to it. Take him, phantom soldiers!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0045
095	Ugh?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0019
096	Though they may call you the Blood Wolf, even you will stop squirming once the phantom soldiers have a hold of you.
097	Oh Blood Wolf, let me show you what hell is like. The same hell we've had to experience.
098	Take a good look at all your followers who died a dog's death! They're fighting their own transmuted captain!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
099	What?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
100	Now fight! Die at the hands of your own comrades! Until the whole Blue Flame Guard is no more!
101	Urghh... oh no... this can't be happening...! S-stop! A-arghh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
102	Stop this right now!<br>Darn it...! Let me go, Neville!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0015
103	How can you step on the pride of knights like that! Dying at the hands of your comrades is the worst possible death!
104	Your knights have tossed away their honor a long time ago, when you turned them into quelling forces!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0029
105	See their numbers dwindle... and there's nothing you can do but watch. How ironic that you're called the Blood Wolf.
106	A-arghh... Captain Zeke...!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
107	W-we can't stand against this...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
108	Hahah... just a little longer. So, Blood Wolf... or rather, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard. Won't you help them? Or can't you help them?	VO_neville.neville_sys_0010
109	Stop it! Stop it right now! If you want me dead, just kill me already instead! Neville!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0015
110	I like the sound of that, Blood Wolf. This is for all the Wratharis bloodshed! I'll wipe out all your followers, to the very last one!
111	...!
112	Hahahah... Now die, Blue Flame Knights! You should realize how foolish it was to threaten Wratharis!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0023
113	Ughh...! What a horrendous way to fight!<br>Darn it!!!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0043
114	It's useless. Haven't you realized by now? You cannot win against this power!
115	Tsk!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0027
116	(Darn it! Even after they've called me the Blood Wolf, am I really going to die like this?!)	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
117	Huh?!<br>W-what is this place?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
118	This is the Door of Truth. The place where souls are judged.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0008
119	My Name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between truth and the world, the observer of destiny.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
120	The Door of Truth?<br>The place where they say forbidden powers are bestowed?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0027
121	I have seen the burning flame of envy inside of you. You have the right to possess Power.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
122	Envy?!<br>Towards Alchemy, the forbidden power, you say?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0012
123	I know you. You have longed for the power to rule the world. The power to smash it all to bits.
124	Have you truly never imagined, even for a moment, what it would be like to have that Power?
125	...?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0016
126	This burning passion of yours will pierce the sky, at some point allowing you to even reach Leviathan.
127	This flame is now threatened, however. Will without Power is easily drowned by the waves of time.
128	Ughh... You mean to say it was all for nothing? The ideals I put forth, as well as all those knights who died following me?! Everything?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0042
129	Is it hard to accept the meaningless waste of lives? The meaningless spiral of bloodshed?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
130	But this is inevitable. Beings without Power will fade away without ever attaining or changing anything.
131	I...<br>I will not allow that!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
132	The Forbidden Arts...<br>If you're telling me that I require this Power now, then power is what I want! I will stop this bloodshed!
133	Yes. The fire of your envy has reached this door.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0038
134	So let me ask you!<br>Do you desire Power?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0002
135	Yes, I desire Power.<br>I want this Power to give meaning to all the suffered bloodshed!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_chara_0016
136	Very well.<br>A contract with Truth has been made!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
137	You should rejoice, human. You just took the first step that will one day lead you to truth.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
138	W-what was that light just now?!<br>Tsk, alchemic soldiers! I order you to kill Zeke!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0028
139	What a distorted, inharmonious power! But if this is what is necessary right now...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0010
140	Huh?! That power... why?!	VO_neville.neville_battle_0023
141	I witnessed the Truth of Alchemy.
142	What?! After all our fruitless efforts to attain this Truth, why were you able to reach it?!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0029
143	You fiend...! But I still have the Philosopher's Stone, which holds Wratharis' desperate wishes!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0013
144	I will end this here and now, Neville!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0012
145	In order to give meaning to the wrath, to all this bloodshed,
146	though I know it is forbidden, I will use this power in order to move forward!!!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_chara_0021
