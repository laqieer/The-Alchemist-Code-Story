001	So you're trying to repay Mayor Edward who gave you a place to belong?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
002	It's not some cold-hearted trade deal. Men don't open their hearts just because someone does them a favor.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
003	There's only one moment when men open their hearts to each other.
004	It's when someone understands their beliefs.
005	Their beliefs?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
006	One day, this right arm will save the world.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0037
007	Mayor Edward was the only one who accepted this policy of mine that everyone else laughed at.
008	He looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘I believe the same as you. I'll be relying on you when that moment comes.'
009	...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
010	That man...he lent an earnest ear to the prattling of a deject like me living in the slums.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
011	From that moment on, I've been wholeheartedly taken by the depth of that man's kindness...sob...	VO_taras.taras_sys_0019
012	Don! Are you crying?!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0013
013	Shut up!!! I'm gonna blow you away!!!	VO_taras.taras_battle_0012
014	N-no! I-I-I'm sorry!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0036
015	Bu-but...how does abducting Miss Fiona help repay your debt?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
016	How? Stop being an idiot.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
017	After Mayor Edward died...that vile Alvarez just strode in and took over his position.
018	That was enough to infuriate me, but on top of that he has the nerve to try and marry his daughter. And I'm supposed to let him get away with that?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
019	In other words, you couldn't stand by and watch her marry Alvarez?
020	Of course.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
021	Mayor Edward is rolling in his grave to know that his daughter is being forced to marry that droid-creating scum...sob...
022	Tsk. How pathetic. Look at you crying over some ancient debt you owe.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
023	I've had enough of you!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0014
024	Wait, Tango!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
025	Huh?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0005
026	It's pathetic...so pathetic that...sob...even I'm starting to cry.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0019
027	See? This is the kinda person Edgar is.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0007
028	...Tango?
029	C'mon... Look at you guys—full-grown men bawling their eyes out...sob...	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0015
030	H-huh...?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
031	Hey...how are you gonna save Miss Fiona like this?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0030
