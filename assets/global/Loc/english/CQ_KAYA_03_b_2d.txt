001	As expected of the Alchemia Pura.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0024
002	You are certainly no slouch either. The average person wouldn't be able to tell that you'd just gotten finished training.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
003	This is more difficult than I expected... It is regrettable that Zain did not push you a little harder while training with you.
004	I haven't seen you like this in a long time. Why the sudden change?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
005	Why are you willing to risk your life to continue your research?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
006	For one, pure curiosity. Second, the same reason that you risk your life.
007	And that is?
008	I want to support the Lord Commander... Help Zain just like you do. But in my own way.
009	You've helped me realize that there's something that only I can do.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
010	...!
011	Learning from history leads to a deeper understanding of both Alchemy and our world.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
012	I believe that will be a great service to the Holy Guard and the Lord Commander.
013	And that's something both Zain and I aren't capable of?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
014	Zain only looks forward. You have your own darkness to face. This... This, I can do.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
015	There is no future without history. And yet our history is missing pieces.
016	By filling those blanks, Zain can build a brighter future.
017	I believe I'm better suited for work like that more than anyone else in the Holy Guard.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
018	Everyone should do what is best suited to them.
019	...I see.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0024
020	Zain's role is to keep moving forward and protecting absolute justice. Mine is to work behind him, rooting out corruption.
021	And my role is to watch both of your backs, seeking the truth.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
022	Everything in its right place.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
023	Very me, don't you think?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
024	...
025	I want you to promise me one thing...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
026	What is it?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
027	In the event that something happens to you after diving into the darkness of this world, make sure there is someone to take your place.
028	As a Captain, that is my request.
029	I understand. I promise. Though I must say I believe I have already been doing so, even without your request.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
030	Good.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
031	Shall we call this a tie now that you've sheathed your sword? I take it I'll be allowed to continue my research.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
032	Yes. You've shown me your passion. I have nothing left to say on the matter.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
033	Just...don't overdo it.
034	I could say the same to you.
035	Still, I never thought I'd hear you talk that way about Zain.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
036	You and me both... I never thought myself capable of something like this.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
037	And you still agreed to my condition? Well, let's do what we can for Zain. Together.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
038	Making silly promises... It really isn't like me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
039	But I suppose it happens.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
