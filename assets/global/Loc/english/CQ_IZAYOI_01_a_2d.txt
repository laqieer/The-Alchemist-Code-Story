001	So this is the next target, is it? A loan shark by the name of Kanayoshi Gozoh... Interesting name.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
002	Let's go, Tsuru!
003	Infiltration successful. And would you look at all this treasure! Someone hasn't been too careful with the money they've taken from others...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
004	The money should really be restored to the rightful owners. Don’t worry, I’ll save you the trouble.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
005	Aaand...all set! Okay, time to head out, Tsuru!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
006	Oops! Not yet. I almost forgot to leave behind a calling card! How rude of me.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0026
007	What? You don't see the point of what I've written here? Really?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
008	Huh? What's this? A...card?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
009	”I've taken the most valuable piece of art in this place. Yours truly, the Phantom Thief Chat Noir.” What?! Phantom thief?!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
010	To not only have gotten past the security of this place, but to have done it before me? Well, color me surprised...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0044
011	What am I saying, I can't dwell on this. I have to get out of here. Come on, Tsuru!
012	It's lovely out tonight, isn’t it? Perfect weather for a late night stroll... So, what brings you to this tycoon’s mansion?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0002
013	Who are you? Wait, are you that—what was it again—“phantom thief"?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
014	I am indeed the Phantom Thief Chat Noir, notorious for my exploits all across the world!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
015	I had heard that the legendary thief called the Night Fox could be found here in Wadatsumi.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0031
016	Correct me if I am wrong, but...would that happen to be you?
017	And if it is?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0012
018	Then it would be my displeasure to tell you that you’re not at all what I expected.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0010
019	I was quite excited about getting to meet the legendary Night Fox, but... Oh, well. I suppose I built the moment up too much in my head.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0022
020	The legends about the Night Fox are true. The Night Fox is the most skilled thief in Wadatsumi.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0013
021	However... Perhaps you were expecting my teacher, who was the previous Night Fox.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
022	I inherited the title from him. I am the new Night Fox.
023	Ah... Now it all makes sense! So you're not the original, you're just his successor.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0044
024	So, what? You came to Wadatsumi just to confirm whether or not the Night Fox legend was true?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0003
025	Of course not. I am here to steal this country's most valuable treasure.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
026	Just to steal, huh...?
027	I'm curious, second-generation Night Fox. What motivates you to plunder?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0002
028	Why...? I just... My teacher...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
029	Uh-oh. We've been discovered!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0026
030	Oh, dear. Our conversation has dragged on for far too long. Time to go!	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0011
031	Shall we go half-and-half on these guards, successor? I would greatly appreciate the help, if it is not too much for you to handle.
032	How high-handed! He's treating me like some kind of servant... Come on, Tsuru!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
