001	...
002	What is it, Lady Mitsuha? Are you not going to seal away the Demon Paragon?
003	Of course. And this vessel will need to be destroyed, so that it cannot be controlled by the Demon Lord.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
004	Then why do you hesitate?
005	Hyah!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0004
006	...?! The horn?
007	We don't know if anything may happen to Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. I want to leave something behind for those who come after us.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
008	Where is the martial arts instructor?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
009	Here.
010	Hide this horn. Mark only its location on a map, but do not label what is to be found there.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
011	Only its location? But then how—
012	I shall spread a legend through the generations of the royal family. One that is not easily deciphered.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
013	It will be passed down in hopes that the sacred treasures cannot be used so readily, nor controlled by Malice. Only those who have the wherewithal to unravel the mystery may obtain them.
014	...Though I do pray this horn will never be needed.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
015	Lady Kaede's horn created both Mikaboshi and Sumeragi. What will this horn create?
016	I don't believe it will be used to create anything new. The aim is merely to protect our land in a time of crisis.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0014
017	I hope Tamba feels the same way. Though perhaps that is nothing more than wishful thinking.
018	I'm sorry, Tamba. We will be taking your horn, for the future of Wadatsumi.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0035
019	So it really was true!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0022
020	It shouldn't be possible, but here it is. Another demon's horn.
021	It isn't hard to guess the demon it belonged to.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0045
022	We now have what we need to reforge the Treasure Blade Sumeragi. All that's left is to gain control of the flame from the sacred art Kagutsuchi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
023	I have no doubt Amane will come through for us there.
024	Don't you think, Lady Celis?
