001	You seek power, but you can't comprehend the consequences.
002	I'll tell you what the consequences are! It's that fox pipsqueak here is going bye-bye if you don't transfer the magic immedia-!
003	Ahahahaha! Yes, the power!
004	Time to test if it's the real deal this time!
005	Gurgh! W-what?
006	Hmm? What's the matter? There's still more power incoming.
007	As the magic continuously flows through him, his body starts to burn up.
008	Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!
009	No!
010	Eira and her foxes gather around the adventurer as they try to snuff out the flames.
011	GUUUAAAAHHHHHHHGGH!
012	...big sis!
013	Please!
014	?
015	Stop!
016	...Of course.
017	What a pure and precious child. Aiding others even after such harsh treatment...
018	...thank...you...
019	You remind me of a certain pure-hearted individual... Though he isn't here to compare the resemblance...
020	?
021	Ow, my head...
022	The boss, is the boss ok?
023	*gasp* yeah...
024	Boss!
025	Leave now.
026	W-we're leaving! We're so sorry o great elf! W-we're sorry Eira!
027	It's not supposed to *gasp* end this way...
028	E-eira! Take care of yourself! We're truly sorry for everything!
029	You... too!
030	Almost at once, the party disappears from sight.
031	Yet another bunch of naive explorers. Maybe mortals are all the same after all.
032	...thank...again...
033	Well, I had to relent after hearing the four of you pleading for their lives.
034	?...four?
035	Your foxes, Dormach, Anwyn and Gwyn. They were pleading alongside you.
036	...
037	Eh?
038	Oh dear, you didn't know the names of your foxes?
039	That is quite amusing.
040	Hmph!
041	Its time you discover what you and your foxes can do together.
042	An encounter like this comes once in a millennia.
043	Would you like me to teach you more? After all, you are much different from those... goofs.
044	...Y-yes?
045	Can call... big sis?
046	Fufufu, I'd be delighted.
