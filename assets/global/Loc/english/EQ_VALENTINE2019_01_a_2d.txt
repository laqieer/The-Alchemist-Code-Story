001	It's that time of the year again! Valentine's! I wonder what kind of chocolate I should make this year?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0023
002	I'm really hoping we'll get some cacao seeds this year, too!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
003	Suzuka, Itsuki, have either of you had chocolate before?	VO_porin.porin_sys_1002
004	Chocolate? I can't say that I have.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
005	Nor have I, but... What do you need me to do? I thought we were here to be security for the cacao farm.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
006	Yeah! Don't worry about it! We'll get work done, too.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
007	Yeah, we can just think about it when the time comes. Right?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
008	That's a very negligent way of thinking.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
009	But I suppose Emma is right. There's nothing for us to do unless something occurs, anyway.
010	Yup! Besides, the Rainbow Cacao, and the Purple Cacao that attracts monsters, have all been stored in the new warehouse.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
011	New warehouse?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
012	It's a specialized warehouse that seals in the cacao's special qualities. So long as we keep the cacao in the warehouse, everything will be fine!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
013	Come to think of it, we haven't yet separated the harvested cacao by color like we said we would.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1001
014	Do we really have to? We probably shouldn't be messing with it.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
015	Yeah! Maybe we can have a simple Valentine's this year, and just trade chocolates around.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
016	Why not? That should be fine!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0045
017	The farm owner said something about cacao thieves showing up lately, but so long as we keep an eye out, we should be all right!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
018	We could have used that information a lot earlier.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
019	You worry too much, Noah. More importantly, check this out! I've brought us some chocolate.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1011
020	Tadaah!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0023
021	Whoaaa!
022	You make the cutest chocolates, Emma! Can I have one, please?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0024
023	So this is...chocolate!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0047
024	How do you like it?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
025	It's amazing! You made this?! You must be a culinary genius!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
026	Oh, come on. It's not that hard to make.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0008
027	We can make some together later!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
028	You think that even I could create this delicacy? Well, then let us complete this mission, and get to it!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0025
029	Ooh, things are getting interesting! What kind of chocolate should we make?
030	What kind? I'm not even sure what kinds there are.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
031	What about you, Itsuki? Any ideas or preferences as to what you might like to do?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
032	Hmm... Preferences...? I suppose I have a lot of preferences.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
033	Urgh!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0043
034	Eve?! What's the matter?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
035	Ack! Urgh!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0024
036	Blech! What is with this chocolate?! It's crazy spicy! Is everyone okay with this?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0019
037	Huh? It's not spicy, is it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
038	Bingo! Hehehe... I mixed in some super spicy chocolates among the normal ones!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
039	Emma...
040	Why would you do that, Emma?! Why me?! My mouth hurts! Aaaah, it hurts!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0025
041	Was Eve's the only one? I thought I made two.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
042	Mine was good.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
043	So was mine!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
044	Nothing wrong with mine, either.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
045	Well, that's weird. Oh, well!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
046	W-water... Please!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
047	Hm...?
048	Itsuki?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
049	Hnngh... Something doesn't feel right.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
050	Aha! A monster! It looks harmless, but whatever!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
051	Huzzaaaahh!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0032
052	Gyaaaargh!
053	Hey! Don't run away!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0016
054	Argh! No fair! I still need to vent!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0022
055	Itsuki...? What is going on?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
