001	...
002	(I cannot stop myself from treading down this path. Even if I lose all of my comrades and am forced to walk it alone, I must continue to bear the hopes of the many.)
003	I must forge on... Isn't that right, Letitia?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
004	...
005	Vettel!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
006	Ren...?
007	What happened?! Why the hell weren't you there?! Why were they there instead?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
008	"They"...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
009	They were clad in what looked like Paladin armor. I think they called themselves the Corpse.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
010	You say...they were Paladins?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0026
011	Why would they send Paladins? Could they have a plan in motion? No...that can't be...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
012	What are you babbling about?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
013	We've...been outmaneuvered.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
014	Outmaneuvered...? By who?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
015	It must have been the Blue Flame Guard... No. The minister. We were originally ordered by the Minister to disregard Shadow Messiah.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
016	No way...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
017	What happened to Zah...to Shadow Messiah?
018	Most of them were killed...when the Philosopher's Stone mine exploded.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
019	Zahar...Zehn, Ila...and those who remained behind at the stronghold are all that's left.
020	What about the one named Corvus?
021	Dead. He was killed by the Paladins who call themselves the Corpse.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
022	I see...
023	So? What's our move, boss?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0002
024	If I were able to make any moves, I would. However, we have been consigned to a joint drill with the Holy Guard.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
025	We depart for Northern Pride immediately.
026	Wait...what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
027	Regardless, I cannot allow you continue on such a perilous mission.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
028	That's not—!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
029	Shadow Messiah are waning in power. They won't try anything for the time being. Besides...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
030	Besides, what?
031	I know for certain that I will once again face Zahar on the battlefield. I feel it in my bones.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
032	How...did this...happen? Why...? Why are you so bruised and battered?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
033	Ugh... Lord Zahar...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
034	Tell me. What has transpired here?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
035	It was...a surprise attack...by the Holy Guard.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
036	The Holy Guard! Again!
037	...?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
038	They have shattered my Sacred Darkstone! You...will rue this day, you holy curs!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
039	We simply cannot have you doing whatever you please.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
040	Who might you be?
041	Zahar, this would be our first meeting in person.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
042	I see. I have heard of you before. You are the mastermind behind the Holy...no. Behind the Corpse.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
043	You go by the name Waginau, I believe.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
044	Indeed, I do.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
045	What is your purpose in all this?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
046	Equilibrium in the world.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
047	Ha. Lies. Your organization is bent on wide-scale conquest, and you are the one who pulls the strings from the shadows.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
048	You have it wrong.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
049	How so? You sow the seeds of war and ensure that chaos runs rampant throughout the world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
050	You boast of building an orderly society, yet you commit the kinds of heinous acts that can only promote anarchy.
051	Within chaos, lies truth. Conflict is the stabilizer of this world. Order, under the guise of chaos, is essential to generate conflict...which in turn affords us equilibrium.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
052	Such hypocrisy will not lead to truth, nor could it ever result in true order. I will be the one to bestow upon this world its new order.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0013
053	The truths we both seek, Zahar, are in fact one and the same. Zahar... Won't you join me?	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
054	...
055	I have had my eye on you ever since you rose through the ranks as a knight in the Holy Guard. Will you not take my offer?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
056	I will not serve you like some mongrel dog, nor do I have any interest in becoming one of your animated dead.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0029
057	Such is not my intention. Under my guidance, you would be molded into a true King of Darkness.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
058	This is a waste of time.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
059	So be it. I was aware from the beginning that this would be your answer.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
060	I am the savior of the shadows, and I will claim the title of King of Darkness without your help.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
061	How disappointing to hear. However, Zahar, I concede that you are truly a hero of the darkness.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
062	I shall see that your name is carved unto the hearts of our people, and allow your memory to endure the test of time.
063	Even so... you may not be the one to control the darkness of this world, for the darkness within you is too intense.
064	Once I have finished with you, my pure darkness will shine upon the world, make no mistake.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0006
065	Fare thee well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
066	This world will be remade in my image.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
067	Lord Zahar! Lord... Lord Zahar!!!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
068	Ila...?
069	I can’t find Mia nowhere. They musta taken her!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
070	What did you say?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0026
071	The Holy Order has truly rotted right down to the core if they have the audacity to kidnap a little girl!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
072	Please! I'm beggin' ya... Save Mia!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0041
073	We will pursue immediately. Mia will not be lost on my watch.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0037
074	Lord Zahar... Why can’t I join the Shadow Messiah?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
075	Mia, let me ask you: Why do you want to join us?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
076	Why? Because...I want to be useful to you, just like Ila.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
077	In that case, I want you to remember: One's worth is not limited to the field of battle.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0022
078	It's...not?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
079	That it is not. At this moment, we have no choice but to fight, in order to change the world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
080	We, Shadow Messiah, will form the cornerstone of the new world...but your role must be different.
081	But...why?	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
082	You will stand atop the foundations we lay. You will live in the world we strive to build.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
083	When that time comes, you must obey the laws we establish and contribute to society in an orderly manner. That is how you can be of use to me. Do you understand?
084	Sorry... I don't...think I get it.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0035
085	Hm. That's fine. You don't have to understand right now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
086	Lord Zahar...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
087	Are you awake?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
088	?!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
089	No need to be frightened, little one. We don't want to hurt you. Nor will we have to, if you behave.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
090	Wh-why did you kidnap me?	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
091	You must already know, precious bait. To lure Zahar out, of course.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
092	B-bait...?
093	Oh, look...he's biting. Hehehe. Just like we planned.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
094	Oh no!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
095	Lord Zahar! Ila!!! Stay away!!!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
096	Mia, we're comin' ta save you!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
097	It never ceases to amaze me how low you lot are willing to stoop.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
098	Hehehe. We must eliminate interlopers like you, for the sake of peace!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
099	So you'll do whatever you decide to be correct? It is my understanding that Waginau would prefer to have me under his command...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
100	No matter. However strong you might be, or how powerful your alchemy, it won't be enough to polish my boots! Bow before me, for mine is the way of truth!
101	I shall reign supreme over the darkness, and become a god of blight to eradicate the old world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
