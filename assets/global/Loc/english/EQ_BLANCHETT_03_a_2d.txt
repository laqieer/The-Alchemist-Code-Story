001	...! We've managed to penetrate the barrier! Let's head to the village!	VO_freed.freed_battle_0021
002	I won't let you escape! You people who have drenched yourselves in Alchemy and have strayed from the path of man. It's time for you to stop and pay the price...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0004
003	Aghh...!	VO_freed.freed_battle_0023
004	(I won't make it at this rate?! More importantly, I can't die in a place like this...)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0022
005	(No, I need to protect Blanchett and the others. I need to deliver this message to Neville!)
006	(No matter what, I'm going to survive this land of the dead!)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
007	At least die like a warrior!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0007
008	Huff...huff...
009	No, I can't run...anymore...
010	I sprained my leg... Leave me here...
011	You can't give up here! You're going to become a soldier, right?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1006
012	B-but...
013	Besides, we're still alive. Every second, every minute is time that the director and the others are buying for us! We can't afford to stop!
014	...! Arghh! I-I'm not gonna lose! Here, I'll lend you my shoulder so stand up!
015	O-okay...
016	Chase them! Our orders are to not leave a single child! Search through the grass from root to root!
017	Th-their voices are close...what should we do?
018	I'll stop them.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
019	Huh?! What can you do on your own?!
020	If I use the trees as a shield, I can run about for a while. There's no other way left, is there?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0038
021	Well...
022	Oh, besides...that voice sounds really familiar.
023	Huh? Blanc?
024	It's the sound of the bloodthirsty and unassuming breathing of a wolf...
025	H-hey! Blanchett!
026	Tsk! I can't believe we're chasing children through the mountains. What a hassle!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
027	Don't say that. We can't leave any witnesses.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
028	Well, if we can hunt down people without following military rules, then I have no complaint...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
029	There's one!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0001
030	What...! An enemy?! No, a child?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
031	Yes, I thought so. You are wolves, aren't you?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0011
032	I can tell by your smell. You've bathed in too much blood. You smell like rotten beasts...
033	Hey!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
034	I've gotta get rid of such bad wolves like you!!!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0014
035	Ack...she's fast! Don't underestimate the child! Surround her and eliminate all routes of escape!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
036	Mr. Wolf, Mr. Wolf, everything that you did to everyone...I'll repay it all back in full!!!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
037	She moves a lot, but...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
038	...?! Let me go...!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0042
039	When we catch her like this, she can't wave those blades of hers!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
040	Aghh!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0043
041	Finally, you stopped. I would've preferred to have captured you alive, but...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
042	Oh...
043	You're dangerous. I'm sorry, but you'll have to die here.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
044	(Me, die? Here? Killed by the Wolf like my mother and father were...?)	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0021
045	No...no, no, no! I can't die yet!
046	The other children aren't safe! I still haven't finished my revenge! And also...!
047	I still haven't said goodbye to Freed yet!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
048	Wh-what the...?! This light!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
049	...Huh? Freed's charm stone...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
050	Oh, what a relief. Are you okay, Blanchett?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
051	Fre...ed? Why?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0025
052	Ah. Couldn't let you go without saying goodbye, could I?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
053	Wh-what is this?! I don't know what's going on, but get out of the way, fiend! Men, attack!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
054	Hey, can you stand up?	VO_freed.freed_chara_1005
055	Um, yeah...
056	Tonight's a really good night. That's why, well...are they your wolves? Maybe we should quiet them a little.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0008
