001	Huzzzzzaaaaahhhh!!!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0032
002	Charge!!!
003	Azami!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
004	You better not die on me, Amane.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
005	Tanosuke, now!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
006	Gotcha! Seal!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0011
007	This area should be safe for now. Let us retreat back to headquarters.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
008	Will the Discarnate Power really come here? Perhaps the force field will actually stop—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
009	You really don't know anything, do you, rookie?
010	Wh-what do you mean?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
011	The demons are fighting with a very specific purpose. Didn't you gather that from what they were doing in the castle town?
012	Their target is Castle Aquila Rubrum. Last time, they used disturbance tactics, and now they're marching with great numbers to overwhelm us.
013	Even a fool can see what this means.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
014	Stay calm! Focus on taking them out one at a time!
015	Understood!
016	(This is odd... I don't see—)	VO_azami.azami_sys_0042
017	(Where is the—?)
018	Well, I'll worry about that later.
019	For now, all I can do is take out the demons before me!
