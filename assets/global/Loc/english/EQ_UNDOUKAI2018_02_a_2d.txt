001	Yes! Finished! I win!	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0029
002	Wonderful! Good job, everyone! You have all displayed your powers magnificently!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0009
003	Tch... What the hell are you on about, lady?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0016
004	Now I will explain the rules of the race!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
005	Oi! Don't ignore me!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
006	Everyone will break up into pairs.
007	Teamwork is key! You must work together and head straight for the goal!
008	Oh, but you're allowed to use whatever you had with you when you were summoned. For example, your motorcycle, Caris.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
009	That means my mech gear is fair game too, right?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0044
010	Of course! You may even customize it however you wish in preparation for the race!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
011	What?! That's so unfair! I'm at one hell of a disadvantage!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0029
012	It's perfectly fair! The summoned and their personal effects are as inseparable as their limbs!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
013	I will deduct Teona Points from you if you continue to complain, Vivi!
014	What, really? How am I supposed to compete against a motorcycle?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0025
015	Is that weapon in your hand just for show, Vivi?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
016	N-no way! You don't mean...!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0022
017	Fight fair and aim for the goal! These are the only rules!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
018	So what you're saying is that it's fine to destroy anyone who gets in your way! All right!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0045
019	I wonder why the rules are so lax?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0030
020	In short, all you need to do is get to the goal first. Are we clear?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
021	Plain and simple, just how I like it! I'm going to do my best and become number one!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0046
022	Good answer! You've earned yourself one Teona Point! Now, all that's left is for you to break up into teams!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
023	I have already decided those teams based on that little warm-up exercise just now...and my personal preferences!
024	Oh, I'd already forgotten about that! It's going to be weird teaming up with someone who isn't Leema. I wonder who it will be?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
025	First up, we've got Caris and Megistos! You coordinated really well with each other!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
026	It's because we're both from Slothstein, isn't it?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0030
027	Someone with honor would be preferable, but I'll deal, I suppose.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0031
028	Next! Vivi and Ravina! The Magia Gunslinger Pair!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
029	So we're gonna be partners, huh? The name's Vivi. Let's do this!	VO_vivi.vivi_chara_1012
030	Oh... Y-yeah.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
031	Next up are Dorothea and Reida, the love-struck sweetheart pair!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
032	Lovestruck? Such a simple word does not even begin to adequately describe my feelings.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0017
033	Same! Also, why couldn't I be teamed up with my special someone?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0010
034	Oh, my! Such passion! Use the power of your combined love to propel you forward!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0008
035	Moving on... Now this one is a sure thing! Two great men of the sea, Dilga and Gormalas!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
036	Captain Gormalas! This must be fate! Let's fight fair and square together!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0024
037	Don't screw with me! Why do I have to team up with you?! This is ridicul—	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0017
038	Let me see... Who's next?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
039	Are you ignoring me again?! You've got some nerve!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
040	Oh! Daisy, I'm pairing you with Reagan.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
041	Really?! With Reagan?!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
042	(I can't believe I get to team up with the amazing Reagan! I wonder if I can ask him about mechanical engineering and stuff?!)	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_1024
043	...
044	U-um... Mister...Reagan?
045	Hm? Oh, excuse me. I was lost in thought. I was wondering why we're competing in pairs.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
046	Phantom Soldiers don't fight alone. If you want to get stronger, you're going to need to improve your teamwork.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
047	And when it comes to training that particular skill, friendship, hard work, challenges, and failure are all part and parcel!
048	Improving your friendship and overcoming hardship is the true beauty of training!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
049	This all seems very unscientific.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
050	The race will be held tomorrow morning, so be sure to make use of the time you have in order to deepen your bonds with your partners!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
051	There will be a prize for the winner, so do your best! Ahem. Allow me to ask one more time...
052	Do you seek power?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
053	I'll see you all tomorrow!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
054	She's gone.
055	Power. Of course I want power! Oh, the things I could do... Heheheh.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0008
056	Looks like we'll get along fabulously! I also want power. Oh, the things I could do... Heheheh.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
057	Those two are giving me the creeps.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0018
058	Captain Gormalas! How about we deepen our bonds over a drink?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0008
059	I thought you were a knight. Don't you feel nothin'? You're incredibly thick-skulled, aren't ya?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0026
060	I have no idea what you mean. Let's go!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0006
061	I don't really get what's going on, but it's been a while since I've had fun like this. It's kinda exciting!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
062	We should go get some food to get ourselves pumped up for tomorrow! Got any cravings, Ravina?
063	Cravings... Maybe brioche? The ones with fruit on them? Lofia said they're really good.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
064	Brush... Biosh... What?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0025
065	They're all so...adaptable.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
066	Well, it can't be helped. We're all in this now. Besides, I can't stand to lose a race. If I'm in, I'm in it to win.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
067	See you tomorrow, Daisy! I expect a nice, clean race!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0007
068	Caris seems like a really tough person to beat. The other teams seem to get along well, too... Can I really win this?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0029
069	No! I can't let myself get disheartened! I have to become number one, no matter what, but...
070	...
071	U-um... Mister Reagan?	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0019
072	Hm?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0005
073	Um, I read your book on mechanical engineering and it was really interesting! It taught me a lot, and I—
074	What operational principle are your actions based on right now?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0002
075	O-operational...principle?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
076	If your intention was simply to begin a conversation with me, then I'm afraid that you have taken far too many unnecessary actions. It was very unpleasant to watch, as a matter of fact.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
077	Though you seemed to intentionally increase in intensity for the purpose of beginning a conversation. Quite interesting.
078	U-um... Well...
079	(I don't understand what he's saying! We'll never get to know each other at this rate!)
080	What is it?
081	Wh-what should I do? At this rate, I'll never be number one.	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
082	I thought doing this training would be what I needed to get Leema to accept me again.
083	Leema... She's your Mech War Games partner or something, right?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
084	That's right! Leema is an excellent mechanic! Do you know her?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
085	Only her name. Anyway, what exactly are these Mech War Games?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0022
086	You know Leema but not the Mech War Games?! That doesn't make any sense! Aren't you from Slothstein?!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
087	The Mech War Games weren't really established as a competition yet when I was alive, and I didn't really pay attention to that kind of thing anyway.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
088	I heard your names for the first time after becoming a phantom. From what I hear, you two are an amazing team.
089	Eheheh... We do make a pretty good... Wait, no. You're getting me off track! I'm going to explain the Mech War Games to you!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0047
090	The Mech War Games are a tournament in which you attach weapons to mechas and fight with them. These are called mech gear.
091	People bring their own custom mech gear in order to fight and compete!
092	It's a strategy-based sport that tests your intellect and skill! That's how Leema explained it to me.
093	You see, you can earn points by hitting certain areas of the enemy with both feet raised off the ground for over a minute... Uh... Well, you see...
094	Ugh! Here, just let me show you!
095	What do you think? My mech gear is pretty cool, right?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
096	Hm... Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply mechanize your own body?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0045
097	However, I admit that I can appreciate how dynamic and appealing the movements of the human body would be when wielding this mech gear. Yes... I think I can understand why the competition grew to be so popular.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0007
098	Yay!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0034
099	(Am I really bonding with Reagan right now?! I knew we'd get to know each other eventually! Thank you so much, Teona!)
100	Hmm... If we consider your habits when in motion, then perhaps a slight adjustment here...	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
101	Wh-what the—?! Whoa! Cool! It's so light!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_1024
102	I figured out how it was put together, so I took the liberty of having myself a little tinker.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
103	You figured it out already?! You're amazing, Mister Reagan!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
104	Oh, but... If you don't mind, I'd really prefer not to alter this mech gear Leema made too much.
105	All I did was tweak it to compliment your motions. It's very well made, so there was little more for me to do.	VO_regen.regen_chara_1002
106	Heheh! Leema's mecha gear is the best in the world!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
107	For now, though, you should at least practice with it, to get yourself used to how it handles after the adjustment. Besides, I'd like to see how a Mech War Games combatant fights.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0031
108	Well, then, why don't we clear out that area over there, and then get ready for tomorrow?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0004
109	I'd like to know what it is that you may be lacking. I'd hate for a fine piece of engineering to go to waste.
110	Do you think I...might not be good enough?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
111	Not necessarily. A mechanic skilled enough to make mech gear like this chose you as her partner, after all.	VO_regen.regen_sys_0039
112	Yeah! Yeah, you're right! Okay, here I go!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
