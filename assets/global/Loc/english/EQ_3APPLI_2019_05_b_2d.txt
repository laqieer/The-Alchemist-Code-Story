001	It was like a dream...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0008
002	More like a nightmare.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0030
003	I apologize on behalf of my little brother for all of his mischief. He's always been an uppity little jerk, ever since we were kids; charging recklessly into trouble...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0036
004	You're really calling me reckless? That's rich.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
005	Quiet, Romeo.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
006	H-hey, this space-time muck-up wasn't entirely my fault! It was our fault, right, Mira?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0027
007	Well...I can't deny my part in all this. You're right. Sorry, everyone.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
008	It's partly thanks to you that my plan to fix things worked, though.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
009	Well, duh!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
010	Oh! It's almost time for the Chance Encounter to end! We'll all be sent back to our respective worlds in short order.
011	I'll make sure we all make it home safe. You can count on me!
012	Well, guess this is goodbye. Play nice with your brother, Mira.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0008
013	H-huh?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
014	There's no need to blush!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0008
015	Your face is redder than mine!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
016	U-um, Nyx...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
017	Yeah? What's up, Hiiragi?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
018	U-um... I'm glad we met.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
019	Me, too.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
020	N-Nyx?! Can you still hear me?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
021	Yeah! I can hear you!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
022	N-Nyx! Um...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0001
023	I-I...I want you to know that I really...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
024	...
025	We're back.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
026	Looks like it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
027	I wonder what Hiiragi was trying to say? Oh, well. Guess we'll never know.
028	Right...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
029	Snow...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
030	...
031	Nyx, it's snowing! Can you believe it?! It never snows out here...
032	Heheh.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
033	Nyx? What're you snickering about?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
034	Heh...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
035	Seeing her get all excited made me feel really happy. That's all.
036	What?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
037	I heard you, Hiiragi. Loud and clear.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
038	Until very recently, I thought I was a normal girl.
039	I like pretty stones, and going on walks... I'm just...me.
040	But then I performed the Blood Covenant, and my entire life changed in an instant. Before I knew it, my normal everyday became...well, a little extraordinary.
041	Hiiragi! Let's get going already!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0008
042	R-right! Sorry!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0038
043	That stone looks good enough to eat.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0010
044	Y-you mustn't eat it!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0010
045	Where'd you get all those rocks, anyway?
046	Eheheh... These stones are the result of my careful analysis and investigation.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
047	Yet now I'm starting to see that what I at first perceived as extraordinary is becoming my ordinary.
048	That's why I decided to reserve my extraordinary solely for you...
049	I'm off!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0005
050	Do you know how I feel? Has my heart reached yours?
