001	Which way are you headed?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
002	To the archives. I want to search through various documents before everyone arrives. There may be some information regarding the Mitsuboshi.
003	I see. In that case, may I join you?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0045
004	The more minds and hands available, the faster a job gets done.
005	Yes, please.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
006	The Mikaboshi...
007	A Spirit Stone that is said to have been transmuted using methods that are no longer available to this time and age.
008	The mention here of Chakra is the Wadatsumi equivalent of Alchemia.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
009	Hmm. So far, it all coincides with our previous information.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
010	...!
011	...I can't believe it.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
012	If the things written in this document are true, then that means Greed Dike's interests are...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0027
013	What's the matter, Lord Commander? Did you find some provocative art or something?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
014	...?!
015	I see. This cannot be discarded. But how...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
016	The continuation is written here.
017	This...! What good luck! No, it may be better to call this fate.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0026
018	Yes. This is what her ability is for...	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
019	Desk work isn't too bad on occasion, isn't it, Lord Commander?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0010
020	Kazahaya...take care of Kagura.
021	Leave it to me, Lord Commander. Wherever she is, I'll bring her to you.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0038
022	I leave it in your hands.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
023	With pleasure.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
024	Let's ask!
025	Who are you? You're not from the Holy Guard, are you?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
026	Indeed. My name is Suzuka. I'm a traveling warrior training to become a knight.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
027	Am I correct in assuming that you are Captain Zain, the renowned Lord Commander of the Holy Guard?
028	That's correct...but what of it?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
029	Prepare yourself!
030	Oh dear... You're quite brave coming up from the front.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
031	Of course! As a warrior, I will not fight a battle which I cannot approach face forward!
032	I've fought every warrior I encounter while I made my way here!
033	Of course, I have no desire for unnecessary deaths, so we fought using the back of our swords.
034	I see...then you were lucky. Or should I say unlucky?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
035	What?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0029
036	Due to urgent matters at the moment, the most challenging knights are not here. It's a stroke of luck that you've come this far.
037	You...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
038	And, unfortunately, I'm in a hurry, so I don't have time to indulge you. I'm going to end this quickly.
039	As you wish! Let's go!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0014
