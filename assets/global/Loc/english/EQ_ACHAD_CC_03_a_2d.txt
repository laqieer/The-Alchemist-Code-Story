001	God doesn't answer our prayers.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
002	True.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
003	I've seen God, you know. You've gotta believe me on this one.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
004	God helped me transcend my humanity. Ever since then, I've been a changed man.
005	Here's a question for you: if, one day, you suddenly lost all sense of everything you once knew, how would you feel? Hm?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
006	You'd struggle to believe it, wouldn't you?
007	You must be my target. Formerly pious disciple of the Holy Order of Babel, member of the top-secret Corpse division—	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
008	What do you think happened to the fool who tried to find God for his mama's sake?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
009	Huh?
010	God saved him! Isn't that incredible?!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
011	But what do you think happened to the fool who transcended his humanity? Aha! He is free. He can do anything. He is almighty. Unchained from the commandments!
012	Right.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
013	But there was a catch! You see, being almighty makes life oh so very boring.
014	Like playing a game without any rules or stakes! There's no joy in a guaranteed victory, in playing the field when there's no one to match you.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0022
015	So the troubled fool prayed to God, and his fate was as I have described. Now, even though he has seen God with his own two eyes, he has stopped believing in the Almighty.
016	In time, he grew so sick of it all that he told his mama that he wanted to die. And do you know what she said to him?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
017	"Good for you." That was all!
018	Ahahah... Hahahahahahaha!	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0012
019	Is that why you left Corpse? In search of a game that wouldn't bore you?
020	Hahahahahahaha! Exactly! But, in the end, all I found was another boring farce!
021	Are you talking about the time you jumped into the Gluttony Foss Colosseum and killed everybody inside?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
022	What? Who did that? It wasn't me! "I did it! It was me!"
023	You trying to make it seem like you have multiple personalities or something? Like I give a damn.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
024	Oh, please! Believe me!
025	Not much chance of that, I'm afraid.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
026	I've been searching for a VIP seat!
027	My client is very angry with you. They're calling you an embarrassment to the Holy Order. A blasphemer in the eyes of God.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
028	Then perhaps, at long last, I'll be granted the satisfying end I've been yearning for! Oh, please say the bliss of the grave awaits me!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
029	Yep. They want you dead, no matter what it takes.
030	It has to be like this: I'm lying on a comfy bed, sipping on exquisite liquor while listening to gentle music, and there's a soft breeze running through my hair.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
031	Mama and I have the best seats in the house. Yes, we're watching our favorite play, and, ever so slowly, I begin to drift off.
032	There's a faint light shimmering through my eyelids. I feel cozy and warm, right down to the tips of my toes...and, just like that, I die.
033	Nothing less than this will do! It has to be a VIP seat. It has to be!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
