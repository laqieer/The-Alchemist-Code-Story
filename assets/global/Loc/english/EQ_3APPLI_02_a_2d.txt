001	We took down the enemy, but that black mist...!	VO_shekina.shekina_battle_0019
002	It's spreading more and more!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0042
003	Hurry. Get away from here! If you're swallowed by that, you won't be able to escape!	VO_rena.rena_battle_0019
004	Rena? Did you remember something?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
005	Yes...just a little.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0037
006	But let's talk later!
007	Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's just around the corner!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0043
008	Everyone! Let's go!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
009	Phew... Somehow, we managed to escape.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
010	What was that...black mist?
011	It is the thing that eats everything.
012	Eats everything? What do you mean?!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
013	Memories, existences, worlds...everything.
014	Memories...existences... Uh... I'm not sure what you mean, but basically something's happening?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
015	That is a culmination of the thoughts someone is producing... It has now reached the point that they threaten to consume the world.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0029
016	At this rate, the people throughout this world will lose their memories, and...
017	Ultimately, this world itself will be consumed.
018	Be consumed...?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
019	Rena! Who is this someone you're talking about?!
020	I'm sorry. That's the full extent of what I can remember.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0035
021	I...see.
022	If we can find this someone and defeat them...then maybe...	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
023	If we defeat that someone, can we return to our original worlds?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
024	Maybe.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0031
025	Um... I'm sorry to ruin the excitement, but...	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0016
026	Could you explain it in a way that someone who joined half-way like me can understand?
027	Oh, right. I'll explain from the beginning.
028	I see. So, because of that, various worlds are trying to connect...	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0045
029	That's why Tyrfing, Sakura, and I came to this world.
030	According to Rena, that seems to be the case. And, in order to avoid a crisis in this world and to return to our own worlds...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0004
031	We need to regain Rena's memory.	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0004
032	Shekinah, would you like to come with us? More is better...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
033	Oh! That might be a good idea! Besides, that strange black thing might show up again!
034	...Right.	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0031
035	 
036	I want to find a way to regain Rena's lost memories.	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0035
037	There may be others besides us who have come to this world.
038	Let's split up and search.
039	All right. Well, Shekinah, stay safe.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0037
040	You too, Tyrfing. Let's both make it back to Ragna safely!
041	She's gone. That was quite a showy outfit.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
042	Sakura, it's you!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0024
043	Huh?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
044	Yomi! You're in this world too?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
045	This world...? I don't really understand what's going on, but somehow I found myself here.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0026
046	What is this place? It doesn't look like this is the ninja village.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0001
047	Oh, um...it's a long story.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
048	Um... Is that person a Phantom?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
049	A Phantom...? What's that? This thing is a Samurai.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
050	A Samurai?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
051	Sakura...it's rude to call someone a "thing." That kinda talk is gonna get you killed!	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0016
052	I've read about them before in an old document in Wadatsumi. They are ancient warriors similar to Phantoms.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0044
053	Wow. I'm surprised they're mentioned in the writings of other worlds. Samurai are famous! Aren't they, Yomi!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0044
054	Sakura...something is coming.	VO_yomi_sinobina.yomi_sinobina_sys_0001
055	More monsters? Such bad timing!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
056	Did they appear here as well?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
057	From the inside again?!	VO_rena.rena_sys_0021
058	What should we do? Maybe we should temporarily withdraw.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
059	Growwwwl!
060	No good! We're surrounded!	VO_sakura.sakura_battle_0019
061	Let's continue to defeat the monsters as we push forward!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
062	Here they come!
