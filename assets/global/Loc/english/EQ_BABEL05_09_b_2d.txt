001	They must be absolved...as must I.
002	A Few Days Earlier... Northern Pride - Inquisition Headquarters
003	We will reaffirm our authority over the Holy Guard.
004	You're sending me to Lustburg?
005	There have been more than a few instances of inquisitors whom we have dispatched failing to return due to certain incidents occurring mid-mission.
006	Ordinarily, such a thing would be unthinkable. Who could possibly best an inquisitor, when they possess both the status and power to bring justice down upon even the knights of the Holy Order?
007	No one should be able to.
008	Unless, that is, they happen to possess the same powers of Alchemy.
009	The impact of the Lion Monarch's Charge has been immense. The world is unstable, and we have yet to truly recover.
010	I would say that that makes now the perfect time to adhere stringently to the rules.
011	The damage taken by the Holy Guard was, in a word, severe. We can expect that their reformation will take some time.
012	It is unfortunate, but the Holy Order of Babel is currently far from a united front.
013	This makes for the perfect foundation upon which excessive powers may run rampant.
014	As such, we will be sending you alone, Inquisitor, to monitor the actions of the Holy Guard. Make certain that they do not become aware of your presence.
015	Your task is twofold.
016	First, you will infiltrate Lustburg and thoroughly investigate each and every Paladin for a fixed period of time.
017	Second, you will work to expose their true purpose.
018	And should another of these incidents take place?
019	The Holy Guard must be held accountable.
020	...
021	This is a good opportunity, is it not?
022	To distance yourself from your parents' dishonor.
023	(Uncontrolled power.)
024	(Excessive power. Alchemy.)
025	Ravina has finally calmed down.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
026	Dear me! It has been a while since this last occurred. It was a rather large outburst, too.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0008
027	(Her powers, too, are out of control.)
028	...
029	Inquisitor?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0001
030	Y-yes?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
031	To pass judgment on others...
032	Such is my duty.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
033	Have you never doubted your own judgments?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0006
034	I would be lying if I said that I had not.
035	Perhaps there is something that you have reconsidered regarding the purpose of Alchemy, and the current state of the Holy Guard, then?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
036	Recent events have certainly given me a lot to think about.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
037	This young lady... Ravina...
038	She naturally possesses incredibly powerful magic and Alchemia Particles both.
039	She was once isolated for these powers—which she has no control over—by the people of her village.
040	All that she had in this world was the kindness of her parents.
041	One day, however, monsters attacked her village, and as she attempted to protect her parents, she descended into a frenzied panic.
042	Her magic overheated and exploded, destroying everything in the vicinity—the monsters, the village, and her parents, all at once.
043	...
044	Ravina is young, but she feels the weight of the responsibility for her powers far more heavily upon her shoulders than most.
045	Not to mention the weight of the guilt that she yet feels for failing to control her powers that day.
046	So please... Do not take Ravina's words from earlier to heart.
047	...
048	She reminds me of someone.
049	Of myself, in fact.
050	Oh?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
051	Hey.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
052	Yes?
053	What are the Cursed Beasts?
054	Wh-what?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
055	Not long ago, while exploring some ruins, I found a document detailing secrets about the Sacred Stone Asmodeus.
056	Am I to be silenced if I speak on?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
057	Wh-what do you—?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
058	I'm not afraid anymore.
059	I've already been killed once. There is no longer anything left for me to fear.
060	I will learn the truth.
061	I will protect this world.
062	What of the reparations I am owed?
063	...
064	I received my mission from the Holy Order! I was merely carrying it out in secrecy!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
065	Y-you're an inquisitor, aren't you? The Alchemy we use is one and the same! We are both loyal disciples of the Holy Order of Babel!
066	You must understand! Do you have any idea what will happen to me—and to you—if you—?!
067	This secret you speak of... I am afraid that I know nothing about it.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0035
068	I thought that might be your answer.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
069	Yet you became a target...of the Holy Guard, no less, for learning that truth?
070	That's what it looks like to me.
071	This is...troubling.
072	As an inquisitor who passes judgment on Alchemy and those who wield it...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
073	Don't you want to know?
074	Are you trying to involve me in this?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0045
075	I suppose that would be sinful of me, wouldn't it?
076	I would like you to accompany me—so long as you have no objections, that is.
077	You're the only lead I have.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0041
078	Lady Lofia...	VO_michael.michael_sys_0001
079	I need to know why they killed me.
080	I can never meet Milis again in this life.
081	That is...true.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
082	...
083	Very well.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_2001
084	I accept your request as reasonable and just.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_3001
085	Whether it be within power, people, systems, or organizations... Where corruption festers, one cannot deny that some violent action may be required to suppress it.
086	There are rules for this very purpose, and I will follow them. I will pass judgment upon heresy and expose the darkness!
087	Even should it lie within the organization of which I am part.
088	I'd like to hear more about that.
089	Who's there?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
090	Sorry to interrupt. I was looking for my sister.
091	Identify yourself immediately!
092	You want my name? Heh. You can call me Nyx.
093	H-how did you get in here, young man?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0026
094	Anyway, since I'm here and all, I really wanna know.
095	I wanna know about the future of this world.
096	What?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
097	To put it bluntly...
098	I'm running out of time.
