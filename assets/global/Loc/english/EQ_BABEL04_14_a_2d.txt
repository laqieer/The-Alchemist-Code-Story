001	I was always giving my brother trouble.
002	Knocking over toys and baskets while I played...
003	As I watch the memories unravel...
004	A winding river, reminiscent of the River Styx, appears before me.
005	I can't go back, now.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
006	Sumeragi is no more. My demon powers have run dry. I feel...hollow.
007	I tried to shoulder all the burdens of my family.
008	I tried to move forward, using the dream I shared with my brother to guide me.
009	I tried to keep pace with my friends.
010	I tried so incredibly hard—and yet...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
011	After all that, no matter how hard I tried... Why?	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0028
012	How long are you going to keep chasing me?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
013	Ah!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
014	A voice...from the other side?
015	Tag is a children's game.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
016	I know this voice. I know it so well.
017	The sun is setting. You ought to go home soon, before it gets dark.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
018	I...I want to! I want to go home! B-but...it's so dark, and...and...I have no home to go back to!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
019	If you open your eyes, you will see the starry sky, even in blackest night.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
020	Don't leave behind the people that are important to you.
021	But...I...!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
022	I've lost...everything!
023	Corruption is the doing of man—and so it is man that must carry it.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
024	There is no such thing as a world without corruption. The ninja will carry the weight of this truth on their shoulders.
025	You, however...	VO_zin.zin_chara_1007
026	You have the noble task of guiding them.
027	I...!
028	Have you forgotten everything you've worked for?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
029	Surrounded by allies, you have no blind spots.
030	...
031	Had you forgotten?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
032	No...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
033	I just...took a little detour.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
034	I know. You're a hard worker.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0007
035	Walking with your back bowed, basket full of worries... You pass your wares on, and now...it's empty.
036	Fill up your empty basket, bow your back, and head to your friends' sides.
037	Standing up, now, are we?
038	Y-Yomi?
039	My life flashed before my eyes.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
040	And yet...here you are.
041	The memories I saw were all...happy. A happy past—a peaceful dream.
042	I can't let it end there.
043	I won't give up until a happy future is in my past!
044	Oh, Yomi. It is far too late for that. Now that I have unleashed corruption upon the world, I am afraid that there is nothing you can do.
045	...
046	Do you know how the wind blows?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
047	What?
048	It rushes from big spaces to small ones, from crowded spaces to sparse ones...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
049	The bigger the difference, the harder it blows.
050	What of it? The wind is irrelevant.
051	D-don't tell me...!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0022
052	Relax your shoulders. Empty yourself.
053	In your mind's eye, it spins on and on, around and around...
054	I call out to the corruption in this world, and I beseech it—
055	Return unto me!
056	What?! What is this?!
057	I was waiting for this moment.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
058	The moment that the Kagomurasaki rises.
059	Now, taste of the secret technique of my clan! Behold, Kagomurasaki!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0014
060	The true role of my clan was not only to store corruption...
061	It was also to purify it, and restore it to the world!
062	L-look! Corruption is swirling around Yomi...like a whirlwind!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
063	That technique, the Kagomurasaki... It's devouring corruption!
064	The Mikaboshi?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
065	I-it's transferring to Yomi!
066	M-my corruption! My precious, beautiful corruption! The Mikaboshi! No!
067	Do not leave me!
068	You...! Will you feast upon it all, you glutton?!
069	Heed me, Mikaboshi.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
070	Wh-what?!
071	If you would slake your thirst on hatred and grief, amplifying corruption in the hearts of humans...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0010
072	If you would seek a turning point in our corruption-laced history...
073	This is your chance!
074	Together, we will create a new era! Come, join our ranks!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0002
075	Y-Yomi!
076	We will persevere until the very end, drawing strength from the past!
077	No doubt about it!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
078	Yeah.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
079	...
080	Mikaboshi! I beseech you to be an ally of Wadatsumi!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
081	You...?! What are you—?!
082	It was the mutual wish for peace, shared by humans and demons alike, that brought you into this world!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
083	If you would manifest corruption and turn us into demons...
084	Then take my blighted prayers!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
085	I know! I'm a greedy little child! I'm pathetic! I never know when to quit! But this is my final wish—the wish I have been chasing all this time!
086	W-wait! This cannot possibly—!
087	My brother—Jin!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
088	Give...him...back...to...me!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0008
089	...
090	Welcome back.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
091	I'm glad you're here.
092	Jin.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
093	...
094	Thank you, Yomi.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
095	Nnnggggrrhhhh! Grrraaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!
096	Your power, this world's corruption—all of it is now mine!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0010
097	Grrraaarrrrrrgggghhhh! You! You...!
098	Everything is my burden to bear.
099	Human and demon as one.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
100	Let's fulfill our promise to one another.
101	Right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
102	Long have I awaited this moment.
103	Today's meeting, like the blue moon...
104	Has been fated since those bygone days.
105	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooooorrrrrggggghhhhhhh!
106	The demon horde ends here.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0012
107	Now, we exorcise demons.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
