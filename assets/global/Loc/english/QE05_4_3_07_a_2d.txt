001	Well met, Protector. We have been waiting for you.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
002	The Collectors of Wisdom!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
003	Where is Ceclidis?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
004	Our goal is to perform the resurrection ceremony, to return this world to the days of warmth and goodness.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
005	Knowing that, do you really need me to tell you where he has gone?
006	The arboreal altar! Still, without a druidic priestess—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
007	No, even with a priestess, it is too late. All that is left of the great tree Sephiron is the corruption that destroyed it. Whatever you hope to accomplish by attempting to reawaken it, your efforts will all be for naught!
008	Hmph. So even you hadn't realized. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0024
009	After all, you seem determined to be Sephiron's Protector until the bitter end.
010	What are you trying to say?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0012
011	Yes, the great Sephiron as we once knew it is gone! The blessings of the Tree of Life have withered away, and we have been left bereft of the paradise that it once gave us!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
012	And yet not all has been lost! O Mother Sephiron, you have not forsaken us! You left one last thing behind, knowing that the chosen ones would see it for the blessing it truly is. The potential to raise a new Sephiron—a Tree of Calamity!
013	Cryphone! We throw ourselves at your feet in supplication! Draw your power from us, and be born anew!
014	The curse of the Sacred Stone, which has taken root within Ceclidis, and a druidic priestess... These two things are all that is needed for Cryphone to sprout upon the carcass of Sephiron!
015	Do you understand now, Protector? The Sephira are no more!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0008
016	It is time for a new world order! Cryphone, raise your fallen people to our rightful place!
017	Cast down these grasping remnants of the past! This is the end for you, Protector of Sephiron!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
018	No!
