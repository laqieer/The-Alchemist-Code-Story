001	Sigh...	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
002	I cannot believe I made Ankh upset. He's usually so unflappable!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0022
003	I wanted to make him smile, but I infuriated him instead.
004	...
005	(I did my best to make people to smile by helping them, just like she'd done for me...)
006	(Perhaps I'm simply not good at it.)
007	I love this festival. Everybody working together to set it up and making each other smile so happily...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
008	Festivals make people happy. That's why I love festivals, and I will do anything to protect them.
009	I see... Then I wish to be like you, Klima, someone who can protect the smiles of others.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0044
010	I wish to be strong and help others as you do. I want to be strong enough to protect people's happiness.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0008
011	That's good.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
105	I think that's very good. I give you an A+ for ambition.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
012	...
013	There you are.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
014	Reimei! You came looking for me?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
015	I mean, it's hard to not worry when someone runs out like that.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
016	Ah, r-right.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
017	I'm sorry. I've only caused problem after problem.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0035
018	I'm so horrible. Not at all worthy of an A+.
019	An A+, huh?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
020	Plumeria, why put so much effort into this?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
021	Excuse me?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
022	I asked you earlier, didn't I? About why you were so interested in helping out with the White Day party? And you were about to say something. What was it?
023	Right. But why insist on White Day for that?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
024	Well, that's because White Day is—
025	...
026	What is it that motivates you?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
027	I...
028	I don't want anybody to regret the way I do.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
029	Regret?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
030	A long time ago, I was told that there was a festival in a particular village. I wanted to see it for myself very much, but Mother and Father forbade me, saying that it could be dangerous.
031	Back then, I was often a target for kidnapping because people thought they could ransom me for money, so I understand their apprehension.
032	Kidnapping? Oh, right. You were the only child of a noble family.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
033	But I just couldn't help myself. I snuck away to the festival.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0011
034	It was so fascinating and fun, but just as my parents feared, I ended up surrounded by scary people.
035	Heheheh, you out here alone? Pretty careless for a rich kid. You should be worth a damn good bit of ransom.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
036	L-let me go!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_battle_0022
037	(If I scream, I will ruin the festival for everybody. How can I do that when this is the result of my own careless and selfish actions?)
038	(I cannot allow that! But then...what can I do?)
039	Huh? Is it raining?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
040	Waaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0028
041	Ouch...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0042
042	A-are you all right?!
043	Absolutely.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
044	More importantly, are you? Can you still smile?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
045	I-I'm sorry?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
046	I love this festival. So I want everyone to enjoy it as well. You ought to be smiling too.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
047	Oh, I'm fine. I can still smile and have fun. I love this festival too!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0004
048	I see. That's good.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
049	I, um! Th-thank y—
050	Klima, you really outdid yourself this year! It's going to be hard beating something like making it rain on a harvest festival the next time.
051	The lightning was a bit much, though.
052	If you like, Klima, we can prepare that tea for you to thank you for livening up the festival.
053	Ooh! Yay! I love this tea. The citrus notes are especially lovely.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0024
054	Would you like some too, young lady?
055	May I?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0025
056	Of course! Only because it's a festival day, though!
057	And so you regret not being able to show your gratitude to that person.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
058	The next time I visited that village, she was not there. I was never able to see her again.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
059	To show gratitude to those who have been kind to you... White Day is really a wonderful event.
060	No one has to live with regret as long as they do not miss their chance to express their gratitude like I did.
061	Is that what White Day is about? I thought White Day was just about giving people sweets.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
062	But along with the sweets, people present their words of gratitude!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0031
063	Huh, I see. So it's a day we gift sweets specifically those who you feel grateful towards.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
064	Yes. So, when I heard about the party to celebrate White Day, I knew I had to take part in it.
065	I wanted the party to be one in which those expressing their gratitude and those receiving it would be smiling and happy.
066	I did not want anyone else to miss their chance to express their gratitude.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0018
067	I see. I think I understand where you're coming from, and why you've been acting so anxious about this.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0005
068	Reimei...
069	However, I think it's important to start with what you know you can handle in order to accomplish what you want.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
070	Slow and steady wins the race, you know. You can't help anyone by just rushing around with no real plan.
071	...
072	What I know I can handle...
073	Filling the party venue with a floral aroma was a great idea, and I think Ankh will come around to it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
074	Wait...
075	(Aroma... Bergamot... Citrus notes... Could it be?)
076	You're right. I understand.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0004
077	I'm glad you do. So for now, let's go follow whatever instructions Ankh h—
078	I'm going to go find the legendary tea, Parfaire!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
079	Uh, what?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
080	Wait, what? Why?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
081	I've got a plan!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
082	No... Listen, when I said that, I meant—	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
083	There is no need to worry. I'm sure I can... No, I must accomplish this quest!
084	When I find this legendary tea, I'm sure Ankh will smile!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0008
085	Parfaire tea, eh? We do indeed make that here in this village.
086	I knew it!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0009
087	It's just that we haven't any available right now.
088	That tea has a really short expiration date. It has to be brewed almost immediately after being roasted. One day at the most.
089	The roasting process is unique as well. So it almost never leaves this village, and we only have it on special occasions.
090	I see. Um... What if... What if I bring fresh leaves here? Could you roast them for me?	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0020
091	I don't mind, but... Are you going alone, miss?
092	I can tell you where to find some, but monsters roam those parts. It's dangerous.
093	Do not worry! I am more capable than I appear.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0007
094	Ah, another day of successfully bringing couples together. I feel so accomplished!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
095	Now, I wonder how Plumeria is doing? I hope everything went well.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
096	Wait, Plumeria?! What are you doing here alone?!
097	Wait a minute... Alone?! Why are you alone?!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
098	Moa! I am here searching for the legendary tea!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
099	Huh? You're... What's going on?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
100	C-could it be, perhaps, a gift of love?! P-Plumeria, wait for me!
101	Surely it must be somewhere around here.	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0031
102	To come all this way for a gift... You are more proactive than I thought, Plumeria.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
103	Huh? Uh, yes! I am doing my best!	VO_plumeria.plumeria_sys_0005
104	Uh oh! An obstacle to your love has appeared! Well, you know what they say: the course of true love never did run smoothly!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0032
