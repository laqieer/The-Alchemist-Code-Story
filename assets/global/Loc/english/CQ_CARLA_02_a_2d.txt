001	Phew, we made it! I never thought we'd be attacked by so many bandits!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
002	Thanks for everything back there, Miss Carla!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0033
003	You sure are strong. Those guys didn't stand a chance.	VO_alba.alba_sys_1050
004	Well, I grew up in these parts, so I'm pretty used to it.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
005	In your case, I wouldn't underestimate the desert if I were you, kid. It's pretty dangerous.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
006	I know you've got to make a living, but at least get yourself a chaperone, kid…	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
007	Believe me, I take this place seriously. Us merchants are pretty light on our feet, you know.	VO_alba.alba_chara_2001
008	Besides, I'm not a kid.
009	Actually, we might be closer in age than you think. I've got several years under my belt…	VO_alba.alba_sys_0011
010	You don't say?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0044
011	Here, take a look at my wares. You think a kid could nab all these?
012	Lately, I've had a lot of weapons sales.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
013	See, what do you think?
014	Hm. Not bad! They're all high quality! Not to mention--	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
015	Well, I'll be! Don't see goods like that 'round here. How much are you selling that for?
016	This? I think I could let it go for about this much.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0037
017	Deal! Never thought I'd get my hands on one of these babies.
018	Impressive! With wares like these, I'm sure you'll sell out in no time.
019	*Chuckle* Traveling the world gives me an edge over the competition!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
020	If I catch wind of a popular item, I'll book it to that region and judge for myself if it's worthwhile.
021	Oh yeah? That's good news for you, but I bet the guilds are none too happy.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0045
022	I'm sure it's fine. I rarely make it out here to the desert, anyway.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
023	Oh? Is that right?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
024	Besides, the guilds have all the power around here. I don't have much of a leg to stand on.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0006
025	If you include travel expenses and the like, I can barely turn a profit.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0016
026	Yikes...
027	Wait a sec. Then why did you come all the way out here, kid?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
028	Why bother if you can't even make money?
029	Actually, I came here to deliver a special order to a customer.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
030	During his travels, this customer discovered a delicious tea made in a settlement in Saga.
031	But the guild doesn't do business with the settlement, so I stocked up and came here to sell it!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
032	You went to all that trouble for one customer? You sure are nice, kid.
033	Nice? Nah… Sure, I like to put a smile on my customers' face, but that's not all there is to it.	VO_alba.alba_chara_2001
034	What do you mean?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0039
035	It might seem like a lot of work to please one customer.
036	But I think I'll benefit in the long run.
037	?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
038	Hey, you!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
039	You can't set up shop here without the guild's permission!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
040	Huh? You've got the wrong idea. I'm just showing my wares to a friend.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
041	We saw you conducting business with a customer just a minute ago.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
042	Well, that was…actually…	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
043	I suggest you educate yourself and abide by the guild's rules if you want to do business here.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
044	Tell you what--you sell us your wares wholesale, and we forget this ever happened. Capiche?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0004
045	What's your problem? You think you can talk to him like that because he's an outsider?
046	Butt out, missy. Besides, I think it's a reasonable offer.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
047	Tch. Seems that jerk is intent on buying from you. What'll you do, Aruba?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
048	Um, thanks...but no thanks.	VO_alba.alba_sys_1050
049	What!?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
050	How come? Weren't you just saying how hard it was to turn a profit out here?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
051	That's true--at least, for now.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
052	Then why?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
053	A merchant needs to be patient, Miss Carla.
054	…!
055	Live in the desert long enough and you become impatient--your heart starts to dry up…
056	For me, watering this seed is like praying to return some life to the desert.
057	(This kid has the same determined look in his eyes. Just like Hawk…)	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
058	…
059	Damn… if we go easy on him now, he'll get cocky…	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0012
060	Don't think outsiders like you can do business here. We'll drive you out!
061	Alright, boys. Take care of him!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
062	Aieeeee!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0027
063	Wait a damn minute! This isn't right!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
064	Shut up! We pay our dues to the guild in order to do business here.
065	We're not going to be disrespected by some outsider!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
066	I thought it was your tone that I disliked, but it's this whole corrupt system.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
067	I bet you were hoping to make money off of Aruba's wares, weren't you?
068	Shut your mouth unless you want to wind up like him!
069	Resorting to violence to settle this, huh? Pathetic.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0017
070	Aruba is just trying to make an honest living…
071	It's thanks to people like you the desert is in this sad state!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0013
