001	Ack! Without the animals, I don't think I can handle these many opponents.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0022
002	Regroup! We're up against a mage! Let's close the distance and use our numbers to our advantage!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
003	Ack. They're regrouping! Well, I'm not going to just standby and—	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
004	... ...
005	...Agh! An ambush! They have archers hidden behind the trees!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0026
006	Now! Press onward!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0012
007	I guess this is where it ends.
008	No! I'm not giving up!
009	If I'm captured here, it might lead them to find Peridot's whereabouts!
010	And if I die here—
011	I'm sure it'll make her cry. We only lived together for a short while, but I know how kind she is.
012	I can't allow that! She's my friend. I'm sure of it. She's someone who I could finally be friends with!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
013	That's why I need your help, animals! Lend me your strength!
014	Wh-what the—?! These beasts are protecting the mage! Agh?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
015	Don't panic! Whatever strange arts this mage may wield, he's alone—	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
016	Enough.
017	What?! Another one!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
018	You who have hurt my forest, my hometown—my friend. You will not escape this forest alive.	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0013
019	Wh-what is this?! It's not just the beasts! It's the trees and the earth as well!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0043
020	Peri...dot?
021	Honestly. Up until the very end, you couldn't even manage to fetch the water properly.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0030
022	Ahaha. You're right. Well, I did try my best.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
023	You don't have to tell me that. I already know. Now stand back.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0007
024	No, I'm going to fight too. I can't abandon my friend.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0013
025	I see. Let's go then.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0006
026	Yes!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
