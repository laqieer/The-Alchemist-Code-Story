001	Here they come!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
002	To be frank, this is a gamble. Should we slip up, there will be no second chances.
003	Nonetheless, this is the best hand we have to play.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
004	Everyone, listen up! We are now going to launch our attack on the enemy's main forces!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
005	You must not fall behind! Know that should even one of you fall behind, this plan will fail!
006	It's time! Forward!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
007	What?! They're charging out with their entire force?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0005
008	Y-yes, sir! Not only that, but they're headed straight for us!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0037
009	Desert scum! Have they lost all sense?! We outnumber them three to one! Crush them!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
010	Yes, sir!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0001
011	All right, they fell for it! Here they come!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
012	Keep that speed up! You must not slow down! "I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
013	Huh? What's that light?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
014	Urrggghhh... Aarrrrggghhhh! What are they doing?! I thought they were on our side!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0043
015	Wh-what is the meaning of this?! King Ceclidis, why—?!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0027
016	It's working! Ceclidis didn't intentionally set the Jam upon that city.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
017	They were merely attacking whatever emitted the strongest Alchemia in the area along the army's march!
018	All we needed to do was direct their incentive.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
019	That is what you get for shutting yourself up in your palace and failing to stand on the front lines with your troops, Ceclidis!
020	We must make the most of this opportunity! Leave the Jam who come this way to Tina and the Fruit Peddlers!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
021	Logi! Take the Liberation Army and tear a hole in Gluttony's defenses while they're still reeling!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
022	Right! Leave it to me!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
