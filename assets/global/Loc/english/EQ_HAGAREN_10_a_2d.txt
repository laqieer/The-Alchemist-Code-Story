001	This... This is like something out of a fairy tale.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0031
002	It is a beautiful place, but...every country has its dark side.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
003	Destruction and sorrow exist in any place that has an uneven distribution of power, like with the Holy Order of Babel and their Paladins.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
004	Ravina...I should tell you how much I appreciate you working with the Colonel and the others to prepare for this.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
005	What the Order did to you... I used to think of it as just another piece of history. Now, I see that it was a sign of what the Order is capable of.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
006	I'm sorry. I don't deserve your forgiveness, and I won't ask for it. However, I just wanted to say... Thank you.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0035
007	It wasn't you who wronged me... It was the Order. Neither the sin I was born into, nor that you were made to bear, is our own burden to carry.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
008	Leave the homunculus to us. You focus on destroying the tower. We won't let the Order get away with their machinations again!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
