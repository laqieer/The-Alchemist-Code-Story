001	Glurrrrrp!
002	...Huh?
003	You! Are you all right?
004	I-I think so. Who are you? Are you alive?
005	I am. I am alive. My name's Kamui. What's yours? Are you all alone out here?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
006	In the factory over there... There's a grown-up, and...
007	I-I was looking for something to eat, and...
008	Will you take me to them?
009	O-okay!
010	Mister!
011	There you are! I told you to stay inside these walls! You... Wait, who are you?
012	Are the Jam not here? What is this place?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0025
013	The Jam? You mean those goo monsters?
014	I'm not sure why, but they seem to avoid this building.
015	They avoid this place?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0012
016	Anyway, let's get inside. Those monsters' shrieks freak me out.
017	Is this...limestone?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
018	Yeah, it's one of the ingredients for making mortar. This place used to deal with building materials. It's a bit dusty, but it's secure.
019	I owe you. I'm—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0034
020	Ah, yeah, I know I asked outside, but I sort of figured. You're with the Liberation Army, aren't you?
021	Yes. Does that not bother you?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
022	Why should it? There are monsters crawling about right outside. We humans gotta stick together.
023	Besides, it's about time we got moving from this place. We ran out of food a little while ago. Where are your friends?
024	We got separated.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
025	Well, that's unfortunate...for all of us.
026	I was hoping you would have some means of helping us out of here.
027	How long has the royal capital been like this?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
028	The monsters started roaming around last night, but...
029	We have had a lot of people going missing at night. It could have been going on for a while.
030	Are there any others here?
031	Nah, just me and the kid. No relation, but, I couldn't just abandon a child.
032	I mean...not after one of those monsters took mine from me.
033	...
034	Anyway, if we coop up here, we'll just be waiting to starve.
035	Can you fight? I was wondering if we could ask you to be our bodyguard.
036	You mean, you know of a way out?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
037	Yeah. This royal capital was built on what used to be a mine.
038	There are still a few tunnels that people used as little passages.
039	And the Jam aren't in them?
040	I wouldn't know about that, but there should at least be less then there are on the streets.
041	I've seen those things all over the place, but I haven't seen one crawl out of the tunnels yet.
042	I see. Well then, I'll accept your request.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0038
043	Really? Thank you. Hold on, let me just go get the kid!
044	Hm... Why do the Jam avoid this building?
045	I feel like I'm missing something, but...what?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
046	It's so dark!
047	Stay close! It's like a maze in here. If we deviate from the right path, even I'll get lost.
048	Wait for me! C-can we light a torch, please?
049	No way! If we burn a torch in this small space, we'll burn through our air and suffocate!
050	I beseech the supreme...
051	Whoa! What the–?! Is that some sort of magic?
052	Some thing like that. Is this the right way?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
053	No doubt. I'll lead the way ahead. Would I be able to hold that light?
054	Yes, please.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
055	Um... Mister?
056	Hm?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0005
057	Th-thank you.
058	We still have a long way to go. Try not to push yourself too hard.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
059	Got it!
060	...
061	What is it?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
062	Just as I thought, there aren't any of the Jam here, but...
063	Grrrrrrr...
064	I forgot this place was closed off because monsters sometimes nest in here!
065	Get back! I'll take care of this!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
066	You got it! Come on, missy! This way!
067	B-be careful, mister!
