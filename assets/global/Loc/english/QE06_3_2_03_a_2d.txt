001	—That is all.
002	The demons are invading quicker than anticipated. Can we fortify our ranks any further?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
003	I'm afraid we can't. We're already being criticized in the castle-town for indiscriminately moving our men to these distant villages.
004	The people are scared everywhere. They believe these demon invasions may release the seal upon the Demon Paragon.
005	On top of that, we have suffered innumerable casualties.
006	I'm all too aware. That's why I'm working on devising a solid plan to deal with these attacks.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0037
007	But at this rate—
008	As I said, I'm well aware!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0015
009	Though I also said I'd take responsibility...yet I've allowed the demons to invade. And there seems to be nothing I can do to mitigate the damage or quell the people's fears.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
010	I'm losing their trust. That's another thing I'm well aware of, unfortunately.
011	Lady Mitsuha...
012	Moreover, the fact that I'm raising demon children here is spurring on even more distrust.
013	Ma'am, that's—
014	My apologies. I won't be able to protect anyone or anything if I allow such worries to consume me. I must bear this burden and act decisively.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0035
015	Evacuate all the survivors from the destroyed village to the castle-town.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
016	You mean to abandon the village?!
017	If we're running so low on troops and can't send any to their defense, it's the only way to protect its residents.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
018	But—
019	I'll take full responsibility for this action. Now hurry, before there are any further casualties!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
020	Yes, Ma'am!
021	...!
022	Lady Mitsuha, you look tired. You must rest.
023	There's no time for that. There's too much to be dealt with.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
024	Are you also concerned for the seal on the Demon Paragon, then?
025	We need something stronger. Since we can't kill it, we need to find a way to make the seal last for all eternity.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
026	If we can do just that much, the people would at least feel a bit more at ease. And there is a way, but...
027	If you know a way to do it, why not see it through? Is it simply a time-consuming process? Or could it be there's something about it that gives you pause?
028	This is the Demon Paragon we're talking about—the Discarnate Power itself! Strengthening the seal upon it would require an immense fortitude and nearly superhuman resolve.
029	We would need a human sacrifice to serve as its Kago—its "cage"—and a family line to keep watch over it once the sealing is complete. And even that wouldn't quite be enough, unfortunately.
030	The Kago would need to take in demon blood in order to bear the burden of its duties. That is the only way.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
031	A human sacrifice...and demon blood...
032	No one would ever wish to fill such a role. And if I were take up the role myself, there would be no one left to oversee Wadatsumi's affairs.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
033	And that's saying nothing of the negative effects one would suffer after taking in demon blood...
034	Lady Mitsuha, you needn't bear this burden alone. We stand with you.
035	Then tell me, who will do it in my place?!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
036	The people are saying that this wouldn't have happened if we hadn't made peace with the demons.
037	But the fact is, for a short time, we did achieve true peace!
038	None of that matters now, though. We—I—must address the problems that lie before us.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
039	Just remember, milady, that those in power are always subject to criticism, whether or not their rule is fair and just.
040	Be that as it may, I am my own critic as well. And I know I still have a long road ahead before I can properly represent the will of the people.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0030
041	I wish you wouldn't be so hard on yourself. Just remember, if there is anything at all I can do, please do not hesitate to ask. I will assist however I am able.
042	......
043	Koga... Kaede... You weren't wrong. You weren't mistaken.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
044	This is the product of malice. And it's my fault for being unable to hold it back.
045	But blaming myself will accomplish nothing. I must set my guilt and regrets aside, and do what I can to salvage as much as possible.
046	......
047	Hey... Heyyy...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
048	...
049	Su-me-ra-gi, are you even listening?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0001
050	What?
051	I'm bored.
052	Good for you.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0006
053	So let's do something!
054	I don't have time.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
055	Of course not! You're always too busy reading, or drawing pictures, or both!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0017
056	Then why did you ask?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
057	I don't get how you can read every day and not get bored. Is that a cookbook? And are you drawing pictures of the food?!
058	It's not a cookbook. It's got more than just recipes in it. This was Father's journal, so there's a lot of information about him in here too.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
059	He did a bunch of research on the history of Wadatsumi. You should read it sometime. it's really interesting.
060	I don't want to just sit around! I want to go outside and move my body! It's boring always being cooped up in here!
061	You can always explore inside the castle—with Lady Mitsuha's permission, of course.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
062	Come on, you know that's not what I'm talking about!
063	If you go outside, you're in danger. Cross the wrong person's path and you'll wind up dead.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0014
064	The people hate us, you know. And with those horns, you especially would stick out like a sore thumb.
065	I know that! But still...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0030
066	...
067	Hey, Sumeragi?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
068	What?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
069	Was what our parents did really that bad?
070	I don't think so.
071	All right. Well, in that case—	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0019
072	Let me finish. I don't think so, but the people of Wadatsumi do. And there's nothing we can do about that.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
073	......
074	Hello? May I come in?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
075	How are you two getting along today?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0037
076	You asked the same thing yesterday. You don't need to worry about us so much, Lady Mitsuha!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
077	I suppose I can't help but worry a little. But you're right. I don't want to be a bother.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
078	You said that yesterday, too! Don't worry. You've already done so much for us. We're fine.
079	I just wish I could do more.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
080	You've taken very good care of us. I'm grateful to you, and so is Mikaboshi.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
081	Thank you. That's kind of you to say.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0033
082	Ohh, is that a smile?! I haven't seen one of those from you in forever!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0008
083	Really?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
084	You always look so tired. We're worried about you, too! Right, Sumeragi?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
085	I'm sorry you have to go through all this trouble just to keep us safe.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0035
086	Ah!
087	That's why we're happy to see you smile.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
088	All right, you two. Get in here!
089	...?
090	...!
091	Thank you so much.
092	If ever there's anything you want from me—anything at all—please, let me know. I'll do whatever I can for you, always.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
093	That sentiment alone is more than enough for me.
094	I...want to go outside.
095	Mikaboshi...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
096	We didn't do anything wrong. It was our parents, not us.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
097	But we're the ones who can't go outside? That hardly seems fair!
098	It...isn't fair. You're right.
099	We know there are a lot of people who say we should never have been born. But, even so...
100	I want to go outside.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0030
101	!!!
102	If only I didn't have these horns...maybe I could've played outside all this time, and nobody would've known!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0018
103	Mikaboshi...
104	I'm sorry. I know I'm just being selfish.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0035
105	No. No, you're not.
106	Lady Mitsuha, you know you don't have to take care of us, right? If we're causing you trouble, we don't have to stay here.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
107	It's not like you're our mother.
108	...
109	Mikaboshi, stop.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0014
110	But it's true!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0029
111	Mikaboshi...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0015
112	I'm sorry, Lady Mitsuha.
113	There's no need to apologize. What you said is true.
114	No, it was rude. Please accept my apology on her behalf. She doesn't mean it the way it sounded.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0035
115	There really is no need to apologize. I swore to Koga and Kaede that I would take you in and keep you safe. That's the relationship we have.
116	And it's why I think of you as if you were my own children.
117	......
118	But that's just how I think of you. You don't have to feel the same way about me. I understand that it's probably quite...difficult for you to do so.
119	I want you to always tell me the truth—how you really feel. Even if it's selfish, I won't mind. I promise.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0041
120	Lady Mitsuha...
121	I decided, back then, that this was my responsibility to bear. And I remain committed to that resolution.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0037
122	......
123	I'll come back to check on you again later. Please, take care.
124	Mikaboshi...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
125	I-I didn't—	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0018
126	I don't want to hear it.
127	I'm sorry...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0035
128	If you're going to apologize to anyone, apologize to Lady Mitsuha.
129	Okay.
130	Honestly...
131	I know. That was selfish of me to say. Lady Mitsuha is having such a hard time because of us.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0030
132	I just want to see her smile more.
133	Why didn't you say that earlier?
134	Because if I did, I know she'd just work herself even harder.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0022
135	It's to realize our parents' dream of a peaceful land, though.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
136	I know that! And I know how much Lady Mitsuha cares for us. I really do.
137	Hmph. Then you need to work on communicating that a little better.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0030
138	......
139	Tell you what. It's been a while. You want to spar a little?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0001
140	Huh? Really? What's gotten into you all of a sudden, Mr. I'm-Too-Busy-To-Hang-Out?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
141	You'll feel better if you move around. Then we can go apologize to Lady Mitsuha together.
142	That sounds nice. Thank you, Sumeragi.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
143	Anytime.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0007
144	Don't think I'm going to go easy on you, though! Get ready to behold the true power of your sister!
145	Maybe go a little easy on me?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0011
146	You wish! Let's do this!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_battle_0010
