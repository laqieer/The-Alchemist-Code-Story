001	As usual, there are a lot of them around here.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
002	...? What the...?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
003	...!!!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0027
004	Hey, what's the matter? Did you twist your ankle?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
005	...?! Ye-yes. Just now, when I was running from those beasts.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
006	From the look of it, you come from a noble family. What're you doing in a place like this?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
007	A weapon...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
008	... ...
009	(Not another one of these...)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0016
010	I wanted to gift my frail brother with a new sword...
011	(Another pest drawn to my title of the Ultimate Blacksmith.)	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
012	Sorry, but you'd best hurry on home.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
013	...What?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
014	I have no intention of welding a sword that'll adorn some nobleman's mansion.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
015	Um. What exactly are you talking about? I came to this mountain in order to make...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
016	Like I said, I...huh? What did you just say?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
017	I heard that this mountain is reputed for the quality of its ore, so I came here in order to make a sword.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0004
018	Make a sword? You?! Are you sure you didn't come here to "have a sword made for you by the Ultimate Blacksmith"?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
019	I don't know what it is that you didn't understand, but I mean exactly what I said.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0031
020	Hey, wait, where do you think you're going?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
021	I need to hurry up and make the sword, so I can return to my brother.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
022	You can't. Now scurry back down the mountain.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0014
023	I'm grateful that you helped me, but if you're going to get in the way of me creating my brother's sword, then...	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0017
024	I'll just have to kill you.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0010
025	Huh...? That escalated fast.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0026
026	Does that better help you comprehend the feelings I hold for my brother?	VO_reyda.reyda_chara_1008
027	Hey! From the look of him, isn't that the Ultimate Blacksmith?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
028	...And who are you scum?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
029	Hmph. We heard you were an unreasonable one! Just come quietly and do as we say! You're going to make a sword for our master!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
030	You lot are easier to understand. If you can "bend" my will then I may just consider your request.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
031	Why do you ask another to create a weapon you seek yourself?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0016
032	...Who's this woman?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
033	How can you expect a weapon to be of high quality when you've had someone else create without any effort on your part?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0030
034	Hey...	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1011
035	Are you mocking our master?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
036	The ore in this mountain belongs to my brother! So scurry back on down the mountain and inform your idiot of a master!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0010
037	You wench...!!! You'll regret those words! Die!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
038	Argh! Why do I have to get caught up in this?!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0042
