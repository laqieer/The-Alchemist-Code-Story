001	Now is your chance, sons of Zeke Crowley.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
002	Way ahead of you!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
003	We don't need you to order us around!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
004	Finally, we have arrived. How strange to have been called so far, a field apart from my comrades.	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0030
005	Yet it seems that I have made it in time for the climax of this tale, at the very least.
006	Hmph... Lady Agatha, we have arrived at the altar.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0001
007	O-oh! Thank you!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
008	Kamui, now!
009	Gladly!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
010	"I beseech the supreme..."	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0004
011	"The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!"
012	"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads..."
013	"Save us, the lost souls!"	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0007
014	Ah... Aaaaaaaaahhhh!	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
015	Marie!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0027
016	Seriolde...?	VO_mary.mary_battle_0028
017	You're okay... I'm so relieved.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0018
018	Nooooo! No, no, no! The light of the curse is fading! Our...grace...!
019	It is the end of you; already forsaken of your humanity! The cradle of which you spoke is now no more than a hollow filled with your selfishness!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0010
020	If you truly wish for peace, now is your chance to quietly pass away!	VO_caesar.caesar_battle_0004
021	No... Nooooooooooooo!
