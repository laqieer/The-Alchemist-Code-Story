001	Greed Dike…!?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
034	You saw it, didn't you? The Discarnate Power multiplying… Demons cannot learn such skills by themselves.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
035	They must have joined forces with Greed Dike to gain new power. That's the most logical explanation.
036	That would coincide with what you saw.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
002	This ties it all together… It seems the roots go deeper than we thought.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
037	... It's hard to imagine, but the demons may have been connected to Greed Dike since waaaaay back.
003	...Celis may be in danger.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
004	Celis...? Why would she--	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
005	She went to Greed Dike alone while you were kidnapped.
006	Why would she go alone!?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
007	She went to investigate possible connections to the demons.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
008	…!
009	Where are you going?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
010	Where else? To find Celis!
011	…We can't allow it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0039
012	Why not!?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
013	We haven't verified Greed Dike's involvement yet... Do you really want to go stir up trouble before we know for certain?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
014	…But!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
015	All we can do now is wait… We're all as anxious as you are.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
016	…
017	…Let's have faith in Celis. That's all we can do for now.
018	…Alright.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
019	Oh, he's away? I see. My apologies for the sudden visit... Yes. Perhaps, I'll see him the next time I give my report… Thank you for your time.
020	Where could he have gone…	VO_celis.celis_sys_0031
021	…
022	…It can't be…	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
023	…
024	Fancy meeting you here...Celis.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
025	Why are you here?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
026	I'm conducting an inspection as ambassador to Wadatsumi. I thought it best to monitor the demons' movements directly.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0007
027	Haven't you been receiving my periodic reports? Were they not enough?
028	First hand knowledge is necessary from time to time… Are you suggesting anything untoward?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
029	…No, not at all.
030	I must say, I’m disappointed to see the leader of the Blade Fox Corps standing here chatting.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
031	…What do you mean?
032	…You're surrounded.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
033	…!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
