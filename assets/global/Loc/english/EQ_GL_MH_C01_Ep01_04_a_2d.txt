001	Pssst!
002	Amos, over there!
003	Thank the heavens! We have been hiding since we got ambushed by rabid wolves while breaking camp 2 days ago.
004	We need to move, are you fit to travel?
005	We patched up ourselves as best we could but there's no way we can escape those beasts on our own. There is a large wolf that seems to be leading the pack but we haven't seen it since last night.
006	Amos, we got company!
007	Grrrr.....
008	Curses! It's back!
009	I've got this!
