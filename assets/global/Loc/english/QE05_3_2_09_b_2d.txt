001	Well, well, well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
002	Someone seems to have undone my seal.
003	So you finally made it. Heh, Satna's awakening must be coming sooner than I had thought.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0009
004	Very well, Kamui. I shall let you hold that vessel for now.
005	Gabirond, what is the situation in Gluttony Foss?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
006	Sir! According to our reports, the civil war is intensifying.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0004
007	The military seems to be holding strong, but it appears they are not making an active effort to stop the rebel forces.
008	Ceclidis might be losing his touch.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
009	His physical body will soon reach its limit. The ruler of Gluttony Foss is not long for this world.
010	Shall we mobilize the Holy Guard?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
011	Why would we do that?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
012	Wratharis and Envylia have fallen, and now Lustburg is losing strength.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0004
013	If Gluttony Foss falls now, the alliance of the five nations will crumble.
014	This continent will lose all sense of balance and order.
015	That is not at all cause for concern.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
016	What?
017	I have orders for you to relay to those Corpse we have stationed in the desert. The time of release is nigh.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_1016
018	What is that supposed to mean?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0027
019	There is no need for you to know.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
020	What could he be planning?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
021	Weren't we... Was Corpse not a necessary evil for the sake of maintaining balance and order upon this continent?
