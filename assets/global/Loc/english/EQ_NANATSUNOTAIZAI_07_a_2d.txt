001	Why won't you help us?!
002	I'm sorry, Hawk.
003	Hey, aren't you one of Elizabeth's friends? Don't you want to get back to your own world?
004	Not all darkness desires the light. But on this... The darkness within me is silent.
005	There are times it doesn't have something to say?
006	I apologize, but everyone has their own part to play.
007	Merlin...
008	All right. I understand. We'll do what we can.
009	Escanor!
010	Merlin isn't someone who'd say something like this without a good reason. I'm sure she has something planned.
011	I trust Merlin.
012	Thank you, Escanor.
013	That sound!
014	Zeldris!
015	I sensed immense power, but...I see Meliodas isn't here.
016	Still, I can see it would be wise to kill you off now.
017	Hahahah... This is such bad timing...
018	Consider it bad luck.
019	Well, it would be wrong of me to make it easy for you.
020	What do you think you can do as you are right now?
021	Don't forget that we're all here too!
022	Stay out of the way. I'll let you live if you don't interfere.
023	As if that's going to happen!
024	This does not concern you. I'll say it again. Stay out of the way.
025	We're part of this whether you like it or not! It's our world that you're trampling over! That alone is reason enough for us to fight!
026	You denounce the concept of trust. That is blasphemy in this world. So whispers the darkness within me.
027	That darkness of yours speaks trifling drivel.
028	Trust is not trifling.
029	Then prove it to me. If you can defeat me, that is. Prepare yourself.
030	...!
