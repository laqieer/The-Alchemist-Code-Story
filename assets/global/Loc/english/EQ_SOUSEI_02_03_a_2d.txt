001	Space-Time Manipulation, activate! For I am the balancer of scales!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0032
002	Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0019
003	(She managed to wound the Cursed Beast! How can this be?!)
004	Tsk. Looks like it wasn't enough.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
005	Well, live and learn. Come now, children, it's time to get out of here!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
006	What? How do you expect to get out of here?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
007	Like this!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
008	Are my eyes playing tricks on me? The Cursed Beast is⁠—?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
009	Groooogghhhh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0001
010	Asmodeus is flinching away from the heat? Or, no...is it the opposite?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
011	Hah! It's been in hibernation for quite some time. I would say it's more likely that it's gone a little cuckoo.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
012	Its perception is no good. It's mistaking the fire for the warmth of people.
013	Cuckoo? Warmth? What—?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
014	Pull yourselves together, fools! Barely smart enough to run away with your tails between your legs... The Cursed Beast covets the heat of the ship! If we leave this place, it will not follow!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
015	Ah!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
016	Nimul, perhaps we should heed this woman's words and follow her.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
017	I... Yes. I agree. Waginau, can you run?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
018	Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
019	One, two, three, and this witch makes four. It appears we all made it out unscathed.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
020	The wind of the snow plains has eased as well. So, that insane weather was because of the Cursed Beast after all.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
021	Oh, you realized that, did you? So that head of yours isn't entirely for show.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
022	Perhaps it is time for some introductions.
023	It's only polite that you introduce yourselves first, don't you think? I did just save your lives.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
024	I apologize. I was brought here from the Gula Belt Region of Gluttony, and I am called Nimul.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
025	This is Waginau, also from Gluttony, and—
026	I'm Yna Ku.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
027	I see. Gluttony... People of the forest, then.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
028	Ah! Adaleigh and the others have arrived.
029	You know who we are?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
030	I suppose it must be your magil. Your people often end up in other Belt Regions, you know.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
031	So I do know who you are. Well, I know of you, at least.
032	Thank you for sharing your names with me. Allow me to introduce myself in return.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
033	I am a witch. The name I once had has already been lost to time. I go by a new name now.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_chara_1001
034	I am the Ambrosia, the Abstinent Witch.
