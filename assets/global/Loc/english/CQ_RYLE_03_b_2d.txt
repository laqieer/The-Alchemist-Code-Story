001	Ryle, can I entrust this to you once more? Here is the list.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
002	Why are you relying on me?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
003	Because you are worth paying the price for. In other words, I have acknowledged your abilities. Rejoice.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
004	And what if I turned you down?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0044
005	I will do whatever I must to obtain these items. Money is not the only bargaining chip.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
006	Well, in your case, I guess I'll accept your request.	VO_ryle.ryle_event_1009
007	That is much appreciated. It appears you've finally acknowledged my greatness.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
008	I've never met an idiot like you before.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
009	Who are you calling an idiot?! I'm your customer!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0012
010	I meant that as a compliment. I no longer see you as just another rich fellow. Besides...our goals are aligned.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
011	A wise decision. As long as you are working on my behalf, I plan to ensure that nothing ill befalls you.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0045
012	After all, I will spare no effort in paying a price worthy of my desires!
013	Why do you go to such lengths?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
014	By making an effort now, I can ensure future pleasures! By completing my art collection, it will bring satisfaction to me! That satisfaction will continue on into the future!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
015	In fact, I can introduce you to all of my personal contacts if you'd like! I'm sure it'll help in bolstering up the Guild!
016	... ...
017	What's the matter? I'm telling you that I'll honor you with my friendship. Rejoice!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0005
018	You really are an idiot, aren't you?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
019	Wh-what did you say?! Silence that tongue of yours! I...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
020	You are the Successor of the Sun, right? What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm actually sort of fond of idiots like you.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
021	Well, of course! I'm still not sure how I feel about you calling me an idiot, but I can appreciate the compliment!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
022	I never said that I was complimenting you.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
023	Fuahahahah! Come now, no need to blush!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
024	Ryle, I look forward to having you continue working with me!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
025	Well, I guess I'll put in some effort. Just enough so that I don't lose to you.	VO_ryle.ryle_event_1009
026	Right! I'll be relying on you, Ryle!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
027	Well then, time for my nap. We'll talk about the details another day.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0045
028	Huh?! You just said you were gonna put some effort into your work?! There's still a bunch of jobs I want you to take care of!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
029	I've got my own pace of handling things. Well then, go on home now. That's it for today.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
030	Hey! Ryle! Ack! I'll be back again soon!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0014
031	(If I can rise in rank and earn more money, I'll be able to live an even easier life.)	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
032	(Now that I've encountered this odd fellow...well, I guess I'll put a little effort into my work. Still, I'm gonna be handling things at my own pace.)
