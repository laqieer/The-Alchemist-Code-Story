001	Chief! Our archers cannot hold them back. The enemy is pushing their way forward!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
002	The armor of the soldiers of Gluttony cannot be penetrated by arrows! Everyone, fall back!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0031
003	Surely not the Ouija...?! But your body...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
004	Don't worry! Hurry!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0039
005	U-understood! Fall back! Retreat!!!
006	All we need is a little time. Please, hold for a bit longer.	VO_adne.adne_sys_0018
007	I am one who honors the unwritten laws of nature.
008	My fight is not with those who uphold peace. I ask for strength in the face of evil which threatens to bring about chaos...	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0004
009	Give me an ounce of courage...place a morsel in my fragile hands!	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0004_01
010	Ah! The chief's Ouija is still alive and well! It's taking the enemy down one after the other...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0009
011	...Agh...!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0020
012	Ch-chief...are you all right?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
013	The Ouija is a power that unleashes both the energy of nature and of one's own life force...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
014	It will inevitably have a negative effect on the shaman who wields it!
015	Suppress it, Adone! If you allow yourself to be corrupted by this pestilence, your body will not be able to take it!
016	It doesn't matter! Th-the second wave of soldiers are coming...everyone, stand back!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0039
017	Ye-yes, Chief! Fall back! Retreat!!!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0042
018	Adone...!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
019	My goal is simply to make them temporarily retreat! Do-don't worry...this won't be enough to kill me!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0007
020	Huh...? Chi-chief! Please, wait! They seem to be up to something...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
021	...What...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
022	Father!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
023	Tina!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0024
024	Chief, there are soldiers hidden amongst the bushes!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
025	What...?!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
026	Argh! Attack!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
027	Ack?! No!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0020
028	I won't let you! Hwwaaaahhh!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
029	Aghh...!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0022
030	...! That technique...	VO_adne.adne_sys_0027
031	I'm sorry I'm late! Please lead everyone downstream!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0036
032	What...?	VO_adne.adne_sys_0025
033	The wind is blowing from downstream up the valley towards us. It should protect us and lend us its power!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
034	I'll go around the valley with Kiki!
035	Wait, Tina!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0001
036	Seriously. Children...they grow so fast when their parents aren't looking.	VO_adne.adne_favorite_0005
037	Lead everyone downstream! Hurry!!!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0030
038	You're not getting away with this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
039	Now! Attack!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0004
040	?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
041	There's still some time until their next attack! Don't miss this opportunity!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0015
042	Is it a trap?! Wha...whahhhh!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
043	Wh-what the...?! Where did she appear from?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
044	So this is my new power... I've got to thank that girl. Away with you, vile people!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
