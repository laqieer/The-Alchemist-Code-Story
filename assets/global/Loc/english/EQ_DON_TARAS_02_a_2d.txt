001	I won't marry anyone, let alone a robot!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0039
002	Guess I got no choice then.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
003	This is all beyond extreme!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
004	Tango.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
005	Yes, Don. I told the family to go out and spread the news. Subtly, of course.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
006	You got some kinda problem, Ronnie?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
007	Nope, not at all.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_1015
008	The city is in chaos!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0012
009	"The AJ7000 Prototype has been let loose upon the city. No one knows when and where it will strike."	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0031
010	"If you want to be protected by the Don Family, all you need to do is pay our monthly protection fee." Now, doesn't that sound like a perfectly respectable business transaction?
011	Yeah, we're just trying to do our part to maintain public order.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0044
012	A protection fee? The citizens are in no position to be paying any kind of fees right now!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0013
013	They're even saying that those who don't pay will be punished, and that the payment schedule will be strictly enforced.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0017
014	Nothing about this is respectable! What do you intend to accomplish with this proclamation? Retract it at once!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0017
015	If you're thinking that the boss came here to do some negotiating after he saved you, you've got another thing coming, Mayor.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
016	It is my responsibility to stop this!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
017	This is just the Don showing his loving concern for the people of this city.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
018	No, this is a front to turn the citizens into slaves!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0015
019	Hey.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
020	Yes?	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
021	Right now, the only ones who can protect this city are my family.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
022	We're not running some kind of charity here, you know?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0030
023	Once the fighting starts, we've got ammunition and personnel fees to consider... Plus, we'll need a little on the side for our entertainment, of course! Not to mention booze.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
024	But...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
025	If you're not happy about our solution, I'm sure we could work something else out.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
026	For example, you could marry the bot.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0007
027	Why that, of all things?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
028	Proposed, didn't it?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0010
029	Th-that's an unreasonable thing to say! For...ahem...a few different reasons.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0012
030	Don saved you. Do you really think you have the right to complain?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0044
031	......
032	Come on. Just tie the knot.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0004
033	Absolutely not.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
034	You're the one he wants, you know? It'd be in everyone's best interests if you just gave him what he's after.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0001
035	What would become of this city if something were to happen to our Mayor?	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0022
036	Nothing to worry about, there. Don would take over.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
037	Anyway, you gotta make a sacrifice. That scrapheap could start firing on the city willy-nilly at any time, you know?
038	If you really cared for the people of this city, you'd stop fighting it and marry the darn thing.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0002
039	......
040	This is just a ploy to get the Mayor out of the city so that you can do as you please!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0017
041	You got me.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
042	That's so...dirty.	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0012
043	Not many clean spots in Real Heaven to begin with.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
044	Fine...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
045	M-Mistress?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
046	I'll do it.
047	I knew you'd come through, Miss Elester!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0023
048	In return, I would like you to stay away from the people of this city.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0005
049	No.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0014
050	Mr. Taras!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
051	You're so naive.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0040
052	It's pretty cocky of you to think you can save everyone all by your lonesome.
053	Especially when there's not a single thing you can do to save anyone in your current predicament.
054	......
055	What do you intend by all this, Mr. Taras?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
056	Didn't I answer that already? If you weren't around, then this city would be all ours.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
057	Which means, if you don't do somethin' now, it's ours anyway.
058	You wanna stop me?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
059	Try and stop me.
060	I...!	VO_fiona.fiona_battle_0019
