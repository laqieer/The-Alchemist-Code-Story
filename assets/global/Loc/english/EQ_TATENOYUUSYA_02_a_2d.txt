001	Zweite Aqua Shot!	VO_melty.melty_battle_0004
002	Urgh... There's too many of them! I can't take care of this alone...	VO_melty.melty_battle_0022
003	Chomp, chomp, chomp...	VO_balloon.balloon_battle_0001
004	...!
005	Haaahh!	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0005
006	Are you all right?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
007	I've never seen such monsters before. Are they also here due to the disasters of the other world?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
008	We'll have time to think about that later. We need to get rid of them first.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
009	You've got a point. Ugh. Why can't life just be easy?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
010	W-wow... They took down all of those Balloons in an instant...
011	Th-thank you so much for your help! My name is Melty Melromarc. May I ask who you all are?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0033
012	I'm Anastasia. We received an order to eradicate the monsters that suddenly appeared here from another world.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_2001
013	I'm Ryle.
014	My name's Lamia. What strange creatures they were... They kept trying to bite us.	VO_lamia.lamia_chara_1001
015	Strange creatures? Do you mean the Balloons?
016	They're pretty common here in Melromarc...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
017	Where's this Melromarc you speak of? We're in Wratharis.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0025
018	Huh?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
019	Continent of Babel... Does this mean that I'm in another world?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
020	I suppose so.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
021	I never thought that I'd end up being the one summoned to another world...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0021
022	D-do you happen to know if anyone else has been sent here besides me?
023	There have been others who called themselves Those Bonded With the Waves, but I don't have much information besides that...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
024	But you wouldn't have been called to this world if you weren't needed for something.
025	Needed...?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
026	Our turn for questions. What is all this about Waves? I know it's about an otherworldly calamity or something, but...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
027	Waves are terrifying calamities that occur when powerful monsters slip out of dimensional rifts.	VO_melty.melty_sys_0004
028	Once a Wave occurs, the monsters will spill endlessly out of the rift until the wave is suppressed.
029	"Endlessly"? I don't like the sound of that...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
030	Yes. We must defeat the monsters' boss with the help of the heroes who wield the Four Holy Weapons: the Sword Hero, Spear Hero, Bow Hero, and Shield Hero.
031	That's all I know about Waves. I'm not sure if they're different here...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
032	Sword, spear, bow... It sounds like the gear types that we use. We don't have a shield, though...	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
033	You're right... You're using the same types of weapons as the four heroes!
034	I wouldn't call us "heroes", though. We're nothing but boring old Phantom Soldiers.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
035	Phantom Soldiers?
036	Phantom Soldiers are those from other eras who are summoned by alchemists.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
037	Does that mean you're all...?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
038	The less you know, the better...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
039	O-okay...
040	(I guess I shouldn't have pressed them on that... I have no clue what's going on.)	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
041	Ah! Watch out, everyone!
042	Th-there's more, already?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0026
043	My goodness... Where'd these guys pop out from?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
044	Gahgahgah!	VO_balloon.balloon_battle_0003
