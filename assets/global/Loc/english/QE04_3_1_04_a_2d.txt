001	What's the matter? Is that all you've got?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
002	Ack! There's no end to his strength!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
003	Hyahahahah! It is my responsibility to trump all! That is my belief...and the purpose of my existence!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0011
004	What is your goal?! What are you thinking... invading on your own?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
005	What I desire is proof of my own strength!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
006	Are you saying that your objective differs from that of the Gluttony army?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
007	Not entirely. Invading is a means to prove one's strength.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
008	Is that your reason for invading Saga?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
009	Of course, there is Gluttony's side as well.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
010	Beelzebub originally belonged to Gluttony Foss. Thus, of course, they would attempt to take it back.
011	If denied their right, they have no choice but to take it back by force. Isn't that a legitimate reason?
012	For starters, the people of Saga have nothing to do with this dispute. What need is there to involve them?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
013	South of Gluttony Foss, the desert is continuing to spread. Along with this, both food and water are beginning to run out.
014	If a country cannot support itself, then it must take from another. That is the way history has constantly repeated itself.
015	That in no way justifies this invasion! Gluttony has a trade agreement with Tehre.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0013
016	Shouldn't that provide enough food and water?! There shouldn't be any need to invade!
017	...Hyahahahah! Tehre approved our invasion!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0008
018	?!
019	Tehre approved it...?! Why?! What is he thinking?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0021
020	Heh. Knowing the reasoning behind his decision won't allow you to prevent it. Let's just say that Tehre holds the same beliefs that we do.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
021	As a result, this invasion has been set into motion. That being said, I have other intentions.
022	Then what exactly are you after?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
023	Isn't it a given that people must forge their lives with their own hands?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
024	I'm well aware of that! I don't need you to tell me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0017
025	No. You are aware of nothing. You burden nature in order to sustain your existence. You've abandoned your responsibility!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
026	...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
