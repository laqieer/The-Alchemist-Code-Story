001	Did you get to eat your fill?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
002	Yes, th-thank you so much.	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0034
003	Oh no, thank you for being alive.
004	Well, if it wasn't for Amane here, I may not have been.
005	No, but if I hadn't met you, Azami, I wouldn't even be here.	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0037
006	We wouldn't have been able to do it alone, but—	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0018
007	We weren't alone.	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0005
008	I see.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0021
009	I thought I lost everything. Duty, Mother and Father...but I was wrong.
010	I had Amane still.
011	Azami...
012	Your duty? Are you perhaps one of the Kagomurasaki?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
013	I am. Everyone else was...	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0004
014	I understand.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0021
015	Thank you for saving me! And Amane!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0034
016	Wait, where are you going?	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0025
017	I'm going to hunt demons.
018	I will avenge my parents and my clan. That's my responsibility as the sole survivor.	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0029
019	Azami...
020	Do you have a minute? Here, let me hold you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
021	Wha—?! What are you doing?!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0025
022	I'm proud of you.
023	?!
024	You've done so well, but for this one moment, just a little while, you don't have to do anything.
025	I-I...!
026	It's okay. You can cry if you want to. It's the human thing to do.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
027	But...	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0029
028	Cry, cry, then cry some more. It's not too late to hold your head up high after exhausting your tears. You don't have to worry about a thing.
029	But I—
030	Where are you planning on going without me?	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0001
031	Huh?
032	You said we'd be sisters, at least until we die.	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0037
033	Neither of us are dead yet, Azami.
034	Waaah! Waaaaaaaaahhh!!!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0018
035	That's right, Azami. You can let it out. You're not alone anymore.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
036	Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! Waaaaaahh! Aaaaaahh!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0019
037	...
038	Are you not coming with us?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
039	I have no reason to. I mean, I want to, but—	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0031
040	You're going through a hard time. Isn't that good enough of a reason to stick together?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
041	But...	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0025
042	You're her little sister, aren't you?
043	You're not planning on making me feel lonely again, are you?	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0001
044	I...
045	Come here.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
046	?!
047	I know I'm not your mother, but I can still embrace you. See?
048	I-I...!
049	You're freezing. You did so well to endure.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
050	...Uggh...	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0018
051	This calls for some hot soup! Let's go get ourselves warmed up.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
052	Mm... Uuuhhhghhh...!
053	Hey, don't start crying now. I just stopped and you're gonna get me to...to...	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0018
054	Uwaaaaahhh!
055	Meal's ready! Now, put your hands together and say: thank you for the meal!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
056	Thank you for the meal!
057	It's so good! I love your cooking, Celis!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0023
058	That makes me happy to hear. Amane, don't rush or you'll end up choking.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0008
059	I'll be fine! I wanna get big and strong as soon as possible!	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0007
060	Oh? Why is that?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
061	I wanna get big and vanquish demons! So I gotta eat a lot!	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0004
062	Eating too much isn't gonna help, especially if you swallow your food whole. Can't you eat properly?	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0012
063	It won't be long before you can't boss me around anymore! I'm gonna eat a lot, get big and strong, and surpass you in every way!	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0010
064	I'd like to see you try!	VO_azami-b.azami-b_sys_0007
065	Oh, just you wait! Celis! I want seconds!	VO_amane-b.amane-b_sys_0017
066	Hehe.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
067	What?
068	I'm sorry. It's just that you two seem to be doing so much better now.
069	Neither of you are the same kids I met on that rainy day back then.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
070	It's all thanks to you, Celis!
071	Hehe, I'm glad you think so. I just wish days like these could last forever.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
072	Oh, how I wish...
073	Haven't thought of that day in a while.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
074	And that selfish little request still holds.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
075	Well, we are alive. But...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
076	But?
077	Well, there's something I've been wondering about since that day.
078	What is it?
079	Am I not more of a big sister than you, Azami?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
080	You can't be serious!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
081	I'm just saying, the way I was that day was a bit more big-sister-ish!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
082	I'm clearly older than you, which makes me the older sister!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
083	I'm not talking about age here!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
084	I'm stronger than you, and besides—
085	H-hey! What are you staring at me like that for?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
086	You haven't grown an inch! I told you eating too much wouldn't help.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0007
087	Hey, my body is not the only measure of my development! I'll soon be—
088	Well, as of now, I'm more mature than you are.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
089	Why, you—
090	What, do you wanna—
091	Pffft!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0007
092	Nckk!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
093	Ahahahahahahahahaha!!!
094	Wow, I can't believe how long it's been. Long enough for us to gain a new every day for ourselves, at least.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
095	And now it's finally time for us to make good on the oath we made back then. We will eradicate the demons.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
096	I will fight to avenge my clan.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0005
097	What about you, Amane?
098	I...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
099	"Demons must be eradicated."
100	I will take out demons as I see fit. That's it.
101	That's a very ambiguous response. You know, I've been wondering... How was it that you were able to stand against the Discarnate Power that day?	VO_azami.azami_sys_0030
102	?!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
103	What's the matter, Azami?
104	Somebody's watching us.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
105	What?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
106	Who's there?! Show yourself!
107	Uh oh, you found me out. I thought I was being sneaky enough.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0011
108	Celis!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
109	I didn't see Azami at the banquet, so I figured she'd be here.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
110	Isn't this the sweetest display of sisterly love! You're gonna make me cry!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
111	Wh-whatever! I'm going.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
112	Oh, don't be like that. It's been a while since we three got together.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
113	The banquet's over, so we should get back to thinking about the mission!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
114	I'm not made of free time, you know!
115	Aww, are you feeling sensitive? Is it hard being a baby?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
116	Celis! Please!
117	The look in her eyes just never changes... But there are other things that have.
118	Like what?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
119	The eyes house your soul, and your soul resides in the humdrum of the everyday.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
120	Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life. Still, if the surrounding environment were to change...
121	Your soul and daily life would change along with it.
122	What do you mean?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
123	Now that all three of us are members of the Blade Fox, we can't expect things to be exactly like before.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
124	I understand that, but...I still want to spend my every day with you two, no matter what it looks like.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
125	It is for that reason I wield a blade. I want peace for Wadatsumi. I want people to be able to live happily and...
126	I want them to feel safe, to be able to surround a table for dinner with their whole family. Though I'm not exactly sure how I can accomplish this...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
127	I want the same thing as you do, Amane. I hope we can find the means to accomplish them.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
128	Yeah...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
129	All right then, guess I should focus on the mission like Azami said.
130	What?
131	Tanosuke will give you the details.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
132	Yo, how's it going? Try to listen to what I have to say this time, okay?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
133	This is going to be your first mission as a member of the Blade Fox, after all.
134	A mission... My first mission!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0011
135	Hey, hey... You trembling already?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
136	It's just adrenaline, that's all!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
137	You're not going to be alone on this mission, so you can loosen up a bit. Hm?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
138	I didn't expect to see demons here. I've got a bad feeling about this.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
139	Anyway, let's take care of them first. Now, stay calm and collected when dealing with them.
140	Leave them to me!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
