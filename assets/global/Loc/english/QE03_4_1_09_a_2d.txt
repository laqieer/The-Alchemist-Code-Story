001	Hahah! You can't kill them, can you? You're a naive little brat!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0008
002	Ohh...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
003	That's the weakness of Alchemy.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
004	You can use those that are dead as Phantom Soldiers, but witches can control the living.
005	A battle is established when one's life is on the line. One who uses the dead to fight does not know what true risk is!
006	You failed as a witch. You lack experience as you cling to your Alchemy. You are nothing more than a pestilence that threatens to harm our country!
007	If a witch is someone who manipulates others who don't want to fight...then I will gladly not be counted amongst you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1001
008	What?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
009	Originally, I was always a failure. I don't know the traditions of being a witch.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0010
010	I am not tied down to such things, nor will I let the country be bound to them!
011	Enough with your talk...! I'll make you never able to speak again!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
012	Wh...what?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
013	Salomo!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
014	Stop messing about! Take me out...while you have the chance, Lisbeth!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
015	Do-don't be stupid! I couldn't...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
016	You're the one that's stupid! We Bugmails...have dedicated our lives to changing this country! Countless of us have died...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0032
017	You once said to me yourself...that you couldn't let your friends die in vain! Don't let me...Lisbeth!
018	...!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
019	Agh! Le-let me go!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
020	Lisbeth...you said to me before that, like me, you had experienced defeat after defeat. You know what it feels like to be wounded!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
021	I have dragged these wounded men this far.
022	At the very least, I've shouldered the resolve of those who've served under me. Now...it's your turn to shoulder this burden!
023	Salomo...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
024	As someone who has lost over and over again, you understand, right? You don't want to see the person who defeated you easily defeated.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0003
025	You're not so weak that you would lose here and in such a cowardly way!
026	You can do it! You can kill me...Lisbeth! Go beyond! Carry us with you to this world's future!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0041
027	Uya...hyaaaaahhhhhh!!!
