001	Nngh... Th-the town...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
002	U-urgh... K-Kagura... Kagura!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
003	I see. You unleashed your phoenix to envelope and suppress the blast to minimize the damage. Clever trick, redhead.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
004	Gnngh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
005	Hey... You okay?
006	Haaa... I don't need your little comments. There's no way you can be allowed to do as you please!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
007	Oh, really? What a bold proclamation. Who is going to stop me? You?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
008	Nngh... Don't underestimate us. This fight...has only just begun!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
009	Urk... We will stop you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
010	I won't allow your attacks to destroy our determination to bring you down!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
011	Same here!
012	Huzzzaahhh!!!
013	Dear me. I certainly hadn't intended to offend. You understand me, don't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
014	Of course.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
015	Tsk. You're always stealing my thunder. That was my line!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
016	Wh-what?! Grk!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
017	Gah!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
018	T-Templars?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
019	Unfortunately for you, I will never let you lay a single finger on Sol.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
020	Seriously, I got here first! How dare you try to hog the spotlight! They're my prey!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
021	Well, well, well. It looks like you'll be busy without me. Such a shame.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
022	Y-you... Don't get cocky just because a couple of your friends showed up!
023	The flames of our justice will not be dampened by such an obstacle!
024	Really? It seems your comrades feel differently.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
025	Huh?
026	Sol a-and those two...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
027	Tch!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
028	No... Wh-what should we do?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
029	H-hey! Don't let me down like this now!
030	They, unlike you, understand how outmatched you all are. You cannot win.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
031	Hey! Hey!!! This is no time to panic! There're only two more people to defeat than before!
032	Shut up for a second, would you?! Kanon...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
033	Yes, I know. We can't defeat them in a straight fight. If they all come at us at once...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
034	That's quite the idea.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
035	Oh no!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
036	Neun, Acht, don't we owe them a farewell gift? I think fulfilling this last..."request" of theirs would fit the bill perfectly.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
037	Understood.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
038	Oh no! Get ready, everyone!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
039	Pitiful creatures, it's too late! The outcome of this battle was determined the moment we stepped foot on—!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
040	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
041	What the—?!
042	Grrr... You...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
043	Ha! I'm not going to let you get away! Let's fight! Yeah!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
044	Victor! I told you not to get ahead of yourself and run off like that! Why don't you ever listen?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
045	Chloe?! How...? Why...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
046	We rushed over here as soon as we subdued the Greed Dike soldiers in Envylia.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
047	Basheeny!
048	Knights from Lustburg and Gluttony Foss should be on their way here as well.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
049	If we can hold out until they arrive, we should have a chance to pull through to victory.
050	Lord Commander! I apologize for the breach in protocol.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
051	Allow me to formerly request permission for the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia to join this battle at your side.
052	Captain Vettel! We would be honored to have you and your knights aid us in battle!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
053	Victor, I hope you have learned from this. We are a knight order that has come to represent our country.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
054	There are certain formalities that must be observed before we just charge in with our swords swinging.
055	Yes, Captain Vettel...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0035
056	This is our chance to get revenge for Captain Monzein! Let's show him what we can do!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_1030
057	Acht?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
058	Understood.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
059	We won't let you take a single step toward any of them!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0004
060	What—?!
061	Nnrk!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
062	You thought you could just forget about us, did you? We already warned you! If you want to get at them, you'll have to get past us!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
063	Miuna!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
064	Sorry about that, Kanon. I didn't mean to let her get away. I'll take her down here instead!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0036
065	Thank you, Spica! You must have had a hard time holding her back!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0033
066	Chloe...	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
067	Lord Commander Kanon, reinforcements are coming from the other countries.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0007
068	Yes, I heard that from Basheeny. Thank you, Kazahaya.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
069	Hey. You heard that, right? Once all of our forces have combined, you won't have any chance of winning!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
070	You should give up now, while you still can!
071	Yeah! We've got all these amazing, famous fighters here! You're going down!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
072	How wonderful. I didn't realize that such illustrious heroes had come to participate in our little tete-a-tete.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
073	What the heck, man? You've been fighting them without even realizing how awesome they are? I can give you a quick summary of everyone if you like—	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
074	Victor.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
075	Sol...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0044
076	Yes, Acht. You're right.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
077	They're all here...which means that if we kill everyone here, this country will crumble in their wake.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
078	Wh-what?!
079	Lord Commander Kanon, please be careful! That man...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
080	I know. Don't worry, Basheeny. I have a plan. I will stop him.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
081	Acht. Neun.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
082	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
083	What's up?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
084	Let's show these interlopers that they are outclassed, no matter how many people they try to throw at us!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
085	Understood.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0038
086	Heheh... This is going to be fun!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
087	This battle will be the anchor for the future we have been striving for!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0023
088	We shall wage our own holy war against the skies that have weighed so heavily upon us and crush the world that has tried to grind us into the ground!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0009
089	They've started their charge!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
090	We will stop you! Come on, Spica!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0032
091	Got it!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
092	Fools...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
093	Shouldn't you have figured it out already? This type of fighting is my specialty. Crumbling Armor Hand!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0004
094	Spica, watch out!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0019
095	Nice try.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0005
096	What—?!
097	Nghh...!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
098	I don't wish to interfere, but this is a dangerous enemy. I believe that we would all be better off working together.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
099	Hmph. I have no objection to that.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
100	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
101	Solid Destruction Axe!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
102	Urgh...!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0026
103	Nngh...!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0024
104	Agh...!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0019
105	One, two, or three... No matter how many of you there are, you will never defeat me.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
106	Nngh... Even three of us is not enough?! It can't be!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
107	Urgh!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
108	Oh man, oh man... This guy's strength is unbelievable!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
109	All of us combined still can't stop him?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
110	Get out of my way, worthless grunts! No one less than a Captain can even hope to stand against me!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
111	Then, why don't you try your hand against me?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
112	Huh? Who're you?
113	If three challengers are not enough, perhaps four will suit you better. If you don't mind, of course.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0032
114	Wha—?!
115	I probably should have been a little more exact with my words.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
116	Urgh...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
117	Hrgh...	VO_victor.victor_battle_0022
118	Agh!
119	Nngh.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
120	I meant that anyone less than a Captain of the Holy Guard cannot hope to stand against me!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
121	Is there no limit to his power?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
122	Nngh... Y-you... Don't you underestimate the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
123	Urk!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
124	Well, well. What happened to your absolute justice? I seem to recall you saying something about stopping me...or have you given up already?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
125	Agh...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
126	Bring as many people as you want. I will show all of them that fate itself has chosen me to lead the way into the future!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
127	You and your little armies are nothing more than specks among the dust of history.
128	You are all just remnants of an obsolete world!
129	I will destroy you here and the whole world will recognize its rightful leader!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
130	I may not know much, but I know that whoever that may be...isn't you.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
131	After all, were you not saying that you will send us all into the next world within three minutes?
132	People are not fools enough to believe in someone who is all talk!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
133	Wha—?!
134	Please. Did you think I wouldn't notice you gearing up to try to take me down? You too, redhead.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
135	Wh-what?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
136	Plasma Burst!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
137	Urk...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
138	Nngh...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
139	Hrgh...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
140	Sorry if I led you to think I'm all talk. Let me follow through with my promise to you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
141	A-Argh! Y-you... Even my powers of darkness cannot damage him?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
142	Th-that's ridiculous... How can he be so untouchable?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
143	This is the end for you. Neun, Acht... The time is upon us. Wipe them all from this earth!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
144	What? Wait, but I haven't had my fun yet! There's just nothing like the satisfaction of crushing my opponent with my own hands.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
145	Is it not enough for you that I recognize you as the strongest of them all?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
146	If you dally around here, you might miss the moment that the legendary power returns to this world.
147	Tch. Well, I guess there's nothing for it.	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
148	However, would it not be wise to conserve our strength here?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
149	It's fine. Orion is only one man. Rather than strength, it is time that is of the essence.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
150	I see.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0038
151	Wh-what is that black light?
152	It's him... Above his head, a ball of black light is...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
153	He's amassing some kind of energy. What an ominous light!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
154	Just looking at it sends shivers down my spine. What would it do if it actually touched the ground?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0023
155	Kazahaya! We must tell everyone in Northern Pride to evacuate immediately!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
156	That would be a pointless endeavor. The shockwaves of my Cursed Sun will reach all who reside in this country.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
157	In a few moments, this country will be wiped from the face of the planet.
158	No!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
159	Don't worry. Death will come gently. Everyone will have time to reflect thoroughly on their lives until this point.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
160	W-wait!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
161	Transform into scorched earth, Northern Pride!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
162	H-he unleashed it?! Is this the end?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
163	Urk! Huzzahhhhhhhhhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
164	Huzzahhhhhhhhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
165	Kanon! Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
166	Now, where do you think you're going?	VO_neun.neun_battle_0001
167	Grk... Get out of my way!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
168	I will not allow you to interfere.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0014
169	Let go of me! Let go! No!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
170	Finally... Finally, this limitless blue sky is ours for the taking! A new age is upon us!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
171	No! Have we truly run out of options to stop this?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
172	N-no... Is this really how it must end?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0043
173	It can't be... We have lost and learned so much... Struggled until we had the strength to face our enemy... Could it all have been for naught?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0043
174	Is this really to end with our inability to fulfill the hopes and dreams of all of those who came together to save Babel?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
175	Nothing has changed! Nothing has been resolved! This can't be the end for us!
176	Please, Excalibur!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
177	Whoa! What's that light?! Is that...the light at the end of the tunnel? Am I dead?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
178	No, that light... It's Kanon.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
179	That sword! It's...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
180	Excalibur is...glowing?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
181	How unlike you, Kanon. You were really never the type to pray for your life.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
182	Huh?
183	Twin Fang God Wolf!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
184	That's—?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
185	What...? Tch!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
186	Wow. Rude. I went through all the trouble of getting myself here, just so I could have the last laugh. Don't ruin this for me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
187	Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
188	Nngh?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
189	Hey, Kanon! You look well. Healthy. How's the battle going? I didn't mean to just drop in like this, but I kinda have to return the favor to this guy here.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
190	Even in my eternal rest, I couldn't rest in peace. Literally.
191	C-Captain Othima?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
192	Captain Othima, I must apologize. You have given me an opening which I shall now take advantage of.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
193	You...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
194	Agh!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
195	I promise you, this is just the beginning. We still have quite a lot to repay you for.	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
196	Seida?!
197	Urk?! Grr...	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
198	Wh-what is this? Restless spirits come to settle their regrets?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
199	Ha... Don't make me laugh. You can rise from the dead as many times as you want to fight me. The outcome will always be the same!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
200	Hey, now. I dunno if you really want to waste your time yelling at us.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
201	You dare—?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
202	Dare what? I'm just saying, we're not the ones who are most upset about this whole thing.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
203	Hey... I don't know if I appreciate the way you have phrased that. I am no sore loser.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
204	I personally feel that such pettiness is beneath me.
205	Y-you?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
206	Captain Yauras?!
207	In fact, I would like to clarify that my good manners simply will not let me disappear without making sure I make myself clear.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
208	To that end... I swear to you that I will make you pay a thousand times over! Eternal Rose!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0032
209	Aghh...!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
