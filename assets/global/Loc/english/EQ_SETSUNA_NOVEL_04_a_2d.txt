001	Odd... It seems like the monsters didn't live here, but were just chasing something.
002	Setsuna, look! There's a light over there!
003	That's...Macherie!
004	That voice! Is that...?
005	Sis! We found you!
006	Jayme?!
007	Macherie, I'm so relieved you're safe.
008	Setsuna... What are you two doing here?
009	We were worried about you, Sis!
010	We were concerned about how you've been lately, so we went to the shrine and were told you were here.
011	You came all this way just for that?!
012	What do you mean, just for that?!
013	It was a big enough deal that Jayme decided he had to come find you.
014	Jayme... I see. Thank you, and I am sorry for making you worry.
015	It's all right. I'm just glad to see you're okay.
016	I feel terrible. I made you two worry because I still have so much left to learn...
017	You don't have to worry about that. Don't be so hard on yourself, because—
018	What?
019	Nothing. Never mind. I'm just glad no one got hurt.
020	(I guess it is pretty hypocritical of me to tell her not to be so hard on herself.)
021	Setsuna...
022	Anyway, it's your turn to explain. What are you doing here alone?
023	Well, the Shrine Monarch had a vision. She said there's something here that I need to retrieve for the ritual.
024	We know that much, but why did it have to be you?
025	She said that I'm...special.
026	Is it something to do with your eyes? Or the fact that you can read the wind?
027	I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with the fact that I'm still an apprentice.
028	I need more training like this.
029	What is this training supposed to accomplish, anyway?
030	Well...
031	Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to sound like I was judging you.
032	(I'm sure it's for Jayme's sake.)
033	So, what is it that you need to retrieve?
034	Let's get it and go home!
035	What? Oh, no, I can't trouble you two any further!
036	It's no trouble at all.
037	I want to help!
038	But... Well, I suppose you're right. I really appreciate it, you two.
039	So we need to get the jewel that's enshrined in this ruin?
040	Yes. Then I need to bring the jewel to the shrine so that they can place it on the staff used in the ritual.
041	But why is such an important item of the village hidden in a ruin so far away?
042	Apparently it brings about misfortune and calamity when kept in the village.
043	The shrine maidens are responsible for bringing blessings, and keeping such unhappy things away from the village.
044	I was told that our ancestors kept the jewel here to ensure the village's safety, only bringing it out for rituals.
045	Whatever the reason, now we know what to get. So let's—
046	Who's there?!
047	What is that?
048	H-hey, Sis? I have a bad feeling about this.
049	Indeed...
050	Whatever that is, I don't think it's going to make this easy for us.
051	Both of you, stay back.
052	I'll take care of this!
