002	......
003	!!!
004	I can't...quite remember what happened that day.
005	My consciousness sank somewhere deep, and my body was no longer my own.
006	But despite that, I couldn't stop the emotions from flooding through me.
007	I wanted to protect my loved ones...which led me to hate...and gave me a reason to destroy.
008	I managed to hold myself together by putting my faith solely in these emotions. But how long did that last? How long had I been hanging on by that thread?
009	Oh...?
010	Suddenly, I was released.
011	I understood that I'd been liberated from the flesh. I had regained my freedom, but I had no body I could use to interact with the world.
012	To protect...<br>To hate...<br>To destroy...
013	I would need a body to properly see even one of these impulses through, much less all three.
014	But wherever I searched, I just couldn't find a suitable host.
015	To fulfill my purpose, I would need a particularly strong body.
016	One bearing a particularly strong will.
017	Strength... The strength to protect...
018	I raised my voice. I called out, louder and louder, continuing to search for the body of a person with the same desires—the same needs. But in this world, such people aren't so easy to find.
019	After so many long years surveying countless potential hosts, I began to forget why I was even looking to begin with.
020	Who was I protecting? For what purpose did I hate? Why did I possess such a need to destroy?
021	An eternity passed for me and my formless desires.
022	And before any answers could manifest to these questions, he arrived.
023	Someone had finally answered my voice. Someone who, like me, was yearning to protect something.
024	Makes sense. And it also means it was worth putting everything on the line for. Even if you and I have different burdens to bear...	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
025	...we both have the same need to protect.
026	...
027	...Yes.
028	I must protect.
029	The strength of your spirit is exactly what I need to fulfill my purpose.
030	Your name is...Tamba?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
031	That means...	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
032	Heh... Hahahaha! Oh, this is all too perfect!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
033	I've been searching everywhere, and always coming up short. Then suddenly, here you are, offered up to me on a silver platter!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
034	After Tanosuke had released whatever power he had and his body was engorged with strength, I'd simply intended to consume him.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
035	But what luck! The stars truly must have aligned in my favor. To use a human term, I might even call this...destiny!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
036	...
037	Are you really...Tamba?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
038	Do you know me?
039	Do I know you?! You... You went to see Koga and Kaede, and then...
040	Koga... Kaede... Those names are very familiar. Should I hate them? Destroy them? Or was I supposed to...
041	...protect them?
042	You... You've forgotten even that?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
043	Ahh, yes. Your beloved sister, and her dear husband.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
044	It was humans who snatched them away, you know. Humans who took from you those you were meant to protect.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
045	Humans...
046	What?! Tamba, don't listen to him! Don't let him deceive you!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
047	You were trying to destroy the humans that betrayed your family.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
048	It's the same old tricks with you every time, isn't it? Always trying to warp the truth with your malice!
049	It was the humans and their schemes that sealed you away. Look inside yourself, and you'll see that it's true.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
050	It's not true! You are being deceived, Tamba! Every part of the scheme to which you fell victim was devised by the Discarnate Power—the Demon Paragon you see before you!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
051	...
052	Heh. Still dusting out the cobwebs, are we?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
053	That's right! Captain Tanosuke! If we act quickly, we might be able to bring him back!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
054	Captain Tanosuke!<br>Huh?!
055	Stay back! I'll let you off with a warning for now, but don't expect that courtesy next time we meet.
056	But... Captain Tanosuke!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
057	Tanosuke...is the name belonging to this host body? Your attempts to reawaken his consciousness will fail. Stop trying now. Otherwise...
058	...I will consider you an enemy, and cut you down where you stand.
059	!!!
060	I'd suggest you do as he says, Amane. I want him back too, but now isn't the time.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
061	You see, Tamba? In every age, humans try to take everything from us.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
062	Even now, their first instinct is to exorcise you and take your body! And without it, you couldn't protect a thing. Humans are the enemy—all humans.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
063	Paragon, you fiend!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
064	You don't want anything else taken away from you ever again, do you? If so, then the humans must be crushed. Join me...
065	We will make Wadatsumi into a land of demons. That has always been our ultimate ambition!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
066	Shut your mouth!!!
067	Tamba! You mustn't allow yourself to be misled! The one who took control of your body before was none other than this very creature!
068	For Koga and Kaede's sake...and for their children, Mikaboshi and Sumeragi...
069	Do not permit yourself to be deceived by malice! Not again!
070	Kaede...
071	I'm still awakening, so I'm yet uncertain on the full scope of what's happening around me...but I remember the name Kaede...
072	And I'll thank you not to use it lightly.
073	What?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
