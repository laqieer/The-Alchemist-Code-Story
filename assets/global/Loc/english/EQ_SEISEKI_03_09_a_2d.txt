001	Captain Kudanstein—once the youngest knight to become a captain in the Holy Guard...I am honored that you know my name.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
002	Do you understand what it is that you're doing? This is Gluttony!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
003	Am I to assume that you, the emperor, have stepped into this country unannounced in search of the Sacred Stone, without utilizing any diplomatic channels?! Are you trying to start a war?!
004	War? Hehe. That's not a bad idea either.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
005	What did you say?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
006	However, unfortunately, I am not interested in that form of simplistic war...just as you are not interested in justice without power.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
007	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
008	Hm. Perhaps this is fate. How about it, Kudanstein? Would you serve me with your lance?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
009	What kind of nonsense are you spewing?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
010	It's not nonsense. I respect your abilities. Please, use that spear of yours to serve under me.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
011	I will never serve you nor will I serve Greed Dike!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
012	If you get caught up in the trivialities, you'll overlook the big picture.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
013	Whether it be Wadatsumi or Zangetsu...
014	You...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
015	I told you, didn't I? I respect you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
016	I respect your ability to survive that fierce battle at Wadatsumi...and your mental strength to maintain your sanity even in Zangetsu that was out of our control.
017	More importantly, I respect your purity in your pursuit of power.
018	You are, by no means, a man whose career will end as captain of a small regiment.
019	You are a chosen knight with the ability to change the world...if you set your mind to it.
020	What...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
021	Abhorrent emotions such as hate, jealousy, and betrayal... swirl throughout this world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
022	No matter how much the spear of justice was to take a stab at these, they will never disappear.
023	I am certain that deep inside you feel emptiness...and a strong emotion resembling hatred.
024	...!
025	Such trivial justices such as love and bonds are not enough to truly unite this world. Absolute power is what is needed.
026	I have the ability to make you pursue that power, to remove other such trivialities from you. This absolute power will be enough to take over the world.
027	!!!
028	How about it, Kudanstein? Would you like to change the world with me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
029	Change the world...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
030	Yes. Powerless justice is useless. What you need is justice that is accompanied by power...the power to change the world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
031	... ...
032	This sensation...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
033	Kudan, please don't tell me...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
034	Let's hurry! If we don't get there soon, it may be too late.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
035	Seriously! I'm hurrying! Don't bother me!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
