001	I have always enjoyed studying history. In my opinion, studying the past is the best way to avoid making the same mistakes again in the future.
002	But the more I read, the more I noticed that there was something missing in the histories left for me to study.
003	The thought that there might be history left unknown even to the Captain of the Holy Guard excited me.
004	My interest in it was so great that even I can admit that it outstripped my interest in my actual duties to the Holy Guard.
005	I even came to think that gathering knowledge of the past could be powerful enough to change the present.
006	That idea alone was enough to take hold of my curiosity and not let go.
007	Hmph. I can't get a good picture of the whole truth with the few fragments I've found so far. I know these ruins are quite old, but...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
008	Certainly from ancient times, or... Perhaps even older than that? If only I had more information... Hm?
009	This is a bit damaged, but maybe it's intact enough that Antie can analyze it for me.
010	...Hehe. This is gotten quite interesting.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
011	You seem to be having fun.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
012	Cadanova.
013	Monzein is worried about you. Have you eaten?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
014	Ah, I believe I've forgotten.
015	Captain... At least remember to eat. You'll cause trouble for Monzein.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
016	You may be right.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
017	I'm only joking, you know?
018	Really? I do think that I'm not suitable as a Captain. I'm only interested in the past and history.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
019	The reason I joined the Holy Guard in the first place was because I thought I'd be able to get more access to ruins and ancient literature.
020	Even now I much prefer spending my time researching to my duties as Captain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
021	I hope my research can be of use to the Holy Guard. If it can be of use to Zain as well, even better.
022	I'd like for the past to lead us into the future.
023	Hm. It is strange to hear my own thoughts out loud. They sound curiously unlike me.
024	That all sounds very fitting of a Captain if you ask me.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
025	But I'm not as passionate as the others... I don't have that burning passion that a Captain needs.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
026	That's why I'm not fit to be Captain. I shouldn't be the one to decide what is justice and what isn't.
027	Not every Captain needs to be what you're thinking of.
028	What do you mean?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
029	...No, it's nothing.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
030	More importantly, you seemed rather excited. Have you found something?
031	Yes, this.
032	A stone tablet? This must be very old.
033	Yes. I believe it may be from antiquity, perhaps even before that. I haven't been able to analyze much of it yet.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
034	But I'm certain I've never seen anything like this before. This may fill one of the holes in our history.
035	...
036	...Cadanova?
037	I'm telling you this as your friend. Stop looking into this. You're only putting yourself in danger.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
038	What are you talking about?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
039	I can't tell you any more than that, it would endanger you even more. And its not just for your sake. I can't risk you—
040	Nngh!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
041	Cadanova!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
042	...! I was aware that attempting to reveal the hidden knowledge here might put me into danger, but...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0018
043	The history hidden here must be quite something if they are targeting me...
044	No, they're after me.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
045	What?
046	For now, at least. If you insist on continuing your research, you will become a target as well.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
047	Dig up something inconvenient for someone and you can end up buried from behind.
048	What is that supposed to mean?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
049	I came to stop you before something like that happened.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
050	There is a grief hidden under the surface, one that feeds a corruption that sits in the shadows of the world...
051	A corruption that must be destroyed.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
