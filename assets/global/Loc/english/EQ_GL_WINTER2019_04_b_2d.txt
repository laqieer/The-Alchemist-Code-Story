001	Trick! Eira...experiment...
002	Eira? Is your name Eira?
003	Eira nods.
004	You've got it all wrong Eira.
005	Yeah, just relax for a moment. We'll explain the details to you.
006	...
007	...okay...
008	Promise...foxes...safe?
009	We promise! Don't worry, the villagers are quite welcoming!
010	And there you have it.
011	Sorry...
012	What about the monsters? It must be because of her that they're coming here in the first place.
013	That's right. Her being here puts us all in constant danger!
014	Not a problem everyone. Soren here can help train Eira to control her Alchemy.
015	Huh?
016	I mean, of course! Since I'll be staying here for awhile, I could practice with her.
017	The village would benefit having someone with Alchemy around.
018	...
019	Well, if this is what you think is best for the village Blair, then we'll go with your decision.
020	Thanks everyone! We won't let you down!
021	Thanks!
