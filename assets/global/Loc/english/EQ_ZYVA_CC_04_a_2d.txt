001	Reporting on Iris' training. A note regarding suspension of proceedings.
002	Our assault on the Mystic Tower Veda is proceeding at a steady pace, and Nihil, having entered the Fringe Dimension located in the upper stories, has obtained the power of the other dimension.
003	He has been given the name Sol, crowning him as the Sun of Lost Blue.
004	Now, as we move toward total conquest of the Tower Veda and take steps toward world domination, we at last commence our formation of the Veda Templars.
005	The bouquet is taking shape.
006	More than half a year has passed since your disappearance...
007	Iris.
008	Blurgck! Blarglarglarglargh...! Gehck! Ah... Blaaaaaghck! Gehck...glargh...urghhh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
009	Haa...haa...haa...haa...haaaa...!
010	Please value your life.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
011	Nrgh...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
012	You have not been taking breaks between missions, it seems. Your body is extremely weak. Yet you elected to take on another mission only recently...
013	Giudecca.
014	Won't you call me by my new name?
015	No.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0039
016	How sad.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
017	You are scary.
018	You sound like Sol.
019	I heard about you from Vier and Füry.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
020	A member of the Imperial Elite Guard... You have connections to the Greed Dike research facility, and are deeply involved in the exploitation of their test subjects...
021	You're from this country's Therian Care Center, yes? I heard that you were forced to participate in some truly awful experiments...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
022	Is this just another experiment to you?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
023	Do I seem like such a terrible human being?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
024	Yes.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
025	I thought you might say that.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
026	However, I must say that I couldn't abide by their...lack of respect for life.
027	Don't believe you.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0030
028	I retired from that line of work for a reason, you know.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
029	I...heard about her.
030	Why did you abandon that girl named Iris?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
031	This is good. The opposing doctrines of power and punishment, illuminated by the light of the sun and governed by its rays.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
032	Answer me.
033	The balance is hanging tenuously by a thread, and it is Sol who reigns over justice.
034	...
035	We must selectively aid those who are honest, true, and worthy of praise. Such as you, Zwei.
036	Me...?
037	Those who would offer up their very lives in order to make but a single wish come true, whose wills are unshakeable, like burnt-out stars who fade slowly from our sight...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
038	That is not me. I only want to help him.
039	In that case, won't you allow me to help you? As paltry as my powers may be...
040	What?
041	It is, as they say, the real deal. Please, here.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
042	The Babel Continental Times...and it's the latest edition, too...
043	The Babel...what?
044	It's a newspaper publication from Slothstein. My, my, I can't believe this comic is still running!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
045	Heheh... Is there a horoscope section?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
046	Where did you get this?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
047	Oh, it is but a trifle. I'm just glad that my daily dumpster-diving finally struck gold!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
048	You've always smelled bad, but I didn't have the heart to tell you. Every single day...it took all the composure I had to not pinch my nose...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0029
049	Urgh... Don't you come any closer! Please, somebody, anybody, bring me some perfume!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0029
050	There isn't any.
051	Then let's burn some incense! Anything will do!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
052	It's not that bad, is it?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
053	What are the Babel...Condi...mental...Times?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
054	Why don't you have a look? See this article here, on the front page...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
055	Hm?
056	7th Re-announcement of the Execution of the Escaped Prisoner Responsible for Severe Casualties in Wratharis
057	This is...
058	The offender in question was first imprisoned half a year previously and sentenced to execution, a cycle that was to be repeated several times over the coming months. Having caused the Wratharian Guard immense losses, the renewed order for her execution has been passed down unusually swiftly upon the prisoner's eighth round of sentencing.
059	The bud has blossomed. Oh, how I have waited for this moment...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
060	Your student's made quite a name for herself.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
061	I never thought we'd be receiving news from Wratharis way out here, of all places.
062	I suppose this means I taught her well.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
063	Are you sure you don't mean poorly?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
064	Of course he does! This isn't good publicity at all.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
065	Old habits die hard...especially when you're an ex-thief.
066	Füry... Did you look into that matter, like I asked?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
067	Y-yeah... I mean, that's my job...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
068	Ooh, having secret meetings, are we?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0004
069	N-no! It's nothing like that.
070	I was investigating the whereabouts of the large number of Philosopher's Stones that the Shadow Messiah were hoarding before their collapse.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
071	I learned that some of them were picked up by Wratharis and are being held within the nation's borders. I have the location, too, of course.
072	Heh.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
073	Sol...?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
074	I'm going to need a lot more Alchemical energy if I am to succeed in materializing the uppermost floors of the Tower Veda. Philosopher's Stones are the obvious choice.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
075	Then I'm your woman! Wratharis is an old haunt of mine.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
076	If I know the place, I can slip right in with an alternate dimensional space leap!
077	In that case...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
078	I propose a tour of sorts. First we rescue my talented pupil, and then we get our hands on those Philosopher's Stones.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
079	Two birds, one stone. You see? Actually...
080	Hm?
081	The more Stones we have in our possession, the closer we come to conquering the Tower Veda.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
082	Zwei. You can be of service to Dead Nine. You can help him.
083	Not only that, but with this, we should be able to reduce your...overexertions.
084	Drei...
085	Ahh! So you finally call me by my new name!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
086	What exactly do you think you can do against them? Put away your weapons at once.
087	What exactly do you think you can do against them?
088	What exactly do you think you can do?
089	What exactly do you—?
090	Are you calling me weak, Yauras?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
091	(I barely even remember what my father's face looked like...or the expressions on those Wratharian soldiers that day...)
092	(But those words... Those damn words that she spoke as I waited to be killed... They just keep going round and round inside my head, as clearly as if she were standing right beside me...)
093	Your execution's tomorrow.
094	What exactly do you think you can do?
095	(Don't be absurd.)
096	So you've conceded.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
097	(Don't...be...absurd!)
098	There's gonna be no escaping these restraints. Not this time.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
099	What exactly do you—?
100	There's nothing you can do.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0008
101	...
102	Ahah.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
103	Are you stupid?
104	Wh-what the—?! Everything's...twisting...?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
105	Bang.
106	Aaaarghh!
107	As gloomy as ever, I see.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
108	My sincerest apologies for the wait.
109	You sure took your damn time!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0016
110	I wasn't sure if you were dead or alive.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
111	It's not easy to escape without being seen, y'know.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0022
112	You noticed me?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0001
113	More than anyone in the world.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
114	Your results were far too elegant for an assassination mission.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
115	I was just doing my job.
116	I was dazzling, wasn't I?	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0001
117	How does freedom taste?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
118	Amazing.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
119	Will that alarm bell ever stop clanging?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0004
120	Nope. No one around to stop it. I let the rest of those soldiers go.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
121	Oh? That was awfully generous of you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
122	Let me guess... You wanted them to run, so you could pin down the location of the Stones from their movements.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0045
123	What a splendid idea.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0046
124	Oi!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
125	My, would you just look at all these soldiers!
126	Well, Iris has just blossomed into a vibrant flower.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
127	I...!
128	Is this not the perfect setting for her blades to dance dazzlingly through the air?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
129	Heh. Oh, hell yeah.	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0007
130	Like teacher, like pupil...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
131	Great. Another headache for me to deal with.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
132	I'm going to make you all dazzle!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
