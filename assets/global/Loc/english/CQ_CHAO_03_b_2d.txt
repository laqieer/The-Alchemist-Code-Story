001	Haa...haa... That was exhausting.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0022
002	(I wouldn't usually get tired from a mere skirmish like this.)	VO_chao.chao_sys_0031
003	(I couldn't give my commands quickly enough because I didn't have enough confidence—and in myself, at that!)
004	(I can't believe I relied on Won's brute strength to win! How pathetic!)	VO_chao.chao_battle_0019
005	(I have confidence in my wits, but...if my attitude truly led to my being fed false information...)
006	(There is no actual problem with my attitude, of course. However, should others perceive me that way...)	VO_chao.chao_sys_0031
007	Oi.
008	Won?
009	You...idiot!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0012
010	O-ouch! That hurt!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0047
011	You're an arrogant brat, and you drive me crazy, but you're amazing when it comes to strategy and tactics!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0003
012	The monsters in this forest are really strong, you know that? But thanks to your directions, I was able to take them down all by myself!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0002
013	Be proud of yourself! Be confident! And go beat up those bastards who gave you false information!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0007
014	Make them cough up some consolation money!
015	Baha! You're absurd.	VO_chao.chao_sys_0008
016	Wow. I didn't picture you for the snorting laugh type. You're pretty cute.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0008
017	Wh—?! I'm not cute! I'm a man! How dare you belittle me!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0012
018	I'm not belittling you. I'm praising you. You're so cute!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0024
019	Q-quiet! If you call me cute one more time, I will—!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0013
020	That's the spirit! Don't let anyone tell you who you are!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0004
021	In any case, I don't need to resort to violence. All I need to do is be more careful in the future, and make sure I get more useful information next time.
022	That is all too easily achieved, after all, for I am Chao; extraordinary genius and raven-haired wonder child!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0008
023	Tch, you're really something. You may be overconfident, but it suits you.	VO_wong.wong_chara_1005
024	Hey! See that huge tree? It's a landmark—there should be some of those fresh medicinal herbs growing behind it! All right, I'm gonna get my fill!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0024
025	Wh—?! Now hold on! I will be collecting them first, you hear me?! You can take whatever is left when I am finished!	VO_chao.chao_sys_0002
026	Heheh, suits me. This is the part you can do for yourself.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0037
027	Hmph. Why should I have to collect them myself? I don't understand why I am always surrounded by those who fail to respect me.
