001	Grooooooarrrgghhh!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0021
002	I spotted an opening!
003	This is our chance! Little lady, are you ready for this?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
004	L-let's go! Our goal is right in front of us!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
005	Then let's finish this!!!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0032
006	GroooOOOOOogghhhh—	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0028_a
007	――――
008	We did it! Now we just have to purify the core—
009	Whew, thanks for sparing me the trouble.
010	That voice, here?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
011	I thought I'd come and see if you guys needed some help, but you wrapped it up so quickly...
012	Though I got to say, little sloppy, don't you think?
013	Don't complain. Even if I had been able to create a path, I couldn't have joined you.
014	Guess I should do my job... Newbies have it so hard...
015	Ignacio! What are you planning to do with the core?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
016	Oh, piqued your curiosity? We would like to use it, of course. Silly Pursuers of Sin.
017	It's just like I was told, I see...
018	You Sephira really will do anything to save people, even if you destroy the world in the process.
019	Hand over the core! If the corruption within were to leak out this whole area would be—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
020	Oh, I know that all too well, but I'm afraid it's all a necessity.
021	As you know, the Ira Belt is right on brink of destruction.
022	...Serpent.
023	So that was your plan? Were you the ones who made the king succumb to corruption?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
024	Oi, Ignacio, can you cut the jabber? I can't keep the pathway open much longer. Get back in here.
025	Yeah, yeah, I got it. Well then, everyone, I hate to cut our time so short, but I bid thee adieu.
026	I'm feeling a little magnanimous today, so here's a little warning. If you Pursuers intend to visit the Ira Belt, you better watch your step out there.
027	That land has long since become a rather lawless place after all—
028	If you approach it as sloppily as you did the other lands, you might just find that your luck runs out this time around.
029	Wait!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
030	...Nrk!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
031	Nimul, we've got to get on the airship and evacuate. Leviathan's defeat is making the ocean go out of control... The ocean currents are picking up speed.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
032	So it's creating one final massive wave?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
033	Exactly. If that happens it'll swallow up our ice path too!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
034	I'm lowering the ship! Everyone get aboard quickly!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
035	You say that, but...!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
036	Huh? Ack!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0025
037	This isn't good! Those two will get swept awa—
038	Bzzp bwrip!
039	Ah... That sound...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0021
040	They didn't fall into the sea?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0005
041	Oh. I see...
042	Bwrii bwriizp!
043	Selsieg! That means that—!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0009
044	Oh, thank goodness, I made it in time.
045	...Don't overdo it, Nicaea.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
046	Of course. My apologies, Imnus.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0035
047	Lady Nicaea!
048	You have done well, Daphne.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
049	No, this victory is a shared one. I couldn't have done it without everyone here.
050	Oh, that's not what I meant to say at all.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0039
051	Huh?
052	I mean... You finally managed to stop dwelling on your worries rather than looking forward, didn't you?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
053	You look just like Imnus and my father. Like someone who can fight to protect others.
054	I-I look like the Captain and His Highness...?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
055	You are my beloved, wonderful Shield Maiden. I am so proud! Why, I'd say more than anything else—
056	Please, my lady, I am not worthy of such praise.
057	Oh come on, I'm going to get sad if a friend of mine keeps acting that terribly humble.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0030
058	Huh? Your...friend?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
059	Oh dear, here I was thinking about how I wanted to be friends this entire time... Is that a problem?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
060	N-not at all! It'd be an honor!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0046
061	...Good, it seems like we didn't lose anyone.
062	Let me extend my gratitude in place of my liege. Without your assistance, we'd all have perished.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0034
063	We are also grateful for the warm welcome we received, but I'm afraid that...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
064	...Yes, it appears our fight isn't over yet.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
065	At the very end we were faced with another problem.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0018
066	King Arius... He was clearly being manipulated by someone else.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
067	How unfortunate that my problems insist on multiplying...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
068	I must find out what happened in the Ira Belt while I was gone.
069	Andechs...
070	Oh, sorry, I'm really spoiling that sweet hard-won victory vibe we had going here, huh.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0036
071	We should be happy about this win. At least this area won't be terrorized by Leviathan any longer.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
072	I'd say that's definitely worth celebrating.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
073	Yeah, that's true enough.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
074	At least the Invidia Belt no longer has to deal with that threat.
075	This is a joyous moment.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
076	With the Cursed Beast defeated, the Invidia Belt will be able to enjoy some fleeting moments of peace.
077	But the Leviathan's corruption-filled core fell into the hands of the Infinite Serpent.
078	We'll have to set our sights on that blistering scorched landmass next, the Ira Belt...
079	That's where we will witness it... The end of this world.
