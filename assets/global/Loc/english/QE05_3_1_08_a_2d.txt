001	Tch! All of this is unforeseen! How can those who wield the forbidden art of Alchemy gather like this?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
002	So, you too? You can use Alchemy?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
003	You can, too?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
004	Logi, we don't have time for idle chatter!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
005	Comrade, you have forgotten Sephiron's teachings of compassion.
006	I cannot stand by and watch you lose your way any further!
007	Sephira...	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
008	Yeah! I heard him, too! We can't lose sight of them!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
009	Urgh! Gah?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0043
010	Mocca! Is the corruption spreading?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
011	Wait here.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
012	But...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
013	I have some things that I want to ask you too. Don't worry, we will come back.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
014	All right then.
015	...
016	Kamui! Did you lose them?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
017	Shh! Don't move!
018	Huh?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
019	Hah!
020	Urgh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
021	You have made a grave mistake. There is nothing here to cast a shadow.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
022	You cannot work your subterfuge here.
023	Protector!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
024	As the last Protector of the Sephira, I tell you this. Your methods will not bring the great tree back.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
025	I reject those words! We have found our hope!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
026	With the druidic priestess, we can complete the resurrection ceremony! All of this is for the great tree Sephiron!
027	You have fallen beyond saving. Allow me to perform your final rites.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0013
028	Keep talking!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
