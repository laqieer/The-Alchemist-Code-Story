001	This is bad! This is bad! This is bad!
002	The hydra flails its elongated necks, aggressively snapping and tossing the adventurers with seemingly no effort.
003	Ugh! What the...! How is the hydra this strong?!
004	We told you boss! We told you! How are we even going to escape from this mess now?!
005	...Foxes! Help... party!
006	With one swift move, Eira and her foxes conjure a speed spell to move the party away to safety.
007	Huh! More power my foot! Can't even beat a hydra with three enchanted humans and one foxgirl!
008	...all... safe?
009	Yes, thank you Eira.
010	We're alright. Boss, we should really thank Eira, we were pretty much kaput before she-
011	Enough! We need to go back to that smug elf and demand answers!
012	Elf!
013	Back so soon? Have you slain-
014	I'm going to stop you right there. Clearly, you were just messing with us. We get it, hilarious!
015	Now, how about, you hand over the remaining power and we can actually go slay the hydra?
016	...
017	With the power i've imbued into your party, it would be enough to take the hydra down.
018	Failing to do so simply means that you lack in technique and experience.
019	I'm afraid I will have to reject your request.
020	...no...fighting!
021	Okay, okay.
022	I see what's happening yeah.
023	Pretending to give us all the power...
024	...when all along you've been giving this runt the magic!
025	It does feel that way, now that the boss spelled it out...
026	No way...
027	Your leap of logic is impressive.
028	In any case, it appears you'd rather settle this with combat instead of coming to an understanding.
029	Oh, I DO understand what's going on.
030	You're going to regret this!
