001	Basheeny! Ack...! I've gotta calm down! Don't hesitate!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
002	No matter how strong a foe, there's always a weakness!
003	Huzaahhhh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
004	Idiot. Your lightweight sword won't even scratch me.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
005	Agh...gh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
006	Basheeny!
007	Ugh...ghh! I...I'm not down yet! Ca-Captain Monzein wouldn't give up here!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
008	That's right...you said that you inherited Monzein's soul, didn't you?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0044
009	If that's the case, then I'll use my arm to obliterate both you and that soul of his!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
010	Ack...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
011	Arm...?
012	That's it!
013	What was I thinking? I was so blown away by that tremendous arm of his that I was completely taken aback...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
014	...Huzahhhh!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
015	Hey, Hero of Lost Blue...what're you gonna try this time?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0025
016	I thought I'd follow in the footsteps of the old man for once. Let's face each other head on.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
017	Huh...?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
018	Sorry, but Basheeny's been entrusted with the future by the old man. I won't let you hurt him.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
019	That proud arm of yours or my technique...let's see which one wins!
020	Captain Othima!!!
021	You're hilarious. If that's you want...then I'll eradicate you with my fist!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
022	Yeah, you're fast... If I miss this attack, I guess you can call it over.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
023	This is to help Basheeny as well...old man, lend me your strength!
024	Dieeeee!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
025	Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0010
026	Aghh!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
027	Captain Othima!
028	Heh... That's unfortunate. Before you could show off that little technique of yours...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
029	Agh... N-no...in fact, I did show off my technique...to its maximum degree.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
030	...! What the...?! What's this?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
031	You...froze his legs?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
032	I concentrated it just at your legs.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
033	Sorry, but that ice...you won't easily break it.
034	Ugh...! You scum! What're you doing?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0043
035	I-I was too taken aback by the tremendous strength of your arm...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
036	After thinking about it, I finally realized that's not where your strongest weapon is.
037	The thing that was harming us the most was your side-to-side movement.
038	...!
039	Well then...now that you can't move around...what're you going to do?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
040	Captain Othima...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
041	Honestly...your jaw looks stupid. I'll leave the rest to you, Basheeny.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
042	Understood!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
043	Even with my lightweight sword...if you can't move your body, I think I can inflict some level of damage on you.
044	Wouldn't you agree?
045	Ack...!	VO_ortima.neun_battle_0019
046	You don't get to do whatever you please anymore! Take this...Quad-Assault!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0014
047	Tsk...fine... At least I fulfilled my role as a distraction to buy time. Argh!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0022
048	?! He disappeared?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
049	Looks like he reached out for that forbidden area of Veda. I guess it wasn't a lie after all.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
050	Huh...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
051	When I fought with a young girl called Acht in Lustburg...she disappeared along with the magic she cast.
052	I was wondering what kind of trick it was...but, if he was telling the truth, then that explains everything.
053	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
054	Most likely, they have the ability to go back and forth between another dimension...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
055	In case of an emergency evacuation or when things go wrong.
056	This must be that guy called Sol's doing.
057	Another dimension?! Are you serious?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
058	The fact that he disappeared without a trace is more evidence than anything.
059	Their inhuman power and their god-like appearance...
060	It seems like little by little we're revealing their secrets.
061	Captain Othima! The soldiers have broken through the barrier! Currently, they are engaged in conflict with the Greed soldiers!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
062	Are things all right over here?!
063	Yeah, somehow. Although...I did get some help.
064	Help?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
065	Ah, nothing.
066	Well then, let's quickly finish off the Greed Dike soldiers. Then we've got to hurry to Saga.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0012
067	Huh? Saga? Not Northern Pride?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
068	Ah. That guy Neun was trying to make us go to Northern Pride.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
069	I mean, you saw his wooden performance, right?
070	Are you saying that they're trying to keep us away from Saga?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
071	In other words...Orion and the main Greed Dike army...
072	Most likely, they're in Saga. Our status report to Northern Pride...
073	Understood. Leave it to me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
074	Thanks. Whatever is going on, attacking Greed Dike's army is our priority. Are you ready to go?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
075	Yes!
076	I never thought I'd be able to approach and close in on someone moving at such a fast velocity as he could.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
077	He really saved me out there.
078	Old man Monzein lent me a hand.
079	Well, I guess that makes up for the lunch he owed me.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
080	What? What is with this wind? I've never felt such an ill-willed wind before...	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
081	What does it mean?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
082	I'm not sure...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
083	Commander Kanon! I bring bad news! They've breached the border!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
084	At the same time, it appears that numerous fires have started in the city below!
085	The wind is fanning the flames causing the fire to spread throughout the city!
086	What...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
087	That's not it...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
088	Huh...?
089	The wind is what's causing the flames! Its heat is what is setting fire to the city!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
090	The wind is causing the fire?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
091	Reporting! The castle has been infiltrated!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
092	What?! In such a short period of time?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
093	Ugh..?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
094	We're under fire! Get back, Kanon!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
095	I-it's dangerous here! Please run...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
096	What...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
097	...!
098	No...! How can so much devastation be caused in such a short amount of time?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
099	Th-there's no way we can win against an enemy with such attacking force...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
100	...?! Run, Kanon!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
101	Huh...?
102	!!! Ka...Ka...non...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
103	Agh...ahhh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
104	Ah...ack! Ugh...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
105	Kanon...!!!
