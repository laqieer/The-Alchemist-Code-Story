001	Let's rest here for today. We need to keep our strength up.
002	Nnrgh...!
003	What's wrong, Edgar?
004	Hey! Let me see that! You're injured! Did this happen last night?
005	Who cares? This is nothing.
006	If I could only use my magic... I could make a wound like this heal over in a moment, but...there's still not enough Alchemia...
007	Huh...? Something's...calling me?
008	Kasumi...? Hey!
009	Um... Here.
010	This herb... I think it's...! Edgar, show me your wound.
011	All done! How do you feel, Edgar?
012	The pain is...gone!
013	I knew it! Nice one, Kasumi! I'm impressed that you knew about this herb.
014	I didn't, actually. I just...felt like that plant was looking at Edgar's wound.
015	Huh? The plant was...looking at me?
016	Oh! Um... N-never mind. Please forget I said that! I'm glad the pain is gone!
017	Hm...?
018	Mmm... Your cooking is the best, Kasumi! This seasoning is so delicious! I suppose this is what you would call Earth cuisine!
019	I'm glad you like it! Mom's always telling me that I shouldn't cook or I'll hurt myself, so...
020	It's really nice to see you enjoying my cooking. It...makes me happy.
021	Your mother sounds like a worrier.
022	No, not really. It's just, I'm totally useless, so she feels like she needs to keep a close eye on me.
023	You wouldn't believe how clumsy I am. Sometimes even I can't believe it.
024	Mom's always getting mad at me for trying to do things beyond my ability better left undone. Or... She used to... When...
025	You're not totally useless. In fact, you're not useless at all. You decided to face off against the Destrolurk all on your own, didn't you? If you can manage that, that's more than anyone could ever ask of you.
026	E-Edgar...
027	Thanks for dinner.
028	Heheh... So, did you do anything else back on Earth? Besides cooking, I mean.
029	Huh? Oh, well... I've always liked the theatre, ever since I was little, but...
030	What?! You're an actress?! A-are you famous?
031	N-n-no! Not at all! It's just that when I was little, I loved playing pretend and acting out stories... That sort of thing.
032	It was what I'd do during playdates at preschool, and at the local park...
033	Now it is time to vanquish the evil dragon, and reclaim our hope! I will imperil my very life for the sake of this world—nay!
034	For whom this world— Aaaahh!
035	That's when I fell... It was quite a distance. I was unconscious for several days.
036	I'll never forget the look on my mom's face when I woke up... I felt like I'd worried her half to death.
037	She was so mad at me, but it was my own fault for making her worry for me. After that, I never had anything to do with theatre again.
038	Why not?
039	I don't want to make my mom worry about anything.
040	But, Kasumi... Isn't that your passion?
041	So what? I-I can't tell her that!
042	I'm sure, if you just talked to her about it, she'd understand. After all, she is your mother; that's what she's there for.
043	I... Thank you.
044	To be honest, when I first found myself in this world, I couldn't help but feel like I was being punished for something.
045	That was how I felt, but now... I'm glad I got the chance to meet you, Liz.
046	I'm glad, too!
047	Oh, and Edgar.
048	What am I, chopped liver?
049	Aahh! N-no, that's not what I meant!
050	Pfft... Hahahahahahahah!
051	Look at them all. The Demons of Darkness are swarming around the Tower of Babel.
052	You can see them from all the way back here. They're even bigger than they were the last time we saw them.
053	Not a whisper from the wind or a word from the trees... It is only a matter of time before this land will be swallowed up by the Darkness.
054	Tina!
055	Lisbeth, Edgar. It's been a while, hasn't it, you two?
056	How are things in Saga?
057	Everyone fighting for their lives...
100	We have heard word of Kasumi... The Light Alchemist.
058	...
059	H-huh?
060	The winds that blow within Kasumi do not whisper of the same strength of power possessed by other Phantom Soldiers. Still...
061	She has something of her own; a certain...warmth, the likes of which I've never felt in another Phantom. What could this mean?
062	U-um...
063	Tina is a Wind Shaman. She can communicate with nature and spirits.
064	I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive us, Kasumi. In due time, we are sure to cause you unimaginable suffering...
065	But still we must have you use your powers for us, at all costs. This world needs your help.
066	I...! O-of course!
067	...
068	Edgar, Lisbeth... May I have a word?
069	So? What is it? I have a rough idea of what you're going to say, though... Seeing as you didn't want Kasumi to hear it.
070	What?
071	The ancient text has yielded a new truth. When the Phantom Soldier who can seal the Darkness defeated the Destrolurk...
072	They, too, were defeated... Completely and utterly destroyed.
073	What?! No! Then...!
074	We will never be able to summon Kasumi again.
075	No! Kasumi... I can't do that to her!
076	I knew it. Can't be helped, though.
077	No! How could you...?! We can't!
078	You've really changed, Edgar. You're nothing like the man I once knew!
079	You would have been unequivocally against something like this! You never would have allowed a girl to suffer on your watch!
080	And what about you, huh? You've changed, too. If you hadn't, then right about now you'd be defiantly telling me how you're going to save both the world and Kasumi, and that no one can stop you!
081	I...!
082	We have all lost far too much. That is why...in order for us to keep anything further from being lost...
083	That's right. For the sake of this world...Kasumi must be destroyed. It's the only—
084	K-Kasumi!
085	D-destroyed... For the sake of this world...
086	N-no! Wait! Kasumi, listen to me! I—!
087	It's all right... I'm already dead, aren't I?
088	It's not like I can return to my world, anyway.
089	If this is all I'm good for, then...!
090	K-Kasumi...!
091	Th-then...it's better this way, isn't it? I'll be destroyed for the sake of this world. That's so...so much better for everybody!
092	This is bad! Her powers are spiralling out of control!
093	Kasumi, please! You need to calm down!
094	For the sake of this world...I... I'll...! I...will...!
095	Zain?!
096	Come. Together we will go...beyond the Void.
097	I...will...
098	No! Kasumi!
099	Kasumi! Tch! Damnit all!
