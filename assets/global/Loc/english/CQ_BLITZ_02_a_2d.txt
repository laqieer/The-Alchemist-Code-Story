001	Haa...haa... Phew! Those guys were really something, huh? And you! You're crazy strong!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0030
002	If dealing with lowlifes such as these wears on you, then you are definitely unsuited for the position of inquisitor.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0004
003	However, having seen your skills firsthand, I find myself not quite so incredulous that the Envylian Guard would be after your talents.
004	Why not accept? Why not put your talents to use for a greater position?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0003
005	...
006	Whatever. In any case, I had best take my leave. You are free to wander the city, but do not disturb the peace.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0022
007	I wasn't gonna! See you around!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0004
008	He might look scary, but I guess he's not so bad after all... Oh, dang! I hope the greengrocer isn't still waiting for me!
009	She said if I helped her out again tomorrow, she'd give me another apple. Can she really afford that? I hope her business is doing well...	VO_blits.blits_sys_0031
010	You, there! Halt!
011	Huh? What is it? Just so you know, I didn't steal this apple!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0025
012	You took part in that little scuffle earlier, didn't you? The Inquisition has deemed you to be under suspicion of the misuse of Alchemy.
013	By my right as inquisitor, I am taking you into custody.
014	H-hold on a second! Alchemy? I didn't use any Alchemy!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0026
015	You'll have plenty of time to find a better excuse while you're stewing in your cell.
016	H-hey! Stop! I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0028
017	How much longer do I have to be here? I didn't even get to eat my apple...	VO_blits.blits_sys_0022
018	My apologies. You are Blitz from Envylia, are you not?
019	Huh? Gilfred?! What're you doing here?	VO_blits.blits_sys_0025
020	I believe I addressed myself to you as 'Inquisitor Gilfred'? I have taken over this case. As such, it falls on me to tell you that you have been cleared of all suspicion.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0007
021	Huh?! Wh-what the heck...? I mean, I'm glad to hear it, but—	VO_blits.blits_sys_0031
022	The misuse of Alchemy charge was never verified. In fact, the report itself was found to be a sham.
023	A sham?! But... I haven't done anything to warrant a grudge like that, have I?	VO_blits.blits_sys_0016
024	You were merely mixed up in a plot against me. The fault does not lie with you.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0036
025	What?! Are you...all right?
026	Fear not. If there were a problem, I would not be here right now.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0004
027	Oh... Well, so long as I'm all clear, and you're all right, then I suppose everything is fine.	VO_blits.blits_sys_0009
028	My apologies for changing the subject, but there is something I must ask you.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0003
029	You said that you seek to help people on your travels... Why is that? What do you expect in return?
030	What? I don't want anything! I just want to help people who need it. That's all!
031	Is it, now?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0006
032	Yeah! I like helping people, you know? I've always done what I can for my family and friends.	VO_blits.blits_sys_0023
033	One day, I found myself with the power of thunder, and decided to try and use it to help people!
034	Is that why you embarked on this journey of yours?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0044
035	Yup! I told myself—Blitz, you're gonna make this world a better place!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0004
036	I got this power totally by accident, so it took me a while to get used to it. It was pretty rough.
037	Still, I can't help but think of it as a happy accident. It's thanks to my power that I've been able to help so many people!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0008
038	If you are so eager to help people, then why do you hesitate to join the ranks of the Envylian Guard?
039	Huh? Oh, well... I was happy to be scouted and all that, but...	VO_blits.blits_sys_0031
040	I've always done this myself, you know? Helping people. I get to see them smile, and that makes me happy. That's all I need.
041	Sure, if I became a knight, I'd be able to work towards protecting something bigger...
042	But if I did that, I wouldn't be able to just go around helping the people who needed it anymore.	VO_blits.blits_sys_0023
043	The bigger the scale, the less you actually get to see the effect of the good you do on the world.
044	One person can only do so much on their own. Only the people with whom you come into direct contact are likely to benefit from your help.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0016
045	A certain measure of power is required to truly help others.
046	I guess... Still, I can't help but worry that one day I'd be given the order to fight someone I want to protect.	VO_blits.blits_sys_0031
047	I realize that this is awfully presumptuous of me...
048	But if you truly believe that you have the power to protect that which you care for by your own hands, then I would have you prove it to me.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0031
049	I've got the power!
050	You're on!	VO_blits.blits_battle_0015
