001	I see. So there is a Wind Shaman from each of the three factions.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0045
002	Yes. It surprised me as well.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
003	Hey, Lizzy! This flies by magic, right? How can I learn to use magic?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0001
004	U-um...I never really thought about how. Are Broom Aces that rare?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
005	Yeah! Us men always dream of flying, you know? I'm so jealous! I wish I could fly as well!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
006	Judging by the way he's acting now, he seems as childlike as his age. However, you say he is gradually increasing his power of the wind?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
007	Yes. That being said, we cannot afford to waste any time here.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
008	We will now head to Tehre and have him fulfill his promise to attend the Sprite Trio Discourse.
009	Let's go, Mocca, Rega!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
010	Wait! I also want to go this time!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
011	As reassuring as it would be to have you with us...I need you to stay here, Lisbeth. There's no guarantee that the Jam won't attack again.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
012	Awww! But, I guess you're right. If I leave, it’ll just be Fuu on his own.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
013	I'm sorry, Lisbeth, but you are the only one I can entrust this task to. I'm relying on you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
014	All right. Leave it to me!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
015	Let me touch your Broom Ace again sometime, Lizzy!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
016	All right then...let's go.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
017	......
018	What's the matter, Mocca?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
019	Lisbeth...Fuu...please, take care of Tamis.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
020	Don't worry, I'll watch her like a hawk. Come back safely, Mocca.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
021	...Understood!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
022	Finally, it looks like the Sprite Trio Discourse is actually happening. We've somehow managed to get this far.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
023	When we finally show Tehre the token, he won't suddenly back down on his promise, will he?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
024	I doubt that. I don't know what Tehre is thinking, but he doesn't seem like the kind of person who would break a promise.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0031
025	We've combined our strength and gotten this far. If something happens, we'll just need to overcome whatever stands in our way.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
026	...?! Hey, look!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
027	...The Gluttony army?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
028	Wow...there's a lot of 'em! I guess that's supposed to be a blockade?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0024
029	We have to pass this road in order to get to Port Nahema... Argh! Does Tehre intend to prevent us from getting there?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
030	Here come the vanguard troops! I guess we've got no choice! Let's withdraw!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
