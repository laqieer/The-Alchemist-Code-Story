001	......
002	Heheh. What's the matter? Are you upset because things didn't go as planned?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
003	N-no...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
004	It's just that...I assumed we would be hampered, but I never expected Monzein to prevent us from obtaining Leviathan.
005	Monzein the Great Thunder Axe, huh? A man who was worthy of his title as Captain of the Holy Guard.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
006	Having been able to engage with him in battle is one of the greatest rewards we could've asked for. We should be grateful.
007	But...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
008	Perhaps I should reflect on having underestimated Monzein's strength.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
009	However, we succeeded in draining Leviathan of its power. Thus, everything is going exactly according to plan. Wouldn't you agree?
010	Indeed!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0003
011	First the Mikaboshi and then the Sacred Stone Leviathan...there's no doubt that we're one step closer to collapsing the balance of power in this world.
012	Already, the Mikaboshi has lost its potency.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
013	In other words...currently, the balance of power in Babel is being maintained by the seven Sacred Stones held by their respective countries. And...
014	The Philosopher's Stone Matter in the Saga region. If we can take a majority of those and drain them of their power...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
015	It is obvious that the equilibrium in this world will collapse.
016	Mammon; the Sacred Stone that belongs to our country...and Leviathan; Envylia's Sacred Stone which is now empty of its power...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
017	Then if we add the two Sacred Stones that currently exist in Northern Pride, that will be half of them.
018	Thus...regarding the Sacred Stones in Wratharis, Slothstein, and Lustburg, whose location is unknown to us...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
019	Worst case scenario, there is no need for us to obtain them.
020	Exactly.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
021	However...that only applies under the assumption that Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone Beelzebub is held by Captain Seida.
022	With somebody as calm, careful, and clever as her...I wonder how long she can remain without changing its whereabouts...
023	Unfortunately, regardless of how extensively we searched for its location, we have yet been unable to discern its location. My deepest apologies.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
024	Do not fret. In any case, once Norther Pride collapses, we will find out.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
025	Either way, in order to guarantee success, we must obtain Saga's Matter.
026	Kudanstein...who fell into darkness...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
027	Even if he were to return to this world, if we can at least obtain the majority of the Sacred Stones within this world, we have nothing to be afraid of.
028	Kudanstein...? Hmph. What about him is there to be afraid of?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
029	I cannot believe that anyone other than myself can obtain Nimul's power.
030	I know that you also understand that well.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
031	Certainly. I was overthinking matters. With Wadatsumi's queen now dead...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
032	There is no longer anyone who can prevent fate from taking its course. All of this has been decided...
033	From your birth, Your Majesty was destined to wield the power of Nimul.
034	Continue to sit on the throne and it will cause a wound. That wound will eventually infect the world...
035	...! Who's there?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
036	You were wise to attack Envylia.
037	The Holy Guard was unable to grasp our movement...and have now sent out troops to Wratharis, Slothstein, and Saga.
038	You...! Look at you nonchalantly making your way back here now!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
039	Nonchalantly? There are those amongst my kind who dislike being used by you.
040	In a short period of time, I've appeased them and placed them strategically in various countries.
041	Shouldn't you be showering me with words of appreciation now instead of complaints?
042	Enough, Waginau... Thank you, Sol.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
043	Uncovering the symbolic artifacts scattered through this world while remaining in Greed Dike...
044	True, your original strategy was certainly a surprising one. However...
045	It was a plan that a decent tactician would be able to eventually uncover.
046	But who of your foe would actually expect you to move in the most orthodox of manners?
047	In other words, instead of being counterintuitive, act on standard intuition.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
048	Your advice reminds of how I was once drowning in strategies and tactics.
049	Your Majesty...!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
050	The fact is that the Holy Guard is currently in a situation where they have no choice but to send troops to each country.
051	One of the reasons why I called on the Templars is because it allows me to act in ways that they cannot predict.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
052	That strategy has been quite successful. In fact, I am quite pleased.
053	Hmph...	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
054	Heheh. Well then, how should I move next, my young strategist?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
055	Your first move against Envylia has already caused the world to reel in shock.
056	From here on you may move however you please.
057	What nonsense...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0017
058	If we move the main army, they'll pick up on it. It'll defeat the whole purpose of having confused them.
059	Honestly. Why do you think I got here this late?
060	All you need to do is create a situation that will keep the Holy Guard headquarters' attention away from your movements.
061	What...?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
062	I've already come up with a plan. You just need to fortify your position, Emperor Orion.
063	My Lady! It's terrible! The Greed Dike army...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
064	I heard that they appeared suddenly! What's going on?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
065	I'm not sure! In any case, there's a vast number of them. They should even be visible from here!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
066	Seida!
067	Wh-what is that...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
068	It's almost as if the horizon has been painted black!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
069	It can't be! Are those all Greed Dike soldiers?!
070	We've no time to be surprised! Kanon, you command the attack! I'll go warn the palace!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
071	I'll make my way to the frontline...excuse me!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
072	Ack! Seida's right...I can't hesitate now! Commander Zain...Captain Monzein...witness my actions!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
073	By our hands, we will protect the peace of this world!
