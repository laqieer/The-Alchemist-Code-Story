001	Dias, are you still mad? If I offended you, I'm sorry.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0002
002	Logi, you have to promise me you'll stop calling me Headstrong Dias in front of Agatha.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
003	What? Why? You were saying it yourself when you had those mushrooms.
004	What? Me? When?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
005	Yeah, you. Don't tell me you don't remember.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0004
006	I don't remember a darn thing. Those mushrooms are dangerous, and we should never eat them again.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
007	Then what is that you're eating right now?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
008	Oh, no! These are Alchemy Mushrooms!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
009	This is starting to become a habit. Drop that mushroom! Give it here!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0029
010	Wh-what are you going to do?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
011	I'm gonna flush this down the toilet!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0039
012	What?! N-no! Stop! Stop!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
013	It had to be done.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
014	Logi! How dare you...! How dare you take away my... My precious...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
015	I will kill you!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0007
016	Kill me? Over a mushroom?! You've got to be joking!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
017	This is no joke. I have a strong suspicion that I will eventually try to kill you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
018	I even have a strong suspicion that I'll kill father before getting to you.
019	Spoilers! You're giving out spoilers! Headstrong Dias, you're going crazy!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0028
020	There you go, calling me that again! I'll kill you!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
021	I-I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I won't call you names anymore!
022	We all have our individual ways of thinking. Don't worry about it.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
023	Y-you're going to forgive me, just like that? You have got to get your emotions under control...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
024	Our methodology may differ, but we're both aiming for a peaceful world without sorrow, right? Hehe.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
025	H-huh?
026	Haha! After all, we've become knights who can "create a world where Agatha can be happy."	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
027	You still remember that, Dias? Hahaha! Right!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0006
028	What do you say we start doing stand-up together?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0007
029	Maybe even start a band?
030	No way.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
031	You just considered it a little, didn't you?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
032	The monsters are growing powerful. Is it the effect of the Philosopher's Stones? 	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
033	We're getting closer to the ruins. If we hadn't discovered the Ab Breaker, we would probably be struggling a lot more.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0006
034	I agree with you wholeheartedly. For the sake of our army as it advances behind us, let's use our rock hard abs to annihilate the enemy!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
035	Let's do this!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0037
036	The Ab Breaker... Hmm... An ab training machine, is it?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
037	Huh?! F-Father...!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
038	Father?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
039	So...the two of you have obtained the forbidden power, after all.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
040	N-no! You've got it all wrong! The late night commercial said that the first ten callers would get a crystal dumbbell if they ordered this, so—	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
041	W-we just wanted abs that could flatten our enemies like steel walls!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
042	Enough excuses. Let me feel those washboard abs.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0030
043	Huh? Uhhh, s-sure...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
044	Now, let me see...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
045	Nnk...!
046	Hm... Firm. Oh, how they remind me of solid plate armor.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0045
047	Father! Feel mine, as well!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
048	All right, let me see...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
049	Ooh...!
050	Well, now. Your abs are as tough as the sole of a gorilla's foot.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0044
051	Father... Your metaphors are a little hard to relate to.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
052	Why don't you try the Ab Breaker out, Father?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0002
053	I hear the TAC Producer uses it every day.
054	What? Even the Producer uses it?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
055	So that's where his massive ego comes from! All right, I'm going to buy myself one as well!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0007
056	Get your abs rock hard with the Ab Breaker!
057	Boys... You... That insane cheer you just did, with your arms outstretched... Why, that's the Romance pose. Where did you learn such a thing?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
058	The other day, at Fort Aldrin.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
059	W-we...were planning on telling you.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
060	Now, boys... You both know what power such a cheer holds, don't you?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0016
061	It's an art forbidden under the Magna Code, established by the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms of Babel.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
062	A strictly forbidden art, permitted only to be used by the Holy Guard.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
063	That's not what I mean. That cheer and the pop-culture arts were the cause of Wratharis' collapse.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0030
064	It's a power that can bring a kingdom to destruction; I'm asking you if you understand the meaning of that.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0017
065	Sorry...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0036
066	B-but, we have no intention of exploiting this art!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
067	What do you plan to use it for?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
068	I plan to use it to protect people without power.
069	I plan to use it to change this world filled with sorrow.
070	My children have now been exposed to the turmoil of pop-culture, as I once was. Is this fate?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
071	Father, why do you know the Romance pose?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
072	Listen. The heart of man is weak by nature.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0030
073	If you do not stay strong, you will be consumed instantly by the power, as I was.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
074	Huh...?!
075	There is no time for us to wait for the Holy Guard.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
076	If it's to combat the pop-culture moves of the rebel army, then we've no other choice.
077	Swear to me that you will never allow yourself to be swallowed up by your power.
078	I swear, Father!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0004
079	Yes! I swear never to lose myself to this power.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0045
080	Very well. Let's cut through the forest. We're going to make a run for the Gilrack Ruins.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0038
081	That's the bar where we're having the mixer. We'll have to walk right into the group of awaiting women. Keep your guard up.
082	U-um, wait! I feel it's too dangerous to charge in from the front, without knowing the target.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
083	Maybe we could divide their seating arrangements.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0002
084	What do you mean by that?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
085	If we arrange the seats as male, female, male, then everybody will be sitting next to a member of the opposite sex.
086	That way, we can at least avoid having the women clustering and speaking only amongst themselves.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0045
087	Arriving late and forcing them to change seats might leave a bad impression. Who's going to make the suggestion?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
088	I will. I'm younger and cuter than you, Father. It should be easier for them to forgive me. Right?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0038
089	Logi...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
090	Hmm...
091	I will go too, Father! With the two of us, we should be able to keep the mood light.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
092	Hmph, very well. Remember, Agatha will know nothing of this.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
093	Of course!
094	You boys will go in with a funky, spring break-vibe, and I'll close it all off with my dandyism. Maintain control of the situation!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0032
095	Right!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0037
096	Got it!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
