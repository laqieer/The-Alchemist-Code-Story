001	Ack...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0021
002	Are all the Phantom Soldiers destroyed?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
003	Shouldn't you be protecting your back?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0007
004	Oh no!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
005	Agh...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0027
006	!!!
007	No matter how skillfully you wield Alchemy, your eyes cannot see in every direction.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
008	There's no way you can continually deflect the AJ5000 Series' 3-unit combo attack.
009	Agh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
010	In battle, where the circumstances change from moment to moment, this is the perfect combo attack! This action is only possible through the ability to sync information!
011	Did you really complete the Messiah?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0016
012	This artificial intelligence called Messiah was originally developed in order to accommodate the accelerating industrialization of this country.
013	Did you just say, ‘this'? Is the Messiah here right now?!
014	However, during the development process, I discovered the possibility of syncing countless Alkaroids.
015	Think about it. If we can sync all the Alkaroids that populate this land, we can obtain information from all across the country.
016	We can obtain the eyes to see through the entire world.
017	Ack! Where is it?! Where are you hiding it?! Look for the Messiah! If we can just destroy that artificial intelligence...	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0012
018	Agh! Wh-where is it?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
019	Seriously what are you looking for? It's right here in front of you. All of this is thanks to Belphegor.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0007
020	I'm sorry, Ethan. Before you stole Belphegor, I'd already completed this ultimate artificial intelligence.
021	I-It can't be...?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
022	Messiah means savior. Having obtained the eyes to see everything in this world, I will become its savior.
023	Y-you...imbedded the Messiah in your own brain?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0012
024	As long as I have these eyes, the chances of one of your attacks penetrating my defenses is one in a million.
025	It's over.
026	Agh?! Agah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0027
027	AJ5000, recover the Belphegor. Let's go, Ethan.
028	Wh-where...?!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0027
029	Where do you think? To the place where the Sacred Stone's power can be unleashed.
030	The clock tower.
