001	The world was young when I first walked its lands.
002	I have watched empires rise and fall at the whim of but a single soul.
003	For Man has ever yearned for the power to change the world, whether for weal or woe...
004	Is that not the reason they travel far and wide in search of my kind?
005	Alas, Man is foolish, and all too often orchestrates their own downfall.
006	From humble grave to fleeting end, their journeys a streak of fire against the falling dusk of their lives.
007	Undone by their own incessant lust for glory.
008	Very funny, elf, pretending to give us power and nearly turning us into hydra food!
009	Now hand over the real stuff or this pipsqueak gets it!
010	We promise to do right by your powers, o great elf!
011	We want to change the world for the better!
012	We'll become great heroes, helping the downtrodden and toppling tyrants!
013	Our names will go down in legend!
014	No matter the paths they walk, it all begins the same way.
015	Please, great elf! I need to get stronger!
016	I gotta save my village! It's all I have!
017	I must kill the mad king. That is my destiny.
018	That's why you're here, isn't it? To help us?
019	O great elf!
020	Power!
021	Glory!
022	GIVE IT TO ME!
023	From dust they came, and into dust they went.
024	Such ignoble ends.
025	Look at you. How could you hope to change a thing, much less the world?
026	Your will falters in the weakness of your flesh.
027	Misused, this power will swallow you whole.
028	...Still, you do not understand.
029	More... Give me more...
030	It's not enough...
031	You promised greatness! What is this?!
032	My legacy cast to ruin...
033	This is all your fault!
034	So be it.
035	If power is what you desire...
036	Burn in the fires of your own ambition, then.
037	Become the beacon you so craved.
