001	And that's why it shines so brightly.
002	I don't need to worry about the colors I see in people anymore. I won't lose myself to those hues any longer.
003	I stand alone in this monochromatic world, but in it I am number one.
004	Dad! I want this! It's all gold and sparkly!
005	Just like your eyes!
006	I can't even tell which of the stones in this bottle are the amber ones I liked so much anymore.
007	In the heat of the battle, my father's skull disappeared into the Mystic Veda Dimension.
008	I have cast aside my stolen garb. I will dress myself in the color of my new world.
009	Finally, I have found my truest self.
010	I am...Sieba.	VO_siewa.siewa_chara_1001
011	...
012	How does it feel?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
013	Amazing.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
014	Like nothing in the world matters.
015	...
016	I see.
017	How...amusing.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0013
018	Your eyes are so pretty, Sieba.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0024
019	My...eyes.
020	They're amber. Really sparkly.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0008
021	Amber...?
022	I... Of course. I am the most dazzling person in this world. The most dazzling of them all...	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
023	Despite the green of my eyes...
024	I had always deliberately turned away from my suspicions that he wasn't my real father.
025	Now my eyes are a shade much closer to his, but I have no means of seeing them for myself. I will never know the color of my own tears.
