001	Upsy-daisy! There we are.
002	You're, um... Marie?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0001
003	Oh! Miss Agatha!	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
004	Oops! Oh, dear! There goes the laundry!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0027
005	Ah! I'm so sorry! I'll pick it up!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0026
006	Th-thank you!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0034
007	I must say... You're a hard worker, aren't you, Marie? I could a learn a thing or two from you.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0007
008	Oh, no, not at all! There's simply not much else for me to do here!
009	Marie? I heard a scream. Is everything all right?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
010	Oh, Miss Mocca! I'm sorry! I'll bring it in now!	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
011	No need to get all flustered. There's no rush. Agatha?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
012	Are you helping out around the barracks, too, Mocca?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0001
013	Yeah. I've got this illness, so no one will let me out on the front lines.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
014	That's why I'm guarding Marie and helping out back here. They think it's easier on me, I guess.
015	A-are you ill, Mocca?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
016	Oh, right. I haven't told you about it, have I?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
017	The Jam that attacked the city in the desert left a curse on me.
018	Wh-what?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
019	Kamui and the others have helped me keep it suppressed, so it's actually not that bad.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
020	Are you in pain? I... I'm sorry. That's a stupid question, isn't it?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
021	Hahah! It does sting a bit sometimes, I suppose—more than a bit, really—but it's not like it's for forever!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0011
022	If we can take down Ceclidis, the curse should disappear.
023	Ceclidis... What does he want with Marie? What does he want with me?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
024	I don't fully understand it, either.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0039
025	I know that I am a druidic priestess; that the blood running through my veins is considered special even among the Sephira.
026	I am not sure what other possible reason there could be.
027	A druidic priestess, huh? What is that, anyway?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
028	I'm afraid I don't know. I am sorry. I know so little.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0036
029	It's all right! There's nothing to worry about. Logi and the others will protect us, no matter—	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0010
030	Huh? Wh-what...?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
031	Where...am I?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
032	Ah, it's been quite a while since we've had visitors here.
033	Wh-who's there?!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0026
034	Is that you, Marie? W-wait, you're not—	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
035	There is nothing to fear. This is but the staircase that links the Truth to this world—or what is left of it.
036	The...Truth?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
037	Ah, so you have some level of self-awareness here, I see. This is very interesting—wait, no, that's not right.
038	I am very happy to think that your will has made it all the way here despite fate's folly.
039	I am certain that Ouroboros will rejoice in your return as well. You are the new Vessel of Reincarnation, after all.
040	The Vessel...of Reincarnation?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
041	Wh-what does that even mean?! I don't know anything about that at all!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0031
042	I... I don't even know anything about myself.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0022
043	There is nothing to fear. The legend has already collapsed, and our protection has faded to a distant time.
044	Only the name itself remains in this world. It is naught but a husk, which serves to tell us that such a role once existed.
045	If that's true, then why are Marie and I being targeted?!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
046	That is because you are both vessels for the blood of the Cursed Beasts.
047	The Cursed...Beasts? I'm sorry, I really don't know anything...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
048	Oh, you don't need to apologize! You are a very caring person, aren't you? To put it simply...
049	Ah, it seems that the connection is weakening. What am I going to do with you?
050	Oh, well. I suppose it cannot be helped. One last thing, then...
051	Beware the lure of the Stone. It seeks to enter this world via your desires.
052	Wait! What is that supposed to—	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
053	...tha! ...ss Agatha?!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0027
054	Ngh!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0018
055	Are you all right, Miss Agatha?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
056	I... Huh? Wh-what? D-did something happen?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
057	You fell down all of a sudden. If Marie hadn't been holding onto you, you would've fallen on your face.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
058	What?! R-really?! I'm sorry! Th-thank you, Marie!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
059	You really don't look well. I think we ought to call for the medic.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
060	N-no, I'm fine. It was just a dizzy spell.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0010
061	(What was that all about? Am I just tired?)	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0030
062	The lure of the Stone... What could that mean?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0031
