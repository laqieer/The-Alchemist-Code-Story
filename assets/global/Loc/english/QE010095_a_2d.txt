001	Hmm... Your power...it seems to grow increasingly refined.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
002	Huff...huff... You don't have to flatter me. We hurry onward.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
003	In order to question Captain Zeke's true intentions?
004	Of course.
005	Father...why would you choose to make peace with Wrath?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
006	Captain Zeke may be attempting to atone for the crimes he committed at the Dawn of Wrath.
007	Atone...?
008	Are you referring to how he slaughtered the unarmed royal family of Wratharis?
009	What of it? Wielding one's sword in battle is to be expected.
010	I doubt father would feel heavy-hearted about that.
011	Well then, why does Captain Zeke raise Agatha?
012	What...?
013	The fact that he raised a child he found on the battlefield of Wratharis...
014	Is that not evidence enough that Zeke feels heavy-hearted about his sins?
015	H-how do you know about that?! That's supposed to be a secret only our family knows!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	Hmph. You underestimate me. Don't make me repeat myself. I am the grand councilor of the Kingdom of Envylia.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
