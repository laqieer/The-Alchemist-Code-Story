001	Grooorgghhhhh!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0032
002	Whoa! Damn, she's strong!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0046
003	Are you all right, my lady?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0042
004	Y-yes, I'm fine. Um... Julia?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
005	I want you to know that... I am proud to have you as my protector.
006	I am unworthy, but I thank you, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
007	I swear that henceforth you will be exposed to no further dangers in my presence.
008	You have nothing to fear, Lady Emmel.
009	Thank you, Julia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
010	Now, let's draw the Waters of Purification and return to the village.
011	Yes, let's... Ngh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
012	Emmel! Emmel, can you hear me?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
013	Nngh... N-Nim...mul...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
014	Hold on, Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
015	Please...don't... I'm really...fine.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
016	No, you're not! Damn it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
017	We must...hurry.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
018	We can't let...the corruption spread...any further.
019	I need to purify it... The corruption...of sin.
020	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
021	H-hey, can't someone else become the Vessel?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
022	That's impossible. I was chosen...to be the Vessel.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0040
023	That's the way things are...in this world.
024	The way of the world, is it?
025	...
026	(Huh? Something's powering the Engineer Soldier...)
027	(What the hell? Where is all this magil coming from? Wait...!)
028	(Emmel!)	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
029	(The powers of the Vessel of Purification, received by making a pact with Sephiron...)
030	The weight of all the problems of the Sephira people rest on her small shoulders.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
031	That is the way of our world.
032	(So it has to be her, huh? I mean, there can't be too many people out there who have this kind of power... I guess there's no one who can replace her.)	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
033	(Poor Emmel...)
034	It's time we headed back.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
035	Y-yeah...
036	(Why?)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
037	(Why must Emmel suffer?)
038	(I cannot let this continue. I must...)
039	I must reshape this mad world...
