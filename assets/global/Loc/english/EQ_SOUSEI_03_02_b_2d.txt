001	Your friends left the three of you behind?
002	Well, we can't leave the airship completely undefended.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
003	Someone has to keep watch.
004	Besides, we can still communicate if we need to. That's why Mira went with them.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
005	Right... Because of your Space-Time Manipulation?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
006	Yes. I'm not acclimated to the magil of this region yet, so teleportation is out of the question, but just speaking with Mira should pose no problem.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
007	Without any magic tools or anything? Wow, some of the other regions are seriously advanced!
008	From my perspective, the technology of this region is just as impressive.
009	This region prioritizes the common good over individual profits. One person's progress isn't limited to that person's individual growth alone. It's a wonderful thing.
010	The fact that technology, and its various benefits, is available to everyone here... That's a philosophy that is more powerful than I could have imagined.
011	I'm happy to hear that, but with the government in its current condition, that philosophy is nothing more than an empty promise.
012	Oh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
013	Anyhow, I confirmed the availability of the materials Adaleigh needs. I mean, it's going to take some time to have them delivered, but that can't be helped.
014	I expect that by the time Adaleigh gives up and comes back, they should be ready!
015	Pardon me. I've been wondering...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
016	What's the matter, miss?
017	Just...what kind of relationship do Icona and Adaleigh have?
018	I just couldn't help but wonder.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
019	Ah, well...
020	So Icona is sort of his senior in terms of engineering studies. They both came from the same orphanage.
021	Orphanage?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
022	They lived down below. It's tough down there. A harsh environment and rigorous labor keeps the life expectancy pretty low compared to those in the "above."
023	Above? Below? Ah, you mean the city and the surface that Icona spoke of.
024	Ah, so you've heard.
025	Only a handful of people get to live in the floating cities, but for this region, that's just how it is.
026	But those two had a rather strange set of circumstances...
027	Circumstances?
028	Brains. Smarts like you wouldn't believe.
029	I thought Father was joking when he brought them up, but they proved their worth in no time, and now they're officially Engineers.
030	They didn't just let their dreams be dreams. I really admire that about them.
031	Even after all these years, she keeps an eye on him.
032	However... No, never mind.
033	In any case, Icona's like a big sister to Adaleigh.
034	That's all I really know about them.
035	I'm sorry.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0035
036	What's up with you, Adaleigh? Apologizing out of nowhere like that.
037	But your arm... Had I been more careful...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
038	You mean this? Don't bother worrying about it.
039	It was just flesh. I'd been thinking it was time for an upgrade anyway.
040	See? Look, this thing's so useful! My mechanical arm eliminates the need to carry around equipment and tools.
041	And look: it's made of the same alloy that I plan to use for airship armaments, so it's super strong!
042	Th-that's not what I meant!
043	You wouldn't have gotten hurt at all if only I...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0019
044	Adaleigh...
045	How long are you going to dwell on the past?
046	There's no point in being scared of making mistakes. Just look back, analyze your mistakes, and try again, do better!
047	The important thing is to learn from failure, right?
048	...This is the Mayor's office.
049	No one's here. What is going on...?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
050	There are so many weird tools in here! Hey, what's this?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
051	Don't touch anything! It could be dangerous!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0014
052	Jeez, just tossing around chemicals like that...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
053	It looks like Icona was here a lot. She really has no space in her mind for something like "crisis management."	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
054	This model...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
055	It's a model of the floating city. You see that in the middle?
056	We saw this under the witch's mansion. Stones that draw their power from the transmutation of life itself...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
057	Huh? Oh, you're right!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
058	It looks just like it, right?! I was surprised when I saw it in Luxuria, too.
059	Adaleigh, what is this?
060	This is the fuel mined from the underground caverns of this region.
061	Mined? This rock can be found underground in this region?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0026
062	We call it the "Stone of the Gods."
063	No one knows its origin, let alone how it exists at all. Some theorize that it might be an ancient fossil, but...
064	...Of the Gods...
065	But it's weird. In Luxuria, this stone was transmuted from the magil of living things, but this is rock that we dug up from under the surface...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
066	If they're both the same thing, how did this get underground?
067	Apologies for the interruption, but I've found something interesting!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
068	What is it all the sudden? Oh, this...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0005
069	It looks like some kind of report. Something to do with the scouting of the tunnels.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
070	Indications of illegal mining. Further investigation required immediately.
071	Does this mean that the mayor has gone to the surface to investigate?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
072	There's a high likelihood of that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
073	Maybe Icona's there too!
074	She did say that the mayor summoned her.
075	So we just missed them...
076	C-come in! Report! Fallen have been spotted in the underground mining area! Repeat, Fallen have been spotted—
077	What? Fallen?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
078	Where! Where is your exact location?!
079	And you are? This is a direct line to the mayor's—
080	This is Adaleigh, Official Engineer of Redington! I came to meet the mayor but... Whatever! Just tell me!
081	U-understood! Fallen have appeared in Redington management division F, and there are injuries reported! Please send reinforcements—
082	Is Icona with the team? Is Icona there?!
083	Affirmative! However, she got separated from the party and—
084	Got it! We're on our way! Nimul, it's okay, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
085	Of course it is.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
086	Thank you!
087	First, we need to go down to the surface! The airship should be able to handle that for now!
088	Then we should act immediately. Mira, can you send word to Emmel?
089	Okay! Leave it to me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
