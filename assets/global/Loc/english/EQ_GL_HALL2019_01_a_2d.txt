001	Halloween! A day filled with fun activities like dressing up in costumes, themed delicacies, and of course, trick-or-treating.
002	On this day, a local orphanage prepares for this highly-anticipated occasion.
003	With costumes designed and financed by Roxanne, this is a day the children will never forget.
004	Thank you so much Lady Roxanne! It's been years since I've seen the children's faces light up so brightly.
005	You're too kind, Halloween is a festive event that no child should miss out on.
006	I'm honored to give the children a day of merriment.
007	Miss Roxanne! Can you help me button up the back of my dress?
008	Of course dear! Here we go...and done!
009	Yay, thank you!
010	Look at all of them being so excited about Halloween!
011	Sieggy! Doesn't it fill you with delight to see so many of them so happy?
012	That's fine and all Roxanne, but why am I all dressed up as well?
013	Hmm? Didn't you say that you wanted a break?
014	This is it! A chance to enjoy life, uninterrupted by killing machines and ravenous beasts!
015	*Sigh* This is going to be a long night.
016	See you later Miss Roxanne!
017	The children scurry off towards the houses that line the streets. The duo watch as they make their rounds collecting candy.
018	It's amazing how Halloween has come to represent what it does today.
019	When we have kids of our own, we'll make sure to bring them out for fun-filled activities too, Sieg!
020	That goes without saying. Children should be brought up in a safe and fun environment.
021	And maybe when they're older, my children and yours can start sparring to learn to defend themselves.
022	My children and yours? Ugh! Sieg, are you still that dense?!
023	What? Did I say something wrong?
024	Waah! Miss Roxanne! There was... There was...!
025	Calm down dear! What's wrong?
026	We were getting our candy when we were suddenly attacked by Rattys!
027	Rattys? In this neighborhood?
028	You have to get our candies back! They stole a bunch from us!
029	Nu-numa! Numa numa!
030	Miss Roxanne! Mr. Sieggy! Help! The rattys won't stop chasing us!
031	Mr. Sieggy?
032	Look sharp, Sieg! Here they come!
