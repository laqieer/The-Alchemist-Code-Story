001	Phew... I can finally breathe again. Running isn't my forte.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
002	Then we should get going!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
003	Mmmm, but... Maybe it's best if I just go home. There are always so many people at festivals.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
004	Those suspicious men from before might be there, and I really don't want to deal with scouts. They're always so persistent. Staying at home is much more...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
005	Hey, I know! Why don't you come over my place? I have everything ready for a cozy night in.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
006	Letting little things like that stop you from going out is so boring!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0012
007	Y-you're absolutely right! Hahahahahah!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
008	(Ungh... She has a point.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0027
009	(She came all the way here from Wadatsumi. I guess I can't blame her for not wanting to stay cooped up indoors.)
010	Come on! Let's go!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0002
011	W-wait! Fujika!	VO_nacre.nacre_battle_1018
012	Here we are!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
013	H-huh?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0020
014	Welcome, one and all! Come, have a look at these accessories—hand-made by the powerful Alchemia Mage herself, Miss Neica!
015	These are incredibly rare pieces, normally available only by custom order! If you want to get your hands on one, you must buy it here, today, at my stall!
016	Wow! She made these?! Oh my gosh! I need one! Gimme!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0009
017	Me too! Gimme!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0007
018	Th-this is...the stall selling my accessories!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0021
019	Heheheh. You told me about it in one of your letters. Don't you remember?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
020	I-I guess I did. It's the first time I've gotten to sell my accessories like this...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
021	This is amazing! So many people came here to buy your accessories, Neica!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0024
022	I feel so happy that my friend's work is so popular! That's so cool!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0007
023	It's...just because of my powers, though.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
024	What do you mean, Neica?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0001
025	Everyone thinks that my accessories have Alchemia in them, and will grant them some kind of special power.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
026	I've never actually tried to do that. It's not something I want to do, either, but everyone keeps hoping for it.
027	I was happy when the stall owner asked me if I wanted to sell them, but at the end of the day, even that was just because of my powers, wasn't it?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
028	Even though I never wanted them in the first place...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
029	Neica...	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
030	Found ya, Fujika!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
031	Y-you!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0025
032	Ain't that the powerful Alchemia Mage, Neica, with ya? Even better, I'll take both of ya with me. I'm gonna need to borrow your powers!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0024
033	Nnngghh! This is why I don't like going outside! It's too dangerous!	VO_nacre.nacre_battle_0011
