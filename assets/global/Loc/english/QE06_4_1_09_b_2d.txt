001	So this...is Castle Aquila Rubrum.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
002	Yes. It is the symbolic heart of Wadatsumi's royalty, built by your ancestors, the House of Rising Ashes.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
003	It also formerly served as the Blade Fox headquarters.
004	...
005	It's still hard to believe I'm descended from Wadatsumi royalty.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
006	Head to the home of your people, Logi. Your destiny awaits you there.
007	(I was told that many souls once dwelled here.)
008	(Then there was a great Malice that brought ruin to them.)
009	(This demon... This Malice wrought untold havoc upon Wadatsumi.)
010	(So much of what could have been important to me was robbed away before I even had a chance to know of its existence.)
011	(And then...)
012	...
013	Logi? Is something the matter? You seem lost in thought.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0002
014	Ah, sorry. It's nothing.
015	Can't blame you if you're feeling a little dumbstruck. It's not every day you find out you're royalty in a foreign land and get brought to your family's old castle.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
016	Is everything all right, then, Logi?
017	Absolutely. So, what do you need me to do?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
018	Well, first and foremost...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
019	I knew you'd be back, Amane.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
020	Jubei...!
021	I seem to have been right to take action when I did. I'm glad to see you safe and sound.
022	Jubei?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
023	Have you already heard of what happened to Lady Celis?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
024	I...have.
025	...
026	Anything I say now would only come across as a hollow excuse for not being able to save her. So I've resolved simply to continue cutting down demons. That, I believe, is my road to atonement.	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0019
027	So? Did you get it?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
028	Here. The demon's horn.
029	This is...Tamba's?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
030	With this horn, we can now finally restore Sumeragi and Kagutsuchi.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
031	...! Logi?!
032	It's really you! I can hardly believe it. You've grown so much!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0023
033	You know me? Who might you be?
034	I'm sorry, I have yet to introduce myself.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
035	I was once a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard, and fought alongside your mother, Lady Celis.
036	Since then, I have been once ousted from the Blade Fox, but have been welcomed back into their ranks as captain. My name is Jubei.
037	Really?! The Scarlet Flame Guard?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
038	I must apologize for having to drag you into this, Lord Logi. This is all because I failed to handle it myself.	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
039	But if you could lend a hand, we would certainly be grateful. Though, to be honest, Lady Celis too had hoped it would never come to that.
040	I see...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0020
041	There is one other thing to note as well.
042	Lady Celis! Hang in there! Let me see if I can patch you up!
060	It's no use. I'm...not going to make it. But please, if you would... Take this.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
061	A...dagger?
062	I've imbued it with my will. Wherever it goes...so too shall my soul.
063	My children will surely understand. So...please...
043	If you could also tell everyone...to please...take care of Wadatsumi...
064	Lady Celis! Don't strain yourself any further! Just hang on!
065	Jubei, I want you to...take care of everyone, and...I wanted to...thank you.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0022
066	Lady Celis!
044	Tell Amane...to try not to be...so picky at the dinner table. And...tell Logi...
045	...to do his best...to protect...the peace...for everyone...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0018
048	Lady Celis? Lady Celis!
067	I have that dagger now. It's...painful to think of, but it's an important memento of her.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
068	I see. I hope you'll take good care of it.
069	I suppose it may have been meant for me, but I...don't think the time is right for me to have it. I don't entirely understand the significance of it yet, after all.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0003
070	I understand. And I'm happy to keep it safe.
050	Logi, I want you to know that I will continue to cut down demons in Lady Celis' honor. I swear it upon her name.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0043
051	...
052	May I ask you to lend your aid?
053	I will do my utmost. But there is something I'm lacking.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
071	Oh? And what might that be?
054	I've heard all there is to be heard. I'm now deeply involved with what is happening in Wadatsumi.
056	I want to protect the way of life here. The problem is, I don't know what that way of life is just yet.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
072	I want to carry on the will of those who've been lost, but I haven't come to know what the people here have willed.
057	What did my father go through when raising me? What did my mother feel when she left me behind?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
058	I want to know what was in their hearts. I feel like it's my responsibility to know!
059	Logi...
