001	What are you playing at?! Why do I need to get involved in your problems?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1011
002	It's inevitable.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
003	I broke your weapon so it was destined to be this way.
004	Seriously? You're like a brat throwing a tantrum.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0016
005	If it matters to you so much then how about you go ahead and apologize to my weapon that you broke?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
006	What? Why should I apologize?!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0017
007	Sigh... Fine. In that case, give me your prey.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
008	Wh-what are you doing?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0025
009	Just hurry up and give it to me.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
010	Hmph!	VO_eizan.eizan_battle_0010
011	Whaaaat?! You broke it?! How could you, you scum?!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_0027
012	Yeah, I broke it. We're even now.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
013	How could you? At this rate, the evil sealed within the scythe and the King of Chaos will be unleashed...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0021
014	Th-this world will end! And it'll all be your fault!
015	Well, that's unfortunate. That being said, half of it will be your fault. How are you going to take responsibility?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
016	What?! Augh...!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_0019
017	Hey, you two...what are you doing there?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0001
018	Huh? Who are you?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
019	I heard there was a talented blacksmith here.
020	It's you, isn't it? Will you forge a weapon for me?
021	No.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0040
022	...What?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
023	Can you not see the number of troops I have standing behind me? Do you think you have an option?
024	I have no intention of forging a weapon for someone I know nothing about.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
025	I see. In that case...burn it all down!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0005
026	Yes, Sir!
027	You...! What are you doing?!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0027
028	I have no resentment towards you, but you'll now be eliminated. I cannot afford to have others of power obtaining your weapons.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0007
029	Hold on a second.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0003
030	I was already in talks with him. Who do you think you are to disrupt my negotiations?
031	Hey. Shut up.
032	No. I will not shut up!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0015
033	As one who loves weapons, I cannot allow such one-sided actions to go overlooked.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1003
034	One-sided, huh?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
035	Those are fine words, young lady. However, this is no place for a child. Shut your mouth and look the other way.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
036	How spiteful...and foolish!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_1028
037	It's nauseating to see a noble of similar rank to myself engaging in such tyranny.
038	I don't know where you claim to be from, but you are not qualified to stand above anyone.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
039	Well, well... It appears I have an unwelcoming witness present here. In that case, you'll have to die as well.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0044
040	Enough of this nonsense. You are the one who will die.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
041	I'll have you eat your own words!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_0014
042	Hey, wait! You're completely unarmed!	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1011
043	Ah...
044	Tsk... Use this!	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0016
045	Is this...a scythe?!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0025
046	I made it as a hobby, but you should be able to wield it.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
047	So, you make things like this as well.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1002
048	I was going through a phase. Let's go.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
049	Heheh. Fine then. I'll show you how terrifying I am!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
