001	We may just meet again someday.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0007
002	(Who was that girl?)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
003	Heck. That was a close call.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0020
004	Heh. That warrior girl packs a mean punch.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0008
005	Let's hurry.	VO_noctis.noctis_battle_0030
006	(I feel the same energy radiating from her as well. What's going on?)
007	We're approaching.
008	...Right.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
009	Dude, I'm getting a real metropolitan vibe from this place. Isn't the air getting worse?	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0044
010	Isn't it the same with Crown City?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0007
011	C'mon. Crown City is nothing like this.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1029
012	I'll have to agree with you there.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0020
013	Dude! Look! That motorbike is awesome!	VO_prompt.prompt_chara_1010
014	What?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
015	(Logi?! No...it can't be.)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
016	What's the matter?	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0001
017	No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
018	Didn't think they'd have machines like that here.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0024
019	And ones like this as well.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0027
020	What's that?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0026
021	These look like they've been through the wringer.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0031
022	Apparently, those are Slothstein's Alkaroids.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
023	I'm not liking the look of 'em!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0028
024	I thought you were fond of machines.	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
025	Only when the fondness is mutual!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_1029
026	Now doesn't appear to be the appropriate time for bantering.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0014
027	Target located. Destruction initiated.
028	Let's clean 'em up.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_battle_0007
