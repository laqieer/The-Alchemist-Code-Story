001	And that's a wrap.
002	Time flies fast when you're kicking butt.
003	Grooooooooooooooooooogghhhh!
004	What is that?!
005	Look! Over there!
006	Whoa! What the hell is that thing?!
007	One, two... Five heads! It can't be...!
008	Impossible!
009	No way! It can't have survived!
010	You mean the ancient dark dragon...the Destrolurk... It's...!
011	Grooooooooooooooooooouuuuuugghhhh!
012	Ngh! Is that a...Shadow Wave?!
013	What?! It's...!
014	This cannot be! It's robbing us of our Alchemia!
015	What?!
016	Nnrgh... Without our Alchemia...we have no hope of defeating it!
017	You must...run.
018	The future of this world...depends on you!
019	Not a chance!
020	Don't be a fool! Go!
021	Tch! Damnit all!
022	That day, our Alchemy and Alchemia were lost to us...
023	And the way of the world was altered.
024	(Oh...)
025	Lo. Lost in the chasm between life and death...
026	Have we, too, not already been swallowed up by death?
027	Cut! That line should be...
028	(They're performing...)
029	Mom? I'm home!
030	Hello, Kasumi. I had a phone call from your teacher today.
031	H-huh?
032	Apparently you've been inattentive in class? You really should be listening to your teachers. Your prospects in life are already looking dim enough as it is.
033	You're so clumsy, and quite a bit slow for your age, so you'll need to work at least twice as hard as your other classmates. If you can't even get into university, you'll be sorry. Don't you understand? You're the only one who's going to reap the consequences for your poor efforts, Kasumi.
034	I-I know... I'm sorry, mom.
035	Haa...
036	I wish I could tell her about what I really want to do, but...I just can't.
037	Where is that Phantom? If they don't get here soon, the Demons of Darkness will be upon us, and—!
038	Almost there! I just need to place the Alchemia Capsule here, and...
039	(Voices...?)
040	Please... The fate of this world lies with you!
041	The f-fate of the...world?
042	Wh-where am I?!
043	Who are you?!
