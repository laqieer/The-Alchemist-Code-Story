001	Haaaaa... It looks like that was the last of them.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0030
002	Shenmei, I understand that you wanted to hasten to their aid, but it's dangerous to rush into battle alone.
003	Heheh, sorry! If I see someone in trouble, I just can't help myself!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0035
004	Pishposh! The monsters have been vanquished, and that is good enough. Now, let us commence our intelligence gathering!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0007
005	Hold! You must not enter the village! You did help us out back there, so I really don't want to have to turn you away, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0002
006	This village is currently in quarantine. None may enter or leave.
007	Wh-what?! Why?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
008	I did hear one of the soldiers shout something about taking the infected to the church. Perhaps that has something to do with it.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0001
009	They did? I didn't catch that. Your hearing must be pretty sharp, Gunner.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0006
010	As an adventurer, it is only natural to hone one's senses, in order to prepare oneself for the many dangers one might face.	VO_gunner.gunner_battle_0016
011	Y-yes, of course.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0022
012	So...there are injured here. If they are infected, that would mean that those who enter the village risk contracting whatever malady is afflicting them.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0016
013	Exactly. That's why we have quarantined the village, to prevent the infection from spreading.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0005
014	So that's why... What's wrong with them?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0021
015	Well... It begins with greenish bruises on the skin, and then they get a high fever that just won't go down.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
016	Greenish bruises...? I feel like I have heard of such a phenomenon somewhere before.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0012
017	S-sir! P-please let me go and collect some medicinal herbs! At this rate, my father will—!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
018	I told you, you must not leave the village! We have already sent some soldiers out to search for medicinal herbs!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0014
019	You will just need to wait a little longer.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
020	It will be too late! I can't stand around waiting! I cannot let my father—!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
021	I know, it's taking some time, but they will bring back those herbs! Have faith, and patience!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
022	Nngh... A-all right.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
023	I don't know about you guys, but I want to help these people!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0027
024	Hmm... I am concerned for the people of this village, but we must not forget about the person who called out for help earlier, either.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0016
025	I know, but I can't abandon someone in need!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0020
026	Besides, I know that keeping the infection from spreading is important and all, but not being able to leave the village must be horrible!
027	I agree with Shenmei.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0005
028	You're right. We cannot simply let this go unresolved.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0005
029	Indeed! It is decided. We will assist in gathering the medicinal herbs. We cannot call ourselves adventurers if we abandon these people to search for that voice.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0037
030	Th-thanks, everyone!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0034
031	Have you been listening, soldier? We will take on this herb gathering as a quest!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0004
032	What are you saying? You saved us from the monsters, even though we're complete strangers, and now—!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0013
033	Oh, hush! To help one in need is the role of any adventurer!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0002
034	I... I thank you! Please, help us save this village!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0035
035	That's the spirit! Leave it to us! Come what may, we will complete this quest!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0038
036	Thank you, all of you! On behalf of the people of Babel, I thank you! You're all so kind!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0009
037	When it comes to helping people, one's homeland—or home world—is irrelevant! We are doing what is right, nothing more.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0007
038	Exactly! Besides, if anyone's kind, it's you, Shenmei! You're a really good person!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0005
039	I-I guess? I'm just being myself. Ahahaha!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
040	I always ended up giving away all the treasure I found to people who needed it, and then my crew would laugh at me.
041	I see. You may have been a pirate, but you used your spoils for the benefit of the people.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0044
042	Ah, and if she was a pirate, that makes Shenmei an adventurer as well!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0044
043	I'd love to have an adventure out at sea... Ah! Would you tell us a story of your adventures as a pirate?	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0009
044	I would like to hear, as well.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0005
045	R-really? Okay, let me see... It was a dark and foggy night, and we were headed toward Sleeping Basilisk Island, when—	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
046	I want to hear this story as much as the rest of you, but we've nearly reached the forest.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
047	...lp...
048	Th-that voice!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0025
049	H-he...lp...me...
050	Wh-what?! Why now?!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0025
051	I'm not sure... However, it seems that it is coming from within the forest.	VO_gunner.gunner_battle_0019
052	Indeed. Excellent! We can find the medicinal herbs and the owner of that voice at the same time, completing our quests in one fell swoop!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0004
053	I'm not sure that it will be that easy... However, we will break through!
