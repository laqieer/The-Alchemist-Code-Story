001	Huff... Huff... Huff...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
002	Spica? Are you okay?
003	I-I'm fine, but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
004	Beasts are animals, too. They're only fighting for their survival, same as us.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
005	Oh, Spica...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
006	What, you wanna be buddies with beasts now, too? You've gotta be kidding me!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
007	I...
008	(Spica is strong. Powerful, even. It's not as if she can't fight.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
009	(But she's too kind—and kindness is a form of weakness.)
010	(What am I missing? What needs to happen for Spica to exercise her powers in full?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
011	Um, Corvus? Everything all right?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
012	Hm? Yeah.
013	Let's head back. We should tell the others about the beast's attack—we'll need to be on our guard for a while.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
014	(I don't have time to worry about Spica right now! The real question is how that creature came to be in the forest.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
015	...
016	C'mon, Spica! Let's go!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
017	Coming.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
