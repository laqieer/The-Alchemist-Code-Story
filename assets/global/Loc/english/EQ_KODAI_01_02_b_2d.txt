001	This...is what a battle amongst dragons is like?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
002	The fights I've come to know don't even compare. Such immense magil...and such unmatched physical strength!
003	Conflict among dragons has been known to reshape the very foundations of the world. Those who control the most magil and territory in the end become the victors.
