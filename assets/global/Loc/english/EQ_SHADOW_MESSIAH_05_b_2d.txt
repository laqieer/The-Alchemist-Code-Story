001	Huff... Huff... Huff...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
002	I defeated... myself.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
003	Spica.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
004	Yes, Lord Zahar?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
005	That was excellent.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
006	I-I am humbled by your praise, my lord.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
007	That armor suits you very well.
008	Oh! Th-thank you, my lord!	VO_spica.spica_event_1005
009	It shall serve you faithfully in the final battle to come.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0005
010	Behold! These are the Final Battle Armaments of the Shadow Messiah!
011	Final Battle Armaments? Hm...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
012	Spica, your strength is more apparent to me now than it has ever been before.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
013	Let us call your armor, the Obsidian Jewel...
014	Shusei.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
015	Shusei... is mine?
016	Yes. Ahh, I cannot wait.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
017	M-my lord?
018	I cannot wait to bear witness to the moment in which you charge into battle, clad in that armor, and guide us to the new order!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
019	I-I will! Someday, I will! I swear it!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
020	Good.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
021	(But I never did.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
022	(I failed to uphold my vow, and to remain by Lord Zahar's side.)
023	(I did get stronger, but in the end...)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
024	(I wasn't strong enough to stand by and watch Lord Zahar destroy himself.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
025	(The Shadow Messiah were my family. They were important to me. I cared for them deeply, and yet—)
026	(And yet, in their hour of need, I left them behind. I fled.)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
027	However...
028	(I'm not running away anymore.)
029	(I'm going to do this for her—the person who made me want to live again in this world without Lord Zahar!)	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
030	(This is my answer—the bonds I share and have shared with those I love.)
031	Come on, Shusei. Let's go.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0032
032	We're going to see that vow upheld if it's the last thing we do.
