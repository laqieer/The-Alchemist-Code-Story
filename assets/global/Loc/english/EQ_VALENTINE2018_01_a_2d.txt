001	Wow, that's so much cacao! Is this all the Rainbow type?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0046
002	Yep! You can choose whichever color you like best!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
003	The Rainbow Cacao is also recognized as a powerful magical ingredient in Lustburg!
004	The harvest this year was particularly abundant, so I was able to get my hands on a fairly large quantity of it, but...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
005	Lovely ladies, gather round! Got eyes for a certain someone? Hoping for a little help? The best-selling Rainbow Cacao is back in stock!
006	Raised in the sweltering heat of the desert, this ingredient will bring a burning passion to your love life!
007	Ohmygod! It's that Rainbow Cacao I've been hearing so much about! I'll take one!
008	Me too!!!
009	O-oh, fantastic. Ah, but wait, don't push...! A-ahhhh!
010	...
011	Uh oh... This could be trouble...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
012	It can't be helped around this time of the year. After all, Valentine's Day is a girl's ultimate battlefield!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
013	This is why we were called? I suppose it's our job to restore public order.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
014	I hope you will also consider the protection of Lustburg's dignity a priority as well.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
015	It's a rather delicate situation. Students of the School of Magic have a tendency to get into...mischief.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0041
016	Geez, what's with that? Gives me indigestion... What's wrong with letting loose a little every once in a while?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
017	Valentine's Day is a ridiculous event that encourages rule-breakers to run wild and forget their duties as representatives of the Academy. Besides, chocolates and such aren't even allowed on campus.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
018	Ugh, whatever. What does it even matter? I ate chocolates and sweets all the time while I was in the School of Magic and nothing ever happened.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
019	Excuse me?! As former student president, I am appalled by your behavior! Though...I suppose we have more important things to focus on right now.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
020	So, this is Rainbow Cacao. I'd only ever seen it in books. It's incredible to be able to see it with my own eyes.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0044
021	...And these are the effects of the Rainbow Cacao according to color. Do you understand?
022	Yes, I understand.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
023	Remember the specific qualities each color brings forth. I expect this will appear on the test.
024	That's all for today. Don't forget to review the material we covered today.
025	Nng... Huh? Class is over already?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1003
026	How could you fall asleep again, Emma? The teacher kept looking over here. If you don't focus in class...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
027	I can't help it if the Magical Ingredients class is less exciting than watching water boil. We didn't even get to see the real Rainbow Cacao with our own eyes!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
028	Plus, it's grown near the desert. That's too far from Lustburg to matter to me.
029	Well, you never know, right?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
030	There might be a day when we get to see it for ourselves. Until then, our duty as students is to learn as much as we can about it and everything else.
031	Yes, yes... Nn... I'm so sleepy...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
032	Were you working last night as well? Are you getting enough sleep, Emma?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
033	Eh, don't worry about me. I'll be okay. I've just been staying up later than usual recently. If I muffle my yawns, it's like I'm not even tired! Nn...	VO_emma.emma_chara_1003
034	Oh, you... Don't sleep in the next class too, okay? I won't just let it go this time!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
035	If I remember correctly, it was red for passion, blue for peace, yellow for sincerity, violet for charm, and...wait...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
036	Green cacao for courage, and orange for friendship, right?
037	Brown doesn't do much, but it's supposed to be exceptionally delicious!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
038	Wow, Emma... So you were listening in class that day.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0009
039	Huh? No, you lent me your notebook to study afterwards.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
040	Hm... Is that how it was?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
041	The two of you have always been thick as thieves!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
042	A-anyway, what's with all this security? Even if this is the real Rainbow Cacao, isn't this number of guards overkill?	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
043	To bring all of us out just for this... Do we all really need to be here?
044	True...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0037
045	Ah... Right, I guess it would seem like overkill to someone who's never taken part in this event before.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0011
046	Oh yeah! The two of you still haven't yet seen for yourselves the true terror of the Rainbow Cacao...!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0022
047	Huh?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
048	Grrrrrr!
049	A monster?!
050	Exactly! Here it comes!	VO_porin.porin_battle_0026
