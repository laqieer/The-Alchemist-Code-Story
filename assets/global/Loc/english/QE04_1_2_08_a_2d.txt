001	Wo-wow, what a crowd! Everyone's panicking!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	Ack! At this rate, I can't even tell where the Jam are...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
003	He-help!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0018
004	There! Over there!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
005	Die! You evil soul!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1030
006	Gluuurp...!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0026
007	Whoa! That was so fast...! I wasn't even finished chanting!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
008	Are you okay...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
009	Th-thank you! But...why...?!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0034
010	Why what...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
011	Aren't you from a Tehre faction tribe? Why would you help me?	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0003
012	Why? You don't need to be from the same tribe to help somebody who's being attacked, do you?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
013	So that's what's going on...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
014	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
015	Look. There are numerous individuals who seem to be warriors.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
016	Even if they couldn't defeat the Jam, I was wondering why no one at least tried to help.
017	You're right. What?! Are you saying they didn't help because they're from a different faction?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
018	That's nonsense! Isn't saving someone's life a completely different matter from any dispute between tribes?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
019	It looks like that's not the case here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
020	That's how serious the divisiveness has become.
021	That's terrible!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
022	I don't want to admit it...but this is the current reality of Saga.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
023	...!
