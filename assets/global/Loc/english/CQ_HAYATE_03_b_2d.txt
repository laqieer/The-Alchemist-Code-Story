001	We weren't even the ones who hurt it! It's not listening at all!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0013
002	Seeing its own child hurt has made it lose its mind. I want it to calm down so it'll listen to us, but how do we do that with such a big Ratty?!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0021
003	Oh! The trees! The trees, Hayate! If we climb the trees and try to calm it down from above, maybe it'll buy us some time!	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
004	Right! In that case...	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1009
005	(There should be an old, giant tree near by! If we lead it there, then—!)
006	Oi, over here!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1024
007	Numa!
008	Okay, if it's from this high up... Hyah!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0007
009	Numa?!
010	You did it! You hit it!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
011	Nu...ma...
012	Oh no! Rin, look out!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0019
013	Huh?
014	Grrr, if only I could make it in... Instant Tanuki Teleportation!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0004
015	Whoa!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0020
016	Eeek!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0026
017	R-Rin, are you all right? Sorry about that. I couldn't stop my momentum...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
018	That was so much fun! Was that your technique?! That's amazing!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0008
019	Huh, oh, that's... I guess...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0025
020	It was so cool!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
021	You handled the Ratty situation and saved me! You're so cool!
022	R-really? N-no, I'm not cool or anything.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0007
023	I didn't even think of climbing a tree in the first place.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
024	And it was a fifty-fifty toss up whether my technique was going to work.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
025	Then it was our win together!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
026	Even though I thought of climbing a tree, I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own. And I almost got squished, too.
027	Thank you so much, Hayate.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0034
028	No, thank you. It's thanks to you that things went well.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0034
029	I wasn't annoying?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
030	You're never annoying!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
031	That's good.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
032	Watching you try your best made me want to help you, too. I'm so glad I got to help you!	VO_rin.rin_chara_1024
033	Th-thanks. But I've still got a long way to go.
034	That's not true at all! You were so cool that—whoa!
035	Are you okay?! You're surprisingly clumsy, Rin.	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
036	Hehehe, I did it again. Sometimes my friend gets mad because of it.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0011
037	Be more careful, would you? Sigh...	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
038	I have to get stronger so I can protect her.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0031
039	Hm? Did you say something?
040	N-no, nothing!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1002
041	You really saved my bacon today. I suppose getting help from someone isn't all bad.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0002
042	See!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
043	It feels good to know someone's got your back and getting help allows you do things you couldn't do alone.
044	It's a win-win situation!
045	Heh. Trying it out, I finally see you're right. You're...an amazing person.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0007
046	(What I need right now is not to struggle on my own, but to rely on the right people to guide me on the road to growing stronger.)
047	It's thanks to you that I've made up my mind.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0032
048	Huh?
049	I am going to become a special soldier so I can go with you to the human village.
050	You'll come to the village with me?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
051	Y-yes.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0006
052	Yay! Then we'll be able to hang out there together! And I won't be alone when we go home!
053	This is going to be so fun!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0008
054	No, that's not what I'm saying! I'm not going for fun!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
055	Protecting you... That's why I'm going to get stronger!
