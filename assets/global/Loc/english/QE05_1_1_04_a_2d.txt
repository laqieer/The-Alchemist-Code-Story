001	There is someplace I must go alone. Wait here.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
002	Sure! Oh, but is it okay if I look around a bit?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
003	There are plenty more men like the ones from earlier. It is much too dangerous for a child to wander alone.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
004	Aw, man... Fine.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
005	When I return, we will begin searching for clues about your memory. Wait here until then.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
006	I suppose this is as good a place as any.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
007	You know why I am here. Show yourself.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
008	Well, this shatters my confidence in my powers of subterfuge. Are all the Sephira so sharp?
009	You think too highly of me. We Sephira merely do as Sephiron guides us.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
010	Now you're just rubbing salt into my wounds. I did consider myself one of the more capable among King Narol's spies.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
011	I know what you're here for. Beelzebub, right?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
012	So there have been abnormalities, I see. When can I see the King?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
013	I'd like to say soon, but honestly, your timing could have been better.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0037
014	General Ceclidis of the Third Legion has returned from suppressing the southern rebels.
015	And...? I am not sure I understand the problem.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
016	The politicians of this country are on the brink of being overrun by the military.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
017	This Ceclidis, he's a clever man with a taste for power.
018	Almost half of the council is under his thumb, so King Narol cannot remove him from his position without consequence.
019	I was under the impression King Narol had made significant progress in establishing a separation of state and military.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
020	Well, there are always those who would prefer that things be done differently. Ceclidis is from an ancient noble bloodline, which makes him a perfect candidate for them.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
021	The situation would be simpler if not for this civil war.
022	If the military turned against us right now, this country would collapse. We just have to endure it for now.
023	In other words, even a Sephira cannot be let into the castle until the situation is resolved?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0044
024	The Sacred Stone is the symbol of royal authority. It is King Narol's trump card.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0037
025	We cannot risk Ceclidis getting his hands on the secrets of the stone.
026	How long?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
027	A week at most.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
028	Then I will spend some time enjoying your city. Luckily, I have other matters to attend to.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
029	Please do. I shall contact you when things change.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
030	Oh right, if you're going to be sightseeing, why not check out the Arena?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
031	You should be able to catch the Champion's bout today.
032	Gluttony is in worse shape than I had imagined.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
033	Never mind that. I must focus on my duty, and that alone.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
034	The Arena, huh?
035	Oh boy, am I tired. I don't think I can take another step!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
036	I am not surprised. We ended up making a full round of this city in one day.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
037	The royal capital is overwhelmed with refugees because of the civil war.
038	I was hoping one of them might know something about you, but...
039	I suppose that was wishful thinking.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
040	Maybe... I really was abandoned.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
041	Maybe my family could no longer afford to feed me, and—
042	When I found you, you were injured and exhausted, but there were no signs of starvation.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
043	You were provided with proper meals and well-cared-for.
044	Th-then, why?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0017
045	I do not know, but I am sure your family is still searching for you.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
046	If they are still alive, you mean.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
047	Unfortunately, so.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
048	Great. What am I supposed to do now?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
049	I will... Hm...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
050	Don't worry about it. I will figure it out for myself somehow.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0022
051	I am sorry. I wish I could commit to helping you more, but I am limited in what I can do for you.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
052	I just wish I at least knew where I come from.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
053	Was there anything that caught your eye in the royal capital?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
054	If so, it could be the catalyst we need to spark your memories.
055	Hrm... Well, not really. Oh! I really wanna see the Arena!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
056	The Arena, huh? The royal capital is famous for it. I hear they run a tournament in which gladiators can test their skills.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0044
057	I was told the Champion is fighting today.
058	R-really?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
059	Huh? Yeah?
060	I'm interested! I'm really interested!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
061	I suppose we should leave no stone unturned. Besides, it would be a waste not to see all that the royal capital has to offer.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
062	Yay!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0046
063	Be careful in this crowd, though. If you get lost, then I'll probably have to spend another whole day—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
064	Mister Kamui! C'mon, hurry up!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
065	Didn't that kid just say he was exhausted?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
066	I don't want to leave the question of his care unresolved, but I do have my duty.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
067	I hope he can remember something soon.
068	Wow! Do they really get to fight in such a huge place?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
069	Uh, I guess that's the entrance?
070	Whoa, hold on there, kiddo!
071	Urk?! Uh, what?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
072	If you want to get into the Arena, you gotta buy a ticket.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
073	You have any identification? Where are your parents?
074	Well, um...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
075	No ID and no parents? You're not a runaway slave, are you?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
076	Of course not! I'm here with my brother, but we got separated!
077	Th-there he is! Mi—Kamui!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
078	Hisham? What's going on? What's with the yelling?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
079	Are you this kid's brother?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
080	Oh... I see.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
081	He is indeed my brother. Do you need some identification? Would this work?
082	Yup, that works. Sorry kid, didn't mean to scare you.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
083	You've chosen the right day to visit the Arena! Our Champion, Teona, is in today's title match! Have fun!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
084	Th-Thank you.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0034
085	I told you to be careful, did I not?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
086	Yes...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
087	To be honest, I do not approve of how familiar you are getting with me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
088	Ka— Mister Kamui? You mean...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
089	You are trying to regain your memory and find your family.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
090	It would be better not to get too close. I'm not your family. We just happen to be sharing the same path at the moment.
091	Do not give up. Your family is fine, and you will see them again.
092	Believe in that or you will never find them.
093	That's... Yeah, you're right.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
094	However, it is fine for me to be your "brother" while we are here, since we did tell the ticket vendor so.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
095	Really? Okay!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
096	Oh, hey! Kamui, look! The gladiators are lining up to—hey!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
097	Uh-oh.
098	You?! What are you jerks doing here?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
099	The ones that attacked us before...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
100	I didn't know this guy was a gladiator. My image of gladiators just got ruined.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0010
101	You loudmouthed brat! You picking a fight with me?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
102	This is the last straw! You two will make the perfect warm up before my title match!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0013
