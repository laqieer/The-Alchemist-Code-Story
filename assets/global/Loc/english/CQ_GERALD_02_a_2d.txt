001	That was easier to deal with than I expected.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
002	If such a simple matter had taken us any longer, then we would have tarnished the name of the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
003	Hahaha, okay. But you know, that was a bit unexpected.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
004	Vettel is one thing, but for you to decide to stay behind yourself and fight alone...
005	...
006	Here, we swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!
007	Abandoning those clearly in need of our help would go against our creed to ensure the joy and laughter of the people.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
008	That's all.
009	It always amazes me how you and Vettel are so steadfast in your beliefs.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
010	Why? Even you must have strong convictions of your own.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
011	Eh. Nah.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
012	What are you talking about? Vettel saw that in you. There's no way that any member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doesn't have their own beliefs to fight for.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
013	Well, I don't. I don't really believe in any of that stuff.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
014	What...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0026
015	Are you saying that all of your actions up until now have been without any sort of purpose?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0003
016	Why do you have to say it like that? Like I said, I don't have what I don't have. Oh, look! We can see the city up ahead!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
017	Vice-Captain! Ren! I am glad to see you have made it safely!
018	How are things here?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
019	There was a brief scuffle, but there has been no further movement in the desert. In addition, we have not encountered any issues thus far in the reorganization of the city guard.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0037
020	We have an emergency! The Commander's daughter has been abducted!
021	We had our eyes on the desert, but then we got caught from behind! Damn it!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
022	This city's got more problems than one. It's a mistake to assume it was the desert ruffians that did this.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
023	I'd like to inspect the daughter's room. Come on, Ren.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
024	Yeah, yeah.
025	This is it. It was in this state by the time we realized she was gone...
026	It looks like someone ransacked this place.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
027	Hm... This coat of arms... Is this what the ruffians have on their flags?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
028	Would they really just blatantly leave incriminating evidence laying around like this?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
029	Look at these footprints. This is soil. You don't really see much of that in the desert.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0002
030	Are you saying that it's the bandits from the mountains trying to frame the desert ruffians and turn us against them?	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0031
031	How likely might it be that the desert ruffians are deliberately trying to frame the bandits?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0001
032	Eh. It's easy to fake a coat of arms if you know what it looks like. Soil is harder to replicate.
033	There were no reports of any movement in the desert, right? How could they sneak past your people into the mountains before we got here? In fact, how would they have known whether or not we were coming?
034	How are we gonna do this, Gerald? These guys don't seem too clever. The two of us should be enough to take them.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
035	If it's as you say, then the desert ruffians likely have nothing to do with this kidnapping.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
036	We'll keep eyes on them for now, just in case.
037	Meanwhile, I'll make my way to where the bandits are camping out. Ren and I will bring back the Commander's daughter.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
038	Understood!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0037
039	Huh... You believed what I said?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0027
040	Your conclusions were sound.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0003
041	Is that the second nice thing you've said to me, Gerald? Be still my heart!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
042	Heh heh... Scarlet Flame Guard, huh? Whatever. Just another bunch of worthless knights. As long as this starts a fight between them and those desert scabs...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
043	Once it does, we'll take that city. That girl is key to our plan, so make sure you don't hurt her too bad, all right?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
044	Let go of her, villains!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
045	They've come after us?! How could they figure it out so fast?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
046	Well, well, caught red-handed. Let's not make this difficult. Give us the girl.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0009
047	In your dreams! Come on, hurry up!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
048	Hold it right there!
049	Whoa there. Hold on a minute, Gerald!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
050	Traps...?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
051	Duh. No self-respecting band of bandits doesn't have a defense mechanism or twenty to defend their territory.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
052	We have no choice. We'll just have to dodge them as we go!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0037
053	Roger that!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
054	More traps? This is getting ridiculous. I didn't actually think they'd have this many.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0028
055	We're approaching the summit. We'll be at a disadvantage on lower ground comparatively... The hostage makes this tricky, too.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
056	Then why don't I go around the back and rescue the daughter first? That'll make it easier for you to maneuver, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
057	If you can do that, I'll attack them head-on to draw their attention.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
058	Just remember that saving a hostage under such heavy guard isn't going to be easy, even for someone with your abilities.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0003
059	Was that a compliment?! Ahem, right. We've got our plan, let's do this. See you on the other side!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
060	Hmph, he's pretty quick...	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
061	Now it's my turn to show what I can do...
