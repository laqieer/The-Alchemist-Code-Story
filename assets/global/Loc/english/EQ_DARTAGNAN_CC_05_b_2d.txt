001	Haaahh!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0032
002	Too slow. I'm a therian, remember? Hyaah!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
003	Aghhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
004	D'Artagnan, watch out!	VO_yura.yura_battle_0019
005	...? There's nothing there... Why?
006	Ngh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
007	Courage?!
008	Phew... That was a close one.	VO_courage.courage_chara_1007
009	Indeed. As skilled as always, though.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
010	You...saved us? Why are you here?
011	I am the mercenary Courage. I've been hired to rescue the therians that have been taken. With me is...	VO_courage.courage_sys_0006
012	Inquisitor Cheryl of the Holy Order of Babel.
013	These people are under suspicion for the use of illegal Alchemy. They were persons of interest previously in my investigation as an inquisitor.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0022
014	Unfortunately, they fled before we could complete our investigation, hiding in these ruins and putting up a barrier.
015	Just when we were wondering what our next step should be, we heard that Envylian Knights would be breaching the barrier. We thought we'd come along for the ride.
016	We were quite surprised by your strength, but it made things easy for us. Thank you for your help.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
017	You should thank D'Artagnan! She was the one who borrowed the cannon and broke through the barrier.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0031
018	Huh?! But it's thanks to you that we found this place! You should get the credit!
019	But I think that you...
020	I see. It seems this mission succeeded thanks to you both taking advantage of your individual talents.	VO_courage.courage_sys_0044
021	I've come to expect nothing less from the knights of Envylia.
022	I'm glad you've found a way to use your strength for good.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
023	...!
024	Whoa, what's wrong, Yura? Your tail is going crazy!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
025	The captured therians have been released. The ruins have been sealed and the extremist members have been apprehended without issue.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
026	All research relating to the Shadow Messiah has been confiscated.
027	We will now continue our investigation into the Lustburg research and search for any remnants of the group while cooperating with the Envylian knights.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
028	Understood. I expect things to go smoothly thanks to our friendly relationship with Envylia.
029	This puts to rest a thorn that has been in our side for years. We have the knights of Envylia to thank for finally driving them out into the open.
030	That D'Artagnan... She's quite something. I suppose I should've expected as much from the Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
031	She was not acting alone. The Envylians have many superb knights.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
032	Philosopher's Stones... Demons... Sounds like we're going to have our hands full.
033	Sticking their necks into things they don't understand... The Scarlet Flame Guard are quite troublesome.
034	...?
035	Ah, that's right. Speaking of the Envylian knights...
036	I've heard a couple of therian knights will be performing a war dance at a parade soon. Why don't you go see it?
037	I believe it's someone named D'Artagnan and—
038	Hyah!	VO_yura.yura_battle_0007
039	Hup!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0004
040	It's been a while, but we work together as well as always, huh?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
041	Yes!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0007
042	Practicing, are we?
043	Captain!
044	I wasn't sure what I was going to do when you said no at first. I'm glad you changed your mind.
045	Why the change of heart?
046	I just thought that I should do whatever I can if I can do it.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0031
047	We may have solved this case, but other things like it may happen. Not to mention all the other dangers out there.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0016
048	That's why I want lots of different kinds of people to become a knight of Envylia.
049	I thought that maybe my war dancing could help get people interested in joining. Besides—
050	I'd like for everyone in the village to see my abilities. See that I've found a good place to lend my strength.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0001
051	I see. You were a troublesome pup, but it seems that I no longer need to worry about you.
052	Captain...
053	Now be honest, you really just like performing with D'Artagnan, isn't that right?
054	Captain! I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0029
055	Your tail is wagging.
056	Huh?	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
057	It is! Your tail is so cute!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
058	Th-this isn't what it looks like!
059	Waaaah!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0026
060	Ehehe! I like performing with you too! I'm so glad we get to do it together again!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0008
061	D'Artagnan...
062	I'm glad, too.
063	All right! Let's give it one more go!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1018
064	Right!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0007
