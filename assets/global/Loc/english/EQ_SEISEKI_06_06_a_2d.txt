001	There was a rebellion among the Holy Guard, and Zain got murdered...
002	That's the only thing I had heard, so I was convinced that the new Lord Commander must have been responsible for that.
003	So, you aren't the one who killed Zain then?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
004	Right, Kanon was not responsible, and neither in Captain Cadanova's case. He wished for it himself...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
005	But... it's true that I bear responsibility in both their deaths.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
006	It's a fact that I wasn't able to stop Captain Kudanstein when it happened.
007	Captain Cadanova also died because... I couldn't help to avoid it.
008	But that's just in hindsight, isn't it? Kanon, I'm sure you don't deserve a single blame in this.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
009	...
010	I had made a faulty judgment. What can I say... I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions without making sure myself.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0035
011	It's okay.<br>It can't be helped that you made that conclusion.
012	But... who would have thought that Master Yogi Ku had passed away...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
013	Does that mean we'll have to give up on Excalibur's restoration?
014	Couldn't Miuna have inherited her father's craftsmanship?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
015	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
016	Nimul, who in ancient times laid eyes on the world on the other side of the Door of Truth...
017	ended up destroying the Grand Excelsior, and the Tower of Babel on his return to our world.
018	It is said that the Sacred Sword Excalibur was forged from the raw materials of the tools used by Nimul.
019	Huh?<br>What are you talking about, so suddenly?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
020	And from those ancient times, the Tribe of Ku passed on this craftsmanship from generation to generation.
021	I highly doubt that Yogi Ku wouldn't have passed on such an important thing on to the next generation.
022	I see!<br>So, Miuna!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
023	It's true that I've inherited his craftsmanship. It's in my blood.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
024	As I thought!<br>So, does that mean...!
025	Wait a moment.<br>It's true that I have the ability to restore Excalibur...
026	but whether I'll do it or not, that's a different question.
027	What do you mean?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
028	I only ever intended to maintain Excalibur for Zain.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
029	I never intended to restore Excalibur for any other owner. I'm sorry.
030	Huh?! But... she inherited Excalibur from Lord Zain, you know?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
031	Wait, Chloe. You don't mean to maintain it if it isn't in Lord Zain's possession anymore?
032	That means that Lord Zain must have been very precious to you, wasn't he?
033	...
034	Would you mind if I asked you about your connection with Lord Zain?
035	This place is pretty big, isn't it?
036	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
037	Yes, it's so big that it would make a good training hall.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
038	Exactly. Whenever I'm here, I feel as if I can still hear them breathing.
039	Zain and Cadanova...<br>they used to spar here.
040	Huh?<br>Lord Zain and Lord Cadanova? Here?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
041	Whenever they were waiting for Excalibur to be restored, they would spar against each other right here.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
042	In a way, this place was something like their secret sparring ground.
043	I see! So you must have learned their abilities from watching them here!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0044
044	I suppose so.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
045	It was also here that I met them for the first time.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
046	When I was a child, they always interacted with me without showing any annoyance.
047	...!
048	I really used to enjoy watching the two of them competing against each other so intensely.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
049	Since I didn't have any siblings, they were like my two older brothers.
050	I see...
051	I'm sorry.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
052	...?
053	Just because I wasn't strong enough, you lost two precious people...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
054	How did such a crybaby become the Lord Commander, hm?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
055	Huh?
056	However much you may mourn, you can never go back to the past.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
057	If you don't show a little bit of dignity, I won't be able to approve of you as the Lord Commander.
058	...!<br>Does that mean...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
059	None other than Zain and Cadanova gave you their approval, right?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
060	If that's so, I'll at least need to listen to your plea.
061	Miuna!
062	However, in order to restore Excalibur, I do have a single condition.
063	A condition?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
064	I want you to kill the one who killed Zain. This man named Kudanstein.
065	If you can promise me that, then I don't mind giving Excalibur a try.
066	Huh?!
