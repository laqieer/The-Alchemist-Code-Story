001	Hmmm, some appear to be missing. Where could they be?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0016
002	Nu, numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
003	Numaaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0002
004	Wow, they're all standing in a line. Incredible. Only the beast tamer known as the Empress could pull that off.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0044
005	I don't really like that nickname.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0029
006	I think it's wonderful. Everyone knows your power is the real deal, and that's why they give you a nickname that commands so much respect.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
007	Even so...	VO_merda.merda_sys_0022
008	Melda, do you know what Hozuki means in the language of flowers?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0001
009	No.
010	It means...impostor.
011	...
012	It may be that this meaning comes from how big the flower appears, while the fruit it bears is so tiny.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0030
013	A deceptive appearance... Empty... Fake. All of these concepts are represented by the hozuki in flower language.
014	I always wondered why my father chose that name for me.
015	Was it because I have no substance? Because I'm empty?
016	I never asked him. I was too scared to know the answer.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0042
017	Hozuki...
018	Ultimately, I suppose I just keep running from the language of flowers.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0030
019	If my exterior is vibrant and shiny, then perhaps it will hide the emptiness inside of me.
020	Was your father really that kind of man?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0002
021	...
022	I've always raised my animals lovingly, the best I can.
023	It seems to me that you've been raised just as lovingly.
024	...
025	I think that maybe your father's true motive for choosing to give you that name may differ from what you believe.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0007
026	His true motive...
027	Oh! Those're...!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0025
028	They're the other Rattys we couldn't find earlier!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0042
029	Wait, isn't that the way back to town?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0006
030	Numa! Numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0020
031	Oh, so that's what they're up to.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0016
032	What? What is it?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0006
033	We really want to participate in Halloween, so we'll sneak into town, numa! If we sneak in, no one will know, numa!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
034	That's what it said.
035	It said all that in what sounded like two short mewls?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0025
036	But...if we sneak them in and the townspeople find out, then it'll cause big problems!
037	That's true. We may need to re-education them some so that things don't go poorly.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
