001	...!
002	Where are we? And why am I...?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
003	I'm sorry, Celis. but our time is short. I know this is sudden, and—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0035
004	Wait! Are you...Logi?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
005	!!!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
006	I knew it. Unbelievable! Look how much you've grown!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0026
007	How could you tell?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
008	How could I not?! He's my precious son... But, my dear Logi, why are you here? How are you here?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
009	...
010	I'll try to keep it brief.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
011	So...you entered the dagger's inner world in order to have me teach you Kagutsuchi?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
054	It boggles the mind. The ancient belief that all things possess a soul is actually true! And it's through the soul of this dagger that you were able to summon me, as well!
012	It is quite a development. And Logi is here to offer his aid in restoring peace to Wadatsumi once more.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
013	Thank you so much, Logi. Though I must also apologize for dragging you into this.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
014	O-oh... It's quite all right. Really.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
015	But you're right; time really is short. We'd best get this started. Draw your weapon, son! Huzzaaaaah!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0032
016	Wh-whoa...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
017	I truly do pale in comparison to you, Celis. You're on another level altogether.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
018	Oh? That just tells me you've been neglecting your training! You should easily be able to manage attacks like this by now, Amane.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0012
019	Training is, after all, one of the tenets of everyday life. And those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.
020	...!
021	Hmm? Did I say something strange?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
022	Just thinking that's a good creed to live by. And that it's even better when you hear it firsthand.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
023	I'm glad you approve! But now is hardly the time to be struck with admiration.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
024	Rather, it's time to train you in the sacred art of Kagutsuchi!
025	Understood!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
026	Oho!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
027	You're still too open in the moments before you strike. Consider your form to be the springboard for the following slash. You can't get caught up in it, or else you'll lose that initial spark.
028	Ah!
029	Celis?!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
030	Nothing like a real fight to polish up your skills, eh? You've got this, Logi.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
031	I have. Just like my father, the Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, and my mother, the Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
032	Their blood runs through me...as does that of the Wadatsumi royal family.
033	This blood of mine tells of countless wishes, and an astounding lineage that spans much of the known world. And thus far, I'd known all of that, but I had yet to truly feel it.
034	Through this training, I will find my path. I will find the burden that I am supposed to bear.
035	Because until I do, I cannot rightfully inherit those wishes.
036	What a lovely answer! You've grown into a truly dependable young man any mother would be proud of.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
037	Haaaaaaaaaah!
038	Celis truly is amazing, and not just in terms of swordsmanship. She sized up Logi in an instant, and knew just how to guide him!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
039	I still have such a long way to go before I'm even worthy of being mentioned in the same breath.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
040	Amane! What are you doing slacking off over there? Come! Join the fray!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0012
041	M-me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
042	All I see is my dear Amane trying to skip her training again, and that will never do! You need to grow stronger too, after all.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
043	I'm counting on you to defend Wadatsumi in my place, you know!
044	Yeah, come on over, Amane! Let's see what you've got!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
045	O-okay! Hyaaaaaaaah!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
046	There we go! Now things are getting interesting! I'll take on both of you at once!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
047	Hyaaaaaah!
048	Are you watching, Lady Mitsuha? It hasn't quite become the Wadatsumi you and my parents hoped for, but it's well on its way.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
049	Your descendants are fighting desperately to return this land to its former glory.
050	That alone is something to celebrate.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
051	And looking at them now, I know that Amane and Logi can do it. They have it within them to restore Wadatsumi back to the way it once was.
052	I'm sure of it!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
053	Hyaaaaaaaah!
