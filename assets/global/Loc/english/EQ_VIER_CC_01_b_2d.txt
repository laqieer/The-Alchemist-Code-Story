001	It has been so long since I've dreamed of anything.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
002	(I haven't been able to sleep well enough to dream lately.)
003	Let us take in the night air.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0030
004	Silently... Just like all the rest...
005	In this frozen time, there are none to hear the sounds of chilled wind, the snow crunching underfoot, or the screams.
006	Let sleep come!
007	Quietly and comfortably, until the end...!
008	One set of footfalls. One cry, raised in the silence.
009	A horrible dream that should never come true.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
010	I can't sleep. Not even here.
011	Ephylinde?! Ephylinde, where are you?!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
012	Princess Ainanna...?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
013	Where have you gone?! Ephylinde?! Please, no! Where are you?!
014	Princess Ainanna?!
015	Ephylinde! There you are! Thank goodness!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0022
016	Is everything all right, Your Highness? Why are you out so late?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0002
017	You weren't in your bedroom, so... Hehehehe, I just got so scared. I thought you left.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0011
018	Rest assured, Your Highness. I am here.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
019	Besides, you have both the King and Queen, your parents, with you.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0031
020	I...can no longer rely on my parents.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0029
021	Oh...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0008
022	I can't sleep, Ephylinde.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
023	What is the matter?
024	I had a nightmare. I was alone, screaming among swarming insects...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
025	...!
026	I've been having this same dream night after night.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
027	The village I worked so hard to protect...burned and lost. There, I'm alone.
028	There is no one there... I'm all alone!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0029
029	Ephylinde...?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
030	I, too, had a nightmare.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0031
031	You did as well, Ephylinde?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0005
032	Insomnia is difficult, isn't it?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
033	I had hoped something would change with you here.
034	I honestly believed I would be able to have pleasant dreams...but I can't.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0027
035	I saw the end of a nation blanketed in snow. I was frightened by the thought of spring approaching. I shivered at the prospect.
036	Ephylinde...?
037	Yes. I am here.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
038	Mmm...
039	I shall remain like this till we lull into sleep.
040	Just...don't...go.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
