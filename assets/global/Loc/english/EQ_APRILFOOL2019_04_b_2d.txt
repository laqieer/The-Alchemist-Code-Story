001	Aaaaaagh!
002	S-stop! Please, stop!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0028
003	I'll never forgive you, Sabareta!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
004	Sabareta, don't!
005	Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll make it to Valderik! That is our resolve!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
006	Don't involve Agatha in your selfish, twisted resolve!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0011
007	Stop, Dias! Please! Don't hurt him!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
008	Tsk! Get out of the way, Agatha!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
009	Their revolt gave birth to countless tragedies! Are you going to divert your eyes from this truth?!
010	I haven't diverted my eyes! I've turned them towards the future, and this is the conclusion I've reached!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0043
011	This is the answer I came up with that will lead the world to peace. If we can work together with them, we can stop the cycle of sorrow!
012	Agatha, you... You don't have a crush on this guy, do you?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
013	Huh?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
014	What is he talking about?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0006
015	Sabareta, you dare approach my sister?! Come on, Agatha. We're going home.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
016	D-Dias...?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0016
017	I've been away from you for too long. I'm about to run out of my Agatha-reserves.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
018	Dias, what are you saying?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0031
019	I'm your big brother! It's about time you started treating me like one!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
020	This is getting weird.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0030
021	What's wrong with this kid?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
022	None of your concern!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
023	I will not allow you to be Agatha's boyfriend! You are not worthy!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
024	B-boyfriend? Where did that come from?!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0025
025	Shut up! You are not worthy!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0009
026	When she was little, Agatha once said that she'd only want a boyfriend as strong as me!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0045
027	I never said that!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0030
028	You and your skewed bandanna will never be good enough for her! I bet your mother made that armor for you, you useless meat sack!
029	Are you trying to insult me?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0026
030	What are you doing?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
031	Lord Gabirond, don't tell me you're after Agatha as well!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
032	What? Of course not!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0025
033	Oh, really? Don't think I can't see the deceit lurking in your eyes!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
034	(What is wrong with him? He believed everything I said earlier, but now that his sister's involved, he's suddenly paranoid.)
035	This is all Agatha's doing. She is far too charming for her own good!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0045
036	Dias, you're freaking me out.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0031
037	I bet none of you knew that Agatha loves cats.
038	You know what else?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
039	You might expect the color of the wallpaper in her room to be pink, but it's actually pale blue.
040	Her charm doesn't end there. She is the best cook I know, she can fold clothes like no other, and her shampoo is the best-smelling stuff around!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
041	This is...bordering on crazy.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0028
042	How can you endanger your daughter to achieve your own ends? Whatever your reasons may be...I will not allow Agatha to be caught up in the ravages of war!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
043	You've got it wrong! Becoming the representative of the Wratharis Dominion was my own—	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
044	Shut up, Agatha!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0015
045	You don't know what father is really like!
046	What...?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
047	I saw it for myself! Father was feverishly deleting his browser history!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
048	Argh!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0020
049	But...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
050	There is also footage of him wiping his booger on a restaurant tablecloth!
051	Y-you saw me doing that?!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0029
052	But that's not all!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
053	There's more?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
054	Father is not just some idol groupie...
055	He's seriously trying to get romantically involved with one of the group's members!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
056	This... This is too much!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0021
057	You were my hero, a knight who I looked up to! I was proud to call you my father!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0021
058	I cannot stand by and watch anymore as you deceive others and pursue the path of treason!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
059	Father...please, open your eyes! Or else, I will have to cut you down!
060	Do it, Dias!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0032
