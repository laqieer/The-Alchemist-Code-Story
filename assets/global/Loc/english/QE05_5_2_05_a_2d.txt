001	O founding powers of darkness, devour the codes of compassion and ancient order. Let out your first cry in this new age!
002	Nngh... Aah...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0018
003	Now, rise! Rise! Rise!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
004	Aah... Aaaagh!	VO_mary.mary_battle_0019
005	Stop that! Now!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0015
006	Wh-what?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
007	Your skills are quite threatening, but we do have our means of dealing with them.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
008	For example; your blade, enhanced with alchemy and supposedly able to cut through anything...
009	Huzzah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
010	Wh-what? How?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
011	Hahaha! A blade is useless if it cannot hit its mark!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
012	...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
013	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
014	It's useless! This stone seals the souls of your comrades turned to the Jam within it!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0007
015	Without the power of purification, the Jam cannot be eradicated, and the power of purification cannot harm me! There is nothing you can do!
016	Don't be so sure! Kamui!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
017	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0004
018	What?!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0025
019	Shadow Excelsior! Let your chaotic gale snuff out the light!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_battle_0001
020	Tch! He blocked it!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
021	Hm, so you spread that troublesome chemical that can wither the Jam with the wind.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0044
022	I never expected lime, imported by my country, to be used against me like this...
023	But did you really think such cheap tricks could fell me?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0010
024	You seem to be threatened enough to take defensive measures, though.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0001
025	Hmph!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_battle_0022
026	Do you still believe things are the same as before?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
027	I was powerless against you back then, but now I can defeat you!
028	Know your place, peasant!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0013
029	Huzzaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0032
030	Grrraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0032
031	You've aged, Ceclidis! Your head is mine!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
032	I cannot let you destroy this vessel just yet.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0001
033	Tch!
034	I will be your next opponent!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
035	Here we go, Kamui!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
036	Right! We end it here!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
