001	How--How could you forget? Everything the humans have done to us--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
002	…You!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
003	I won't forget so easily!
004	Someday…he'll reveal his true character!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
005	…What's gotten into you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
006	…Do you honestly plan to make peace?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
007	Do you think it wise to fight now--when you are overcome with emotion and exhaustion--for the sake of our race?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
008	I don't. But…the thought of joining forces with humans--
009	Even I have doubts as to their true intentions. However…their proposal is a reasonable one. That is all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
010	…
011	Where are you off to?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
012	I need to know Kaede's true feelings.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
013	You witnessed her resolve, did you not? That was your answer.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
014	…But
015	Your rashness could reignite the flames of war… Are you still intent on going?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
016	…
017	Such thoughtless indiscretion. It seems you still suffer from shortsightedness.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
018	…But, my sister…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
019	You cannot coddle her forever!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
020	…!
021	Even that human, Koga, made his decision in good faith… Where do you stand?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
022	You cling to your sister and the past--Carrying your grudge, you refuse to look ahead. Why can't you see? Only you remain caught in the past.
023	I'm--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
024	Kaede expressed her conviction. What will you do?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
025	I…
026	Such thoughtless indiscretion. What would Kaede think if she saw you now?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
027	…!
028	I…won't remain caught in the past.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
029	…That's right. The first step has been taken…
030	Now, Tamba…show me how you plan to follow through--	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
