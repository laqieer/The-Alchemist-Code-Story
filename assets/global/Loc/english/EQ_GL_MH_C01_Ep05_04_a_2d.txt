001	Well, at least we made it out safely and didn't get thrown in jail.
002	That would be scarier than the beasts...
003	We can't go back there, though. Not unless we want to be caught again.
004	Smiling mischievously, Minerva produces a small vial of crimson liquid from her bag.
005	Teacher, is that...?
006	A blood sample from the savage beasts. At the very least, we should be able to ascertain the level of Alchemia particles in their body.
007	Minerva pulls out her supplies and begins her work. A small while later, her jewel begins to glow brightly.
008	Whoa, that can't be good.
009	Oh, my. This is comparable to the sample my colleague sent me!
010	Given how savagely they were fighting before, I wouldn't be surprised if some of their blood managed to seep into the earth.
011	Definitely not contamination from the samples, then.
012	That squad that marched us out... Seemed a bit too well-prepared and excessive for a patrol.
013	It's too much of a coincidence for them to be there.
014	Those guards are definitely aware of what's going on in the forest.
015	What should we do now? I think we observed all we could back there.
016	If the squad's there for a reason, now's our best time to check out what they're up to.
017	I agree. Sundown's in about half an hour. I don't think they'll be expecting us again quite so soon.
018	Fairly said. Shall we?
019	Everyone ready? It's probably going to get dark out real quick, but we can't use lights or they'll see us.
020	Stay close and be extra careful where you step.
021	OW!
022	Idiot! I told you to move quickly, not clumsily!
023	...! Did you hear that?
024	Yeah. Move over a little. Watch it, don't fall.
025	(Hehe... It's so comfortable leaning on Sieg.)
026	Well, if it isn't our dear Captain from before.
027	Ugh. What a nasty dent. This better not be damaged...
028	Hurry up, we're late. The rest of you, make sure no one is following us.
029	Aye sir!
030	I wonder what's in the boxes. Looks... heavy.
031	Guess we'll have to find out. But first, let's take care of the guys bringing up the rear.
