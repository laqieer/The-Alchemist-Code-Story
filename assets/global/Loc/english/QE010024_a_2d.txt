001	Ack! The rebel army has already breached the castle!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
002	Agatha, do not get separated from us! Let's go, Logi!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
003	O-okay!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
004	Sir Logi! Sir Dias! Wratharis soldiers appeared out of nowhere, and the castle has fallen into a state of chaos!
005	And the evacuation of the citizens?!
006	The women and children, along with the elders, have already been evacuated from within the castle to the square in front of the Convent. They are under the protection of the guards!
007	All right! Take Agatha to the Convent!
008	Agatha, inspire courage within the citizens!
009	Where are the two of you going?!
010	We're headed to the castle, of course! King Patrick is in danger. Let's go!
011	Wa-wait!
012	Tsk. What?!
013	Both of you, don't do anything foolish! Promise me you'll come back safely!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
014	Of course, we will. Don't worry about us.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
015	We promise we'll come back safely. Let's go, Dias!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0006
016	Oh God, protect those two.
