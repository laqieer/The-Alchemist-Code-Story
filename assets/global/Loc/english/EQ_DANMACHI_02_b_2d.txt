001	Demons all scattered about... Something smells real fishy here.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
002	You need to be more careful! This really isn't the time for bravado like that, Ila.
003	Just stay out of my way! I don't need protection from the likes of you; I can handle myself just fine!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0003
004	You were in danger, though.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
005	I would've been fine on my own! You've got some nerve thinking you have some say in whether I need help or not...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
006	Okay, okay. Let's all take a deep breath, now.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0014
007	No one got hurt, right? So it all worked out just fine in the end.
008	Hmph!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
009	The way Bell fights, it's easy to tell he's got his friends in mind at all times.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
010	Sure, maybe he started out his adventure with impure motives, but those moves don't lie:
011	He's someone who cares for his friends, and that's his primary motivation now. There's no doubt in my mind about that.
012	Kevin...! Thank you.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0033
013	Aspiring to be an adventurer means aspiring to be a hero, too. I also learned that from listening to my grandpa...for whatever that may be worth.
014	This grandpa of yours must've been a big influence on you, from how it sounds.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
015	He was. But after he passed away, I was left all alone.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
016	All alone...
017	The person who took me in after that, and treated me like family on top of it all, is my goddess.
018	To be honest with you, my reason for becoming an adventurer is still...something I aspire to. But now that I am one, it's not my only goal anymore.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0006
019	Meeting Lili, having Welf and Mikoto lend me their strength... I've grown so much closer to everyone as time went on.
020	I was even able to rescue Haruhime. I was able to push myself to fight even harder for the sake of others.
021	Everyone in my Familia is someone I think of as family, and I want more than anything to protect them.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
022	Not to mention my goddess, Hestia. I want to protect her, too. Especially after bungling the job before.
023	I just wasn't strong enough on my own, and I wound up causing trouble for everyone instead.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0030
024	I was disappointed in myself, so I decided I'd try to get stronger. No... I swore that I would get stronger! No matter what!
025	Ila, I'm sure you think the worst of me after hearing my reason for becoming an adventurer, but I want you to at least see me for the person I've become, not the person I was at the beginning.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
026	...I can't stand you.
027	Ila...
028	I can't stand you. But I get it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
029	I don't know your friends, but you clearly have their support, and they have yours.
030	I wanted to get stronger too... Strong enough that I could do everything on my own.
031	But that's not how things work.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
032	...
033	You need other people to rely on. You need...friends.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
034	Ooh! So does this mean you've made up, now, and we're all friends again?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
035	We're not friends!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
036	That's what you say. But I bet somewhere deep down, you actually do think of me as one, don't you?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
037	Grrr!
038	I can't stand you! You're the worst!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
039	Haha. Well, Bell, it looks like you've redeemed yourself after all!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
040	Except I think she dislikes you more than ever now...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
