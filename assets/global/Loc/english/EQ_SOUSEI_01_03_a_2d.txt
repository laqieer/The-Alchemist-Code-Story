001	Wait... You're his little sister?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
002	That's right. Nimul is my elder brother.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
003	Oh, uh... So that's how it is.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
004	Moreover, Lady Emmel is the Vessel of Purification of our generation.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
005	The Vessel of Purification, huh?
006	She is the most noble of us all.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
007	Please take care that you do not forget this, visitor.
008	If you should attempt any funny business, any at all...
009	I-I wasn't gonna! I swear!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
010	Julia, don't be like that. He is our guest.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0013
011	Julia...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
012	L-Lord Nimul...!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
013	Emmel's back home for the first time in a while.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
014	I'd prefer it if we didn't stand on ceremony.
015	Y-yes, of course. My sincere apologies...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
016	You know, Julia, maybe you should go home once in a while.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
017	I-I... I couldn't. I am the Vessel's Shield. I must protect Lady Emmel at all times!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
018	I cannot afford to leave her side, even for a moment.
019	...
020	Unless... If you would prefer to be alone as a family, then I will, of course, take my leave.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
021	That's not what I'm saying. I just...
022	Stop it, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
023	Julia has her duty, and I have mine.
024	I didn't come here just to relax, you know.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0029
025	I came back for the Godwolf Ceremony.
026	I will fulfill the duty which I have been tasked with since birth...
027	As the Vessel of Purification.
028	...
029	It's just like you said. This is my way.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
030	Emmel... Let's go away together, somewhere far away from here.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
031	What are you saying? The Godwolf Ceremony is tomorrow. It can only be conducted once every three years, and it's the rite that will ordain me as the Vessel of Purification.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
032	We can't afford to just...get up and leave!
033	That's exactly why I want to go. I don't want you to become the Vessel of Purification.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
034	Nimul, have you lost your mind?! If I don't become the Vessel, what will happen to the village? To the Sephira?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
035	How long do you think it would take for the corruption of sin to devour them all?
036	Is that what you want, Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
037	I...
038	I know you worry for me, but it's going to be all right. After all, I'll have Julia by my side.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
039	I must admit that I declined her company at first, but she persisted. Heheh... She can be quite stubborn.
040	Emmel... Please reconsider. No matter how you look at it—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
041	Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
042	But...
043	I was born to be the Vessel of Purification.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
044	But that's—!
045	That's just how it is.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
046	That's just the way I am.
047	Oh, my! It's the Vessel of Purification!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
048	Today marks the birth of a new Vessel!
049	Please, o Vessel... Save us! Save this land from corruption!
050	...
051	Hey, Nimul... Your little sister just became the Vessel of Purification.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
052	Shouldn't you be happy for her?
053	Why...would I be happy?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
054	Hmph. Why this? Why that? Will your questions never cease?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
055	Voicing every doubt that crosses your mind is a bad habit of yours, Nimul.
056	...
057	As of today, Emmel is the Vessel of Purification, and Julia is the Vessel's Shield, her protector.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
058	You are now the commander of the Sephira Guard, and I am your deputy.
059	This is how things were decided. This is the way of our world.
060	The way of our world... This isn't—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
061	Hooraaaaaaaaaaay!
062	Today is a day of celebration! Today marks the birth of a new Vessel! Let us celebrate!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
063	Hm...? Were you saying something, Nimul?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
064	This isn't the way of our world at all...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
065	Is it true, Nimul?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
066	You're going to become the chief?
067	Indeed I am. Why wouldn't it be true?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
068	Well, I only meant...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
069	Considering your age... We've never had a chief so young.
070	I have already discussed this with the village elders. They agree that there are no promising candidates, even outside of their age group.
071	So why not me?
072	I didn't mean to make it sound as if I had any objections.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
073	There will be no delays. As for why, you need only use your eyes. Look there.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
074	Hm?
075	The corruption is causing that once beautiful forest to decay.
076	Will Emmel even be able to stave off the corruption until the next Godwolf Ceremony comes around?
077	What are you going to do about your duties as commander of the Sephira Guard?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0031
078	I have every faith that you will handle them just as well as I could.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
079	M-me?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
080	Who else?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
081	But...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
082	I'm counting on you, Waginau.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
083	Nimul, I...
084	Your support would mean a lot to me.
085	Then you shall have it.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
086	Upon the great tree, the all mother, Sephiron, I vow to protect the Vessel of Purification, the Sephira village, and you...with my life.
087	Waginau... Thank you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
088	(Please hold on...)
089	(Emmel.)
090	(I will release you from your role as the Vessel...)
091	(And make a new world order!)
092	...
093	...
094	Hmm... Looks good enough.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
095	It is done. Here.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
096	Thank you, Yna. This is immaculate work.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
097	Surely there are blacksmiths in your village?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
098	But I wanted you to be the one to sharpen it up again for me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
099	I'm going to be off retrieving the Waters of Purification, after all.
100	I suppose that is also for the Godwolf Ceremony?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
101	Exactly. The person who is or will be the village chief must escort the Vessel of Purification to the Sacred Fountain. Together, they will draw water from there.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
102	It is only by first cleansing both mind and body in the Waters of Purification that one may communicate with the Godwolf Asena.
103	It seems that the corruption has recently contaminated the path to the Sacred Fountain, and to a terrible extent.
104	I can't protect anyone with a blunt weapon, now can I?
105	...
106	Still, I must admit that I didn't think you would do it for me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
107	What are you talking about? You asked me, did you not?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
108	I did, but I thought you'd turn me down, for sure.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
109	Well, I considered it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
110	Oh?
111	And if your request had come at any other time, I likely would have.
112	What do you mean?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
113	...
114	Not in the mood to answer that, huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
115	We are done here, yes? Go home. I have work to do.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
116	Fair enough. I've got to attend to the ceremony myself. I'll be off, then.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
117	Oh, but, before I go...
118	What is it now?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
119	Why don't you come and watch the Godwolf Ceremony?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
120	It's a festival that only comes once every three years. It brings the people joy.
121	I don't enjoy rowdy crowds...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
122	But should the mood strike me, I might make an appearance.
123	I'll be waiting.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
124	Nimul! Where were you? I've been ready for ages!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0013
125	Sorry, Emmel. Just taking care of things.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
126	Hmph! You always say that. All of a sudden, you go off on your own, and all you'll tell me is that you were "just taking care of things"!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
127	You haven't changed a bit!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0029
128	Do I really always say that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
129	Yes! Haa... With you as our chief, Nimul, I worry for what will become of our village.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
130	Waginau, I'm so sorry. My brother is always causing you trouble.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
131	Not at all, my lady. I am far too used to it to pay it any mind.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0011
132	Oh, really?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
133	Hmph. You have no idea, do you?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
134	That's just like him...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
135	J-Julia!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0013
136	I...! I apologize, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
137	You know, Julia, you're going to need to be stricter with my brother.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0029
138	I-I'm not sure what you mean, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
139	Haa... Never mind. Let's get going before the sun sets, shall we?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
140	Good idea.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
141	H-hey!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
142	What's wrong, Adaleigh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
143	Well... You're going to draw the water you need for that ceremony, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
144	Yes...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
145	I want you to take me with you!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
146	What insolence is this? This is a sacred rite of our people.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
147	We can't take an outsider with us!
148	That's true... Besides, you're our guest.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
149	Th-that doesn't matter.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
150	I just want to learn more about this place! I mean, I came all this way, braved all these dangers...
151	Besides, this thing you're doing isn't exactly going to be a walk in the park, is it?
152	I bet my Engineer Soldier will come in handy somewhere along the way. So, please, take me with you!
153	I suppose you do have a point. Very well, then. You may join us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
154	Yeah?! You mean it?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
155	Nimul!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
156	Are you sure about this?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0017
157	Why not? It can do no harm.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
158	Adaleigh is right. We are walking into danger. I'd feel much better knowing that we had his Engineer Soldier with us than not.
159	All right! You're going to be glad you took me with you, you'll see!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
160	I'm counting on it, Adaleigh.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0041
161	You got it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
162	Waginau...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
163	Once Nimul has his mind made up, no one can change it, not even the two of us.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
164	That's Lord Nimul for you.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
165	The force of his will is my lord's greatest strength.
166	Haa... Still, if he has so much faith in you, I am sure it will be all right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
167	I'm glad to have you along, Adaleigh.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
168	O-oh! I, uh...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
169	I'm not sure what dangers we will face along the way, but I hope I can count on you to help us deal with them.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0041
170	Y-yeah, of course! You can count on me!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
171	I'll protect you! No matter what!
172	Heheh. Seems like I can rely on you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
173	Hmph.
174	H-hey! Don't look at me like that!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
175	Emmel is the most important person in this village, right?! So she needs to be protected. That's why I said that! That's all!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
176	I see... So that's what this is all about.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
177	You have yet to grow up, it seems. Let me give you a piece of advice, boy: quit while you're ahead.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
178	How dare y—?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
179	Heheh. Thank you, Adaleigh.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
180	Y-yeah! No problem!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
181	Now, then... Nimul?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
182	Right. We need to get going.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
183	This is...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
184	No...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
185	What's the matter?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
186	When we passed through here three years ago, this place was full of greenery.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
187	Yet the corruption has ravaged it.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
188	So it really is a withering land, huh? I...can see that now.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
189	Oh, no! This is... This is all my fault!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0019
190	I need more power! I need to become stronger as the Vessel!
191	Lady Emmel...!
192	It's not your fault, Emmel. You must not blame yourself. The Cursed Beast is the root of all this senseless destruction.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
193	But...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
194	H-hey, so... Is the Vessel really the one responsible for suppressing the corruption?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
195	The Vessel of Purification offers her prayers to Sephiron, urging the great tree to cleanse the earth with her powers.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
196	That is how the Cursed Beast's corruption is exorcised. The Vessel heals the ravaged earth with the goodness of her own heart.
197	So the fact that the corruption continues to devour the land can only mean that my powers are insufficient.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
198	All of this devastation is my fault!
199	Lady Emmel, there is nothing you could have done. Three years have passed since the last Godwolf Ceremony took place.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
200	What does that mean?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
201	The Vessel of Purification cannot wield Sephiron's powers indefinitely.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
202	Once every three years, we hold a rite using the powers of the Godwolf Asena, the avatar of the divine Guardian Dragon Nidhogg.
203	This rite is when Sephiron and the Vessel of Purification are linked anew. The true purpose of the Godwolf Ceremony is this: the Binding of Sephiron.
204	It is no fault of yours that your powers have waned, my lady...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
205	Still, this is all happening far sooner than it should. Which can only mean that—	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
206	The Cursed Beast is growing stronger.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
207	No way!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
208	We cannot allow the corruption to encroach any further upon this land!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
209	I want to hold the Godwolf Ceremony as soon as possible. I must do everything in my power to... Argh!
210	Emmel?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
211	I-it's all right. I'm fine, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
212	You mustn't push yourself, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
213	Don't worry about me. Let's make haste, for the sake of all our people.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
214	Right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
215	(Emmel... Your powers are waning... The brilliance of your Spiritbonding has faded.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
216	(It must be agonizing, but you're putting on a brave face so that we don't notice how hard you're struggling.)
217	(I must hurry... Emmel's spirit, her very life force, is dwindling away, even now.)
218	(Before that happens, I must change this world.)
219	Corruption?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0022
220	Lady Emmel!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
221	Aaaaaaahhh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
222	Emmel! Get back!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
223	Engineer Soldier! Protect Emmel!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0001
224	From infinity, the void is born, and light there does not shine!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
225	Whoa! The corruption's...gone! Was that the power of the Vessel of Purification?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0046
226	Precisely. That is the power of the Vessel and Sephiron both.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
227	Power that can suppress the corruption, huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
228	Adaleigh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
229	Huh? Wh-what is it?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
230	Both you and your Engineer Soldier have my thanks.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
231	W-well, I mean, uh... That's...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
232	That's right! Isn't my Engineer Soldier amazing?! It's my life's work!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0016
233	You made this, too?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
234	Adaleigh here is an engineer.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
235	Wow... You really are incredible!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0046
236	I, uh, um... Hahah.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
237	I'm glad you're coming with us.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
238	Th-thanks.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
239	...
240	We should keep moving, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0009
241	Right. Let's go! Ngh...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
242	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
243	I told you already, I'm fine!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
244	H-hey, are you sure about that? If you're tired, we can rest for a bit.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
245	I'm sure. I'm fine, really, so let's hurry up and go already!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
246	All right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
247	...
248	Great power comes at a cost.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
249	The role of the Vessel is taxing on both her mind and body.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
250	...
251	The weight of all the problems of the Sephira people rest on her small shoulders.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
252	That is the way of our world.
253	That's...
254	The river is pitch-black!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
255	No...! For even these waters to have been defiled by the corruption...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
256	Yet we must cross the river if we are to reach the Sacred Fountain.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
257	How should we proceed?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
258	Hey, um... You know, my Engineer Soldier could carry us over to the opposite bank, one at a time.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
259	And it would be immune to the corruption... Of course!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
260	With this, we'll be able to reach the Sacred Fountain!
261	I must put an end to the onslaught of the corruption. We haven't a moment to lose!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
262	Everyone is depending on us... Please, Adaleigh!
263	R-right! Leave it to me!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0037
264	And...there. Phew! Good work, buddy!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0001
265	We're lucky you were here, Adaleigh. We couldn't have made it across without you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
266	Thank you for your assistance.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0033
267	Hah! See? I knew you wouldn't regret bringing us along!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0016
268	Well, it's only right that you made yourself useful, since we went to the trouble of bringing you with us.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
269	Tch! Can't you even manage a thank you?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
270	Well, I can. Thank you so much, Adaleigh.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
271	O-oh, uh... No problem.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
272	You've made so many incredible things. An airship, this Soldier...
273	You're a genius, Adaleigh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
274	G-genius...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
275	Is something wrong?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
276	Well, that makes it sound like I don't have to put any effort into things.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
277	I made my airship and the Engineer Soldier with blood, sweat, and tears.
278	It's not like it just comes naturally to me, or anything like that. I had to work hard to gain these skills.
279	...
280	So, please don't use some trite word like "genius" to describe me.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
281	I-I... I'm terribly sorry, Adaleigh. I didn't mean to offend you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
282	Huh?! N-no, I... Th-that's not what I meant, at all!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
283	Hey.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
284	Wh-what? I'm sorry, all right? I didn't mean to make your precious Vessel have to apologize to lowly old me, I just—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
285	I've changed my mind about you.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
286	Huh?
287	Just a little, mind you.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
288	Wha...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
289	Skills that you worked hard for...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
290	Lady Emmel, is something...?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
291	No, not at all. His words simply made an impression on me.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
292	After all, it's not like I worked hard to become the Vessel...
293	But perhaps I should have done.
294	Maybe if I had, the corruption wouldn't have reached this extent.
295	Lady Emmel...
296	Emmel, listen... You've endured a lot to become the Vessel. You've absolutely devoted yourself to the role.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
297	Everyone knows it. You should be proud of yourself.
298	Sure, Adaleigh's engineering is impressive—but your efforts are no less so.
299	Keep your chin up.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
300	One day soon, you'll be free from all the troubles in the world.
301	Nimul, I... Thank you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
302	Let's keep going. Our task is not yet complete.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
303	Right!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
304	(Emmel... I'm going to put an end to your suffering, and free you from the constraints that the way of the world imposes upon you.)
305	(For you, my sister, I promise...)
306	(I will make a new world order!)
307	Nimul, we're almost at the Sacred Fountain.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
308	Right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
309	Grrrrrrrrrrrr...
310	What is that?! Everyone, be on your guard!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
311	Grrooooooooo!
312	Corrupted beasts... Looks like they've got us surrounded.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
313	Tch! Why now?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
314	Nimul...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
315	Don't worry. I'm here. I'll protect you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
316	Huzzaaahh!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0007
317	Are you all right, my lady?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
318	Be careful! You must step away from the beasts even after they are defeated!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
319	Or else you risk falling to the corruption yourself!
320	I am aware! Lady Emmel, this way!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
321	There're so many of them!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
322	Stay back, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
323	Julia...
324	Fear not. I am your protector. No harm will come to you, so long as I am by your side...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
325	And I will never leave you, my lady.
326	If I cannot protect you here and now, can I truly call myself fit to serve you in the future?
327	Nay... I cannot! So fear not, my lady, and watch.
328	Grooorrrgghhh... Urrrgghhh!
329	For just as you will fulfill your role as the Vessel of our people...
330	I will fulfill my duty unto you!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0014
