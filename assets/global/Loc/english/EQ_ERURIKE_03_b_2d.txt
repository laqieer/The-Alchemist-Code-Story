001	Arghh! Balt, you scum...!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
002	It's a worthy end to a villainous sorry-excuse of a mercenary. Go make amends to your victims in the after life.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
003	Aghhhhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0028_a
004	It's over, Elrike.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
005	Where are the children?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
006	All the children in the hideout are safe. Now, all we can do is search for the record books and see if we can investigate their trail.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
007	I see...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0022
008	He-hey, are you okay?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
009	Y-yes. Now that everything is okay, I suddenly feel faint.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0011
010	You did well. With the amount of courage you have, it's almost regretful you're a merchant.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
011	But how did they know where the hideout was?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
012	It's thanks to this.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
013	The chain on your leg? You said it was a memento of your comrades.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
014	(Oh! That's right. He said it served another purpose too.)
015	In this road less dessert, we are all bound together by this chain, even those of us who are gone.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
016	What?! That's amazing! Is that something specific to this desert?! Or is there a special craftsman?!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
017	Oh, but...if it's a memento then...ah, nothing. Sorry.
018	Wh-what's gotten into you all of a sudden?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0029
019	How would you expect a merchant to react after encountering something so rare? But never mind that right now.
020	Hmm. As I must also report about what occurred here, I'm going to head back to Gluttony Foss. What are you going to do, Elrike?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
021	I'll...return to Envylia once. After all, I've lost all my goods.
022	I see. Well, if you feel like you want to cross this desert again then call me.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
023	No, let me help!
024	...?
025	I don't have that chain, but...I have my network of people that I have encountered as a merchant.
026	I don't want to end that connection here.
027	That's why, as a merchant, I want to help you return this dessert to the way that it used to be. After all...you'll need supplies, right?
028	Heh. A chain linked together by people, huh? You're quite the merchant.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
029	Why thank you. Anyway, I'll be waiting for your order, all right? Oh, that's right...I should pay you for everything.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0008
030	You don't have anything on hand, right? When I order supplies from you, just minus that amount from the costs.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
031	Huh, but...	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
032	My comrades are calling me. I'll see you around, Elrike!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
033	But...! Wait, are you sure?! ...He's gone.
034	Hey, next time you get involved in a big incident like this, try to put yourself in the shoes of those who are worried sick about you.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0013
035	Oh, Elaine! Yeah. Thank you...and sorry.
036	This time you were lucky and just happened to be with Balt from the Sand Hawks. Otherwise, you would've been dead!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0014
037	Also, it just so happened that I had been hired by the Guild. That's why I was able to come immediately, but...
038	Try to take better care of yourself next time.
039	Sorry...
040	Hey, what's the matter?! You usually never let my lectures get you down! You look so depressed...	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0025
041	Balt scolded me as well. He told me not to underestimate the desert.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0042
042	Besides, if I had died, I would lose the network of people that I've worked so hard to build and I'd also break the promise that I made.
043	Mm. Okay. No matter talk of this!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0031
044	Once we get back to Envylia, let's go eat something sweet!
045	Are you sure? I don't have any goods on me and practically no money as well.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
046	Oh well. I have you covered. Just think of it as a welcome-back-alive celebration. Actually, a really good shop just opened! I want to go there with you!	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0007
047	In that case, I'll gladly accept it!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0044
048	When I was in the desert, I actually wanted something sour over sweet.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0016
049	Of course. If it's that hot, you could suffer from a heat stroke.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0008
050	Right! I think there's a need for salt in the desert! I have to obtain some!
051	Look at you; a true merchant. Even when you fall, you have them pay you to get back up again.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0044
052	Fall? What're you talking about?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0025
053	Huh? I mean, you lost all your supplies that you brought with you on the caravan, right?	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0047
054	No. Anyway, I learned about a much more valuable business prospect, so it doesn't matter!
055	Besides, with the absence of bandits in the desert, I think trade across the desert will increase a lot.
056	Balt aims to create a land filled with trees and plants. They might have to start with an oasis, but I'm going to bring them the things they need!
057	Ahahah. How reliable of you, Elrike.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0023
058	If I'm going to help Balt, trust will be even more important than before. I need to do my best to prepare!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0031
059	All right. Let's hurry back to Envylia so that I can start preparing!
060	Even while we're eating sweets, tell me about these things, Elaine. You enter the desert more often than me, don't you?	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0002
061	Fine, fine. I need to teach how to properly defend yourself as well.	VO_elaine.elaine_sys_0038
062	A land overflowing with trees and plants...an oasis. I need to do my best to make my business strive!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0004
