001	Judith, Daddy... Daddy doesn't regret anything!
002	The Giant Taurus is a danger to all of humankind, but Daddy believes in the Mecha Weapon. It is a product of justice!
003	We cannot let it end here, Judith... The Mecha Weapon is my hope for the future of—!
004	D-Daddy has no regrets! Daddy stayed true to himself, to his beliefs! Daddy did what he had to do to protect everyone!
005	Daddy! Daddy! Don't take my daddy away!
006	You'll have to carve your own path forward, too; one that you believe in with all your heart. Whatever it is, wherever it goes, Daddy will always support you. You truly are—
007	Daddy! Daddy!
008	...
009	She's gone.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
010	Dangit! What the heck do we do now?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
011	Getting mad isn't going to solve anything, dummy!	VO_budd.budd_chara_1011
012	But...!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
013	What does that have to do with anything?! He's here now! We've gotten to know each other!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
014	He's just as human as you and me!
015	That's what Judith said, remember?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0002
016	That was only a few minutes ago, but you're already reciting the words back to me, huh, little frog?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
017	Getting to know each other... That's what normal people do. Idiot.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
018	...
019	Never thought I'd be in a position to get scolded for something like that! Aw, jeez...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0020
020	For the sake of the whole continent of Babel, some sacrifices have to be made.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
021	If necessary, I'm willing to make some sacrifices in order to bring peace to Babel!
022	You know, I've been wondering... Are you really that kind of guy?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
023	What are trying to say?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
024	I guess I'm not talking about you, so much as our oath. Is that really what upholding justice in Babel is all about?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
025	You've been kinda quiet lately—like you're trying to look cool or something. You really think you can protect Babel like that?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
026	Lord Commander Kanon would never have justified willingly making sacrifices. Aren't you just trying to take shortcuts?
027	You...! What would you know?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
028	I know you're wrong, that's what! You made a girl cry!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0013
029	The man standing in front of me right now is not the same man who swore that oath!
030	Get your head on straight, you dang idiot!	VO_budd.budd_battle_0004
031	I...
032	H-hey! Bud!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
033	We're supposed to uphold justice in Babel, right?! We need to solve this problem as soon as possible!	VO_budd.budd_chara_2011
034	It shouldn't matter what weapon we use! If the Mecha Weapon is our solution, then there's no reason we shouldn't use it!
035	I broke the sword that was supposed to be the only thing that could exorcise demons in Wadatsumi! It was really bad! It was all my fault!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0017
036	But somehow, we pulled through! Isn't that amazing?!
037	What exactly are you trying to say?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
038	I don't know! You've just been weird lately! I know you've got a lot on your mind, but right now...
039	We've got one thing that needs doing, and it's pretty simple. We need to take down the Giant Taurus—that's all!
040	The Mecha Weapon is a forbidden article—	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
041	The Philosopher's Stone isn't powering it anymore, right?! Case closed!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0012
042	That may be true, but the invention itself is still problematic. It is an incredibly powerful weapon.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
043	Should it fall into the wrong hands, or come to be used by the military... It's possible it could be misused.
044	Well, Judith just needs to keep a close eye on it. Problem solved!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
045	After all, she doesn't look like she has a bad bone in her body! Case closed!
046	Does this mean that Bud beat Basheeny?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
047	Sometimes I have good ideas, too! Right, Basheeny?!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0010
048	...
049	We decided that we would be the ones to protect this world, but maybe we overdo it sometimes. Lose our cool, so to speak.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
050	But when you step back and take a long, hard look at what's going on, it turns out that the solution was pretty simple. So calm down, will you, you dang idiot?
051	If you can't handle it, don't worry. We're here to pick up the slack!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0007
052	Right!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
053	I see. I think I understand what you are trying to say.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
054	Y-yeah! Wait, hold on a second! What's gotten into you, Bud?! You're like a whole new man all of a sudden!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
055	Heheheheh! I just said what needed to be said!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0008
056	(If he keeps going like this... What would Captain Kagura have to say? I've gotta make her proud!)
057	What's that dreamy look for?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
058	Wha...? What dreamy look?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
059	I bet you were thinking about Kagura! You practically worship her, don't you?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
060	I do not!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0012
061	Then what are you getting all worked up about, huh?! Your face is all red!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
062	Shut up!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0013
063	Ouch! So that's how it's gonna be, huh?! You wanna fight?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0042
064	Hahaha... Hahahahahahahaha!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0008
065	Huh? What's so funny?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0004
066	I was just thinking that you two never change. Watching you fool around like that made me realize that I've probably been pushing myself a bit too hard.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
067	Things don't change overnight. You have to keep moving forward, one step at a time.
068	Nothing wrong with that, right? I bet Kanon made heaps of mistakes before becoming Lord Commander.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
069	Then maybe someday I'll be like Captain Vettel!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
070	No way.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0010
071	What did you say?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0013
072	Bud, Victor—thank you. I feel like I can take on the world!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
073	Good to hear. In that case, I have something to ask of Kazahaya.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
074	Go watch over Judith, okay? Wait, no—protect her!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0006
075	Did you hear that, Kazahaya?
076	Understood.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
077	Then it's decided. Let's go and find Judith.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0044
078	Levi? Why are you...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
079	I need her for something.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0005
080	Wait up! I've figured out how we can get the ODM gear working again!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0007
081	We should be able to combat the Titans with this. As for the Giant Taurus... I really did not think it would come to this.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
082	What are you talking about, Tehre?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
083	We have found a way to send these people back to their world.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
084	Really?! Wait... So when you said that you need her for something, you—?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
085	That's right. The key to our return is the Giant Taurus...and that girl.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0005
086	It's Judith!
087	Who's there?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
088	Hey now, no need to be wary! I'm not your enemy. Is he...doing all right?
089	I won't let him die.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
090	Well, I guess it makes sense that you'd react like that. I'm the Lord Commander's liaison. The name's Kazahaya.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
091	That makes you my enemy, doesn't it?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0012
092	Does it, now? You might be right, but hear me out first, will you?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
093	What are you going to do to Reiner?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0017
094	Heh. I don't care about him. I'm just wondering why you saved him.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_event_1004
095	I owe Reiner my life! Of course I saved him!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0012
096	Hmmm... So, you're such a good person that you'll fight with people from your own world in order to protect someone from a different one? Sounds pretty stupid to me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
097	If that makes me stupid, then I'm fine with being stupid! But you know what? I'm not stupid! I am Judith, the mechanic extraordinaire!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
098	You realize that he was trying to kill you to further his own agenda, right?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_chara_1001
099	...
100	I guess you really are stupid. There is such a thing as too good of a person. Don't forget about yourself.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0022
101	What the hell are you here for, anyway?! You didn't just come here to make fun of me, did you?! I bet you're really here for Reiner!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
102	I already told you. I don't care about Reiner, and I'm not that close to the current Lord Commander.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_event_1004
103	I'm also on my own right now. I can do what I want. I know why you hate the Holy Guard—and I have something to tell you about that.
104	That machine of yours... It's called the Mecha Weapon, isn't it?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_chara_1001
105	What about it?
106	It's dangerous. Seeing it up close only confirms that for me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0022
107	So you're going to kill me, just like you killed my dad! Is that it?! Huh?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0013
108	Calm down! There's no need for you to jump down my throat like that! The Mecha Weapon isn't anything like the omni-directional mobility gear those soldiers use. It's not meant for movement.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
109	But not only can you ram people with it, you can also hurl attacks at them at the same time, right?
110	That sounds like a pretty frightening weapon to me. It's a danger to everyone.
111	How many times do I have to tell you people?! My dad didn't make it for those reasons!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
112	It's not about who made it, or for what reasons. What's important is how it is used.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_event_1004
113	Even items made with the best of intentions can be used for the vilest of purposes. This world is not all sunshine and roses, you know.
114	What one person considers to be just will be called evil by another—and vice versa, of course.
115	N-no...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
116	Basheeny has seen a lot of despair in his life. That's why he's so desperate to stop you.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_chara_1001
117	I know that must be difficult for you to accept, since you blame him for your dad's death and all.
118	Shut the hell up!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
119	Hey! Don't look at me like that! I know you won't want to hear this, but everyone has their own idea of justice!
120	I said, shut the hell up! Shut up! I'm going to get justice for my dad!
121	You do what you think is right. I think you'll find that, one day soon, your justice will come to overlap with Basheeny's, anyway.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0030
122	Ngh!
123	Again?! Is this...?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
124	Everything's going all weird and twisty again! Look, a Titan! Ah! I get it now! This is where our worlds connect!	VO_judith.judith_chara_1002
125	Urrk! This isn't the time for that kind of talk! Hurry up and get out of here, Judith!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
126	I need to protect Reiner!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0015
127	You're saying you want to dedicate that power to protection?! Don't be stupid! More importantly, you can't take them on all by yourself! There's too many of them!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0013
128	Don't worry! I have my Mecha Weapon!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
129	Ngh... Fine! I'm going to go call Basheeny and the others! You'll have to hold them off for a little while!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
130	Hey, you! Yeah, you! Giant Taurus! I'm gonna take you down, no matter what, you big lug! Just watch me!
