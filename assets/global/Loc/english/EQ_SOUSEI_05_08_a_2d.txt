001	My name is Andechs.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
002	I've been entrusted with King Arius' wish to preserve peace between our kingdoms—
003	Well, I'm basically your everyday righteous knight.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
004	A righteous knight, you say?
005	Does that make me the villain responsible for ravaging your Ira Belt?
006	Huh? Oh no, that's not what I was trying to say at all.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
007	I'm not here for any underhanded business, I just have a message to deliver.
008	Hm. A difficult thing to trust. And yet I can tell from your bearing that you have no intention of casting yourself as my enemy.
009	There's no doubt that you're a skilled warrior, but I sense no hostility from your posture.
010	So I'm guessing you're not here to assassinate this old man then, are you?
011	You got me! You're pretty cheeky for an king, you know that?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0011
012	Truthfully, that's something of a relief for me. I'm not the best at formality myself.
013	All that proper etiquette and beating around the bush just to try to slowly guess at each other's intentions? No thank you, that's just not for me.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0008
014	Then be at ease. I myself am not so fond of such things.
015	I always like to think that I am a human first, king second.
016	It's all too easy to forget that you're still just a person, no different from your people, when you're the king.
017	If you don't mind yourself, it's all too easy to become a tyrant that's grown unable to understand the general public.
018	Sounds like ruling is no simple matter, eh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
019	But that isn't here nor there. We've got ourselves quite the pickle to deal with first, so I'm here to get your cooperation through any means possible.
020	Oh? Is the Ira Belt is asking for our help?
021	Does this happen to be related to fact that your soldiers are attacking us?
022	Fraid so. We don't have a lot of time left.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
023	At this rate, Satna's flames are going to raze the whole place down before half the month is up.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
024	You believe your Cursed Beast was roused by that incident too then?
025	That's right. Well. It's more accurate to say that the root of the problem has always been simmering under our feet this whole time.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
026	The fire-breathing Cursed Beast that sleeps at the foot of the holy Mt. Shinai, Satna... It wakes once a decade and brings forth great calamity.
027	We have to survive its "night of fire rain" one way or another...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
028	That's why I came to your country for aid, for a power said to chase away even the Cursed Beasts.
029	We want to borrow your Silver Shield's divine protection.
030	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0001
031	Whew! It really is just one thing after another in this place.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
032	This Cursed Beast really gets free reign to go wherever it pleases 'round here, huh?
033	This isn't the time to admire it! Imnus, we have to retreat now!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
034	It's going to hit our fleet head-on if we don't move!
035	Got it!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
036	Everybody retreat! Leave arms and other ballast behind! Lend a hand to the wounded if you're able!
037	Yes, sir! You heard the man! We're fighting against the clock here, so move it!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
038	...Huh? What are you doing?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
039	The captain told us to help the wounded, I'm just following orders.
040	You're helping your enemy? Did you forget we just invaded your country?
041	Who cares about such things when the battle is over? We won, and losers should listen to the victors. If you have a problem with that, you should've tried harder to win.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
042	...You're a good person.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
043	Hurry! Board the faster ships! Ships at full capacity should leave immediately!
044	(This isn't good, everybody is still exhausted from the fight. We're too slow...)	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
045	Hey, Nimul! How many people can fit on the airship of yours?!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
046	A couple dozen at best, and it'll be hard enough to escape with that many.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
047	If only the Silver Shield wasn't broken...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0022
048	...
049	Nimul?
050	Evacuate as many people as possible. I'm going to try and buy us some time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
051	You...
052	...All right, I'll leave this in your hands.
053	Thanks.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
054	Adaleigh, did you copy? How long is it going to take to ready the Valley of Siddim?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
055	I thought it might come to this, so I made sure to stoke Libra's fire!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
056	But I don't have Mira and Nyx here, so I won't be able to keep it going for long.
057	That's fine. I'll take every second you can give me.
058	Alrighty, let's fire this baby up then—!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0037
059	Initiating Anti-Curse Beast Binding Protocol! Redirecting magil from the reactor to rapidly pressurize Libra!
060	I need a bit more time! Keep 'em busy a little longer!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
061	Got it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
062	...I'm not going to let tragedy repeat itself in this place.
063	That's why we've come here! To prevent such things from happening!
064	I will stop it! I will spare this place the grief and sorrow!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
