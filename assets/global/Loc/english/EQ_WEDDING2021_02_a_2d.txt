001	I'm all for getting the bandits, but we've dealt with so many in this area, haven't we?
002	That's true, but they continue to create disturbances.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0004
003	There have been a number of sightings of bandits reported in the area ahead. Let's go!
004	Didn't you think the outfits those two had were marvelous? I really want to perform my duties in something like that!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
005	Like go on a mission dressed that way?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
006	Precisely! Don't you think it would boost your spirits and make you more motivated?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0008
007	I wonder... I can understand the desire to wear fancy high-quality clothing.
008	But I don't know that it would be useful for us now. We do not need flamboyant frills to crack bandit skulls.
009	Sure, but if you had particularly cute attire, don't you think it'd make you feel stronger?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
010	You think a pretty outfit would make me stronger? Really?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0006
011	Absolutely! Cuteness is righteous!	VO_shayna.shayna_chara_1001
012	Huh?
013	We can discuss it more later. For now, we must do something about those dirty bandits!
014	We cannot allow them to disrupt the bridal fair!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0012
015	What is the big deal with this fair anyway? The town seems really excited about it, too.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0002
016	Well, if it's cancelled, then all the cute clothes and decorations will go to waste.
017	Everyone's worked so hard to put on a fantastic event, and we cannot let that hard work be ruined by some bandits.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0022
018	So I'm going to do something about it!
019	...
020	You have such a kind heart.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
021	And I agree. I want everyone's hard work to be rewarded, too.
022	Excellent! I think the visitors are all really looking forward to the festivities. I heard it was quite lively in the past.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0005
023	Wasn't there a couple planning to wed at the fair? Not just a rehearsal but the real thing?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0023
024	I do recall there being talk of it earlier.
025	How marvelous! The loving couple will be embarking on the road to a happy life together!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0024
026	The staff seem to have really done their best to ensure that the ceremony will be unforgettable.
027	I really don't want to see them cancelled, so we must make sure the fair is held and not let the bandits get in the way!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
028	The road to a happy life...
029	(Once, I used to think about that. I thought it was my duty to dance with all my heart for the sake of that happiness.)	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0030
030	(But...)
031	Now, I offer up a prayer dance to the god of Wadatasumi, who has watched over the wedding.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0004
032	I pray for the growth of both families, and that those who are to wed find unending happiness.
033	God of Wadatsumi hear me!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0014
034	Chihaya really is a wonderful dancer.
035	Such a splendid performance will certainly strengthen the bond between the two families.
036	I believe you're right. Chihaya's movements have real power.
037	Happy day! Happy day! Now, both families can be free from worry.
038	(That day I performed my first dance for a wedding ceremony.)
039	(It acted as a prayer to celebrate the newlyweds and solidify the bond between their families.)
040	(Listening to the joyous voices of family members, I threw myself into the dance...and I caught a glimpse of the bride's face.)
041	!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0042
042	...
043	Chihaya? What's the matter?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0006
044	Oh, it's nothing.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
045	Well, let's go. We still have a duty to perform.
046	...
