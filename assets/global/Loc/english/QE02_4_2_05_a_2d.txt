001	I can't believe the clock tower that I was so accustomed to as a child could appear so frightening now.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0029
002	Heh. I would say whatever ability you received from your ancestors is in some ways much more frightening.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
003	What? Ability?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
004	If my guess is correct...the clock is only part of this tower's function.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
005	I believe the real reason this clock tower exists is to seal the true disaster.
006	The true disaster?!
007	How can I explain it...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
008	This clock tower is most likely an enormous contraption to counteract Alchemic energy.
009	I guess you could say it's a kind of anti-gravity device.
010	Do you mean that is a mechanism that relies on the Belphegor's Alchemic energy to function?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
011	Yep. There was a podium on the other side of the clock's face dial, wasn't there?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
012	By placing the Sacred Stone Belphegor there, I believe it was restraining the power of the Demon Ore sleeping beneath the earth.
013	I believe that this clock tower is a gigantic storage that restrains the true disaster sleeping beneath its surface.
014	What...?! Wh-what is that disaster?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
015	Sorry, but we've got company. Let's go underground. Hold on tight.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
