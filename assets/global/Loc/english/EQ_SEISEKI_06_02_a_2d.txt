001	Pant... pant...<br>How could it be so hot? My armor feels as hot as a frying party!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
002	Don't you mean, as hot as a frying pan?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
003	Huh?
004	How could an armor be like a party? That doesn't make sense.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0031
005	Or maybe you should say, “My armor feels as hot as a frying pan used at a frying party.”
006	Who the heck are you?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
007	Oh, wait!<br>She doesn't have any ill intentions!
008	More importantly, Captain Monzein, thank you for earlier.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
009	What are you talking about? But oh man, it's hot. This is really not a joke!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
010	No, I mean... You saved me when I was being attacked from behind earlier, right?
011	I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, it's so hot! Shut up already!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
012	Huh?
013	It wasn't you who saved Kanon?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
014	I don't know! Those monsters probably just perished from their own accord! Let's just be quiet and start walking!
015	It wasn't Captain Monzein who cut those monsters down?
016	Hm?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
017	...
018	Pant... pant...!<br>Kanon, do you have a moment?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
019	S-sure!<br>What is it?
020	I'm done for!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0022
021	Huh?
022	What I mean is that I can't go any further. I'm really done for!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
023	Huh?!<br>Did you get wounded somewhere?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
024	No, it's the heat. I've gotten dehydrated. I probably don't have much time left.
025	Huh? Captain Monzein, this is not the time for jokes!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
026	Jokes?! You fool! I'm truly being honest here! Look at the way I'm staggering...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
027	You don't seem to be staggering at all!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
028	How could you be acting lazy at a time like this? Doesn't that go against your sense of chivalry?
029	Pure decision-making is also part of my chivalry! I'm really done for!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
030	I've never heard of such a “convenient” sense of chivalry.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
031	How can you say such a thing as if you know what you're talking about?! Can't you get that I'm really bad with hot and cold places?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0047
032	Seems like the Lord Commander is more of a man than you...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
033	Did you say anything?
034	N-never mind!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
035	Oh, come on...<br>I wonder what Lord Zain would think if he saw you like this.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
036	Hm?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
037	Excalibur...<br>Besides being the supreme symbol of justice, it's also the key to saving Kagura...
038	and it's our last resort in the destruction of the Mikaboshi, who will soon appear once again.
039	I hope you do realize how important the restoration of Excalibur is exactly, Captain Monzein!
040	Well... that goes without saying.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
041	And besides, didn't you say it yourself? How we wouldn't be able to face Captain Kudanstein.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
042	Captain Kudanstein?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
043	“How could we face Captain Kudanstein when he comes back, if we haven't been able to take care of something like the restoration of Excalibur?”	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
044	Those are your own words.
045	H-hmm...<br>Did I really say that?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
046	Even after everything he did, you're still waiting for Captain Kudanstein's return?
047	I-it's not like I'm waiting for his return!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
048	It's just that... I wouldn't feel satisfied unless I could give him a thorough beating!
049	Argh, you're so stubborn.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
050	Even after everything that happened, we're still on the same side.
051	Captain Kudanstein will definitely change himself for the better. We have faith in that.
052	Phuh!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
053	The strength of your unity, that's the true strength of the Holy Guard, isn't it?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
054	Huh?
055	I mean to say that it's really wonderful. We'll have to restore Excalibur, no matter what!
056	Right!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
057	...
058	Phuh... Anyway, I've reached my limit! Look, even my eyes are all blurry!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
059	Are you still making arguments? There's no way for me to see that.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
060	Tsk! By the way, where are Yauras and the others?! How late can you possibly be?	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
061	Well...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
062	What?
063	Captain Yauras, as well as Captain Seida and Othima... they all left.
064	Huh?
065	I guess everybody has his own way of seeing things. I couldn't bring myself to...
066	W-w-what?!<br>They left?!<br>They left the Holy Guard?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
067	What?<br>Is that really what happened, Kanon?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0021
068	That's also why...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
069	we don't have a second to lose to get Excalibur restored!
070	As the symbol of ultimate justice, Excalibur can act as a beacon of light to call everyone back together!
071	Kanon...
072	And in order to bring everyone back home, I need to be stronger.
073	And restoring Excalibur is my very first step on my future path!
074	Is that why you want to restore Excalibur?
075	Huh?
076	...?!<br>Get back, Kanon!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
077	?!
078	Monsters?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
079	How can they be so quick? Watch out!
080	S-sure! Ugh...!
081	N-no, it's not that they're so quick! It's just that our movements have gotten dull!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
082	Could it be... the volcanic gas?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
