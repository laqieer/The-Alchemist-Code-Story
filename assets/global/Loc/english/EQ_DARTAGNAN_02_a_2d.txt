001	It ends here!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1018
002	... ...
003	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0005
004	No...I just realized you really are a knight. Thanks to you, the damage didn't spread too far.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1006
005	That's fine and all, but...did you figure out the cause?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
006	Oh, hold on a second...	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0004
007	Hey, you gotta be kidding.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0050
008	What's the matter?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0005
009	It didn't go rogue... There's an illegally modified control board on this Droid.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_1019
010	Does that mean...?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
011	What did you say?!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0026
012	It's Amis' voice!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
013	Something seems to have happened over there too.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
014	Amis! What happened?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
015	D'Artagnan, Megistos...
016	Documents have been removed from our office. They're all regarding confidential information about our airships.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0018
017	What? In other words, what happened just now...	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0012
018	There's a high possibility that someone set it up so that they could steal the documents. Right now, we're gathering the non-employees within the facility.
019	Huh? Am I under suspicion as well?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
020	Of course not. That's the one thing I'm sure of.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
021	Megistos...?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
022	(Is he covering for me? Huh? Is he actually a good person?)
023	There's no way you'd have the brain to pull something like this off.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
024	That's why?! I regret ever having questioned my opinion of you!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
025	Huh? What are you getting mad about?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
026	Who wouldn't get mad about being talked about like that?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
027	Of course. No one in the Technology Division thinks you were involved D'Artagnan.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
028	But from an external perspective, it's not that simple.
029	That's why I need the two of you to investigate this matter.
030	You want us to prove our own innocence!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0045
031	Wait, hold on. Why am I a part of it too?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0050
032	Well, D'Artagnan isn't very knowledgeable about this facility, right?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0006
033	But I'm busy with examining the damage and other information control, so...
034	In that respect, you have time on your hand, and you're surprisingly resourceful, so I'd feel reassured.
035	You just want to throw all of this onto me, don't you?!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0001
036	I also have to do things like confirm whether or not the blueprints have been stolen!
037	I'll take care of that, so don't worry about it.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
038	I think it's a good opportunity for you to take a break from the guns and cannons you're always working with.
039	All right. Good luck!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0041
040	Hold on a sec, look...argh. She's gone.	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1006
041	I guess I have no choice. Hey, Lady Knight, what are we going to investigate first?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
042	... ...
043	Hey?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
044	Huh, what do you mean? Investigate what?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
045	Wait... You don't understand the situation at all, do you?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0003
046	Hmm. I'm not really the type to put my brain to work.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0022
047	Sigh... Listen. Right now we're in a pretty bad situation.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0029
048	The documents for our precious airship were stolen. You get that?
049	Ye-yeah...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
050	Well, normally we'd assume that an outside party used what happened as a distraction to infiltrate our office, but...	VO_megistus.megistus_event_1017
051	The situation is a little different. That's because we know the Droid was directly tampered with.
052	Huh? Why?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
053	We inspect our Droids once every week. If someone were to make even the tiniest of adjustments before that, we'd find out immediately.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0004
054	We were betrayed by an insider. In other words, we can assume there's a spy in our ranks.
055	No way... I can't believe someone would betray a good leader like Amis!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0021
056	But, um, how do you we investigate that?
057	That's the problem. The spy, of course, would have inside information regarding us. If we were to launch an all-out investigation, they would probably go into hiding.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0004
058	That's not good!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
059	Right. So I have a plan that I personally find very amusing.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
060	I doubt anyone will pursue me this far.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
061	That being said, even after that incident, the security was still a joke.
062	Those in the Technology Division have become lax to their core. It was a smart choice to abandon ship.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
063	How did it go?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
064	Huh?! A-ah, you. Of course, it went well.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
065	As you can see, there's information regarding the airship as well as blueprints for the latest artillery system.
066	This will buy me a position in Gluttony's military ranks, right?
067	Ah, was that what the conditions were?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
068	He-hey, come on. I put my life on the line for this...huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0020
069	Wh...why...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
070	Sorry, this information is all I need. I've no intention of recruiting a traitor like you into our ranks. Heheh.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
071	With these blueprints for Slothstein's military equipment, the day when we will reign glorious over Gluttony's military is nigh!
072	In other words, you're not only terrorists from our perspective, but Gluttony's as well.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0045
073	Ah. What a terrible story. Thanks to that, it's clear to me that I don't need to go easy on you.
074	I was just thinking about test-driving this guy over here.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0023
075	It's made with the technology you wanted. Why don't you experience firsthand just how much power it's packing!	VO_megistus.megistus_battle_0014
076	Huh. Long distance attack! It is aimed precisely towards us?!
077	Wh-what...?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
078	Of course, it doesn't end here! Go, D'Artaggy!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
079	I told you not to call me that!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
080	Bullets are limited! Aim directly for the head of the 'herd'!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
081	Yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0010
082	Arg-gghh! I will not die here...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0028_c
