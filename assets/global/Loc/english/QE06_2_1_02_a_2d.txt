001	What do you mean?
002	It's the only logical answer. At first, I thought she came up with the technique by herself, but…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
003	How could anybody learn something so powerful so quickly? Besides…
004	I remember Amane saying something about hearing voices, and seeing visions that were not her own.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
005	What the hell…?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
006	So that's why the demons were after her…?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
007	…I can't say for sure. Not yet anyway.
008	Dammit, Tanosuke! We don't have time for speculation!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
009	Why else would the demons target Amane?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
010	…After all, I have the same power.
011	Do it.
012	Stop! STOP IT!!!!!!
013	…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
014	So that's why the Discarnate Power didn't go after you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
015	That's right…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
016	Unlike Amane, I cannot access that "power."
017	So that's what's going on…	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
018	Amane may act recklessly--even thoughtlessly, sometimes--but she's also innocent and naive…a normal, kindhearted girl.
019	If anything sets her apart…it must be her ability to access that power. Don't you think?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
020	…Yeah.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
021	Then what about the "voices" and "visions" you were talking about?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
022	…The thing is...I don't know what they are. Amane doesn't seem to know either.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
023	…I see.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
024	Ugachi!?
025	If, somehow, they wind up threatening our safety, you'll have to be purged.
026	…and Amane?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
027	If necessary, her as well.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
028	…You know, sometimes--
029	…?
030	I don't know who or what I am. I can't tell if I'm in control of my own actions.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
031	Amane said something like that before. But right now, the person standing here is me--Blade Fox Corps Third Squad Captain Tanosuke.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
032	…What are you trying to say?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
033	I don't know what's inside me…but whatever it is, it's a part of me.
034	Spare us your monologue.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0003
035	If I become a danger to the Blade Fox Corps or the local people, then I'd happily be purged. But for now…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
036	I want you to trust me.
037	…
038	…! Celis, you…!!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
039	Cool your head. I understand how you feel, but…	VO_celis.celis_sys_0012
040	We can't afford to lose any more members--or lives… I'm sure you agree.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
041	…Tch.
042	Just remember I won't hold back if you turn on us.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
043	Of course--I wouldn't have it any other way.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
044	…You're a sly fox.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
045	I'm not trying to be sly. Honest.
046	In any case, there are no simple answers. This mysterious power and these voices and visions…	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
047	If we can somehow connect the dots, we might start to see the bigger picture…	VO_celis.celis_sys_0031
048	I hate to interrupt, but our scouts have reported a horde of demons approaching the castle!
049	!?
050	Could it be the Discarnate Powers?	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
051	No, there was no mention of purebloods included in the report.
052	Damn demons…what are they planning?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
053	Who knows…but our duty remains the same.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
054	That's right… We can't allow them to cause any more damage.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
055	I say…we move out!!!
