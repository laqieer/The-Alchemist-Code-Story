001	Mm. It still bothers me that we hunt weak monsters.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
002	Come on. If you think of the bad things, you'll miss out on the fun.
003	The fun...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
004	It's just a rumor I picked up on recently, but apparently a man from Lustburg is gonna be visiting soon.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
005	Really?! A foreigner? Are you sure it's not some kind of fake story? There's no way they'd let a man into the Royal Palace.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
006	What it means is that the Royal Palace can't stop him from entering. After all, he's a Paladin.
007	A Paladin?! Does that mean he can use Alchemy?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
008	Yep. It's not often that you get to see a foreigner man. Aren't you curious?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
009	Y-yeah. I wonder what kind of person he is.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
010	Well, you won't be able to find out if you get eaten by these monsters. Come on, there's more approaching!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
011	Whoa!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0028
