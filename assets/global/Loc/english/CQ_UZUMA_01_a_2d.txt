001	Oh, dear. Another mistake.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0030
002	Time slips through one's fingers like sand, and it cannot be rewound. How many times shall the same cycles be repeated? One goes around in circles, over and over again...
003	Her fate and mine must be intertwined! Thank you so much, Miss Uzuma! I've resolved to do everything I can to make her happy!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0009
004	Heheh... I'm glad that I could help. I shall pray that the two of you find happiness together.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
005	Fingers crossed that the next time I see you, I'll be here to consult with you about the name of my children! Haha! See you!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0008
006	(Today was a good day. Only fortunes about happiness, instead of death or despair!)
007	(I hope that I was able to inspire happiness outside of the readings as well... Oh! I know!)
008	I'll send flowers to the newlyweds to decorate their home and bless it with joy!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0008
009	Aaahh... I messed up again. I shouldn't have sent the flowers before the proposal...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
010	I completely ruined his special surprise!
011	Perhaps I'm not suited to this line of work...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
012	No, I shouldn't be too hard on myself! I have to keep doing my best, and be positive!
013	I promised myself that I'd become strong, like Miuna!
014	Grrrrrrrrrrrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
015	(What?! I've been surrounded! I have to fight, but... There're so many of them!)	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0017
016	Oh! The hourglass...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
017	My, what an alarming number of enemies. If you do not mind, I shall provide some backup.
018	Lady Nefertiti! What are you doing here?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
019	Perhaps we should discuss that afterwards? By the way, is your hourglass all right?
020	Oh! Y-yes!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0019
021	Grrrraaaaaaah!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
022	We'd better focus on getting ourselves out of here first.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0010
