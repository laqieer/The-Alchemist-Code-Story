001	The steady flow of water leaves an echo in the space, accompanied by an abrupt, ice-cold splash on skin.
002	Gwaggh! *gasp*
003	Good. I only needed to use one bucket.
004	Soren shifts around in his tight bonds, taking in the nauseatingly familiar scenery.
005	The jutting rocks forming the backdrop against sparse racks of machines and a single, pulsing glass tube in the center was too similar to Atropos.
006	Off to the side, Blair laid unmoving, her limbs bound and mouth gagged.
007	(Another underground facility...? It must have been nearby.)
008	Time's a-wasting, so I'll get straight to the point.
009	We know who you are, and what you're capable of. The specifics? Not my problem.
010	In there is what you're looking for, and you're going to awaken her.
011	Soren lifts his head, squinting at the faint silhouette imprisoned within.
012	Wait...That's Lachesis?
013	Ouch!
014	Get to it, boy.
015	(Looks like I don't have a choice.)
016	(The best I can do is make contact with Lachesis...if that is her.)
017	Haaah...
018	Hello?
019	Soren! You came!
020	Ugh...am I dreaming?
021	Where am I?
022	...He will be fine, Elder. Your grandson will be well again in no time.
023	Isn't that right, Master?
024	Of course. We will do our utmost best.
025	Thank you. Elylon Teg owes much to the two of you.
026	If it wasn't for you, we would have lost many of our youth.
027	Come, Lachesis. We must see our patient at once.
028	Soren's hand passes through the elder, who makes no reaction.
029	(Another vision, huh...)
030	(And what's this about a patient?)
031	Within the shack, a young man lays bundled in furs and cloth, his body wracked with spasms.
032	He's beginning to convulse. Lachesis, quickly!
033	Yes!
034	Ahh!
035	The youth shudders as his body flares briefly with light, which dissipates toward Lachesis.
036	...
037	Whew... We were just in time.
038	A moment too soon and he might have succumbed to the Alchemia poisoning his system.
039	(Alchemia...?)
040	(Isn't that just like Eira?)
041	(Emrys did say she suffered from what they called a "curse"...)
042	(And Lachesis seems capable of curing it!)
043	Do you remember now, Master?
044	Eira's in danger...
045	Yeah.
046	Don't worry. I won't let her fall into their clutches.
047	I'll save everyone this time!
048	Hehe. That's more like the Master I know.
049	Ah... But you're in danger too.
050	...
051	Well? What did you do?
052	You've been spacing out for fifteen minutes and there hasn't been a single movement in that tube.
053	I- I don't know. It's not as if I could just *will* her to move!
054	You can't, or you won't?
055	Guess you need some encouragement.
056	Mmmrph!
057	Waste my time again and you can say goodbye to your friend.
058	Blair!
059	Master!
060	(...Was that a voice?)
061	A ripple pulses through the room, causing Grimm to suddenly jolt.
062	Nrgh! What the- My head-
063	Soren quickly slices through Blair's bonds with his hunting knife.
064	All right there?
065	Could be better once we get out of here!
066	*GRRRKKK!*
067	The amorphous black shadow gnashes its teeth in agitation.
068	Looks like we'll have to do it the hard way.
