001	Hold on, let me just sit here... Now, what would you like to know?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
002	The Gears of Judgement... What exactly are they?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
003	How is it that your powers can affect Asmodeus?
004	Well...
005	To answer those questions, I must explain the results of the research that I've been conducting in this region.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
006	I've mentioned it before, but I don't know where these Cursed Beasts came from, nor do I know what they are.
007	But they do have certain habitual patterns that I have discovered through vigilant observation.
008	Vigilant observation?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
009	Stalking them, to put it simply. To kill Asmodeus, I followed its footsteps and took note of its every action.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
010	I learned that their operational capacity is proportionate to the size of the world's human population.
011	What?! You mean the more people there are in the world, the stronger the Cursed Beasts are?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
012	That doesn't make sense. Aren't they made to eradicate humans?
013	That's an interesting thing you mentioned, my young friend.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
014	Let me ask you. Who exactly was it that told you that?
015	That's just... I mean, what else would they exist for?!
016	The Cursed Beasts threaten our lives by simply existing! This whole world is has been ruined just because of their presence, right?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
017	That is the truth.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
018	But consider this: the fact that we will be decimated by the Cursed Beasts does not necessarily mean that their purpose is to do so.
019	For example, humans cut down trees to make firewood, not for the sake of eliminating the forest.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
020	From what I've observed, the Cursed Beasts accumulate the sin of people.
021	The corruption of the people of each region, Lust in this region's case, is what feeds the Cursed Beasts.
022	So the destruction of the regions is simply a kind of...side effect?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
023	Unless even that is just a part of some greater process.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
024	...
025	Anyway, the key point is that the Cursed Beasts accumulate sins and convert them into power.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
026	This is why normal attacks have little to no effect on the Cursed Beasts.
027	The sin they accumulate is in one sense, a unique form of magil.
028	Asmodeus creates its shell by using this accumulated magil.
029	But no matter how highly condensed, magil is magil.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
030	It does not explain why our powers, especially when using Matter, are negated.
031	I said it was a unique form of magil, did I not? The magil that encases the Cursed Beast has special properties unlike those of regular magil.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
032	That is the power of the seven deadly sins.
033	Would that be the seven vices that exists within all people?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
034	Exactly. It is also what maintains the balance of the seven regions of this world, and so it is something we have no hope of facing on our own.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
035	Can we not? Through strong discipline, shouldn't we be able to resist the temptations of sin?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
036	So naive... Well, I don't dislike the way you think.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
037	But we must be realistic. We live in a world where temptation is all-powerful. You should all recognize that by now.
038	The Fallen...
039	Right. They are those who have had their souls overwritten by the magil of their sin.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
040	The essence of magil is without its own "color," therefore it is susceptible to conversion by more powerful colors.
041	Those who possess strong magil may be able to retain some sense of self, but ultimately none can resist what alteration sin will wrought upon their very being.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
042	We witches use this malleability of magil to alter its state into, if you will, a desired color. Then we exert them upon the enemy.
043	The sins that Cursed Beasts envelope themselves in are stained to the core by the vices of humankind. Our shallow palate of magil simply gets repelled.
044	Huh... I really don't get it.
045	To put it simply, magil is like a piece of cloth.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
046	When it's white, you can stain it different colors.
047	However, it is much more difficult to stain pieces of cloth already stained with a deep color.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
048	Exactly.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
049	So the invulnerability of the Cursed Beasts comes from the fact they are already deeply stained in one color.
050	If we cannot stain them into a different color, then we must bleach the color out of them.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
051	No matter how powerful their magil is, if it is colorless, then we can do as we wish with it.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
052	And that's what the Gears of Judgment do?
053	Yes. The magic rod Libra can peel away and seal the Lust that envelopes Asmodeus.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
054	In our last encounter, all I could do was peel away the outer layer of her shell, but...
055	Had I been able to reach the core, then I would have been able to undo the Cursed Beast's invulnerability.
056	Then our powers would be able to affect Asmodeus?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
057	In theory, yes.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
058	Let's just say it will, for morale's sake.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
059	Well, we can't know until we try it. Everything is only theoretical at this point.
060	We haven't yet seen if it is even possible to penetrate Asmodeus's shell! That is where we must start.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
061	This method of challenging a Cursed Beast is somewhat haphazard to my eyes.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0011
062	This is how research is done. Hypothesis, followed by experimentation. Observe the results—then formulate a new hypothesis.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
063	If I already knew the answer to this issue, I would have never gotten myself into this situation!
064	Hrgh! My wound just opened up.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0043
065	What?! Nyx, get the first aid kit!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
066	Yes, yes...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
067	It is not fun growing old, I'll tell you what.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
068	I understand the theory you've devised to overcome the Cursed Beasts.
069	But as far as I could tell, the magic rod was powerful enough to damage the Cursed Beast, but not powerful enough to defeat it.
070	Any theories as to why?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
071	Not even going to take a moment to comfort me about my age?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
072	I don't think anybody really cares, Ambrosia.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
073	That's cold... Fine.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
074	To put it simply, there's not enough output.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
075	The limited magil available in this region just isn't enough to reach the core of that Cursed Beast.
076	There are ways to deal with that, but most of them would end with me bleeding out. I have no intention of dying that way.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
077	I'm not sure I understand...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
078	...
079	First of all, how do you charge that rod with the magil necessary for it to function?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
080	It's easier to just show you. Come with me.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
081	I'll show you my laboratory.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
082	Where are we?
083	Back when Agape was still a town of people, this mansion was home to the ruler of this land.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
084	As you have seen, this land is small, so there was no need to separate the judicial and executive branches of government.
085	An underground dungeon for those found guilty...
086	And now it is my laboratory.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
087	Ugh, it's so gloomy down here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
088	Why would you choose a place like this to work?
089	If that town isn't a town of people anymore, you could've chosen anywhere to work, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
090	It seemed to me to be a fitting place to conduct my research.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
091	But the biggest reason I chose this place...
092	Th-this is...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
093	Insects? No... Are these corpses of the people of this region?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0028
094	That's not all. Look at what lies among the corpses.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
095	Some kind of...stone...?
096	In ancient times, the gods used magil to imbue stones with the cosmic principles of this world, and gifted them to the people.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
097	This is a replication of that ancient art, a crystallization of magil.
098	The fuel source of the magic rod Libra. I assume you know what I'm trying to show you by now.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
099	You don't mean the rod is powered by...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
100	I do. The rod functions by using the life force of those poor souls turned to bugs.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
101	The magil drawn out from the bodies of these people.
102	That's...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
103	Cruel?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
104	Absolutely! Do you not value life?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
105	Sadly, they have no other means of survival.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
106	...What?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
107	Those who were in the town during the last attack should have noticed.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
108	Yes... The people, they were extremely sensitive to the cold. More so than we were.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
109	Exactly. Their bodies are not made to endure the harsh cold of this perpetual winter.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
110	To survive here, something has to be burned for warmth.
111	So this magic rod Libra was originally a system designed to manage the magil of the town of Agape.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
112	It accumulated the surplus magil, which you planned to use against the Cursed Beast.
113	Unfortunately, most of it was spent in the last fight.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
114	Hmph! This town is an inversion of Paradise, the manifestation of Hell itself, built upon the sacrifice of their own kin!
115	It's a pathetic ship made of mud, on the brink of sinking if the birthrate ever dares to drop!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0020
116	So this is the world of Lust.
117	Yes. They are an ignorant flock, forced by Lust to march towards their doom, yet surviving thanks only to the grace of that same Lust.
118	Still, I have to believe they have the right to live and survive if they will.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
119	This complicates things.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
120	To defeat Asmodeus, we'll have to remove the sin of Lust from it.
121	But if using the rod to do so would kill the people of the town...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
122	Casualties... Sacrifices for the sake of the rest...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
123	(It's the same. The duty of the Vessel of Purification... I can't accept this. I won't accept this! I can't let people die like this!)
124	Nimul...?
125	I cannot let this lie. Now I have stronger conviction than ever to destroy Asmodeus.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
126	How do you expect to do so? It will cost a substantial amount of magil to peel sin away using Libra.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
127	Especially from a Cursed Beast. That would cost the lives of the entire town. Are you prepared to make such a sacrifice?
128	There must be ways to work around that.
129	Where do you think we're gonna find the resources to do that?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
130	You don't mean the Matter?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
131	I don't know if that is a wise decision.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
132	That orb you call Matter... The magil within it is indeed incredible.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0002
133	But it was formed in the Gula Belt Region, was it not?
134	Magil stained in the color of Gluttony will not blend well with Libra's mechanism. We risk causing the  rod to malfunction.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
135	I don't think it will come to that. There's another way to extract the magil of this world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
136	Wh-what?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
137	Magil is not exclusively found in organisms.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
138	It is possible to extract them from inorganic material as well.
139	You don't mean...?!
140	I do. The reactor of the airship extracts magil from the atmosphere and converts it into fuel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
141	If we can link the rod to the airship's mechanism, we may be able to make full use of Libra's powers that way.
142	What do you think, Adaleigh. Can you do it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
143	I...think so. But I can't do it immediately.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
144	I'd have to get back to the airship to repair and modify the reactor. I might need a specialist in magic to help me out.
145	So we're going retrieve the airship we left in the Cursed Beast's territory.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
146	I need to gather all the necessary supplies, and then some.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
147	We will also need to reexamine the rod from a magical perspective.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
148	Is that going to be a problem for you?
149	Not at all. Do what you must with it.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
150	None of you know the meaning of giving up, do you?
151	I would like to think so.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
152	Mira, Nyx, assist them with the rod in any way you can.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
153	Sure!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
154	Understood.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0038
155	Thank you. All of you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
156	You've got it backwards. You're the ones helping us out here.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
157	But this leaves me concerned about the limits of what you are able to do at the moment.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
158	Excuse me?
159	Those were some pretty bold claims you've been making.
160	If you are truly able to do all that you say, it should be a small thing for you to overcome little old me.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
161	Winnick!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
162	Yes, ma'am?
163	Come join me! We're all going to have a bit of fun!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0008
164	Understood.
165	Huh? Wait, what's going on?! Are you serious?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
