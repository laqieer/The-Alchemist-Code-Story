001	They have us surrounded.
002	(This is strangely intelligent behavior for mere beasts.)
003	Rrgh... we can't keep fighting them forever. We'll tire sooner or later.
004	...
005	...!!!
006	That ought to do it. Are you alright, my dears?
007	Teacher!
008	Just in time... it's so good to see you, Teach.
009	Let's get back above ground first. Don't want to be boxed in by those monsters again.
010	Back on the surface, Minerva takes a good look at her apprentices.
011	How you two have grown! It hasn't been that long, has it?
012	Your skin is as flawless as ever, Teacher.
013	And your tongue is as honey-sweet as always.
014	Why, Siegfried, you look more rugged. Have you forgotten to look after yourself without me?
015	Well, I run around an awful lot for the Holy Guard...
016	I thought as much. You don't write home like Roxanne does.
017	I'm not really good for that kind of thing.
018	Merely a jest, dear. Now... about this child.....
019	Mmgh...
020	I detected a prodigious concentration of Alchemia particles within him. Simply astonishing!
021	Far greater than either of yours, I might add.
022	...
023	...So, I suppose you have decided to sire offspring?
024	Not my son, adopted or otherwise. Or Roxanne's, for that matter.
025	What is your name, curious one?
026	S-Soren...
027	Soren, my dear, I have questions—
028	Teach, come on. You can study him later. This is no place to talk.
