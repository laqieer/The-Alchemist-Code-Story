001	Mm. So that's why you came looking for me...
002	Well, now that you're all here, we'll have a better chance of unravelling these mysteries.
003	Some time ago, I was strolling in the woods behind the house when I ended up... here.
004	(I thought so...)
005	I retraced my steps after retrieving my equipment, and found that these strange ruins were improperly excavated a number of months before.
006	Remnants of their implements buried in the debris indicate haste in their operations. They were eager to leave.
007	Some of the monsters that surrounded us seemed different from the wildlife in this area.
008	That is correct. They are not indigenous to this part of Lustburg.
009	I can only conclude that they were contained within those rooms. However, I have no explanation as to their purpose.
010	They, much like the various machines you see around you, evade elucidation.
011	It's not just the entrances that show artificial damage, either. This place wasn't simply abandoned.
012	Very good. I expected nothing less from my dear apprentices.
013	The hypothetical chain of events is, therefore, as follows...
014	The excavators utilized improper methods to uncover artifacts in these ruins.
015	In doing so, the monsters sealed within were accidentally released.
016	Fearing for their safety, they vacated the premises, but not without detonating explosives to seal off the access.
017	The tanks were shattered in the process, causing the substance within to seep into the surrounding area.
018	Could it be that the substance itself is the cause of aggression in the local wildlife?
019	That is precisely what I feared. I've detected worrying concentrations of Alchemia particles in the surrounding woods, and they appear to differ from the norm.
020	The beasts that escaped containment may have savaged the excavators who failed to escape in time, and acquired a taste for flesh.
021	These particles may be causing changes in their biology...but to what extent, I am uncertain.
022	No worries, Teach. Lead the way and we'll find out.
023	In that case, let us return below ground. There are several other such chambers in the vicinity.
024	Um... I don't...
025	Don't worry. I'll look after you, so tell me if you feel faint again, okay?
026	...Okay.
027	The party heads below once more. Upon clearing away the debris, they find more of the strange machines buried within the rooms.
028	Minerva begins to inspect them one by one, with her expression growing grimmer by the minute.
029	The sheer number of these machines may be evidence that this was once the site of a production facility.
030	Was that...a tremor?
031	How strange... I don’t recall this area being anywhere near a fault line.
032	Urgh... My head...
033	I think the contamination might be affecting him. We should take him back up as soon as—
034	*gasp*
035	A large lumbering shadow begins to rise from the heap and its every step causes the ground to shake.
036	Its eye-like sensors flicker, as if detecting something. It pauses, and begins to zone in on Minerva.
037	*Whiiirrrr...*
038	What—
039	Teach, watch out!
