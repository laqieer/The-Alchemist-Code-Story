001	Lord Waginau? Those wounds! What happened to you?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
002	Ceclidis had more tricks up his sleeve than I thought.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
003	Heh. How very unlike me to underestimate my opponent's strength...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
004	However, we have more important topics to discuss.
005	It was always an expected eventuality that the ancient veil would be lifted and Sephiron would become known to the world.
006	Expected?! Do you mean to tell me you knew the village would be attacked?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
007	I had no way of knowing when it would happen or who would do so.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
008	However, this was always a possible outcome as long as the Sephira and their Protector kept a stranglehold on the secrets of their taboos.
009	What...?!
010	Once knowledge of Sephiron and her secrets made its way out of the village, it was only a matter of time until somebody attempted to make use of her powers.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
011	The previous Lord Commander foresaw this issue and prepared a contingency plan, the Desert Zone.
012	The Desert Zone? The contingency plan is...the desert?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
013	Yes. For generations, the Holy Guard has granted the desert people autonomy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
014	That is how we have been able to maintain a region outside the influence of the seven nations.
015	Only the Lord Commander knew that the purpose of doing so was for the protection of the Sephira.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
016	Now is the time to make use of his foresight.
017	The Sephira, with their immense Alchemia, will be hunted down by those who plan to abuse the powers of Alchemy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
018	The Desert Zone was created to harbor the Sephira when the village and its secrets were brought to light.
019	I've already ordered the rear guard to prepare to escort the Sephira there.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
020	The moment their retreat is complete, we will assault Ceclidis and his forces with all of our might!
021	No matter how large the army, it cannot function without its head.
022	So we must first pinpoint Ceclidis' location.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
023	From within that army? He's probably safely ensconced by his soldiers.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
024	According to our scouts, only his lieutenants were seen in their headquarters.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0030
025	Do you suppose he anticipates a direct attack on his position?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
026	That, or he has other intentions.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0005
027	Ceclidis is not one to risk danger for the sake of honor or glory.
028	For him to take it upon himself to lead an army to battle, there is likely some other ulterior motive at work here.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0031
029	If that is true, one thing does come to mind.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
030	Lord Waginau...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
031	When I faced him in battle, he held a particular stone in his hand.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
032	That makes it likely that Ceclidis' intention is to find Sephiron.
033	Sephiron?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
034	If my theory is correct, we do not have the luxury of time. We must make it to Sephiron before he does.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
035	In that case, I will leave Ceclidis to you, Waginau.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0045
036	I shall personally lead the Liberation Army into battle to distract the Royal Army's main forces and prevent any interference to your operation.
037	I will go with you, Lord Waginau.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
038	We will be deep behind enemy lines. I cannot guarantee your safety.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
039	I understand. I am willing to take that risk, as we do not have any other choice, correct?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
040	Very well.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
041	I will come too!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
042	Isidore?! You are still battling the darkness. Who knows what will happen if you approach Sephiron?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
043	I know, but as the commander of the warriors, I have a responsibility to fight for the good of this village!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
044	Isidore?
045	General Leordas, I leave command of my warriors to you.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0041
046	Understood. I'll be waiting for the good news.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0037
047	The plan is this: we shall identify and slip through a gap in the enemy's defenses, then make our way directly to Sephiron.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
048	Remember that we will be fighting behind enemy lines! If you fall behind, you will be left behind!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0007
