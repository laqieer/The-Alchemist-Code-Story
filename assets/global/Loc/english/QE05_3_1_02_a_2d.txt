003	Mocca, can I ask you something?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
004	Please don't, Tina. I already know.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
005	I think we might have lost our way.
006	I knew it.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
007	I had no idea it was this easy to get lost in the desert.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
008	We're running out of food and water. We have to find someone soon or we'll have none left.
009	I thought we were so well prepared when we left Saga. What happened?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
010	Maybe it was a bad idea to share our food with that guy who was down on his luck yesterday. Or could it have been the water we shared with that family three days ago?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
011	Whatever the reason, we need to hurry. Helping others is a wonderful thing to do, but it'd make us stupid if we died because of it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
012	You're right.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0038
013	Hm? That sound...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
014	Isn't that Slothstein's alchemic carriage? It sounds like it's in a hurry!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
015	Look! The carriage is under attack!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
016	Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
017	Let's go!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
018	Argh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
019	Stop right there, you scoundrels!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
020	Tch! You shouldn't have done that. C'mon! Kill them all!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
021	Well, at least this makes it easy for us to tell who the villain is.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0010
022	Nngh!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
023	Mocca, can you fight?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
024	I'm fine! Let's go, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
