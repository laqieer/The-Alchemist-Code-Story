001	Thanks for saving us back there!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0033
002	You're miners, aren't you? What are you doing here?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0003
003	I thought the mine was closed due to the monsters…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
004	They're the reason we're here! They're jeopardizing our ability to make a living.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
005	We need to exterminate them to get the mine reopened.
006	That makes sense!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
007	Sense? There’s nothing sensible about what just happened…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
008	The monsters are already panic-stricken. If you antagonize them further, you’re putting yourselves in danger.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0014
009	As long as they're here, our jobs and our livelihoods are on the line!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
010	There's got to be other mines where you can work. It doesn't have to be this one.
011	Try to find the silver lining in this situation and relocate to a safer area…
012	Are you familiar with the local legend about Felicitite?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
013	You're referring to the custom of making wedding knives out of Felicitite, correct?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0004
014	These special knives are said to ward of all sorts of misfortunes that might befall newlyweds.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1008
015	And the couple who uses the knife together for the first time is said to be linked by an unbreakable bond.
016	That's right. Believers of that legend rely on us to keep mining.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0005
017	So, we're not about to let a couple of monsters get in our way.
018	You almost got yourselves killed by a "couple of monsters". You were lucky this time.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
019	Tch... Well, I guess that's true, but…	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
020	Listen, I understand your dilemma.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
021	But that doesn't mean I can allow this kind of recklessness.
022	(Besides just because we exterminated the monsters this time doesn't mean it won't happen again.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
023	So, from here on we're going to take over for you guys.
024	We’ll get rid of the monsters so that you can work here again. Sounds good?
025	Godspeed! Our future is in your hands! We're counting on you!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
026	They all have such pride in their work.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0007
027	Yeah…but that pride almost got them killed. Then, what would they have?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0005
028	Something about them was so radiant! Almost like the wedding knife I saw at the bridal fair.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
029	*Swoon* The bridal fair was so fun. Everyone and everything seemed to shine!
030	Whoa! Has something other than weapon-making piqued your interest?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0025
031	Yes! When the bride and groom placed their hands atop each other, it was a dazzling scene to behold!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
032	Thinking of one another and wishing for a future full of happiness. How romantic!
033	Yeah! When they joined hands, the bride and groom were beaming!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
034	…
035	Lady Lucia?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0005
036	…Alright! I think I got the inspiration I was looking for!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
037	Oh, man. Looks like you're back to weapons now.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
038	Well, duh! I'm dead set on making a sparkly weapon like the one we saw!
039	Weapon craft oozes out of my every pore!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0008
040	…
041	Hey, Lucia. Were you happy?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
042	Always making weapons--never travelling the world. You didn't regret it?
043	Huh? Making lots of weapons makes me happy.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
044	!
045	I would rather live and die by that vow than to ever waver.
046	As long as I stay true to myself, I'll be happy.
047	And I'll be happy to fight alongside likeminded comrades.
048	To fight alongside a leader who vows to protect the people--
049	It's the greatest honor! I'd follow you to the ends of the earth, sir!
050	You…enjoyed it?
051	Of course! I could realize my ideas immediately and I had plenty of time and materials!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
052	The only thing I didn't like was having to keep my fingers from getting worn down from working too much.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0011
053	I really enjoyed doing what I loved every single day!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
054	…
055	(…Now I see. I was projecting my past experiences onto Lucia.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
056	You only see what's on the surface. You aren't trying to see who Lucia truly is.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
057	…Mei Fang was right.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0011
058	(No man should decide the happiness of another.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
059	(The miners and Lucia…they all lay their life on the line for what they love.)
060	(No man has the right to decide how others should live their lives.)
061	(That includes the men and comrades who died--who I'm responsible for…even him.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
062	Don't worry. I’ll try not to influence you. I'm sure your father would be none too happy.
063	But actually…that's why I--
064	Hey now. Don't give me that face. You're not thinking of quitting the service, are you?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0025
065	I don’t think you've ever tried to change me. Let's just keep doing our best!
066	Besides, I'm me. I decide who I spend my time with and how I live my life.
067	(I used to be able say things like that and smile.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
068	(I assumed that living a long life was the only way to be happy and that death meant sorrow.)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
069	(I took it upon myself to carry out the will of my fallen comrades.)
070	(As the lone survivor, I thought that was my duty to bear--but I was wrong.)
071	(I put a lid on my own hopes and dreams. How could I ever smile about that?)	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
072	…
073	You asked if I was happy… Didn't you say something like this before?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
074	Is that what's important to you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
075	Hm?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
076	What's important to you is protecting the happiness of others.
077	Come on. I said so from the beginning. Protecting the people is a soldier's duty.	VO_yuen.yuen_chara_1010
078	…No, that's just a facade--not as a soldier.
079	It's not just about protecting the weak from senseless violence, either...	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
080	Protecting all lives--That's my goal as a human being. I want to walk the path I choose for myself.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
081	…
082	…You're…incredible.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0045
083	Huh?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0026
084	It’s like you're overflowing with light!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
085	What're you doing here? The mine is closed. You've got some nerve wandering in here.	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0002
086	Who are you people?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
087	Well, well… I could ask you all the same thing. You don't look like miners, that's for sure.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
088	...We can't have you exterminate the monsters and ruin what we've got goin' here. This place is ours!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0029
