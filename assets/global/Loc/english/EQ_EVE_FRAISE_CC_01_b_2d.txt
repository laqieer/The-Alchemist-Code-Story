001	Phew, what a workout! Great job, ladies!	VO_eve.eve_chara_1020
002	T-That was intense… How were you able to keep up, Moa?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0029
003	I've gotten used to it. It's what happens when you practice every day! Well, to be honest, I'm pretty worn out…	VO_mor.mor_sys_0011
004	Don't sell yourself short, Rachel! You've got impressive lower body strength!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0001
005	I do? I guess I can thank my part time job for that…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
006	…
007	(…Eve looks like her normal cheerful self…but…)	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
008	…Hm? Moa, what's up?	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
009	…
010	…I, um, I'm doing my best with my Cupid's Training, and…	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
011	I plan to beat this curse with brute force to bring happiness to our people. So--
012	So, if there's anyone getting in the way of your romance, let me know! I'll kick the you-know-what out of them!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
013	Moa…
014	…?
015	…Oh, Moa! You silly goose! I bet you let your imagination run wild and now you're worried. I'm fine.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
016	Sure, there's a lot to deal with lately and Fraise is busy so we can't see each other, but…
017	It can't be helped! After all, Fraise is a knight of Envylia.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
018	I can't allow myself to burden him! So, I'll do what I can.
019	That means devoting myself to Bridal Training for Fraise…! Alrighty then, breaktime's over! Back to it!
020	Aw, come on!!! Already? Can't we rest a little longer?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
021	Wow… It's funny seeing Moa being the one pushed around…
022	Someone who has such strong feelings she'll do all this for the one she loves… Kinda reminds me of mom.
023	But the look in her eyes…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0031
024	…
025	You're coming too, Rachel! Let's go!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
026	…Ah, coming! I'll be right there!	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
