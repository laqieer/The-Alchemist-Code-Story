001	Hey, you didn't hear me? I said to move that toy.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0006
002	He...heheh...! I-I'm sorry, but I don't take orders from you anymore!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0011
003	Is that so? And how exactly did that come to be?	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0007
004	I-I'm sick and tired of working for you!
005	I'm go-going to start a new era for the mafia—yours has finished!
006	Hmph. Do what you like.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0008
007	Huh?
008	If that's what you've decided for yourself, I've no intention of stopping you.
009	Just don't do anything stupid like making a woman cry, all right?
010	Huh? O-okay...
011	Don! Are you sure?!
012	About what? Hey, I said get rid of those. They're in the way.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0009
013	Shall I commence my search for Miss Fiona?
014	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
015	N-no, well...!
016	H-he sold us out to the Beckrams! He's trying to give them Fiona!
017	What?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0026
018	Tsk! Yeah, that's right! I'm gonna give them Elester's daughter in trade for their support!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0029
019	AJ2500! Attack these—
020	Huh...?!
021	I just told you not to make women cry. Take them out.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0010
022	Ack! If you attack the Beckrams they won't let you off lightly!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0016
023	You don't understand, do you? There's nothing more frightening in this world than women.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
