001	I made it out of that one by the skin of my teeth, huh? Come to think of it, I'm surprised I have any teeth left!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
002	From the moment I first saw you, I knew you were someone worthy of my respect.
003	The image of you fighting tooth and nail against impossible odds, all to save my pathetic hide, is burned into my retina for all eternity!
004	The star of Greed Dike, the father of Imperial Security...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
005	Leader of the Intelligencers... D. Lily. Getting to work with you is the happiest moment of my life!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0002
006	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
007	Don't you remember me?
008	I'm afraid not.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0035
009	I've protected the royal family many a time, but I've had few opportunities to work with general infantry before, and...I can't quite place you. Sorry to disappoint.
010	Not at all! This is wonderful! It must be because you've created so many corpses that distinctions between living and dead have become blurred! Marvelous!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0046
011	However, sir... If I may ask one thing?
012	I-it had better not be the same question as before. I-I'm on a mission, here.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
013	Oh, but it is! Why don't you draw your sword?
014	I-I just did.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
015	You declare yourself before the enemy, but when they draw their sword on you, you leave yours sheathed. Now, why is that?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0002
016	In the school of Iai, we say, "Victory is won in the sheath."
017	Iai? Ahh, that's a Wadatsumi sword technique, isn't it?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
018	Why is your weapon of choice a katana, anyway? There must be plenty of other options for a soldier of Greed Dike.
019	Th—
020	Come to think of it, how much is a tool from the island home of demons worth? Was it very expensive?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
021	C-could you give me a second to answer?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
022	Oh! My apologies. I have yet to master the art of conversation.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
023	The spirit of Iai resonates with me.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
024	Oh? Does this go back to "victory is won in the sheath"?
139	My existence is akin to the quick-drawn blade. I am always stationed where I am needed, and there I wait, like a sheathed blade, for my target to appear. The moment they do, I draw my katana, and with their swift death, I retreat. It is a skill that ensures my survival.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
025	Distance and positioning are everything in Iai.
026	Being able to perceive the exact distance at which you can strike your enemy without being in reach of their attacks enables you to cut them down the moment you unsheathe your sword.
027	Of course, enemies who are aware of this technique are unlikely to get too close.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0016
028	Because they know you'll kill them before they can so much as touch you, yes?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0044
029	This is how Iai creates the ultimate ideal for suppressing an enemy without drawing one's blade. Hence, victory is won in the sheath.
030	Sounds like the perfect skill for an assassin.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
031	...
032	So, by executing one's enemy the second they step too close, you avoid any risk of personal injury.
033	Genius! A skill worthy of our noble nation!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0009
034	I didn't learn it for the country. I learned it for the job.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
035	Oh? What's that look for?
036	...
037	Come on, spit it out. What's eating at you? How can you look so positively gloomy when you have such a fun job?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
038	Greed Dike Royal Castle, Dynam Dionysus - Dungeon
039	I've been wondering...do you only work out of habit?
040	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
041	You never relished drawing your katana before.
042	Yet now you use the art of Iai, which you mastered for the purpose of achieving victory without unsheathing your katana, to feed your blade more blood than ever before.
043	You have greedily absorbed Wadatsumi's traditions—our literature, techniques, even our weaponry—to become a mockery of a samurai.
044	I hope you are proud of yourself.
045	Wa—	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
046	To think that you would set out to learn the secrets of the island of demons, only to become a demon yourself. You stand before me a cruel, cold-blooded killer.
047	Bu—	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
048	Murderer! Fiendish brute! Demon of avarice! Begone from my midst!
049	P-please stop! Sh-shouting at me isn't going to help anything, is it?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0026
050	True, but it's hard to resist being scornful when you so brazenly ignore the insult of the very name you've been given.
051	My...name? What does my name have to do with anything?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
052	D. Lily. As in, daylily. Also known as the ditch lily. In the morning they bloom, and by evening they wilt. They only last a single day.
053	A somewhat derisive nickname for someone whose targets, once marked, do not survive the night. It doesn't suit you. It's too sweet and fanciful.
054	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
055	What is your real name?
056	Unfortunately, I...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
057	Don't remember?
058	I always thought...that holding on to memories would weaken my blade. I don't know my own birthday anymore, and I couldn't pick my parents out from a crowd of strangers.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
059	How awful.
060	Isn't there anything I can do for you?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
061	Oh. Is that what you came down here to ask me?
062	Is there anything you want? Anything at all?
063	Is this how you plan to appease your troubled conscience?
064	Or is it simply because I am a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi? Am I just another curiosity that piques your interest, like that katana of yours?
065	The only nation Wadatsumi is currently willing to open its doors to is Greed Dike.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
066	Indeed. Greed Dike is Wadatsumi's sole ally in this world.
067	One only has to look at you to see the extent to which our two nations have grown close and exchanged cultures.
068	But I don't understand. Why would Wadatsumi send over a human being among their trade goods—and a shrine maiden, at that?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0039
069	Your country paid a princely sum for me, so I hear. This is to save my family, who lost everything to the fires of war.
070	Wh-what?!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
071	You can keep your sympathies, thank you. I have no need for pity over a matter that is already decided.
072	P-pity?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
073	Yes. Keep it to yourself.
074	I... I thought you were as cold and unfeeling as I was.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
075	How rude!
076	You were so frank about being traded, as if you were a chair or a cabinet, but...now I see your honesty belied your shame.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
077	Hmph.
078	I-I'm not trying to insult you. Really. I just...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0035
079	Just what?
080	I just r-realized that, even so...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
081	You're...determined.
082	I'm sorry... What are you talking about?
083	You mentioned...the afterlife.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0007
084	Oh, don't bring that up. How embarrassing.
085	But, you see, I... I stopped thinking about things like that a long time ago. I gave up.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
086	Well, well...
087	We're a sorry pair, aren't we?
088	Multifunctional, resilient, flexible, easy to handle...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
089	It's human nature to want a tool like you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
090	...
091	Since the old king met his end and Emperor Orion claimed the throne, rebel elements have continued to contest his rule at every turn.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
092	Their roots must run deep to produce so many seeds.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
093	My father was a careless fool who bedded more concubines than he could count, producing dozens of illegitimate heirs. Now these bastards plot to overthrow my rightful rule.
094	And if we allow this unrest to continue, we risk invasion by opportunistic foreign powers, correct?
095	Yes, but that is also why we must avoid mobilizing our military. There is no faster route for foreign nations to sniff out our weakness.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
096	That's where we come in! As an organization that operates in secret as proxy executors of the state, Imperial Security is best poised to do what needs to be done. We're the fangs of the powerful lion himself!
097	A new empire shall rise under the lion's mane.
098	The age of adherence to morals and faith is at an end. Under my rule, people will be moved by strength alone.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
099	...
100	As such, it only makes sense for the worth of our leaders to be tested regularly, to ensure that they are fit to stand above the rest.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
101	I was told this was a...training exercise.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
102	And we were told that whoever kills the head of the Intelligencers would be next in line for the position!
103	You have my word.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0037
104	You would pit me...against all of our new recruits?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
105	We can do this! There's no way he can take down all of us alone!
106	I...don't think this is a good idea. In a pitched battle, I might not be able to hold back. We could lose dozens of new recruits.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
107	So? It's always advisable to do a little sorting when you get new tools, is it not? The same rule applies here. The unworthy should be weeded out post-haste.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
108	Exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself.
109	I thought you might say that, my lord.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0037
110	But...
111	I want you to think of yourself as a blacksmith.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
112	I know nothing of forging swords...only swinging them.
113	I did not mean it literally. Put it this way: Na Zhu is a quality hunk of iron ore. It is the work of a blacksmith to temper quality ore, and forge quality weapons.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
114	And who better suited to fulfill that role than you, D. Lily? You are my silent dagger, my most utile tool, and now also the blacksmith who will hone my iron pawns into warriors of steel.
115	I want you to train me. You will, won't you?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0041
116	...
117	I want to be like you! A tool who serves the emperor! A glorious annal in the history of this proud nation!
118	You, too, huh?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
119	Unlike you, I have no means of changing my course. I am but a sacrifice, a good to be traded.
120	(Why do you long to become a tool?)	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
121	Come, rise and fight, brethren!
122	Fulfill your duty, my daylily.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
123	Like a surrendered blade, I have no will of my own. I am fated only to be carried from place to place.
124	(Why do you cling so to your blindfold?)	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
125	And so the katana is fed to the flame! Among crimson fire it's reborn again!
126	Uh-oh. There goes that gloomy look again.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
127	This fight is pointless.
128	You mean you don't think you can win?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0010
129	Oho. He's trying to rattle you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
130	I don't think I can win without killing you.
131	Hah!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
132	Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?
133	The flame is yet small, like a candlewick glare, yet who can say what will provoke it to flare?
134	(If there is a way to do things over, I...)	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
135	A single droplet of frost upon the vessel drips! It is all I can see—the vision has me in its grips!
136	If you take one more step, I'll cut you down where you stand.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0014
137	Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me?
138	(I hope I find it.)
