001	Nngh!
002	I've got you now!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0001
003	What?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0025
004	My hands are shaking as I grip my shield. My heart feels like it's faltering. It's taking everything I have to just stand here...
005	But...
006	I won't let you go any further!
007	I will hold this shield with these trembling arms and legs, no matter what it takes. I will fulfill my duty this time.
008	Oh shield bearer, look how your legs tremble. Do you intend to disgrace the battlefield with your presence again? Do you yearn for death so terribly?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0007
009	Sorry, but I'm not planning to die any time soon! And neither am I going to let any more people die at your hand!
010	I will stop you this time!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0011
011	Hah, how interesting. All right, little girl. Show me what you can do!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0032
012	...Relax. Look ahead. Keep your eyes on what is important.
013	Unconsciously, my body mimicked the movement of the knight that showed me the way forward.
014	Those movements... Is that...Andechs?!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0026
015	If I am lacking, I simply have to use whatever I am capable of! No matter how crude or unrefined!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
016	Daphne figured it out!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
017	"We are the ones who embraced Envy—"	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
018	(This shield... I know it. I understood it the moment I touched it. It is the same as our Silver Shield, in every way.)
019	(That means there's only one thing left to do. Fulfill the responsibility that I inherited from those who came before me...)	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0012
020	It is time for me to do what I was meant to do! The divine protection of the Silver Shield, bestowed upon us by the Mesarthim, the first Shield Maiden!
021	Madness! If you do that at this distance, then you too will—!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0019
022	"My body is a shield, a silver barrier that blocks and breaks all that attempt to cross it." Silver Shield, grant me the power to vanquish my foes!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
023	A barrier of magil! You think this will break through my corruption?!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0025
024	Rrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0025
025	That ability...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
026	(It's the same thing Ignacio used to get away from us in the Gula Belt...)
027	(As expected, the Ira Belt is connected to the Infinite Serpent somehow!)
028	First, we have to deal with the Cursed Beast, though...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
029	I did it? I... I did it! The shield finally...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0027
030	It's too soon to celebrate, unfortunately.
031	Ah, yes! We must save Andechs and the others from that Cursed Beast!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
032	Our guests have a way to send you to the Leviathan.
033	Isn't that right, Nimul?
034	Yes, we can leave immediately.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
035	Right, Mira?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
036	Hold on a second, I'm trying to connect to Nyx—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
037	Eyo, one two three, test test. You hear me, Nyx?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
038	Whoaa! That was one hell of an impact! I nearly fell over!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
039	Then sit down and shut up, would you?! Shoot, the magil conversion rate is dropping?! Oi, Nyx, what are you doing? Nyx? Nyx?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
040	...
041	Hey, Nyx? We're a little busy here, so can you stop spacing out?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
042	Damnit! And just when we were about to reach the border too! That beast is going to overtake us at this rate!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
043	Wait, Adaleigh... Mira's sending us a message from Nimul...
044	Nimul?
045	Huh? You want to make a connection between the castle and us using Space-Time Manipulation? Are you serious? If we do that the load on Libra will—	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
046	What?! You already started the ritual?! Hold on, could you wait for just two seconds?! Haaaah... Okay, I'm mentally prepared.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
047	...Um, what's with the foreboding conversation?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
048	I gave up. She's always dragging me around by the nose, that sister of mine... "Space-Time Manipulation: Connection Initiated."	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
049	"Libra has granted us control. Analysis of surrounding magil: complete." Okay, I'm ready to jump anytime!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0037
050	Daphne, are you ready?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
051	Yes! I'll do my best!
052	Don't mind how weird it feels, 'kay? If you shift your magil around too much we're going to land somewhere way off course!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
053	W-wait, what?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
054	Nimul.
055	Yes?
056	I'm leaving it in your hands. Please give our citizens the chance to dream of tomorrow.
057	Of course. We will do whatever we can.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
058	Let's go!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
