001	...
002	It was foretold, I suppose. Such is human folly.
003	Some things never change.
004	Morrigan kneels and gathers a handful of ash, letting it scatter in the wind.
005	But enough of that.
006	Let us turn our attention to other threads.
007	Morrigan awakens from her meditation in the midst of a dark, twilit forest.
008	Before her, a pristine pool set into an ancient stone receptacle reflects the full moon above.
009	The time is right. I feel it shimmering in the air.
010	Catha, Macha - to me.
011	Caw!
012	Two large ravens descend from shadowed branches, settling on either side of Morrigan.
013	I sense unease upon the wind, and a great calamity will soon rear its monstrous head.
014	From the vast void above I ask for a sign.
015	Her arms aloft, Morrigan begins to channel her magic into the pool.
016	O Night, I offer greetings and implore thee open mine eyes, so that I may perceive and partake of thy visions.
017	Stir the waters of truth, and reveal unto me its deepest secrets...
018	My vessel is yours to command.
019	[Thy will be done.]
020	Morrigan steps out under the full moon, glowing embers trailing in her ink-black feathers.
021	Now, let us begin.
022	Her finger dips into the crystalline surface of the pool: once, twice, and upon the third, a murky shadow surfaces.
023	[A child approaches.]
024	[Alone, afraid.]
025	Eira?
026	Eira's figure swims into sight, hunched over as she navigates slowly through the darkness.
027	Of course.
028	[She bears many sorrows for a child.]
029	[Her mantle is heavy with memory.]
030	Let us see what she has to show us.
