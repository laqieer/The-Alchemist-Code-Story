001	Wh-why are the insects attacking us again?! I thought the Bugmail withdrew...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
002	They're not being manipulated by magic. I can't detect anything from them.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0039
003	Huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
004	I think they're confused. The forest is burning, and they've lost their homes.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0021
005	This is bad! I-I'm going to the forest! We need to put out the fire!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
006	Can we put out the fire with these few people?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
007	It doesn't matter! I'm going! We've got to do what is in front of us!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0040
008	Whoa! Mo-move out of the way, insects!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
009	Seriously. This is way too dangerous. I'll help you out, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
010	There's something about you, Liz. It's impossible for me to abandon you.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
011	Alma! Rebecca!
