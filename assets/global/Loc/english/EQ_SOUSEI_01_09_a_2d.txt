001	Well... We'd better get planning, then.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
002	We are now going to slay the fallen dragon, the Great Nidhogg.
003	We don't have much time. The Cursed Beast stirs, and the area around Sephiron has all but been destroyed.
004	By sundown, we must take the dragon's powers and use the Matter to conduct the sealing ritual.
005	Yeah, okay, but how the hell are we supposed to take down a giant freaking dragon?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
006	Just so you know, my ship doesn't have that kind of firepower!
007	It's all right, Adaleigh... I have an idea. Yna...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
008	What is it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
009	The sword you gave Waginau... It is complete, yes?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
010	Of course it is.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
011	What are the two of you talking about? What's this about my sword?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
012	Yna forged that blade for you for a specific purpose, Waginau; to slice through the Barrier that separates this world from its brethren.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
013	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
014	Cutting the Barrier...with a sword?! You've gotta be kidding! There's no way that's possible.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
015	Within every person is a gate that leads elsewhere.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
016	Those are the words my master spoke to me in his final moments.
017	I realized the truth of them only after I arrived in this land.
018	S-so...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
019	...
020	Is that it?! What was the point?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
021	Uhh... Suffice to say that my new technique has been worked into Waginau's blade.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
022	In other words, it could be used as a catalyst to—
023	Wait... I can use the same technique as you, Nimul?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
024	Well...yes. At least, in theory.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	You sure don't sound very confident about that. Are you saying you didn't even test it?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
026	This blade is the sum of my mastery, and ought to choose its wielder; yet not just anyone can attain its true value.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
027	Waginau, your will—your refusal—makes you worthy of glimpsing the profundity of this sword.
028	So that's why you gave it to me... I see. But how do I draw out this power you speak of?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
029	Don't overthink things. Just use your Spiritbonding, as usual.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
030	Hmph. That, I can do. Leave it to me.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
031	Waginau and I will use my new technique to carve open a path that leads inside the Guardian Dragon.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
032	It will be seeping with corruption, but we'll have Adaleigh's Engineer Soldiers with us. We should be able to traverse the...interior...without much difficulty.
033	Once we have found and destroyed the dragon's core, control over the dragon's powers will shift...
034	From the living dragon core to the Matter we possess.
035	But that won't be enough, will it, Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
036	Emmel! Shouldn't you be resting?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
037	I'm fine now, thanks to Julia's care.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
038	Oh...
039	You cannot seal the Cursed Beast without the Vessel of Purification. Is that not so, Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
040	You don't have to carry that burden.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
041	That's not true.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
042	You and I have lived blessed lives, Nimul. We have been given so much. We have been protected.
043	All...for the sake of this very day.
044	Upon my life, I will appease the Cursed Beast, for that is the duty I was born to carry out.
045	...
046	...
047	...
048	Huh? What's with all this "Upon my life," crap? You're not gonna die, are you?! Why should you have to die?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
049	Waginau! What the hell is going on?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
050	The title of Vessel was chosen by the Sephira for its nuance of...offering.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
051	Huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
052	She... Lady Emmel...is meant to be the one to seal shut the earth that imprisons the Cursed Beast...as a human sacrifice.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
053	What?!
054	I suspected as much. There was a similar custom in my hometown.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
055	There was a ritual held to beg for protection, in which a sacrifice was offered up to the malevolent gods and the senseless disaster.
056	Th-that's so...primitive!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
057	But that is how we have come to protect our land.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
058	We must not squander the countless sacrifices our ancestors have made over the generations, weeping tears of blood.
059	Ngh!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
060	I see... So this is why you loathe wanderers such as myself.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
061	We are little more than pilgrims. We visit for a time, but lack the readiness to shed blood for the sake of the land on which we dwell.
062	That's right. I understand that you have strong convictions and dreams of your own.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
063	However, that is exactly why we cannot hope to coexist. You spill the blood of others for your own progress, while we spill our own for the peace of all.
064	Yet, it appears that your new Chief holds an equally new perspective. Isn't that right, Nimul?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
065	Emmel...I have no intention of allowing you to be sacrificed.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
066	There's no other way! Surely you know that better than anyone!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
067	The Cursed Beast can be killed. I am sure of it.
068	What?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
069	Lord Nimul... Are you quite sober?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
070	Of course I am. I know exactly what I'm saying and how it sounds, but thanks to Adaleigh, we have a chance.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
071	Me?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
072	Until you came, I always thought that what one needed to traverse the Barrier was sufficient strength of will.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
073	That would have explained why wanderers like Yna were able to pass through the obstructing torrent, but why nothing else came flowing into our region.
074	Precisely. Hence why there have only been two such arrivals since the time of our birth.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
075	No! You're overlooking something enormous that flew right in, but doesn't possess a will of its own!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
076	I'm talking about this, of course... The airship.
077	Ohhh!
078	It is truly an amazing invention. Even Yna and I can appreciate its value, just by looking at it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
079	However, you will note that it is equipped with no special measures against the corruption.
080	Well... That's because I didn't really understand what the corruption was.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
081	I didn't even know that the corruption was what turned people into the Fallen until I came here.
082	I just thought it was, like...fate, or something.
083	No need to look so down about it. Ignorance is the stepladder to all learning. Now... Why, then, was the airship able to cross the barrier?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
084	Let's start with this... What is the difference between this airship and those who have been taken by the corruption thus far?
085	I believe that it has something to do with their levels of magil.
086	Magil? Well, this ship has the best power reactor in the world on board, just so you know.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
087	That's it, then! The corruption can't consume high concentrations of pure magil!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
088	The power of the Cursed Beasts and the corruption are one and the same! Therefore, we can assume that the Cursed Beasts themselves share this same characteristic.
089	Magil is one of the components that makes up this world. It can be found in both humans and machines.
090	Then we have Matter; the substance that contains the purest concentration of magil in this region.
091	Nimul... You intend to use this Matter to strike down the Cursed Beast?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
092	I-is that even possible?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
093	It is. I'm sure of it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
094	Listen, Emmel. The components that make up this world form fixed rules that govern it.
095	Sparks will fly when iron strikes iron, steam will rise when water is boiled... There are laws that govern every aspect of our world, and they cannot be challenged.
096	These laws formed the foundation of the theory on which I based my new technique.
097	There are no exceptions to them...not even the Cursed Beasts!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
098	Hmm...
099	But all of this is just conjecture, isn't it? You don't know anything for sure.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
100	Maybe not, but I'm as close to certain as I can possibly be. It'll work—I just know it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
101	Possibilities that risk putting my people in grave danger simply aren't good enough. They have already suffered enough.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
102	But Emmel, everything we have learned up until this point leads us to this conclusion!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
150	This way, you won't have to die! No, not only you; no one will have to be sacrificed, and our sins will be erased!
103	Correct me if I am wrong, but regardless of which plan we opt for in the end, the Matter we possess must be made complete first.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
104	That's right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
105	Then we should save this discussion for after we have slain the dragon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
106	Indeed. Beelzebub is on the verge of awakening. We cannot afford a moment's delay.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
107	You agree, don't you?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
108	I...
109	Nimul!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_chara_1003
110	Fine.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
111	Good. Now, wipe that brooding look from your face, will you? We are going into battle, and all our lives are at stake.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
112	...
113	Ooh, ouch! That's quite a face. Are you okay, man? You're really red, too.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
151	I was just a bit...passionate...but that was unseemly of me. My apologies.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
114	No more brooding for me. Now, we're all ready to go, I trust? Adaleigh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
115	Y-yeah! The power reactor is already fired up! We'll be on that dragon's tail in no time!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
116	And...Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
117	I'm coming with you, of course. I'm more proficient with Matter than you, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
118	I will protect Lady Emmel with my life. I hope that you have faith in me and will not worry unduly, my lord.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
119	Very well. It's time. After that dragon!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
120	Such incredible speed... I can hardly believe that this was built by human hands.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
121	Hah! Well, how about that! So, you're finally starting to appreciate me, huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
122	Quit crowing like a brainless chick, and keep your hands on the helm! Gods above...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
123	Hey! Are you calling me a child again?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
124	Cut it out, both of you. We have arrived.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
125	Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!
126	It looks even bigger up close! Where should I land us, Nimul?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0046
127	On the chest! That's where we'll find the core.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
128	Seriously?! If we so much as bump the neck or forelegs of this thing, this ship is going down!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
129	Don't worry. Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
130	Right!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
131	Matter from the fore to the four, bind to thy will anew the fleshy prison from whence I was born!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
132	Grraaaooogghhh!
133	Whoa! The dragon stopped moving!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
134	Now, Adaleigh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
135	Oh, right! Commencing landing...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
136	This is where we come in. Are you ready, Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
137	Of course. Let's see if this sword's power can truly pierce the dragon's hide!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
138	Be careful when you step out on deck! The dragon's messing up the airflow here, somehow. There's no telling where you'll end up if you fall off!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
139	Understood.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
140	Excellent. Now, with the power of my new technique, we will open up a path to the dragon's inner—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
141	Graaarrgh! Grrrghh!	VO_desertbird.desertbird_battle_0001
142	What?! The beasts of Suga...?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
143	The dragon's corruption must have tainted them!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
144	How should we proceed? Taking on these creatures in midair without a firm foothold would be no small feat!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
145	Ice and snow, become the floor beneath my feet!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
146	This is...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
147	I condensed the moisture in the surrounding area to form a temporary foothold for us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
148	It won't last long, so we'll need to finish this quickly!
149	We won't need long.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
