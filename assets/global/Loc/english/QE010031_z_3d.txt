001	Agatha chose to leave with the Lizard Brigade?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
002	Yes. What does she think she's doing?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0021
003	I was too weak. I thought I had gained the power to protect what was important to me.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
004	And yet, I was unable to protect my own sister—the one thing I had to protect over everything.
005	A knight's true value is tested by what he does when faced with a difficult situation.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
006	If you want to bask in regret, then you should do it after you rescue Agatha.
007	Yeah, Logi. If you have time to mope over what happened, then start thinking of a way to save Agatha.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
008	For my part, I'm going to master the laws of Alchemy as soon as I can and use that power to save Agatha!
009	True. A knight needs the power to save others and protect the world.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0037
010	However, more importantly, what matters is how he uses that power.
011	Dias, this is something you must learn.
012	I must learn how to use my powers?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
013	You must focus on controlling the power of your Alchemy—a power that exceeds human limits.
014	... ...	VO_dios.dios_dios_sys_0016
015	It appears you've all gathered.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0009
016	Due to the expanding revolt of old Wratharis against our kingdom...
017	It has been decided that the Holy Guard, serving under the Holy Order of Babel, will officially step in.
018	The Holy Guard? The strongest army force in all of the continent? I thought they were wary of intervening in the warfare of any one kingdom.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
019	The Lizard Brigade's use of Alchemy is the reason behind this.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
020	This decision was reached in a meeting held between the Six Elders, who are composed of the grand councilors from each kingdom.
021	It was a decision declared under the name of His Holiness Pope Aimerlin.
022	And you, Gabirond, as one of the Six Elders, will be unifying the Paladins that have been dispatched?
023	Indeed.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0004
024	...Do not worry. I'll be keeping a sharp eye on them.
025	We don't want the Holy Guard intervening in our kingdom's internal affairs.
026	Zeke. Lead the Blue Flame Guard and work together with the Holy Guard to stop Sabareta.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0041
027	Understood. However, I have one request. I would like Dias to join the Holy Guard.
028	Me?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
029	What? On what basis do you request this?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0025
030	Dias is a knight who will be responsible for the future of Envylia.
031	I wish for him to learn how the Holy Guard, the ultimate military force in all the continent, handles Alchemy. Please, grant my request.
032	However...
033	It will be more efficient if us two brothers, who have fought Sabareta, search for him separately!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
034	The search for Agatha is more urgent than anything. Lord Gabirond, I humbly ask you!
035	Dias...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
