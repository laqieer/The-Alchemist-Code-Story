001	The answer lies in the rumbling? What do you mean?
002	In anticipation of overthrowing the king of Envylia, Captain Zeke took in the two of you who have Wratharis lineage.
003	That rumbling supports this deduction.
004	Enough. Get to the point! How is that rumbling related to him raising us?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
005	Didn't you notice? That rumbling was caused by Agatha's eye.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
006	Huh...?! What are you saying? What nonsense is this?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
007	You might not believe this, but Agatha harbors hidden Alchemy within her eye.
008	Agatha has...Alchemy?!
009	Therein lies Captain Zeke's reasoning for taking the two of you in.
010	You for your martial force and Agatha for her tremendous power.
011	He has been waiting for this day to overthrow the king of Envylia!
012	I-in other words... We were tools?! So, it wasn't love or penance that led him to raise us until now?!
013	Indeed.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
014	I know it's painful, but you must not avert your gaze from the truth. You must embrace reality.
015	!!!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
016	I-I must find out the truth from my father. If he truly does see us as tools...then...
017	Then...?
018	I will stop my father!
019	Even if it means taking up arms!!!
