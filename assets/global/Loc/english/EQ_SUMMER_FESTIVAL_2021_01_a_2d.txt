001	Windchimes?
002	Oh? Do they sound familiar?
003	Oh, not really. It's not a big deal.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
004	Just made me a little nostalgic.
005	Oh, I see. They do have a nice sound. Supposedly, they ward off evil spirits of Wadatsumi.
006	There's more than just chimes. They put out these lanterns and float them on the water at the end of the festival.
007	(I never thought I'd see another Wadatsumi festival.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
008	(So the culture spreads, even though we were invaded and abandoned.)
009	(I suppose people always take the convenient path. They find what's fun for them.)
010	(I guess, everyone's like that. Even me...with Button.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
011	...
012	Ooh! Look at that white fluffy thing! It looks so tasty. Hurry!
013	H-Hang on! I'm coming!
014	Oh, are you okay?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0035
015	S-Sorry!
016	What're you doing?
017	I'm so sorry, Sis! Okay, let's go!
018	Well, she's got some pep.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0008
019	Seems like they're having a good time.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
020	Are those windchimes for me...?
021	You seemed hot, so I thought the windchimes might help with that.
022	I suppose I do feel a little cooler.
023	Windchimes are also meant to ward off evil spirits, aren't they?
024	If purified by those, then next year we should be able to attend the festival together, too.
025	Pfew... I suppose taking a break here would be fine.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
026	I can't believe I've ended up in the mountains looking for someplace quiet.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0016
027	Compared to the mountains in Saga, these aren't that impressive...
028	(That had been rough going. The footing was bad, and Button fell down a lot. I even tripped once...)
029	What's the matter? You can be so clumsy. Here, take my hand.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
030	...
031	Ikasa?
032	I-It's nothing. I'm fine. I can get up on my own.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
033	Come on. It's fine. Take it.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0037
034	No. It's not right for me to lean on the princess I'm meant to protect for support. It isn't knightly.
035	(I didn't take your hand then.)
036	(I didn't feel worth helping...)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0020
037	(In the end, you and I...)
038	This is frustrating. This should all be over.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0021
039	...
040	Sitting here moping?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
041	You...?
042	I don't think Button will be coming here.
043	What makes you think I'm looking for Button?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
044	Maybe it's because I first met you two in the mountains. It's where I remember you from.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
045	Ooh, a place of memories?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0044
046	Is this child with you?
047	I guess she is.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
048	I thought I might discover something interesting following Sol.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
049	And I didn't have anywhere in particular to be right now, anyway.
050	Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but there's nothing interesting in this place. There's nothing to see or anything unusual.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0035
051	And I'm just someone with too much time on her hands, though it seems pointless now.
052	I can't say I don't understand how you feel.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
053	It seems an unexpected waste. But if joy was had, then there was meaning.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
054	Meaning...
055	...
056	Hey, do you hear something?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
057	...Why won't this work? The execution should be perfect.
058	Maybe we need more power. If we had...
059	Then we could perfect this ritual and use its power to enforce our wills.
060	Grave robbers? They're disturbing the bodies of those laid to rest.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0016
061	It makes my blood boil.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
062	Shall we teach them a lesson?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0030
