001	How is the investigation going?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
002	It's been confirmed. The rumors of an invasion of Wadatsumi were true.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0005
003	So, Greed Dike is on the move.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
004	In addition, though we have not verified this information, it is rumored that Gluttony Foss is supporting their warmongering.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0004
005	Ceclidis may be up to something.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0031
006	Sadly, we do not yet have the strength to oppose an entire nation.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
007	I cannot stand it... It is vexing that we can only stand idly by as lives are being taken.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0022
008	There is still something we can do.
009	What would that be?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0006
010	We can use the connections General Leordas left us.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
011	Though their numbers are waning, there is still an anti-Ceclidis movement in the South. I expect there are also numerous merchants losing their patience with the tyranny of the nobles.
012	With their cooperation, we could seize and control trade on the black market on a scale that would eclipse that of both the royal capital and the port city.
013	Do you mean to obstruct support from Gluttony to Greed Dike? Would that not attract too much attention to us?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0031
014	We do not need to stop their support entirely. We only need to delay it as much as possible.
015	It is not unusual for merchant caravans to encounter trouble on the road. I hear stories of former mercenaries becoming bandits and raiding caravans nearly every day.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
016	Must we really go that far?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
017	If we do this right, we can delay war without shedding any blood. Why wouldn't we do this?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
018	How are the arrangements?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
019	We have explained our ruse to the caravans. We will plunder their goods while they are enroute to deliver them, but we will return those goods as they make their trip back home.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
020	They have agreed to cooperate with us.
021	It's just that...they must still be apprehensive of our intentions, because they have also hired a squad from the Royal Army as guards.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
022	This changes nothing. Keep casualties to a minimum as you take the goods. Be sure to keep up!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
023	Yes, sir!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
024	Hey! What's with this slow pace?! The harbor is just beyond this checkpoint!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
025	We apologize, but our horses are worn out from the constant deliveries of ammo.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
026	Tch! Where is the glory in this? Why must we, of the Royal Army, participate in such lowly work as guarding merchants?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0016
027	Well, I have here some fine wine from my secret stash... Perhaps this will lift your mood.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
028	Well... No, I wish, but I am on duty.
029	Now, now, don't be so uptight! Here, just one cup!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0011
030	Uh, w-well... If you insist...	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0031
031	(The merchant gives a thumbs up to Kamui, with a somewhat self-satisfied smile.)
032	Time to attack!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
033	What the—a raid?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0026
