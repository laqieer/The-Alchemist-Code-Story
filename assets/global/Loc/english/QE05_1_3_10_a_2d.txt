001	No... How could this be? Not this village too!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_battle_0025
002	Kill all the villagers! Even the women and children!
003	No, no, no, no! This is the worst!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
004	All this is going to be burned down? The orchards, the wise women's observatory, the fields, and even Kamui's house... No...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
005	What...? I've started to hear voices from Sephiron again!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_favorite_0006
006	I have to find Kamui and Malta!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
007	Uh-oh.	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
008	Malta! Are you okay?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
009	I... I couldn't absorb all of it, but I took much of Sephiron's corruption into myself. I cannot move my body as easily anymore.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
010	Just go! Leave me behind!
011	As if I could do such a thing!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
012	Here they are! Over here!
013	I will protect you! Do not expect me to just give up!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0032
