001	Agh!	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0019
002	Your Highness!
003	I'm fine. Being on horseback just got to my wounds. It's not a problem.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0001
004	...
005	How are the soldiers doing?
006	Seeing you here has uplifted their spirits.
007	They should be able to go through with the plan without issue.
008	I see. Then all we have to do is rendezvous with Kamui.
009	Adelbert, would you lend me an ear?
010	Of course, your Highness?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0005
011	I...feel so pathetic. Look, my hands are shaking in fear.	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0019
012	This is your first real battle, your Highness. It's only natural to be nervous.	VO_adalbert.adalbert_favorite_0005
013	That's not it, Adelbert.
014	The battle that will decide the fate of this country is before me, and yet all I can think about is Marie's wellbeing.
015	Every soldier here is risking their life for the sake of this country...but I... I'm ashamed of how abject I can be.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0029
016	You are mistaken, your Highness.
017	What?
018	To be able to woe for someone you love, that is a highly admirable, human quality. No one would criticize you for that.
019	Do you think so?
020	Absolutely. That is why we all are here. We are fighting for the ones we love.
021	So be proud, your Highness. We are honored to follow you under these motives and intentions.
022	Thank you, Adelbert.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0034
023	Uh, sorry to interrupt your little moment here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
024	How long were you listening?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0028
025	The whole time.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
026	Forget what you heard.
027	I-I thought it was beautiful!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0001
028	Caring is important, isn't it? Isn't it?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0044
029	...
030	Heh. Hahahahaha!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0008
031	Y-your Highness?!
032	Hahaha, my apologies, but that helped me relax a little.
033	So, you were about to take another route, were you not?
034	We are, yes.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0004
035	Kamui wishes to use the fact that the enemy can track my movements to our advantage.
036	Are you sure you'll be okay with just the two of you?	VO_adalbert.adalbert_sys_0016
037	I can still scatter beasts away. We're not going that far anyway.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
038	Well then, we'll be off. Take care.
039	...
040	Agatha? What's wrong?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
041	Oh, I'm just a little nervous.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
042	Ah, yeah, you had amnesia, right? If you're worried, I could handle the negotiations.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
043	It's not that. I'm just not sure what I should talk about. That's all.
044	I see. It probably would be wise to think of some topic of conversation.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0045
045	There's gotta be something you can say that will drag Dias Elysion, the Captain of the Fourth Regiment of the Holy Guard, out onto the battlefield.
046	...
047	Your face, your hair... All of it is maddening.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0005
048	It baffles me how Seriolde could fall for such a girl.
049	Your loathing of the Sephira truly knows no bounds, Ceclidis.
050	Of course. They were the biggest obstruction on my path to rule.
051	I will see every lost drop of their blood go up in smoke.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0040
052	...
053	Hmph, did I anger you? Come to think of it, you share the same bloodline as the Sephira. Does it pain you to hear such malevolence toward your people?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0010
054	A woman from Saga has contacted the Holy Guard.
055	What?
056	Alchemy is a great threat to us, the Jam.
057	If the Holy Guard is to stand against us, we will need to split a large portion of our forces to deal with them.
058	Could they be...? No! That's impossible! Waginau and the Protector oppose each other. There is no way they would stand together.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0022
059	But what if...	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_battle_0019
060	Eradicate them.	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0001
061	Are you sure? You will be losing a significant portion of your forces in battle against the Liberation Army.
062	That is of little consequence to me! Kill them! Devour and wreak havoc upon all who have ties with that man!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0013
063	Very well.
064	Ceclidis... He was a perfect candidate to be our vessel, but his will is at its limit.
065	It is fortunate that we found a new vessel. The resurrection ceremony is soon at hand!
066	O cradle reborn, Cryphone! Blessed be, your evil majesty!
