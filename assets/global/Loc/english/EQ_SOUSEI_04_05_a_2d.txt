001	Julia, is that you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
002	Hmph. I do seem to have some relation to that name. Fine. You may call me that.
003	Even though that name means nothing to me anymore.
004	Emmel worried about you, so much...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
005	Hmm?
006	Since the last time we saw you, Emmel's gaze has wandered more and more...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
007	She never said a word, but you have always, always weighed heavily on her heart since we ended up in the Luxuria Belt.
008	In spite of all that... In spite of what happened... I couldn't save Emmel either...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
009	Of all people, how could you become a Sinner...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
010	A Sinner? But she seems way too aware to be a...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
011	Despite being taken completely by surprise, he was able to defend against my attack. Quite curious...	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0030
012	I thought that a single target would be simpler. What a pain...
013	You are...Mira? No, I sense something... No.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
014	Sinner!
015	Then...Julia is also under the power of the Cursed Beast?
016	Ah, back in my former life, you all once held quite some respect for me, did you?
017	But there is no longer any use in regarding me like that.
018	The Julia you once knew is dead. She died and now she is me. Too bad for you.
019	Your affection, your friendship, and the person I was are all somewhere far away, like a fleeting dream at twilight.
020	I...see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
021	But that's why I am filled with such disgust now. Because it was just a dream...
022	Disgust?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
023	Yes, disgust. Of course. Don't you understand?
024	Stop it, Nimul! That's not the Julia you know! Don't listen to anything she says!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0015
025	Eulalia? Why is she worked up like that?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
026	Shapeless ones, fulfill your duties.
027	...!
028	Agh! These Sinners possess a whole different level of speed?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
029	Ahhh! That was a surprise!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
030	Oh!
