001	You want me to enlist in the Wadatsumi army?
002	Yes.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
003	I thought I made it clear long ago that I refuse.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
004	There is a shortage of new recruits…especially qualified ones.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
005	Save it. I told you--these hands only wield kitchen knives.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
006	That wasn't always the case.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
007	…Yeah, but those days are over.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
008	…
009	I can't fulfill your request. Go home.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
010	That won't do… Demons have appeared who can nullify chakra.
011	…!?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
012	Chakra used to be effective against them…but these demons could nullify the Phoenix Brigade's every move.
013	They must be using chakra--or something comparable--in order to nullifies our powers.
014	…We could be in grave danger.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
015	What do you have to worry about? You still have the arcane art, don't you?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
016	…Both Kagutsuchi and the arts of the Phoenix Brigade stem from the Phoenix Covenant passed down through generations of the Aquila Rubrum royal family.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
017	For now, nothing can surpass the Kagutsuchi…but somewhere along the line, that may change.
018	…So what?
019	We may become outmatched by the demons… I want to solidify our strength before that happens.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
020	Come on. We're talking about the pinnacle of our arts--that which was carefully developed by the royal family to protect Wadatsumi.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
021	If it could be surpassed so easily, the people would lose hope.
022	That's why I'm here…
023	Fighting power with power… That's always been your strategy--but not mine.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
024	If Kagutsuchi were to be destroyed someday, Wadatsumi would fall into the demons' hands.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
025	…That's not my concern.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
026	…I need you.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
027	Has that line ever worked?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
028	This isn't a joke…! The very future of Wadatsumi is at stake.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
029	You're the only man I know with enough chakra to endure the Phoenix Covenant…
030	You were once a Demon Hunter for a reason. Please…
031	…
032	You're not even going to consider it?
033	…I swore long ago the only blade I'll wield is in the kitchen. I thought I made myself clear.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
034	…I refuse.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0039
035	Why? Your abilities are second to none and you possess the ideal amount of chakra. Won't you lend us your support…for Wadatsumi's sake?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
036	…What ever happened to the demons we hunted?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
037	...That's beyond my purview. Unfortunately, there is much I do not know.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
038	Then why enlist my help?
039	I was told to find someone capable enough.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
040	You don't even know what's going on in your own country? You only care when it's convenient for you. It's pathetic.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0012
041	Denigrate me if you must. I'll accept it all in the name of Wadatsumi.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
042	A country that takes life for granted deserves to fall…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
043	…
044	...I have no intention of taking up arms.
045	If not arms, then what?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
046	…Well…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
047	…I'll make do with kitchen knives.
048	You haven't changed a bit since then…
049	I prefer life-giving meals to life-taking war. That--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
050	Is my atonement for the lives I've taken, and my own way of fighting.
051	…
052	If we fill their stomachs, then maybe they'll stop eating us. If both sides have their basic needs met, the fighting should end.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
053	Only then will there be any lasting peace.
054	…That's a fantasy.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
055	Better to fantasize about a better future than to give up.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
056	…I haven't given up.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
057	Then you've got it all backwards.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
058	…
059	…You said there's a demon who can use chakra, right?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
060	If such a demon exists, who's to say there aren't also demons who don't devour humans?
061	…Impossible. Demons devour humans. Period. That is why they're our mortal enemies.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
062	…But…it is possible.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
063	Even if my dream is a long shot, I'm glad I haven't given up. I've come this far, so I've got to follow through.
064	My food...will bring peace to Wadatsumi.
065	Kaede…still hasn't returned.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
066	It appears not.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
067	She must be too weak to move…I should go find her.	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
068	Calm down, Tamba. You'd be a fool to put yourself at risk for one demon.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
069	It's far riskier to lose Kaede and have our strength diminished. In order to wipe out those damned humans…
070	We need her.
071	…Yes, you may be right. We can't allow any more damage to our side.
072	She hasn't replenished her life force yet. What if she's trapped somewhere and the humans find her…	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
073	…We'll deal with that when the time comes. Once you become the king's vessel, nothing can stop you.
074	Are you saying we should abandon Kaede…?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
075	Survival of the fittest--that's the law of nature.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
076	…!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0042
077	I'm moved by your loyalty to you sister…but she's naïve.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
078	It's not just Kaede. I have a promise to keep.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
079	…
080	…Ah, yes. I remember--The day you both returned home covered in blood. You had escaped your human captors.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
081	…
082	The youngsters kidnapped by vile humans were thought to have been killed… Imagine our surprise when you made it back here all on your own.
083	…You still despise humans, don't you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
084	…A foolish question. I live with that hatred each and every day.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
085	Of course, of course. The anger you both harbor against humans--the "corruption"--THAT is your great power.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
086	That "corruption" coupled with the unique power you possess--I'm convinced…
087	You will surpass me and become the king's vessel, bringing about a new dawn for the demon race.
088	…I don't know about all this "king's vessel" talk… but I'm in your debt.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
089	So…I hope to meet your high expectations.
090	I haven't done anything. What does this "debt" concept even mean?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
091	After we escaped from our abductors and returned here, the other demons blamed us for being too weak. But you took us in.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
092	The other demons didn't realize the powers you possess--that of both human and demon…
093	I simply discovered that you are mixedbloods and guided you accordingly.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
094	You mean the extremely rare case in which a child is born with a demon's lifeforce and the power of chakra?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
136	Indeed. You and Kaede are exceptional in that regard.
095	…That aside, I vowed to exterminate all humans, and that's what I'm going to do.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0010
096	Yes. Well said. What we demons need in order to survive is…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
097	The powers of you and your sister and the anger you harbor towards humans--that "corruption." That's to say nothing of the king's vessel.
098	…
099	You two will defend us against the humans' confounded arts.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
100	We cannot allow them to intimidate us any longer. If demons are to rule this land…
101	Then we must destroy all humans.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
102	…I couldn't agree more.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
103	(Especially the humans who made us suffer!)	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
104	(They're the worst of all! I'll hunt them down--every last one!)
105	Hm… You are still not ready to be king.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
106	…What do you mean?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0006
107	One such as myself cannot comprehend human emotions, however...as long as your vision is clouded by the past…
108	…You won't be able to achieve anything.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
109	…!
110	We're running out of time. I wish for your awakening as soon as possible.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
111	…!?
112	…Kagutsuchi. That confounded art.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
113	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
114	It must not be underestimated.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
115	We cannot let those filthy humans defeat us. That is why we must hurry.
116	…I know.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
117	…Look who decided to return.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
118	…I'm back.
119	…Kaede!! Are you alright!? You're not hurt, are you?	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
120	…I'm fine.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
121	Where have you been!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
122	Give her space, Tamba. First she needs to replenish her life force.
123	…Kaede, did you finally…devour a human?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
124	…No.
125	Is that so? You seem to have a surprising amount of life force remaining. Well, no matter.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
126	You proved that you can stand up to the humans in our previous battle. Make sure you don't make the same embarrassing mistake again.
127	…Understood.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0037
128	Curse that Kagutsuchi… To think it's too powerful even for you two…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
129	…The one obstacle we'll need to overcome if we're to expel the humans from Wadatsumi… We will destroy it--it's only a matter of time.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0010
130	…I’m relieved to hear you say that.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
131	…I'm sorry to have worried you.
132	…I wasn't worried, child. I leave that to him. Be sure to prepare adequately for our next battle.
133	...Tamba	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
134	I'm glad you're safe. Where have you been…?
135	…
