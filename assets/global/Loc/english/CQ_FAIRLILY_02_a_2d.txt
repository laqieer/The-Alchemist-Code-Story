001	Phew! Now that that's been taken care of... Nice to meet ya! The name's D'Artagnan.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
002	Pleased to meet you! I'm Fairily.	VO_fairlily.fairlily_chara_1001
003	You know, I was thinking about this while we were fighting, but you're as agile as a cat, aren't you? It's uncanny!	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0003
004	What?! I'm no cat! I'm a tiger! Rawrrrrrrr!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0012
005	O-oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you.	VO_fairlily.fairlily_battle_0019
006	Heheh. Don't worry. You didn't!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
007	I have a question for you, too, Fairily. Do you always hold back when you fight?
008	Wh-what?	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0025
009	I could tell that you were holding back against those Goblins, that's all.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0002
010	W-well... I'm not very good at controlling my powers, you see.	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0031
011	I always worry that I'll end up harming the flowers and trees around me, so I take special care when I fight, so as not to overdo it.
012	I gotcha. You're afraid to fight at full strength.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0045
013	In that case... Why don't we train together, Fairily?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
014	T-together?!	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0025
015	Us therians are always being targeted by poachers and traffickers. I've gotten pretty good at defending myself over the years.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
016	Is that why you're so strong?	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0044
017	Yep! Oh, but don't worry! Things are totally different here in Envylia!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
018	Nobody treats me differently just 'cause I'm a therian. They see me as me, and that's that.
019	That's why I'm gonna protect this country with everything I have!
020	Protect...it?	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0020
021	Oh! That explains why you were training with such ferocity earlier!
022	You got it! Come on, Fairily! Let's train together!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1008
023	W-well...	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0025
024	You want to be able to control your powers, don't you?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
025	Yes! I... I do! All right. I'll try!	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0004
026	Haaa... I can't...keep...going. Bana, bana... This isn't going well at all.	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0022
027	Keep those petals up, Fairily!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1004
028	You might not be able to control your powers right now, but so long as you keep practicing, you'll get there!
029	You've just gotta keep getting back up, like the grass under our feet. It might bend when we tread on it, but give it a second and it'll spring straight again!
030	Heheh... You make a good point. Thanks, D'Artagnan.	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0004
031	It also really helps to have someone or something in mind, to give you reason to get stronger, you know?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
032	For me, that's Envylia.
033	What about you, Fairily? Why do you wanna be able to control your powers? Why is that important to you?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
034	I...	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0006
035	Eek!	VO_fairlily.fairlily_battle_0019
036	Huh?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
037	That thing, it...! It coughed up a fireball!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0027
038	This is terrible! If we don't do something soon, the whole forest will be ablaze!	VO_fairlily.fairlily_sys_0028
039	Hurry! Rawrrrrrrrr!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0012
