001	I, Mocca of the Neva tribe, have returned. Is Fuu here?
002	... ...
003	Where is Fuu?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
004	... ...
005	I know you can hear me. What rudeness prompts you to ignore my question?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
006	Hmph. We have no words to spare for one who holds discourse with other factions.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
007	Exactly! Why would we let someone like you meet with Fuu! Don't make me laugh!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0037
008	Right now, all of Saga is...ack! Aghh!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
009	Hey... He's brought the blight with him.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
010	We, the faction of Fuu, are warriors! How dare you soil our name with your blight! You should be ashamed of yourself!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0040
011	Don't come near us. You'll spread your blight!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
012	Hmph! Haa! Hoo!	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1002
013	Fuu! It is I, Mocca from the Neva tribe. So, you are here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
014	Mocca, is it? Have you concluded your investigation into the massive outbreak of the Jam?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
015	Regarding my investigation, I still have not reached a definite conclusion yet.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
016	However, I've come to issue a report regarding valuable information that I've obtained.
017	The Gluttony army is behind the massive outbreak of the Jam.
018	The Gluttony army... Hmph. If only the cursed Tehre faction hadn't engaged in trade with Gluttony this could've all been prevented.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0045
019	Voda must have her hands full with the Jam wreaking havoc in her forests. If only they'd keep their problems to themselves.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
020	Fuu...perhaps that's a somewhat selfish take on the situation.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
021	I merely speak the truth. You've performed well. Now, stand down.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0007
022	Although we may belong to a different faction, we all live in the same land of Saga. Does this situation not concern you in the least?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
023	I said stand down.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
024	Fuu...will you say the same if or when such an outbreak occurs at Lilith's Hill?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
025	Hyahahahahahah! Don't worry. If or when such an outbreak occurs, I'll take care it.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0008
026	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
027	Do not underestimate the power of the Sprite Trio. We of the Fuu will protect the land of Saga.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
028	There is one who's foreseen the destruction of Saga.
029	Saga will not be destroyed. I will not allow it.
030	She also foresaw Voda's death at the hands of General Georgios of the Gluttony army!
031	Fuu, I'm sure that even you have noticed something is going on! There's a crisis that threatens to destroy all of Saga!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
032	... ...!
033	...We've got to hurry.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
