001	Ssshhh...hohhh...!
002	Impossible... Kaiser has been...defeated?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0021
003	...!
004	Kaiser's wound is healing?! What...what are you doing?!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0047
005	I've been doing it all this time. I've been sharing my power and healing the injured insects.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
006	All this time...? Then those insects that underwent metamorphosis...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0027
007	They're the ones that Liz healed. By no means was she trying to tame then.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
008	Lisbeth was just using Alchemy try to save the injured insects.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0022
009	That's absurd. That will cause the healed insects to...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0021
010	Exactly! Kaiser! Finish off the girl!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
011	... ...
012	What...why, Kaiser?! Hey, come back!	VO_salomo.salomo_battle_0027
013	That ant knows as well that there's no need to fight—that this conflict was pointless!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
014	You...! Did you do something to Kaiser?!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0002
015	All I did was remove the spell you put on him. I returned him to the ant that he was before meeting you.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
016	That's absurd! Are you saying that Kaiser didn't hate witches?!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0021
017	He was turned into an ant because he loved a witch. People are creatures that are meant to love each other!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
018	Are you saying that even this insect hasn't forgotten the love he felt as a human?!	VO_salomo.salomo_battle_0019
019	Salomo...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
020	Lord Salomo! Are you all right?! Leave this to us!	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0010
021	Tsk... Are they still gonna keep coming?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
022	I'm completely depleted.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0021
023	We withdraw.
024	Huh...?	VO_bugmale.bugmale_sys_0025
025	We've lost our trump card, and now we're stuck. Fallback and regroup. I can't afford to let you men die like dogs.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0033
026	U-understood! I'll inform all the troops!
027	Salomo!
028	Lisbeth...you were speaking almost as if you could fix the twisted nature of this country.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
029	Is there something that inspires hope within you?
030	Yes. It's something that probably only I can do.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
031	My hope has all but been extinguished. We've reached a stalemate. I'll leave the future of this country to your so-called hope...for now.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0005
032	Just know this: if this country continues to oppress men...next time, I swear that I'll crush you!
033	Well done, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
034	Now all that's left is to convince the queen!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
035	Yes! It seems like that'll be the most difficult...but we've gotten this far. Let's do it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0038
