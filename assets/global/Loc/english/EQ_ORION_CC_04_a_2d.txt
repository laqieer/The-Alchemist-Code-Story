008	...
009	This is unusual. I don't typically see you outside the castle at this time of day.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
010	Likewise. Come to pay your respects?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0004
011	It seems only fair I do. I wanted to congratulate you on being chosen. It pains me to admit it, but I wasn't able to keep up with you after all.
012	That's a rather hackneyed line.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
013	Well, it was a hard-fought victory. You made your dream a reality with your own two hands. Hackneyed or no, formal congratulations seemed in order.
014	I've done nothing worthy of congratulating. If that's all you came here to say, you might as well just leave.
015	What's got you in such a huff?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0031
016	Everything.
017	Then why not change it all? Now that you're the next in line for the throne, you should have all the power you need to change anything you want.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
018	Some things can't be changed with power and influence alone.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
019	Like what?
022	In this world, the privileged rule, while those who have nothing are simply used. And I've come to realize first-hand just how unappealing that whole system is.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
023	I don't follow you.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
024	"You aren't a very suitable choice after all." That's what His Majesty said about me.
025	What? What does that mean?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0025
026	The Sacred Stone Mammon is Greed itself, and thus hungers for a sizable and continuous offering from the one to whom it is bound...as you yourself well know.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
027	But what happens if it has difficulty receiving that offering? What happens if its ability to take that life force is in some way...hindered?
028	If it's not enough, you mean? In that case...I imagine it would begin to take more and more, eventually exhausting your life force entirely, no?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
029	And there you have it. Mammon isn't getting what it needs from me, and I cheated my way to the top in the first place. No part of me is prepared for the seat of the empire. I don't even have viable social standing.	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0019
030	Nonsense! What of your marriage to Wratharis?
031	That was all part of a greater plan—a ploy, to take Mammon away from you and see what became of me.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
032	...
033	And to think, people call me Thunder Wolf. I wasn't changing my destiny for even a moment. I was just dancing like a puppet. Rather pathetic, wouldn't you say?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0022
034	I fought so hard to become strong, only to learn I was playing the same games as everyone else all along...
035	I was just barely accepted by Mammon, but I couldn't keep it under control. I couldn't keep it...satisfied.
036	You remain Mammon's true chosen. I've shown it the Greed inside me, but I'm a mere stopover along the way. I'm the vacation, but you're the home.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0016
059	It seems all my talk of managing the despair you've had to deal with for so long was little more than bluster on my part. I don't have what it takes.
037	It's not like you to give up this easily!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
038	All of the remaining successors were sacrificed to Mammon, but it still wasn't enough.
039	What?! You held such disdain for the fight to become successor, yet you took it upon yourself to end it?!
040	It's a matter of priority. I gave Mammon their blood in place of yours.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
041	Doing so ensured that it would desire your blood over that of the masses.
042	Yes... I saw hope in your strength. I felt relief when you took the despair from me. In essence, I allowed it to happen.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0022
043	Which makes all of this my fault...
044	I will walk with Mammon, until the very last of my life force is taken from me.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0029
045	Even if I am to suffer eternal torment within Mammon, and become little more than a shell to house that torment...
048	Wait. These aren't assassins. These are... These are...!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0027
049	Imperial Security. They follow only the orders of the emperor.
050	Which makes this different from the assassination attempts upon you thus far. This...is a purge.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
053	No... No!
054	If you die, perhaps Mammon will finally give up on you, and focus all its efforts into giving me its protection instead.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
