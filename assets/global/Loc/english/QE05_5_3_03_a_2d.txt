001	Incredible... So this is the true might of the Sephira.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0025
002	No, that is the power wielded by one blessed by Sephiron herself, further augmented by the power of the Sacred Stone.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
003	Normally, there would be no Sephira, Protector or otherwise, capable of accessing such power.
004	More importantly... Are you sure about coming with us? It'll be dangerous.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
005	Yes. I have left the Liberation Army to Adelbert.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0037
006	There must be something I can do for Marie!
007	Kamui said that she might still be in there somewhere.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0016
008	If that's true, then...perhaps my voice can still reach her. If it can, then it is my responsibility to try—not only to save Marie, but everyone else, as well.
009	Only a coward would hesitate to try. I'm counting on you to help me, Georgios.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0041
010	Understood! I, the Flame-Armed General, shall swing my sword as you will it!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0006
011	Nngh! It's getting harder to advance against the surge!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
012	Don't tell me you're giving up already.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
013	Don't make me laugh! I've overcome lesser obstacles than this, countless times!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
014	Nrk... Just a bit further! The arboreal altar is...right...there!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
015	Leave the rearguard to me! Just keep going!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
