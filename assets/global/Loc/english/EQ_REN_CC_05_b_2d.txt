001	It's my first time seeing Sumeragi. But the Black Star blood flowing through me tells me that this is the real thing.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0045
002	So what are you going to do?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
003	This.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
004	Wh-what are you thinking?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
005	I'll let Sumeragi drink my blood. As much as possible.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0043
006	Are you trying to kill yourself?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
007	I won't live long no matter what I choose! I want to do everything I can for the people I leave behind.	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0019
008	Sumeragi's strength grows from drinking the blood of the Black Star...
009	I will give all my remaining strength to the blade.
010	So this is the extent of your passion. It's ironic that the best of us die so soon.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
011	If you truly regret my death, would you deliver Ren a message for me? I wrote a letter, but nothing seemed to come out right.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
012	I refuse. You should tell him yourself.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
013	...You're not wrong.
014	(Ren...)	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
015	(I'm so proud of you. That tiny little hand that held mine that day can now go wherever it pleases.)
016	My death is not in vain. I can leave it to you to carry on my will.
017	I hope you'll live freely in the place you belong with your eye on what is coming.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
018	...!
019	That's right... Natsume told me that Sumeragi was the key to defeating the demons.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
020	I never thought I would wield it. I hate to admit it, but it broke...	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
021	It wasn't me though, okay? Do you believe me?
022	Hey, Natsume...
023	You got so hung up on following rules and traditions, but did that really make you happy?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
024	Didn't you ever want to try following your heart?
025	Because I do—and I'm going to. From here on out, I'm going to choose my own path.
026	...
027	You know...	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
028	It was kinda frustrating.
029	I couldn't do it.
030	I...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
031	I wonder if I can...be there for someone, like they all were for each other?
032	Jin kept his promise to his baby sister...but you didn't get to see me keep mine. It's not fair.
033	Unlike Yomi...I wasn't able to meet you...one last time.
034	...
035	What's the big idea, huh?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
036	Couldn't you just hang in there a little longer? Just...until I got home?
037	Nobody...wants to be left behind.
038	Hey. Come on. Say something.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0019
039	Cause I...
040	Yeah, I know.	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
041	My other family is waiting for me.
042	At least I have a place to go back to, now.
043	Lucky me, huh?
044	I even start missing it when I'm away for too long.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
045	I'll have to show you around some time.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
046	I hope Vettel will welcome me back with open arms...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
047	That'd be...nice.
048	I belong there now. I think I feel different wielding my blade now. I could be wrong. But...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
049	I feel like I maybe understand a bit of what you told me.
050	I'll bear your burden, Natsume. Not because of any code, but because I want to.
051	I may not be able to bear it all.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
052	But for the people around me as well...
053	I'll do the best I can.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
054	Not the way you would have. But...I think doing it my way will be enough.
055	...Remember how we played with bubbles?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
056	I'd like to blow some with you again soon. It's been three years since you trained me.
057	I don't want you to leave me behind. Oh, but I'll pass on more training. Though looking back now, I only have fond memories of it... How strange.
058	By the way, your handwriting is terrible, you know? I couldn't read anything you wrote, especially near the end.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0008
059	But for some reason I still knew what it said. It went like this, didn't it?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
060	Please... Please...
061	Live a long life, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
062	You really are selfish.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
063	But I think it's the first time you've ever entrusted me with something.
064	I'll do it. Or at least, as much as I can.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0038
