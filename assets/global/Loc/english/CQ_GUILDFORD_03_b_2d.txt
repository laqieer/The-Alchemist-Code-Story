001	Urk...
002	I'm sure you are aware, but the creation of a Philosopher's Stone is a severe breach of the Magna Code.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0023
003	Did you really think changing your identity would be enough to evade the eyes of the Inquisition and continue your research?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0004
004	Silence! The completion of my research would have been an unprecedented advancement for this world! That should be the ambition of all researchers!
005	Chief Decel! You understand, don't you?! Don't you see the importance of my work?!
006	It's true, the production of Philosopher's Stones would open the door to unimaginable power...	VO_desel.desel_sys_0020
007	But that is why it's dangerous. It could incite wars among nations. Are you willing to shoulder the burden of that responsibility?
008	Th-that's not my problem! I can't be held accountable for the actions of politicians!
009	I have to disagree. Our research brings about the development of technology, and therefore paves the way for this continent's future.
010	We are responsible for that future. Isn't that why this job is exciting and worth the effort?
011	I now see your dignity.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0007
012	What?
013	Nothing. Take him away.
014	Yes, Sir!
015	...
016	We are finished with our inspection. I apologize for any inconvenience.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0016
017	Yeah, there was a lot of it.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0030
018	You barged into my laboratory, halted my research, and caused me such a headache.
019	But...had he successfully produced a Philosopher's Stone, I can't imagine what would have happened to my lab.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0031
020	Couldn't you have told me you were investigating him specifically?
021	I believe a research facility like this, dedicated to revolutionary advancements in technology, would accept my unconventional theories and research.
022	That's... That's the statement of purpose he wrote when applying for this job.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
023	According to our investigation, he was extremely interested in your research. Said something about how he felt kinship to your point of view.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0005
024	Somehow, I'm not flattered.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0031
025	Regardless, he misinterpreted your sense of responsibility. Sooner or later he would have shown his true nature.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0031
026	What?
027	Responsible for this continent's future, eh? An arrogant and overconfident statement if I ever heard one.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0010
028	You have a problem with that? We researchers have to have some confidence in our work!	VO_desel.desel_sys_0050
029	No, no problem at all. We can't be shortchanging the children by compromising their future.
030	But remember this: if you ever go against the Magna Code, I will not hesitate to hunt you down.
031	I will be strict. I will be pitiless. Without order today, there is no future for anyone tomorrow.
032	...I should be on my way. I've already spent too much time on this case.
033	Yeah, don't ever come back. Well, as an Inquisitor, that is.
034	...Heh.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0007
035	U-um...!
036	Hm?
037	Thank you for saving me the other day!
038	Decel told me all about you! How you look really scary but you're actually really nice!
039	...!
040	We should have a staring contest sometime! I bet I can make you laugh, mister!
041	Mister?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0025
042	Mister... Heh...	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0008
