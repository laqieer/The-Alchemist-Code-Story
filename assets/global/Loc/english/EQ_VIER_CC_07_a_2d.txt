001	Lack of sleep has its risks.
002	Stress builds up, your immune system falters, disease abounds and death rates climb...
003	I wonder if smoking shortens your lifespan.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
004	Now that I've lost the ability to sleep, I can't do without the soothing fragrance.
005	Perhaps it is a poison for my body, but I can't quit it.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
006	If I could sleep...I'd feel so much better.
007	The night is unending.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
008	What a dull thing so say. So boring it might actually put me to sleep.
009	They say you start to see things if you go too long without sleeping.
010	Does sleeping fulfill your dreams, then?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
011	Let me sleep.
012	After living for all these hundreds of years...that's all you dream of achieving?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
013	Let me sleep.
014	A clean way to die, don't you think?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
015	Death is death. There's nothing nice or clean about it.
016	A pure, sinless life is nothing but a dream. That's just wasted breath.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
017	No one consciously makes a decision to live a bad life.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0002
018	Wishing for a nice future, predicting such a thing and waiting tens of hundreds of years for it to come true...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
019	For the day there is no more struggle, no more suffering. The day I don't dread what might come tomorrow.
020	My days have been haunted by that waking dream of such a life. The years have passed as I lost myself to it.
021	But no matter how far I go to try to escape it, I hate my race, I hate myself, I hate the future, and I hate the past.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0029
022	There is only punishment waiting around every corner, every turn in the road.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
023	All that lives on forever is the sin I carry of having tricked you! If putting me to sleep is an execution, then do it!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
024	Tell me! What kind of teacher even are you if you can't even tell me where I can sleep?!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
025	Holding onto vast dreams will only crush you.
026	I've had many dreams, and abandoned them.
027	The fulfillment of even the smallest dream is a combination of joy and sorrow.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
028	After so long, the desire to sleep long and deep...
029	Is that so wrong?!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
030	No.
031	However, I...may have a tendency...to be a little too strict.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
032	You are! And stingy, too! I can't go on like this!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
033	When you struggle to sleep, the night air assaults your skin, does it not? As it does me.
034	Your sheets stick to you, clinging and suffocating, trapping all your feverish heat...
035	So you get out of bed.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
036	You start to think, "Maybe I'll just stay up until dawn."	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
037	...
038	I've slept and woken like this for hundreds of years... Repeating the same cycle every night, thousands or tens of thousands of times...
039	Then you must be tired of it.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
040	...
041	It was the same for us.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
042	Sleeping forever means never waking. It means never living again.
043	Never...living...
044	...
045	What a terrible memory.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
046	We should make it nicer.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
047	Waking is awful.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
048	Hey...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
049	Yes?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0004
050	I'm not good at figuring things out, like a young girl blinded by hazy dreams.
051	I'm sick of brushing off bad dreams and trying to forge on with positivity and optimism.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
052	I'm just waiting for the poison to lead me to my death.
053	I close my eyes, thinking that if I can't die today, I might tomorrow.
054	Is it enough to go on living so with so little resolution?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
055	Is it?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
056	...
057	That's...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
058	I'd rather you said it was.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
