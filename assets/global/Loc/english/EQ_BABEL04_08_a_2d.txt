001	I swore on the setting sun before his grave.
002	I will live on, shouldering all that it means to be of my clan.
003	My brother's affection, his dishonor, Kagomurasaki's shame, and Wadatsumi's fate... All this is mine to bear.
004	It all rests on my shoulders.
005	My all-consuming burden.
006	The sun will set and night will come.
007	That shooting star my brother and I made our promise upon lights my way.
008	I walk on.
009	The conflict between the Shiba Senko and the Kagomurasaki has never been worse.
010	Rumors that a Kagomurasaki ninja, Jin, had manifested the Discarnate Power to conquer Wadatsumi were already making the rounds, but...
011	A new rumor spread that Yomi, leader of the Kagomurasaki and now wielder of the Mikaboshi—a stone with powers comparable to that of the Sacred Stones—planned to bring Wadatsumi to its knees.
012	The Shiba Senko, trumpeting these rumors as their justification, declared open war against the Kagomurasaki.
013	Rivers of blood ran throughout Wadatsumi as the civil war plunged the country into chaos.
014	They're here.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
015	I take it that you are Yomi, leader of the Kagomurasaki.
016	I am.
017	Your life is forfeit.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
018	You, too, believe the lies?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0010
019	There is no denying that you killed our leader and many of our brethren.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
020	Hm.
021	For the sake of peace, you must die.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
022	Someday, I will clear my name.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
023	The fate of my clan resides with me. I cannot halt for a moment.
024	So, for now, I have no choice but to press on.
025	Yomi, we'll watch your back. You just march forward.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
026	You can count on us!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0037
027	I appreciate it!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0033
028	Prepare yourself.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
029	This is war.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
030	As I march forward, I know my allies are at my back as I swing my blade forward.
031	I have no blind spots.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0010
032	Give me back my brother!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0008
