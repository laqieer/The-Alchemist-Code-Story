001	I walked alone, with nowhere to go and no place to call my home.
002	I swung my blade. Not to gain anything, but to avoid losing anything more.
003	Though I didn't have anything left to lose, I could never forgive seeing someone just...take something from someone else.
004	That's all there was to it. That's the only purpose I ever needed. And yet...
005	It was only when I swung my sword that I was able to forget that feeling. Only in those brief moments...
006	I can just leave the bucket here, right?
007	Yeah! You're so strong, Setsuna. That bucket was full of water!
008	You'll be able to pick it up soon enough, Jayme. As long as you keep training, of course.
009	I'll be as strong as you one day, Setsuna! Heheheh! I can't wait!
010	Training's not all fun and games, you know.
011	Well, yeah...but I'm just saying things have been great since you came here.
012	I really like having you around, Setsuna.
013	...
014	Welcome home, Jayme.
015	Hey, Sis!
016	You, too, Setsuna. Welcome home.
017	Macherie... Uh, hi.
018	I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be making our guest draw water for us.
019	This is the least I could do. I appreciate the two of you letting me stay here for so long.
020	For so long? Why, you've only just arrived!
021	I should have been gone a long while ago.
022	What? Setsuna, you're not leaving town, are you?
023	Well...I should.
024	I promised myself not to get attached to anything or anyone. I convinced myself that I don't need them, but...
025	I don't want to hold you back from what you want to do, but I still haven't had a chance to repay you for saving my life yet.
026	Please, stay for a while longer. I'm sorry. I know we don't have much to offer, but...
027	Well, I haven't thanked you enough yet, either.
028	Oh, not at all. You've done plenty for us!
029	Still, I feel like I could do more.
030	You two are weird. Stop thanking each other.
031	Heheh. Kid's got a point.
032	If we continue on like this, we'll end up repaying each other for the rest of our lives.
033	Don't worry, I'll be gone before then.
034	B-but...
035	But...I'll stick around for a while longer.
036	Really?!
037	After all, I have to train you up, Jayme.
038	Yeah! I'm gonna be so strong after I get through your training!
039	Heheh. Well, for starters, you have to be sure to eat well and grow bigger.
040	Perfect! I was just thinking about how hungry I am!
041	Then let's go wash our hands and have some breakfast. I'll get the plates ready.
042	Oh, lemme help!
043	Sure. If you don't mind.
044	How long has it been?
045	When was the last time I lived a life like this with others?
046	And for so long?
047	Why?
048	I ask myself questions I already know the answers to.
049	I already know.
050	The most important things I lost...they're right here.
051	They're here and flowing with the passage of time.
052	I'm stuffed!
053	Thank you for the meal.
054	Hmhm. You're very welcome.
055	You're taking your time this morning, huh, Sis?
056	The shrine maidens told me to come in a little later than usual today.
057	I would have thought that an apprentice like you would have to be there early to make preparations.
058	That's usually how it is, but they said they needed to make preparations for some ritual.
059	A ritual?
060	Some kind of ceremony. They said there are parts that they can't allow me to take part in yet.
061	I...see.
062	Oh! Does that mean you get to watch me train with Setsuna for a bit?
063	I'm not sure if I have that much time to spare...
064	Oh...
065	Why don't you ask Macherie to look over your homework?
066	That should be fine. Jayme, will you show me your notes?
067	Really?! Yeah! I haven't had Sis help me study in forever!
068	I'll leave you two to it. I'd like to spend some time getting to know this village better.
069	All right. I suppose you don't need to hear this from me, but please do be careful.
070	Yes. Thank you.
071	...
072	I mustn't forget that I won't get back what I lost just by spending time with them.
073	What am I doing? Ridiculous...
074	...
075	I should just go around the village once and head back.
076	And then, Setsuna's sword went fwoosh! I couldn't see it at all!
077	That's amazing. I bet you'll get so strong since you have such a talented teacher.
078	No, no, no! That doesn't matter! Setsuna said it's daily dedication that'll make me strong!
079	Hmhm. Then I guess you'll have to work really hard.
080	Oh! Hello, Setsuna.
081	How is the studying going?
082	Well, I asked him how his training with you is going, and we seem to have gotten sidetracked.
083	You're so awesome, Setsuna!
084	Hmhm. Jayme keeps saying that. He is really very fond of you.
085	I didn't think our training would make for such an interesting tale.
086	How couldn't it?! It's exhausting, but I'm getting super strong because of it!
087	It's only a wooden sword, but it looks so much cooler in her hands compared to when I hold it!
088	There's nothing cool about it in my opinion.
089	Is something the matter, Setsuna?
090	Oh, uh... It's nothing.
091	I know! Tell me about that time Setsuna fought with a real sword again!
092	Do you mean the time Setsuna saved me?
093	Yeah! You took out a giant bird, right?!
094	Well, I don't know if it's a story that's as interesting as how you've made our training sound.
095	Oh man, I wish I'd been there to see it.
096	Well, I for one am glad you weren't there in harm's way.
097	Okay...but I still wanna hear about it!
098	I suppose it's fine. It's just a story.
099	If Setsuna's all right with it, then so am I. But to be clear, I don't want you ever going out too far on your own, Jayme. Do you promise?
100	I promise!
101	Well... I'd gone out of the village to read the wind, when I was suddenly attacked by a giant bird.
