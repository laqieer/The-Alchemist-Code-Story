001	What is going on? It's highly unusual for any beasts to begin attacking people at this time of the night.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
002	In addition, that frenzied appearance... Something is not right with the great Sephiron... Come to think of it, what are you even doing here, Hisham?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
003	K-Kamui, I'm sorry, but...I heard a voice.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
004	A voice?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
005	Yeah, exactly! I am sure I heard a voice calling me, coming from Sephiron. A familiar voice... Nngh... My head...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
006	Hisham! We can speak later. You should head home and rest.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
007	B-but... I'm sure that voice... My mother...!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0017
008	Is this...your memories coming back?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
009	I'm not sure, but... Please, Kamui! I have to know! I have to follow that voice!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
010	Fine, but I'm coming with you. Those beasts should keep their distance if I do.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
011	Where is the voice coming from?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
012	Over there.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
013	The arboreal altar lies in that direction. Could Sephiron be responding to Hisham's Alchemia...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
014	No, this isn't the time to be contemplating such matters. Hisham, be sure to stay with me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
015	O-okay...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
