001	Ack...	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
002	I don't think...that sacrifice is a part of love.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
003	What?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0026
004	There's something wrong with this country! Loving someone is supposed to add to that person's life, right?!
005	Yet, in this country, sacrifice is a part of love. That's not adding that's subtracting!
006	Whether that's wrong or not, that is this country's fate.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0009
007	The curse that the abominable witch left...
008	To protect myself and this country from that curse, these people die, yet continue to be a part of me...that is love in this country.
009	If you are one of my citizens, then before you bring about disaster, it would be best if you died for all of us!
010	If you think those shadows that surround you is "love," then, Your Highness...do you really love those people?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
011	Of course, I do. It's the queen's duty to love her people.	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0010
012	Then why did those people die?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0012
013	If love protects you and this country, why did the mages that you love have to die! It doesn't make sense!
014	They are still alive, are they not? They live within me! That is the ultimate form of love—	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0011
015	How can someone who kills her own body be capable of love!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0040
016	How dare you deny your queen's love!	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0012
