001	Amane, how are you managing over there?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
002	Oh, I'm good! ...Nngh!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
003	Amane?! Dear me! I forgot how much energy it takes for you to keep us all here.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
004	Please do not concern yourself with me. This is my burden to bear.
005	Ohh! You've become so strong!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
006	...I had a good role model.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
007	Well, if you're sure you can keep it up, then!
008	Are we really just going to...eat? At a time like this?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0016
009	Did... Did you just make light of the need to eat?
010	Uh-oh.
011	Ouch!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
012	Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal! Say it!
013	Huh...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
014	Say it!
015	S-strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!
016	There we go. Now, then... Let's get some food in you!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
017	What a beautiful spread, wouldn't you say? So... Bon appetit!
018	Thank you, Celis!
019	Mmm! This is amazing...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
020	Right? Celis is the best cook ever.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0024
021	But, uh... What is it, exactly?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
022	That's the problem with trying to cook inside a dagger world. You can't go fighting on an empty stomach, but ingredient options are awfully limited here. I only could make some simple rice balls.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
023	They're a common dish among those in Wadatsumi, so I hope you'll find them to your liking.
024	Oh? So this is part of day-to-day life among the people here?
025	That's right. Of course, it isn't all they eat, but it's definitely a staple of the lifestyle here.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
026	Though now there are people who can't even enjoy such modest pleasures due to the evil that threatens the land. Even a modest gathering like this is a thing of the past for many of them.
027	...Those poor people were robbed of everything.
028	Exactly. It's truly heartbreaking. There's no way to change the past, but I know the two of you can change the future. 
029	The...two of us...
030	I've passed on, so I can't do anything more out there myself, unfortunately. But I know in my heart what you're capable of. You're my son. Mine and Zeke's. It's in your blood.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
031	...
032	You've truly grown so big. Must be all that milk you drank when you were a child. You refused to drink anything else. How old were you when you broke out of that habit, I wonder?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
033	I'm sorry... I don't remember anything from back then.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
034	I understand. You were still so young. To think, I left you before I could ever see you grow into the man you are now... I can never apologize enough.
035	I'm so sorry, Logi.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
036	...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
037	Huh? Celis' dagger has started glowing again! What's going on?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
044	Oopsie-daisy! Looks like he's a little restless. Such a feisty little one!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0024
045	I told you he might wake up if you stared at him too hard! People can sense that, you know. I understand, it's...hard not to look. But you have to give him a little space sometimes.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
046	Ah, well. There, there. It's okay! Daddy's here.
047	I'm sorry for waking you up.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0034
048	(Father? What...is this voice?)
049	(Are these...my memories?)
050	Sorry, Logi. We were a little too noisy, weren't we? Let me wipe off some of that drool.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
051	(Wait! I know that handkerchief!)
052	Well, isn't this just perfect? Let's all have some lunch together!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
053	(...!)
054	How lovely. The entire family around the dinner table. I couldn't ask for a more perfect moment.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0009
055	Right? Well, then...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
056	Let's dig in, shall we?
057	Logi's been so good about drinking his milk lately!
058	He's definitely going to grow up big and strong. Look at him, already learning his first words and starting to walk!
059	Kids grow up so quickly. He'll be running around and getting himself into trouble before we know it.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
060	I know it's a bit silly, but I'll rather miss these days of wiping drool when he gets older.
061	I pray that he'll get to grow during a time of peace across these lands.
062	Yeah... Me too.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
063	(Ah...)
064	I wonder what kind of man you'll be. Well, as long as you live a happy life, it doesn't really matter, does it? You can be whatever you wish.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
065	Cherish your everyday life, my precious son. I just hope beyond that we can always have some small part in it.
066	(...)
067	I'll be there by your side, whenever I possibly can.
068	(Ah!)
069	Stop saying that! You'll jinx it. They say making promises like that invites bad luck.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0001
070	Haha, I suppose you're right. But that's enough talk for now! The food's getting cold. Let's finish our lunch!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
071	...
072	Well... I'd better get going.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
073	All right. Though, what do you want to do about this?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0005
111	The dagger? What do you mean? I said before, we're to pass it to Logi when he grows up. It's to be a symbol of our thoughts and prayers for his future success and happiness.
112	I know. But since that was your idea, I thought you should be the one to give it to him. So I'd like you to hang onto it, until that day comes.
113	I'll still continue sending my prayers to it as well, from afar. I won't forget.
114	All right. If you insist.
074	Though, on the subject of Logi...
075	Don't worry, I'll work twice as hard to raise him, for the both of us.
076	Thank you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0050
077	...This might the last time I'll be able to wipe your tears away, little one.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0047
078	Please, be happy. And know that even if I can't be by your side...
079	I'll aways be thinking of you. You will always have a place in my heart.
080	The everyday life I'll be fighting for from here on out will no longer be one that includes you...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
081	...but I hope you'll find an everyday life of your own one day, that's worth just as much to you.
115	(Aah...)
116	I guess this is the end. I can't even move my body. All that's left for me now is to pray.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0022
117	At least I can still send my prayers to you, even while we're apart... And even in death, I pray that my wishes for you will still be granted.
118	I put all my thoughts, wishes, and prayers into this dagger, so...Amane, may you inherit it, and pass it along to my dear son.
119	I've never stopped thinking about him since then. I've never stopped wishing for all the best things in life to come his way. I hope that somehow, those feelings have reached him.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0020
120	(Aah...aaah...)
121	My friends... My comrades... Amane... Logi...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0018
122	I couldn't make our wishes come true, but please...continue to...
123	...protect...the sanctity...of your daily lives...	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
124	(You... You took it so far...)
082	...
125	So...this is what it means...to connect with the thoughts and emotions...inside in an object...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
083	Amane?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
084	I never knew Father could smile like that.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0011
085	Hmm?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
086	I never knew that we had such warm and lovely meals together.
087	Logi, you...
088	Can I ask you something?
089	Of course! Anything.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
090	The everyday lives and livelihoods you fought to protect in Wadatsumi...are countless, aren't they?
091	Well, of course! And they meant even more to me when I considered your father's and...your connection to this place.
092	That's why I fought as a captain in the Blade Fox to the very end.
093	That's what I thought. And I think I've finally found the commonality in the daily lives we each put ourselves out there for.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
094	And I swear I will continue to protect Wadatsumi in your place.
126	I will fully inherit your will. Because I, too, want to protect this everyday life.
127	Your feelings, and your prayers...have indeed reached me, loud and clear!
095	I'm so glad. You've grown into such a fine young man, Logi.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
096	Amane! You can't keep going like this!
099	Thank you, Amane. Remember to eat properly. I hope you'll stay well.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
101	Celis... I promise we'll return peace to Wadatsumi. We'll protect this place. You have my word.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
103	Mother...
104	Amane, thank you for calling me here. And Logi... Thank you for calling me Mother.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0050
105	The rice balls were delicious.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
106	Thank you for the hearty meal.
107	Logi...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
108	I'm ready now, Amane. I can feel it. I appreciate you keeping this active for so long.
109	My mother cherished Wadatsumi just as dearly as you. She gave her life to protect it, just as you no doubt would in a heartbeat. So I, too...
110	...will defend it to my last breath!
