001	What exactly happened on the night of Alia's purging?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
002	...The moon was noticeably large on that night Alia summoned me.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
003	Alia summoned you?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0025
004	Yes. He summoned me, yet remained silent when I went to him.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
005	... ...
006	How about you say something? You were the one who called me here, Alia.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0030
007	Kakkakka! Sorry, I got caught up in gazing at the moon's beauty. Don't you think it's beautiful?
008	You know what a moonlit sky like this calls for? Wine! You wouldn't happen to have any wine on you by any chance, Fuu? Ah, that's right. You don't drink.
009	Why didn't you say anything about Beelzebub?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
010	Come now. Why would I place such a heavy burden on a youngster like you?
011	Can you be serious for a moment?! I know you understand the gravity of the situation!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
012	I'm always serious. You just get a little too worked up. Come on. Relax those shoulders of yours.
013	Alia! Enough...!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
014	Sacred Stones...they can cause one to go mad. Just look at the recent Lion Monarch's Charge...now that's a perfect example. You never know who and when someone may be after it.
015	...! You could've told us. You didn't have to shoulder the burden alone!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
016	Kakkakka! If something were to happen, it would've been enough for the people of Saga to direct their blame and hatred towards an old decrepit like me.
017	That's not what I mean!	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
018	If you had relied on us more, we could've done something about it sooner!
019	Would you have been able to reduce the damage caused by the Veda Templars? ...Ah, look. A shooting star.
020	Alia! I'm being serious with you!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
021	Kakkakka! I'm quite serious myself. Wine always tastes best on a moonlit night like this. Wouldn't you agree, Fuu?
022	Enough! You're not the only one who is shouldering the weight of Saga's future.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
023	That's why...you should've relied on us more.
024	I find your words reassuring. You give me confidence that I can leave the rest to you when I'm gone.
025	Alia!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0018
026	Enough, Fuu! You must face reality.
027	...!
028	You underestimate the power of Beelzebub.
029	If it were to go on a rampage, it has the power to engulf not only Saga...but the entire world!
030	It was my blunder that led to them learning of Beelzebub's whereabouts...thus, I'll take full responsibility.
031	I broke the law of Saga and brought about a crisis in the land...I, the Wind Sprite.
032	I doubt there's anyone who'd hold a single mistake you made against you. You've saved Saga countless times!	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
033	Someone must pay the price for Saga to be restored to its old ways of life.
034	Pay the price...? What do you mean?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
035	Kakkakkakka! I want you to see me off, Fuu.
