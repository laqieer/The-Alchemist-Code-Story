001	If the Beckrams don't know where she is either, then there's only one person who knows.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
002	Ethan!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
003	Yep. Unfortunately, we're back to the beginning.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
004	Seems we've no other choice but to rescue him from the Beckrams' mansion and ask him directly.
005	That's...impossible...	VO_aj3000.aj3000_sys_0018
006	Yo-you're still alive! Aye, you're a stubborn one, aren't you!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0012
007	Hold on, Alkemono. What do you mean that's impossible?
008	...Heh...heheh... To-tomorrow...that man...is...going to be executed.
009	Ethan...?! Executed?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
010	...I-it's unfortunate... That I can't...see...the disappointment on your faces...	VO_aj3000.aj3000_sys_0019
011	Jeez. What an unladylike parting speech.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
012	N-no! Why have things ended up like this?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
013	...No need to mourn yet. In fact, you should be happy.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
014	...Why?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
015	Look at it the other way around. If he's going to be executed tomorrow, it means that he'll definitely be alive until then.
016	If he's still alive, it means there's a chance we can rescue him...right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
017	Yes...
018	We can perceive the situation as hopeless or hopeful. Tweaking our perspective can sometimes open new possibilities.
019	...I think we've still got plenty of opportunities here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
020	Yes! We must do whatever we can to rescue him. Edgar, please lend me your strength!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0004
021	It's like seeing a wilted flower suddenly blossom afresh again. You can count on me, mademoiselle.
022	Now that's decided, let's hurry. Alkemono, show us the route to where the execution will take place.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
023	I don't know, aye.
024	Huh? Why?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
025	For starters, here in Slothstein, we don't have something as ominous as an execution site.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
026	I'm sure it's somewhere in one of the Beckrams' facilities.
027	Where are those facilities?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
028	There are as many as the stars, aye. There's no easy way of determining their location.
029	What?!
030	Hey, you! Wake up!
031	Its functions have been terminated. It's too late, aye.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0011
032	Tsk...! We don't have any time. This is not good!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
033	Wow! I never knew the Beckrams had so many facilities!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
034	I guess we can't afford to go knocking on all of them. We need to somehow obtain information.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
035	But...I doubt the Alkaloids created by the Beckrams will easily give up any.
036	I'm back. They only had a beef pastrami sandwich.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0004
037	That's great. Here you go, little lady.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
038	... ...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
039	...What's the matter? This looks pretty good too, doesn't it?
040	Yes. It's just that when I think about how, while we spend time here, Ethan's life is in danger...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
041	All the more reason. Even if we lament over our present situation, it won't change anything. When it becomes necessary...
042	We need to make sure we're in a state to move when it becomes necessary.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
043	Right. Food is part of what is required to pave a path ahead. Thank you, Ronnie.
044	Heh. You're starting to catch on.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
045	Destiny is not something you wait for, but something you reach out and grasp.
046	You're the one who enabled me to think this way, Edgar. We need to do what we can for now.
047	Exactly. In any case, we've no other options now. Let's try and ask them.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
048	Guard Droid approaching! Guard Droid approaching!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
049	Whoa! That was fast! Careful...here they come!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
