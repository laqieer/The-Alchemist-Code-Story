001	But, how?! Last time I saw you, you were—
002	You think I could stand to just sit by wallowing in defeat? All it took was a bit of training and rehabilitation, and I'm good as new.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
003	But, your arm...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
004	As Second Captain of Blade Fox, I'm not about to let losing an arm prevent me from fulfilling my duties!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
005	Well, you certainly haven't changed, have you?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0038
006	That's some frightening precision. That blade is being held at just the right angle to lop off someone's head, cleanly and with little effort. Looks simple, but it takes serious training to learn that!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0021
007	What are you doing? We're withdrawing!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
008	But... Can't we win?
009	I can't take on every single one myself. Maybe if you fell in line a bit more, we could eke out a victory!
010	Oh, come on!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
011	Yeah, that's no way to talk to a lady, Captain!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
012	Even so, your judgment may be spot on. Question is, if we're withdrawing, where are we withdrawing to?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
013	Shut up and follow me.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0047
014	Where are we?
015	...Home.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
016	The Blade Fox! You're all okay!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
017	I don't know if I'd say we're okay, considering how much our numbers have dwindled.
018	But the Demon Elimination Corps, Blade Fox, is still at least hanging in there. And we'll continue to do so, if only out of respect for those who've made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.
019	So this is...everyone? All under your command?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
020	Jubei and I share command over what little regiment we have left.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
021	Jubei?! Whereabouts might she be? And... Umm, Captain Ugachi?
022	Even without your arm, can you... Uhh, that is to say, are you...still able...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
023	I know what you're trying to say, rookie. Next time, just get your words together and say it. Don't be so mealy-mouthed.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0029
024	Gah! So abrasive! Yet strangely nostalgic...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
025	Jubei is currently out on another mission. We knew you'd be returning shortly, so the timing seemed apt.
026	And you needn't worry about me. I only require one arm to wield a blade.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
027	But...
028	How could I live with myself if I didn't fight—if I didn't do everything I could to uphold her memory?
029	...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
030	I understand.
031	Then hurry up and give me your report, rookie.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
032	All right, I've been mostly quiet so far, but I don't think I like your tone of voice with Amane very much!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
033	...You can start by explaining to me just who this irritating man is.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
034	He looks more like a rooster than a soldier.
035	You've got some nerve, you know that?! I barely know you and my blood's already boiling!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
036	Good. Maybe you can channel that. We wouldn't have any use for you if you couldn't fight.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
037	I'm not sure where you came from or what your story is, but we'll have to see if you're truly ready for what's to come when you stick your neck in Wadatsumi's business.
038	Edgar! Captain Ugachi!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
039	Bring it on. Hope I don't leave you crying too hard in front of your troops.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
040	And I hope you can back up all that bluster.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0010
041	Hyaaaaaah!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0007
042	How did it come to this...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
