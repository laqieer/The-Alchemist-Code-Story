001	(Wadatsumi is ensnared...by law...by Demon's Blood, and by the chains of destiny.)	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
002	(Yomi...I have to save you!)	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
003	...
004	You... Who are you?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
005	WRAAAAAAAAAGH!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0008
006	?!
007	What are you doing?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
008	Heh... Dodged everything, huh? You're pretty strong, but...you're not serious yet.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0044
009	Hurry up and show me what you've got! Let's fight until our heart's content!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
010	I don't know why, but... This life is not so cheap that I will stay quiet and let you kill me.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0013
011	There are still things I must do!
012	Heh... I know that kunai. That's one made through the secret arts of my hometown! So, you were the one who destroyed and pillaged it, huh?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0004
013	What did you say?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
014	I came back because I'd heard that my village was destroyed by someone. I was curious to see how strong that someone was.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0005
015	Talking is pointless. Let's find out through glorious battle.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0011
016	That's...!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
017	This is another secret art from my hometown... I can clad my blade in qi!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
018	You destroyed my town and pillaged it!
019	So...that was your hometown. You're wrong. I wasn't the one who—	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
020	Don't get me wrong! I don't want to fight you because of some kind of grudge.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0007
021	It's all for my path of conquest! I will reign over Wadatsumi and restore it to its former glory!
022	I will make everyone and everything submit to my power! For that reason, I seek out strong people to fight. That's my way of life!
023	You... I'm looking for the nourishment to keep me walking on my path of conquest, so let's go! Fight me with everything you've got!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0006
024	This is why I didn't want to fight you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
025	Haaaaaaargh!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0008
026	Ngh!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
027	I can't allow myself to be defeated here. My own destiny is riding on this, too! Therefore...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0012
028	If you stand in my way, I will kill you!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0007
