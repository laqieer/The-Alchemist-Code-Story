001	Welp, it's that time of year again!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
002	Looks like we're on security detail this year. Everyone is gonna be spending time with their loved ones out there, and it's our job to make sure they stay safe!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
003	Wow Ishuna, you're taking this really seriously. I think that's great. 	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0044
004	Well, yeah. I mean, the winter holiday's for the kids, right?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
005	It's our duty to protect their smiling little faces!
006	So sleepy... Ishi...pillow...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
007	Kiyaa!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0022
008	You're going to use Ishuna as your pillow!? Wait, really!?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
009	Owowow...cut it out Rochelle. What are you doing?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
010	Yeah, she makes a good pillow. Very comfy.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
011	...zzz.
012	Hey! No more using people as pillows! Wake up!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
013	Just gimme...five more minutes...
014	How are you gonna guard anything while you're asleep!?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0014
015	It's fine. I'll wake up at the first sign of danger.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0010
016	Just watch out for wild beasts, right? I'll protect people my way and you protect them your way. You know how strong I am.
017	Well all that strength isn't going to be much help if you sleep through the whole event.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
018	Mer...
019	Jeez... Well anyway, once the mission's over, we're all gonna have a party again right?
020	Yep, that's the plan. I've let the others out there on missions know as well.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
021	It sounds like Michael and Lofia are really looking forward to it.
022	Perfect, can't wait! Let's all get out there in the snow after the party too!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0007
023	Ooh, now there's an idea. I am always up for a snowball fight.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
024	Same! ...But our mission comes first!
025	It definitely makes it easier to give it your all when you know there's something good waiting at the other end, right?
026	Ehehe, well seems like you were gonna give it your all regardless.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
027	I remember you said you wanted to protect the winter holiday before too. You worked really hard. You've got a good heart, Ishuna.
028	Yeah, she's always been like that. She's definitely on the nice list. I bet she'll get some amazing presents.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
029	It must be nice to have something to look forward to...
030	Huh? What does that mean?
031	Excuse me! Hi. Do you ladies know if any decorations for snow sculptures have arrived recently?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
032	Huh? Decorations? Oh, I'm not sure. But we're actually the security detail, so...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
033	Oh, really? Security? Ah, I'm very sorry. My mistake.
034	Just, this is usually where the packages arrive, so I thought you must be working delivery...
035	This isn't good at all. How am I supposed to win the contest if I can't even finish my sculpture... I was planning on giving the prize to my kid too...
036	The snow sculpture display is supposed to be the centerpiece of the event, right? You should really talk to the manager or something...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
037	Well, I guess I'll just have to make due. Maybe I can find something else to use instead.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
038	He isn't even listening...
039	There he goes. He certainly seemed worked up. I hope the contest will be ok...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0011
040	It better! Cause we're gonna enter it!
041	Huh? Oh, so you must be the son of that man, then.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0003
042	Yep!
043	What's that guy doing running off without his own kid?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
044	Maybe he was so panicked he forgot?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
045	Papa said he's definitely going to win. I can't wait!
046	The prize for the contest is goods from the Maruda Tribe. He knows how much I love them, so he's trying really hard to win.
047	He special ordered the decorations from a famous craftsman who lives in the forest. "I'll make the perfect snow sculpture! Just you watch!" he said...
048	But actually, I kind of wish we could have made it together...
049	...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0027
050	...Ah! Maybe when he's done making the snow sculpture, he'll want to play with me!
051	Oh, I'm sure he'd love to!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
052	Really!?
053	...What was with that boy? He seemed so lonely, even though it's the holidays.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
054	Hm... I wonder.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
055	I don't get it. Bears go out and hunt to bring things back for their cubs. Seems normal enough to me.
056	Um, bears?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
057	You mean the dad just wants to make his son happy, right? I understand that, but...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
058	How did you understand that!?
059	But that boy looked so lonely. The holidays are supposed to be a happy time for children. His dad's going about it all wrong.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
060	Oh, now I see...
061	Wow, you're pretty insightful, Ishuna. I had no idea.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0044
062	Ehehe, I told you she's amazing! An amazing pillow!
063	Hey, come on. I was just trying to be understanding.
064	Yep, you always are!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0005
065	Maybe instead of just congratulating me, you could try to be a little more understanding too.
066	Hahaha, you guys are like two peas in a pod!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
067	Hehe
068	*sigh* Anyway.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
069	That man mentioned something about decorations. They must be somewhere, right?
070	He said he ordered them from a famous craftsman in the forest. I think that's the same one that sells goods at the holiday market in the next town over.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
071	Maybe they got sent over there by mistake?
072	It's certainly a possibility...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
073	...Got it. Then I'll head over there and check it out. Black and white bears are really fast, you know.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
074	Can you handle that?
075	Once the decorations are found and the snow sculpture is complete, everything will work out for the best.
076	You were the one who said it's our duty to protect the kids' smiles, Ishi.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
077	So I'm gonna protect them. That's part of my duty as a guard!
078	I get the feeling it will take more than just finding the decorations to make that boy happy again, but...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
079	I agree... But maybe once the snow sculpture is completed, his dad will relax a bit and have some time for his son.
080	And then they can just focus on having a happy holiday together.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
081	It's settled then. I'll go look for the decorations.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0005
082	...You're really set on going, huh? You seem oddly eager to get out there.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
083	It's just your imagination.
084	Is it...?
085	Well if you're heading out there, I may as well accompany you. I've been to the holiday market before, after all.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
086	Mer...
087	What's with that look?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0005
088	Hmm, well alright. Since you're not an icky-sticky.
089	An icky-sticky...?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
090	You know, an icky-sticky. Those scary things.
091	I, um... I guess I'll take that as a compliment?
092	All right, then. You guys get going and we'll stay here and watch over the event.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0003
093	Just leave it to us! And Rochelle...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
094	?
095	No distractions. Come right back when you're done.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
096	Yeah, yeah. Ok Ravi, let's get going.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0038
097	Did I...get a new nickname?
098	She's up to something...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
