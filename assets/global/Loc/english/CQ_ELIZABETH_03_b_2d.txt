001	There you are! Hey, Decel!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0029
002	Why did you suddenly disappear on me the other day?!
003	Ah... Sorry about that. I was told that the enemy had suddenly appeared.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0011
004	More importantly, there have been quite a large number of casualties amongst the villagers. Do you think you can help?	VO_desel.desel_sys_0002
005	You're just gonna run away again, aren't you?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0013
006	I'll keep my promise. In any case, we don't have enough available hands and many of the injured are in a critical state.
007	As someone who is involved in medicine, I'd like to request your help.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0035
008	I'm not really involved in medicine, it's just that my mother...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0022
009	...?
010	It's nothing. Fine. But, in return, you'll have to do whatever I tell you for a month.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0020
011	Thank you. The pain is a lot better now.
012	All you need to do now is rest. Also, be sure to eat properly. If you don't have money then use this.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
013	Y-you do too much...
014	Don't worry about it. I'm acting on a whim.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
015	Thank you. Thank you.
016	Now I can buy something nourishing for my daughter.
017	This isn't for your daughter, it's for you...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
018	Ah, never mind. Just hurry up and get better, so that you she can stop worrying about you.
019	See, you can give proper medical treatment. You're even capable of improving the patient's environment.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0046
020	You should've told me if you were watching. Now I feel embarrassed.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
021	She reminded me a little of my mom.
022	Did I tell you? My mom is suffering from one of those incurable diseases.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0022
023	Without treatment, she doesn't have long left to live.
024	What...?	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
025	That's why I'm doing whatever it takes to make a medicine that can heal her.
026	Yes. I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
027	I see. That explains why you're so obsessed with research.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0020
028	If that were the case, you should've told me sooner.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0030
029	Decel...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0020
030	If there's anything I can do, I'd like to help.	VO_desel.desel_sys_0037
031	Of course, to the extent that I don't suffer any bodily harm.
032	Heheh. You said it.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
033	Huh...?	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
034	Everyone! You heard that, didn't you?! Decel is gonna help with my research!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
035	He said he'll do anything!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
036	He-hey, wait!	VO_desel.desel_sys_0025
037	Yeah! Now I can advance the research for my latest medicine!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0024
038	Actually, I just came up with a new one!
039	Wait! What's with the sudden smile?! Was that story you just told me about your mom a lie?!	VO_desel.desel_sys_0013
040	No. That's true.
041	But, more than, I'm just happy that you're gonna help me.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0023
042	I told you, didn't I? I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
043	Right. It's all right if I mix that with the medicine from before, right?
044	I'm sure you'll be able to handle it, Decel. Plus, you can give me a detailed report...
045	Sorry! I can't!	VO_desel.desel_battle_0019
046	Hey! That's not what you promised me!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0013
047	You said that you'd do anything!
048	I didn't say that!
049	Anyway, hold on!
