001	Hmm. The ruins are partially excavated, but it doesn't look like Teach was a part of it.
002	Certainly looks like far too much work for just one person.
003	Teach would run mental circles around any of her colleagues. She definitely wouldn't call any of them in to help.
004	I think it's as good a guess as any that she's still around here, at any rate.
005	She might have gotten so excited that she stayed out longer than she intended.
006	With all these aggressive creatures around, though... the sooner we find her, the better.
007	Somewhere, on the other side of the ruins, in a small alcove underground...
008	Various machines and broken displays litter the room, covered in layers of dust.
009	My, this is fascinating indeed.
010	Such refined ancient technology. I wonder what secrets you will reveal to me?
011	It is unfortunate that many of these are destroyed beyond repair. Perhaps we may never discover what knowledge the ancients sought to preserve.
012	Based on what I can deduce, however... it seems to be a laboratory dedicated to the study of Alchemy and its effects on living organisms.
013	The desire of humans to harness such a forbidden power is well documented throughout history,
014	but this is a rare finding of an actual research facility dedicated to such pursuits.
015	How wonderfully convenient that it should be in Lustburg. Right behind my house, no less.
016	So much to do! Ah, how I wish my lovely apprentices were still here with me.
