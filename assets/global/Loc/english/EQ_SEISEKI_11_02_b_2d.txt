001	Ughh...!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
002	Hrgh...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
003	He not only countered my attack, but even managed to attack as well?! In that single moment?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
004	He somehow managed to deflect my attack...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
005	How can this be?
006	Ugh... I don't have time for this. You're in my way.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
007	Oh? Are you admitting defeat?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
008	Ha... Don't make me laugh. I don't know what kind of powers of darkness you have, but I have no intention of losing to the likes of you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0012
009	I simply have more important things to do than hang around here to fight this useless battle with you. I need to get to Northern Pride.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
010	Northern Pride?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
011	After losing the Matter, we at least need a Sacred Stone to make it all worth while...
012	I must discuss this with Orion before it becomes a problem...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
013	What are you talking about?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
014	I'm saying it's none of your business!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
015	Ack...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
016	He's gone...?
017	Orion in Northern Pride...? He's making his move on the Alchemy of Power?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
018	Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard
019	Ack!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
020	Suzuka, watch out!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
021	No, he's—!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
022	Behind me?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
023	Kanon, are you alright?	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
024	Y-yes... You're so fast...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
025	To be able to deflect my blade under such circumstances... Well done.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
026	However, it's time to put an end to this. Prepare for your demise.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
027	So this is the skill that defeated both Captain Monzein and Captain Yauras!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
028	What? Those two... They were defeated by these Templars?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
029	Not just those two.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
030	Huh?
031	According to my information, we have also taken care of the ones called Othima and Seida.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
032	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
033	Captain Othima...?! A-and Captain Seida...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0021
034	So I hear. Perhaps that information has not reached you yet.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
035	It can't be...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
036	Of the core members of the Holy Guard, only two remain: Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment and the Lord Commander.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
037	That is all that is left of this world's "absolute justice."	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
038	Rrgh! Huzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
039	Mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
040	Such tremendous fighting spirit...but no matter.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
041	Ack...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
042	You cannot hope to defeat me with vigor alone, especially when you've left so many openings for my blade to finish you off.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0013
043	U-ughh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
044	No! Mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
045	Ack...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
046	Were you not listening to what I just said? Now you're just being obtuse...	VO_zen.zen_battle_0016
047	Wait... That fighting spirit... She was aiming for...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
048	I won't let you do this! Even if it costs me my life!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
049	Strange... You are not one of the Holy Guard. In which case, why are you willing to go so far to protect them?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
050	Why? Kanon is a friend—a one in a million friend who reaffirmed the value of my life.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
051	Spica...
052	In other words, these people showed you the reason for your existence.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0045
053	I believe I understand. You have come clad in your Final Battle Armament to pay your debt of gratitude to these people for what they have done for you.
054	...! You... You know of it?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
055	Final Battle Armament...?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
056	This armament was created by the Shadow Messiah, the organization created by Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
057	The Final Battle Armament is a special set of armor worn by Shadow Messiah members when they plan to take part in a battle they expect to possibly lose their life in.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
058	In other words, she has come with the resolution to die here if needed.
059	What?! Spica... I had no idea that you'd come here with that in mind!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
060	Until I met Kanon, my life had one driving force—revenge for Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
061	After crossing swords with Kanon, Chloe, and the others... I couldn't fulfill it, because I realized that wasn't a cause worth dedicating my life to.
062	Spica...
063	Everything that had given my life meaning disappeared in that moment.
064	At the very least, I thought I could find value in it by sacrificing myself on Ramproad Mountain to suppress the eruption.
065	If I'm honest...I was hoping to die then.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
066	...!
067	However, I was saved by the very people I considered my enemies, the knights of the Holy Guard.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
068	Seeing Kanon genuinely hope for my survival... It opened a door in my heart that I thought would always be closed.
069	She helped me find the strength to live again. That I am even here at all is in itself thanks to Kanon.
070	It's only natural that I would be willing to lay down my life for the one who saved it to begin with.
071	Spica...
072	To meet someone of the Shadow Messiah in a place like this...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
073	I shall give you one chance. If you leave this battle, I will allow you to live.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
074	What...? Why?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
075	I must decline your generous offer.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
076	Spica?!
077	If I were to abandon my friends now in their time of need, the value of my life would disappear again. I will fight you. I will protect them.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
078	I see. In that case...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0020
079	I pity you, but I will lose no sleep over your death. Goodbye.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
080	?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
081	Spica!
082	...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
083	Huh...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
084	Hm. How fortuitous to be welcomed back by so many familiar faces just when I finally decide to pop back for a bit.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
085	Who are you?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
086	Who...? Do you mean to tell me that you have already forgotten the sound of my voice...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
087	I-impossible!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0021
088	Huh...?! Wh-whoa!!!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0029
089	Zehn, what are you thinking? Why are you attacking Spica like this?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
090	Lord...Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
091	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
