005	Urk! I must—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
006	Kamui, stop! This corruption cannot be fully purified. It's been collecting in Sephiron for thousands of years!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
007	The only one who can heal the tree is the druidic priestess!
008	No, I'm not done yet!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
009	That's enough, Kamui. Having you here, in the end, this is all I could ever hope for.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0015
010	No...no!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
011	Oh, great tree, I give myself to you.
012	Noooo!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0015
013	Heh heh... It's happening. I can hear it!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0008
014	Sephiron is coming back to life! The ancient door is opening to swallow the curse of Beelzebub!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0024
015	Great Sephiron, have you realized yet? The one you chose as a sacrifice is the Vessel of Reincarnation!
016	It is finally achieved, the equilibrium! The balance between the Sacred Stone's curse and the great tree's purifying energy...
017	This is what will finally bring about the awakening of the Vessel of Compassion!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0023
018	Finally... Finally, true justice can be brought to this—	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
019	?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0026
020	Canon fire?! They're targeting Sephiron! Who—?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0021
021	Gluttony's soldiers... The Royal Army?! How did they find the village?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
022	Heh heh. It seems like the tides have turned, Lord Waginau.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0023
023	Ceclidis...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0012
024	As both Bishop and Paladin of the Holy Guard, your authority has always presented an obstacle to our plans.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
025	You'd most certainly have become an eyesore in our upcoming collaboration with Greed Dike. I humbly request that you...disappear.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
026	Greed Dike? I see, so you intend to oppose the peace we the, Holy Guard, fight so diligently to maintain.
027	I knew you were an ambitious one, but I never thought you were so drunk with greed.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
028	This continent is mine!
029	It is only natural for me to desire all I may have. After all, Gluttony is the essence of this country.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
030	I concede the point. That does not, however, explain your presence here.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
031	...
032	I believe I ordered you to side with King Narol to subdue this civil war.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0003
033	They have joined me instead, though we do not share the same goals.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
034	I suppose you could call it a temporary alliance until you Paladins have been eradicated.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
035	Is that so?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0012
036	Lord Waginau, we are tired. You have preached about the return of the will of god, but this road you have led us on never seems to end.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
037	The task you have given us is far too excruciating.
038	Flushing out elements of discord, instigating rebellion through them, then wiping them out. That will never end the bloodshed!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
039	You continue to shed blood to vindicate your justice... We can no longer follow your lead!
040	If blood must flow for the sake of justice—
041	If that is the way of the world, then we renounce that justice!
042	No matter if we are considered evil or mistaken in the end, we choose this path in the hopes that it might bring peace and save the people!
043	Lord Waginau, we draw our swords against your justice!
044	It seems I left you to your own devices for too long. Never did I expect such gutless idealism among the Corpse.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
045	Gutless?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
046	That's what I said. Gutless. Spilling blood is all we know how to do.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
047	That is our self-evident truth.
048	I created the Corpse as a way to protect the purity of justice in the face of evil and spite.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
049	Now look at you. You are now simply a mirror of the world I created you to destroy.
050	You are no different from the foolish optimists that govern the Holy Guard!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0013
051	If I allow this to continue, I cannot show my face to those who are destined to return here.
052	Both you, General Ceclidis, and those of you who have forsaken the Corpse have willingly painted yourselves with the same sin.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
053	It is my duty to punish you all and let the darkness engulf the guilty.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
054	You think so little of me.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0011
055	What?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0021
056	You should not take me so lightly. What made you think I wouldn't have come prepared for your alchemy?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0023
057	You nullified... No! Absorbed my Spiritbonding?! That stone in your hand...!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0025
058	Enough talk! Die!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
059	Do not worry, General Ceclidis will burn your precious old tree down after you.
060	You...!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
061	I don't have time to chat. It's time. Out with the old and in with the new!
062	No! We must protect the great tree Sephiron somehow!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0042
