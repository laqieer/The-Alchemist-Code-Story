001	What good weather.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0044
002	Hey, don't you guys think so too? I want to spend my time relaxing like this forever.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0001
003	Mm. I'll take a quick nap...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0020
004	Huh! A dream?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
005	Is something wrong, Mage Flamel?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0020
006	No...it's nothing.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
007	Is that so? Your talent is one that cannot be replaced. Please take care of yourself.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0031
008	Yes...I'm sorry.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0036
009	Sigh. Why do people talk to me every time our paths cross.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
010	It's a long time since I've come to this country, but I'm still not used to it at all.
011	Every day it's reports, communication, and consultations. Everywhere I go, I have to talk with someone.
012	Wasn't this supposed to be based fully on my merit and no other additional abilities?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0030
013	Sigh... Let's return to my room. I don't want to see anyone anymore.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
014	A talent that can't be replaced, huh?
015	Chirp!
016	Hello, bird.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0007
017	Chirp?
018	Yeah, I got a little tired.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
019	Besides, I can't release you guys inside the court.
020	This ability to summon animals...
021	The elders said it was the strange ability of creating spirits, but...
022	For me, it's just everyday life.
023	Chirp...
024	Huh? What? Wait! Don't disappear!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
025	The animals don't respond. No. Why?
026	What should I do?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0048
027	I doubt I can find how to fix it even if I were to hit the library.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0022
028	After all, there's no precedent to my talent. I'm the only one who has it.
029	Could there be a chance that I might not be able to meet the animals again?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0018
030	...!
031	Ah. Mage Flamel, what are you doing here?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
032	Huh, what?	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
033	Oh. Did I surprise you? You appeared to be in a troubled state.
034	I-it's nothing.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
035	Are you certain? Oh, that's right...	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
036	Mage Flamel, you're from Saga, aren't you?
037	Yes, I am. What about it?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0011
038	Well, that area remains a land of mystery that is alive with ancient lore.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
039	I was thinking of telling a story of ancient magic to my students who occupy their minds with management and theories.
040	However, I've been having a hard time understanding the concept of a shaman.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
041	Um. I'm not especially...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
042	Are they individuals who hear the voices of...spirits? What does it mean?
043	I think it's some metaphor, but...
044	!
045	Hm? Is something the matter? Ah, Mage Flamel! Where are you going?!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
046	That's right. The shaman living in the forest of Saga may be able to help me!
047	Where is this?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0020
048	I don't remember the forest of Saga being so dense. I guess usually the animals would guide me.
049	Ack. My feet can't take anymore.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
050	Maybe it was a mistake to come here alone.
051	Right. I'm alone right now.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0018
052	... ...
053	I really can't hear the voices of the animals. Nothing.
054	Ugh...
055	What are you doing here, stranger?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
056	Wh-who's there?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0026
057	I'd like to ask the same of you. Why have you intruded within my forest?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0012
058	Oh, um, well...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0027
059	So you can't answer. My guess is you're up to something suspicious.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0044
060	Th-that's not true!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
061	I just never expected to meet someone in a place like this.
062	Hmm. I guess that means you're lost. It's rare, but not unheard of.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0006
063	In that case, I'll lead you outside the forest. Don't come straying back in again.
064	No!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0021
065	What do you mean 'no'? I doubt a layman like you would have any reason to be within an ancient forest like this.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0004
066	I-I heard that there was a shaman in the forest of Saga who could hear the voices of spirits.
067	What would you want from such an individual?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
068	Well, um...	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
069	I had the power to create animals, but I can't use it anymore.
070	The animals I summoned, well, they were artificial spirits, so I thought a shaman might be able to hear them.
071	Are you telling me you can create spirits with your bare hands?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0044
072	Ye-yes...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
073	I would be hard-pressed to believe your story. A human who can create spirits? You jest!	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0024
074	Bu-but...!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
075	Judging from your appearance, you're not from this country.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0010
076	You're not one of Gluttony Foss's hyenas, are you?
077	I-I came from Lustburg!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
078	That's absurd! Am I supposed to believe that you traveled across numerous countries to get here?	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0021
079	Yes. It was really far.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
080	Hey, what's with the bizarre answers?! I feel like I'm stabbing at air!	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0022
081	Y-you're the one that's asking me all the questions.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0018
082	Hmm. This is going nowhere, shaman of the forest.
083	... ...
084	Huh? What? Where did that voice come from?
085	Can you hear it?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0027
086	Huh?
087	Now that I think about it, it sounds similar to the voice of the animals who respond to my call.
088	Oh. How rare. You're of Saga blood, yet mixed with that of others as well.
089	What did you say?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0026
090	Shaman, his blood is that of our kind. It is not of the same color as those from Gluttony.
091	...I see.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
092	Um. Do you believe me now?
093	I'll take your word that you're not from Gluttony Foss. However—	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
094	Shaman, something is going on in the forest.
095	...!
096	The forest...?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
097	?!
098	Ah! A herd of monsters is approaching from within the forest...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0028
099	Agggggh!
100	I-I forgot that the animals don't come now even when I summon them!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0027
101	Gah?!
102	Sigh. It can't be helped. Stand back, you who have lost your way.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
103	Whatever the reason, I cannot abandon one who also hears the voice of the spirits.
