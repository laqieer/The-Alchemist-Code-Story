001	Lisbeth! Kasumi! You've gotta get up!
002	I cannot believe it. To think that you would not fall wholly unto the Darkness... Kasumi, you must remember the need to abandon yourself to the Darkness in your heart. Come to us. Walk by our sides.
003	Zain! Shut your damn mouth!
004	Were you ordered to capture Kasumi?
005	No one is giving us orders.
006	What?!
007	Destrolurk has set us free.
008	We help Destrolurk of our own free will.
009	Phantom Soldiers...with free will?
010	I didn't think that it was possible...
011	...for the puppets with which you controlled could move on their own.
012	By ending this world, in which living and dead are locked in perverted bonds...
013	Destrolurk will unmake the world, and from the Void it will be reborn.
014	What hope have you of stopping it? You do nothing but summon the slumbering dead...
015	...and have them fight war after war in the name of your justice! You are nothing!
016	But if the world ends, where do you think you'll all end up, huh?!
017	If the world should be unmade, it goes without saying that we too, would disappear into the Void. However...our existence as Phantoms has always been a twisted one.
018	By unmaking the world, we can restore it to its truest form.
019	For this—to achieve true peace—we are prepared to wager our very existence!
