001	Glurrrrrpp! Grrrrr!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_c
002	Tch! One after another...!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0021
003	At this rate...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0022
004	Over here!
005	That voice... The altar's Protector?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
006	What are you waiting for?! This way!
007	Logi, let's go!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
008	Y-yeah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
009	The ancient Sephira barrier still functions here.
010	We should be safe here for a while.
011	Thank you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
012	It is so vexing, not being able to join the fight.
013	Yet I am nothing more than a fragment of history, a memory. This body of mine is no good in a fight anymore.
014	I am sorry. Had I found you sooner, I would have been able to give you a more complete transmutation.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
015	Ah, don't say that. To have been able to pass on my words and exist in this world to this day was more than I could have hoped for.
016	Kamui, how is Georgios doing?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
017	He still lives...but without treatment, he won't for much longer.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
018	Isn't there something we can do?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0020
019	Kamui.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0018
020	Georgios! You're awake!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
021	Turn me into a Phantom. Then I should be able to fight alongside you for the time being.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
022	I know you can do it!
023	But then your mortal being will—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
024	This is a dying body anyway. What reason do I have to hesitate?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
025	This chaos is partially my fault. I never knew my cousin cared so deeply. I wouldn't be able to rest in peace without seeing this matter settled.
026	Gyaar! Grrrr! Gluuuurrrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0009
027	There's no time to think! Just do it, Kamui!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0042
028	I see... Very well, then.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
029	Kamui? What are you doing?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
030	This is a sinful act. This deed will inevitably bring me to ruin.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
031	Yet...I cannot turn away from the hearts and minds of those who have passed. I cannot overlook the lamentations of those who are leaving this mortal realm.
032	...
033	Therefore, I walk this path without hesitation. "This form of mine, no longer supreme—"	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
034	Kamui's Alchemia is surging so intensely!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
035	"Paths come to an end, as does your breath. Tomorrow is distant, yet your march is strong. If you will search for another unseen day—"
036	"Then answer my call, and grab hold of your ephemeral awakening!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0004
037	Urgh... Aaaaah!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0043
038	His physical form is turning into a Phantom! Is this the result of Kamui's Spiritbonding?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
039	Your purpose lies with this battle. Once we achieve peace, your body will turn to dust and fade away.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
040	Then my time here is limited, you mean... Heh. It's all I need.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0045
041	Kamui, what was that?! Don't tell me you had to pay some price for such a feat?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
042	Do not worry about it. My fated time drew closer, that is all.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
043	I've wielded this power freely for the past one hundred years.
044	It's about time I paid the price.
045	Well, it appears the barrier is reaching its limit.
046	My arm is at the ready for whatever you need, Kamui. Just say the word.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
047	We must reach the arboreal altar, but we will need more strength to get out of here.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
048	There must be some way to get through and reconvene with the Liberation Army!
049	That sounds like a plan. Let's do this!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0044
