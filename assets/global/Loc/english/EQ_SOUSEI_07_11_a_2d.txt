001	It's finished! This blade can do it!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0009
002	So you finished it...before sundown...
003	Master!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
004	Hahahah! What a simple mistake to make. How could I have misjudged my own strength?
005	It is indeed time for me to retire.
006	Master Roh Ku...
007	No, I am just Roh now. Take this blade to Lord Kubera, my successor, Yna Ku.
008	Me?
009	Hmm... However, not in your soot covered state.
010	There is a change of clothes in the other room. Take it with you.
011	This is a time for urgency. Lord Kubera won't care about my appearance.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
012	Good grief. You never change. Listen here, Yna Ku.
013	What lies before you will be the greatest spectacle in the Avaritia Belt.
014	Everyone has done their best to do all that they can and make marks that will never fade.
015	And in the midst of all this, if a key figure was dressed shabbily, it would dampen the whole experience.
016	Very well then.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0038
017	This outfit is...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
018	Ngh... Uckkk!
019	Master!
020	What...are you doing? If you stay here...you'll be drawn...into the collapse...
021	But leaving you here when your body is—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
022	Fool! The collapse is fast approaching!
023	My friend will assuredly dispatch of Mammon. But this is as far as I go.
024	Master...
025	That's why you must inherit...
026	Master, what's this box?
027	A parting gift from me... Normally, you would have been given it when you came of age, but...it is... Ack! Urgh...
028	Master!
029	What are you doing? Go! We cannot allow the title of Ku that's been passed down for generations to end!
030	There is no one more suited to don my parting gift in this life than you.
031	.........
032	I shall wear this gratefully. Thank you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0034
033	Now go. From now on, you are this region's greatest blacksmith.
034	There is no need for you to fear what others think. Take the path you wish to follow.
035	Yes, sir!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0038
036	Heh... That immature youngster has finally inherited my title.
037	Is this that emotion unbecoming of people born to this region?
038	I see... That much too kind man is...
039	Lord Kubera!
040	So you've arrived.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
041	Those clothes... You've inherited your master's name?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
042	Yes.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
043	Brother...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
044	I have to go now, but I'll be back. All right, Benika?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
045	Yeah...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
046	Benika?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
047	Thoughts have no power unless they take form.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
048	R-right.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0004
049	Um, brother... I can fight, too.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
050	Benika...
051	I decided to fight.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
052	I don't want to just be protected. I want to protect you, too!
053	.........
054	I can fight! With the help of Luke... But still!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
055	I'm no longer the useless Benika you knew.
056	Being with you, being able to save you... I decided that's the person I wanted to be!
057	Oh, Benika.
058	Yna!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
059	All right. Let's go, Benika.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
060	Right!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
