001	We've arrived. This is the first rendezvous point. According to the plan, this is where we're supposed to meet up with the other captains.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
002	Hey, that's quite a comeback, Seida! We're the first here!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0010
003	It appears so. I can't see any of the other Paladins anywhere.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
004	Eeek?! There's more of them, teacher!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0043
005	Yikes, I guess one wasn't enough.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0046
006	It makes it easier to take them down. Let's go, Captain Othima!
007	...?! Seida, behind you!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
008	What?!
009	...!!!
010	Disappear with this hammer of justice...Lightning Axe!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
011	Hmph. Not much of an effect for its size.
012	Vice-Captain Monzein!
013	Othima...make no mistake. I got here first. I just...got a little lost.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
014	Huh? I was totally the first one here. Why would you tell such an obvious lie?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
015	What did you say?! I don't lie! That goes against my Code of Chivalry!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
016	There you go again...you chivalrous idiot!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
017	Idiot?! Time and time again you insult me...!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
018	Vice-Captain Monzein! There are monsters behind you!
019	Shut up! Don't call me Vice-Captain! Let Yauras handle that!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
020	Huh...?
021	Scatter!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0014
022	Captain Yauras! Kanon!
023	Monzein...don't just rush forward on your own. Use your head a little more.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
024	My head?! You idiot! It's not like you're a civilian. If you're a knight than you use your arms...ah, no, that's wrong! Right now, my opponent is this weakling!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
025	What did you say?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
026	No! The enemies are the goblins! Our priority is to get to Lord Zain, right?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
027	Keep your bickering for later! Everyone is here now. Let's head forward.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
028	Hey, hold on.
029	Unfortunately, everyone really is here now.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
030	Huh?
031	Ca-Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
032	Where's Kagura...no, where's Zain?
033	Captain Kudan...what are you doing here?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
034	Shut up! I'm the one asking the questions!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
035	You scum, I am aware the entire Holy Guard is working together to steal the Mikaboshi!
036	...?! Why do you know about the Mikaboshi...where did you hear it from?!
037	Your words give you away. So your aim is the Mikaboshi after all!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
038	Captain Kudan! No! We're following Lord Zain's orders in order to destroy the Mikaboshi!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
039	Tsk...Zain...I guess he's hiding the more important part from the others.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
040	What's that supposed to mean?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
041	I don't have time to explain! Get out of the way! Even as we waste time here, Kagura is...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0011
042	Wait.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0015
043	I cannot let you pass here. It's for your own good as well, Kudan.
044	For my own good? What kind of nonsense...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
045	Stand down, Kudan. This is on the order of the Lord Commander. We won't let you pass here.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
046	Kagura is being placed in harm's way!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
047	Could you stand by and watch someone from your own regiment being placed in that situation?!
048	It's to save the world...Kagura agreed to it too.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
049	Idiot. Why won't you realize the truth?! You are all being deceived by Zain!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
050	If you words aren't enough, then I'll get by you with force!
051	Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
052	Have you forgotten? You've never once won against me before. You're gonna get hurt.
053	Not you too, Captain Yauras! Please, stop! Lower your weapons!
054	There's no other choice, Kanon.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
055	Let everyone else go first. We'll stave him off here. Hurry to Lord Zain!
056	No...what's the matter with both of you?! How did it end up like this?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
057	Yauras draws her sword in an attempt to correct Kudanstein's suspicion towards the Holy Guard.
058	In front of the disappearing Kanon, the two Paladins exchange blows.
