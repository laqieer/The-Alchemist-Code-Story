001	Now we just have to deal with you. Tell me, stranger... What is your purpose here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
002	My will...is the protection of this world.
003	Protection...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
004	You mean to say that you desire to preserve the state of this mad and twisted world?
005	Sin is the foundation of this world; and it is sin, and only sin, that can truly purify it.
006	Purifying the world...with sin?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
007	You're wrong! Sin must be eradicated, so that the world can be made anew!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
008	True purification of this world can only be achieved by creating a new world order!
009	What you seek is a new world, but running contrary to the way of this world will lead only to its mutation.
010	You must open your minds, Sephira.
011	Open our minds?! That's rich!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
012	You have the gall to stand there and lecture us about the protection of this world when you would revive the Cursed Beast?!
013	You're a hypocrite!
014	So long as there is a sky overhead and earth stretches below it, this world will continue to exist.
015	Even if the world of man should fall...
016	Wh-what are you saying?!
017	The world of man...will fall?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
018	Humankind are nothing but irregularities that sprung up from the earth like worms.
019	Y-you...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
020	Humankind does not deserve our protection. This world does.
021	What is a world without people?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
022	I am here to change this world for the better!
023	Even now, you fail to realize that you are committing sin! Your arrogance is just that—pride!
024	Theory unfolding! Reconfigure!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
025	Still you resist the truth... "Fall upon us, oh shapeless one!"
026	Nnrgh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
027	Argh...!
028	Huzzaaahhhhh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
029	Haa...haa...haa...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
030	So...this is...it.
031	Wh—?!
032	I have done what I was bound to do. I might as well retreat. However...
033	It would be most regrettable if this new technique of yours were to disappear now.
034	So...I will claim it for myself.
035	What?!
036	The corruption!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
037	Power...stolen from God.
038	I'll just use my technique again, to...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
039	Too slow.
040	No!
041	Nimul!
042	Infinite light!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
043	The Vessel of Purification... Hmm... That would make this the light of Sephiron.
044	Haa...haa...haa...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
045	Thanks, Emmel... Ngh.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
046	Nimul!
047	E-Emmel...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
048	It cannot be helped.
049	Still, with this, I can protect the world.
050	Wh-what?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
051	What's he talking about?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
052	Farewell...Sephira.
053	You're not going anywhere!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0004
054	Futile...
055	May my sword break on your...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
056	Waginau! Get back! The corruption—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
057	Ngh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
058	Hold on...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
059	He's...gone.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0028
060	Hey... What the hell was he talking about? What was all that stuff he said about protecting the world?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
061	Tch... This world doesn't need protection! It deserves nothing less than to be destroyed!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
062	And I... I will do it. I'm going to tear this world apart, and remake it myself!
063	L-Lord...Nimul...	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
064	What is it, Julia?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
065	I-I... I humbly beg for your forgiveness. All of this happened because I wasn't—	VO_julia.julia_sys_0035
066	Julia...
067	What are you talking about, Julia? You risked your life so that my sister might escape.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
068	It's thanks to you that we made it here as soon as we did.
069	If anything... I owe you thanks, Julia, for saving my sister's life.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
070	So, thank you, Julia.
071	Lord Nimul, I...
072	Guys! The ground's shaking like crazy! If we don't do something soon, the Cursed Beast is gonna get free!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
073	If that happens...this entire region... Maybe even the entire world, not to mention everyone in it...will be—!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
074	Utterly destroyed.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
075	Ngh...!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
076	Nimul...?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
077	I-I... I'm going to do what I can!
078	No, Emmel! Just leave it to me. I'll—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
079	Nimul. This is my duty as the Vessel of Purification. If things end here, everything you have dreamed of will come to naught.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
080	I... But I...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
081	Wh-what does she want to do?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
082	Emmel is the Vessel of Purification...as you should know well by now. As such, she is the only person who possesses the power to cleanse the earth of corruption, and suppress the powers of the Cursed Beast.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
083	But that's...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
084	O Sephiron, our great Mother, Tree of Life... Pray, heed my call...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0011
085	Descend from your supreme heights, oh King. From nothing to infinity, from infinity arises the light. Oh, sacred, sacred, sacred.
086	Transform your candor. I seek repose for his soul, 22nd in form... Come!
087	Wh-what's going on?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
088	Emmel...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
089	Why?! Why is nothing happening?! N-no...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
090	O-once more... I'm going to try again!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
091	Transform your candor. I seek repose for his soul, 22nd in form... Come!
092	Nngh... Why?! Am I...? Am I not—?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
093	Vessel.
094	Th-that's...Asena! Y-yes, Your Divinity?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
095	Take this.
096	What is it?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
097	It is Matter. Contained within are the powers of the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg: earth, water, wind, and fire.
098	Matter...? What is...? I mean, what do I do with it?
099	With this...thou must kill Us. Slay the Guardian Dragon.
100	Wh-what?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
101	What are you saying, Godwolf?! You would have us kill our Guardian Dragon?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
102	The Guardian Dragon works to suppress the powers of the nascent Cursed Beast, and is assailed by corruption.
103	N-no...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
104	But that means that the Great Nidhogg...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
105	Before long, the Guardian Dragon will fall to sin.
106	No...! What will become of the village—of the Sephira?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
107	Devoured by the corruption, all life will die out.
108	No! This can't be happening!
109	Vessel. Chief of the Sephira.
110	Slay the Guardian Dragon. Protect the Sephira from doom.
111	B-but, Your Divinity—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
112	This is all that can be done...to save...the world.
113	Your Divinity...? Your Divinity, can you hear me?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
114	Little girl... Is this the way of the world that you desired?
115	Your Divinity! P-please!
116	...
117	H-hey! Guys?! This is really, really bad!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
118	But, I...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
119	Let's go, Emmel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
120	N-Nimul?! You're not... You're not just going to abandon Sephiron, are you?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
121	You heard the Godwolf. We must slay the Guardian Dragon!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
122	B-but... We can't just...
123	So long as you and I work together, I know we can do this!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
124	Then I am going to remake the world! Create a new world order!
125	N-Nimul...!
126	Uh... I don't think Julia can walk, so I'm gonna have my Engineer Soldier carry her.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
127	Thanks, Adaleigh. Let's get going!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
128	Corrupted beasts...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
129	Trying to stall us, huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
130	Wh—?!
131	Such speed!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
132	The wind will blow where it will. It cannot be stopped.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
133	I will not stand by and let anyone destroy this world I call home.
134	If such destruction is necessary under the way of this world, then I will take up my sword and fight to subvert this so-called order alongside he who I would call my friend.
135	For that is my way.
136	Yna...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
137	Amazing! He took out all those beasts in a single instant!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0046
138	I am Yna Ku. On my honor, I will aid you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
139	Glad to have you on board!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
140	The deed is far from done. Before we go... Here. This is for you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
141	Use it well, Waginau.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
142	Wh-what...?
143	What is it?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
144	It is close to the best blade that I can forge at present. I think it only appropriate that it be wielded by the hands of one of the Sephira.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
145	This blue blade... It can't be...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
146	A Sephirium-forged blade?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
147	Yna Ku...
148	As you endeavor now to protect the current state of your soul, I bestow upon you my present best.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
149	May your soul and your thoughts be one and the same. With this blade, protect all that is important to you.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0041
150	Hmph. I don't need you to tell me to do that.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
151	Hey, guys? Something's coming!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
152	The Godwolf...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
153	No!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
154	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
155	N-no...! Your Divinity! Please, speak to me!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
156	Has she...? Has she fallen to the corruption of sin?
157	Damn it all!
158	The corruption must be progressing far faster than we realized! Does this mean that the Guardian Dragon has fallen, too?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
159	Well? What're we gonna do?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
160	What can we do? We must take her down.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
161	Nimul! She might be corrupted, but she's still the Godwolf!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
162	Emmel. We must keep going.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
163	Was it not Asena who told us? If we want to protect this world, we must slay the Guardian Dragon...and the Godwolf.
164	No...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
165	I will do it. I will take down the fallen Godwolf.
166	That was Asena's hope, as it is mine. Hope for the new world.
167	No...
168	L-Lady Emmel... For the sake of us all...please, listen to your brother!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
169	You understand, don't you, Emmel? We need to protect—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
170	The Sephira. Our people.
171	Alright. As you say, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
172	Thanks.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
173	O Godwolf... May your bones form the cornerstones of my new world.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
174	Now, watch carefully...
175	As I take my first step toward its formation!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
