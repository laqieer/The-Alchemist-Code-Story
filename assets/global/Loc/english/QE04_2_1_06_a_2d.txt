001	Voda! What is this strange turn of events?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
002	I'd put it down to a gust of new wind.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
003	Tina...!
004	Sorry to keep you waiting, Mocca. I brought her like I promised!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
005	Well then...Fuu boy, tell me more about what you were just talking about.	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
006	...Why?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
007	I had my own doubts about the whole situation. However, at the time, I did nothing to resolve them. Thus, we now find ourselves here.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
008	The gulf between our tribes continues to deepen. It has allowed this mass outbreak of the Jam. As a result, all of Saga is now in danger.
009	Is this the Saga that we pledged that day to protect? It's still not too late. We must come to terms with the past and move forward.
010	...I have nothing to say to you.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0040
011	I see. In that case, allow me to fulfill the purpose of my visit.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
012	...! Why are you kneeling? What is the meaning of this?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
013	As leader of Voda, I would like to make a formal request. Apparently, there is one who seeks to destroy both this forest and my life.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
014	I invoke the Sprite's Oath. In accordance with the law, I call upon the unification of Saga. Now is the time to work together to restore peace to Saga!
015	Voda...! What are you doing?! How could you submit so easily?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0021
016	When a crisis arises that threatens the land of Saga, we must set aside tribe and faction and unite as one. That's the law of Saga. I am merely following it.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
017	... ...!
018	I hardly believe one so dedicated to the law as yourself would dismiss this.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
019	My hope is that you will tell me what happened that night.
020	Why now?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
021	Because it matters now more than ever.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
022	I'm sure you have also felt that a gluttonous power has begun to suppress Asena.
023	... ...
024	It is probable that Asena gave this girl, Tina, the power of foresight.
025	And, by coincidence, Tina has also manifested a wind Ouija.
026	This matter is of the utmost importance. I don't know what the Gluttony army is plotting, but let us work together.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0002
027	There's no need for that. I'll take care of this situation myself. I'll give you the reinforcements you've requested. After all, you'll need them to eradicate the Gluttony army.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1006
028	Always such a stubborn boy.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
029	As for you, you should hurry back to the Water Temple. What if something were to happen to the Water Matter?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
030	There' s no need to worry about that. It's fine, as you can see.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
031	You brought your Matter with you?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
032	You took the risk of rendering yourself defenseless in order to come here?!
033	That's how serious I am about this. It's made me want to entrust my fate to this girl.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
034	If would be quite problematic if the Gluttony soldiers were to seize it in my absence.
035	Although I can't carry it for long, it gives me enough time to hear your story.
036	After all, it's about time we engaged in some meaningful conversation.
037	Excuse me! The Jam have emerged on the outskirts of the village! There's an astonishing number of them! Please, Fuu, help us!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0042
038	Leave this to us! Let's go, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
039	Of course! Voda, please wait here.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
040	Wait! I'll go too!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
041	... ...
042	Watch them work together so naturally...it reminds me of the old Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0002
043	That, right there, is the future of Saga. It's never too late for us, Fuu.
044	Voda...
