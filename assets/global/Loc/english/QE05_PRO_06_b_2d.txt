001	Haaa... Haaa... You're skilled.	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
002	I told you. I am a Captain of the Holy Guard.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
003	This sword bears the weight of peace on this continent. Such a sword could never lose against one who only thinks of their own personal gain.
004	Personal gain...? Who do you think you are?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
005	Urk!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
006	I carry the lamentations of an entire country of people who lost their home and future to this cruel world!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
007	You...!
008	There will never be anything that anyone can do to justify what happened to my people!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0013
009	I could never lose to someone like you who wields authority in such a corrupted reality! Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Leo!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0007
010	The ink came to life?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
011	Go forth!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0001
012	Nrk! Huzzah!!!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
013	He was able to intercept my lion's attack?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
014	Forgive me! Chaos Bringer!!!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0004
015	No!
016	Ugh... Wh-what the...?!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
017	Stay where you are.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0003
018	No...
019	...
020	Wh-what are you doing? Why haven't you killed me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
021	My sword's purpose is to defeat evil, not to slay the defenseless.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
022	E-evil...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
023	I sense no evil in your heart. You will not die by my blade today.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
024	You...!
025	Logi... I heard that he is leading some kind of militia now, but...I couldn't even guess where he might be.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
026	Huh...?
027	However, I do have some information about the Mikaboshi.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
028	What...? Wh-what is your purpose in telling me this? Pity?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
029	No... I just think that it is in my own interest to tell you this.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
030	Your...own interest?
031	I am currently chasing after Wratharis' Sacred Stone, Satna. I just thought...perhaps your quest could help both of us.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
032	It is said that the Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance of power has been disrupted.
033	Balance of power...?
034	It doesn't matter. Forget it.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
035	Then...where is the Mikaboshi?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
036	The Corpse only managed to grasp what can be taken as mere rumor... We don't have any proof to verify what we've heard yet.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
037	Just tell me!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
038	Most people think it has just disappeared, but...the truth is, the Lord Commander of the time neutralized its power.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
039	Neutralized...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
040	The Holy Guard has committed all of its resources to searching for it, but they haven't been able to find it yet. In other words...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
041	To find it, then... I have to go to...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
042	Yes... You'll have to go to the country that has swallowed Wadatsumi whole: Greed Dike.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
043	Greed Dike...
044	The sacred stone of my country is...in Greed Dike? The origin of all of this horror?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0022
045	Why...? Why must this life be so full of cruel discoveries?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
046	Aghhhhhhhhh!!!
047	Aghhhhhh!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0019
048	What the—?! Are you okay?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
049	Nngh... Wah... Wahhhhhhhh!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0019
050	Y-you need to calm down! Pull yourself together!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
051	Nngh...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
052	Have you calmed down? What...happened?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
053	It's... It doesn't matter. These are not...my tears! What are you...? Wh-whoa!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
054	Ahem, it's better if you don't move too much.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
055	Wh-what are you doing?! Why...are you...holding me in your arms?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0028
056	Y-you're not going to kiss me or anything, right?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
057	You just...seemed like you needed comfort. It can't be easy to deal with whatever it is you're struggling with, if you're being pushed to break down and cry like that.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
058	C-comfort...? Y-your face is...really close.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
059	This is normal when you hug someone, like it or not.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
060	Really...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
061	Look, I didn't expect to be thanked or anything, but this criticism is a little much. Get your mind out of the gutter.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
062	My mind is not in the gutter!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
063	Just...calm down for a moment, okay?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
064	So, listen. This information of mine is all I have for you. If you mean to go to Greed Dike, you should hurry.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
065	What? Why?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
066	Didn't I tell you? I got this information from the Corpse.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
067	You mean...the Corpse is already looking for it?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
068	Could be. Now, I have other places to be. I have answered your questions.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
069	W-wait!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
070	What is it?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
071	Are you really going to let me go after telling me all that?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
072	I told you. I don't sense any evil in you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
073	You...
074	I'm sure that fate will bring us together again. Goodbye for now.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
075	Wait...
076	A sword for defeating evil, not slaying the defenseless... Just like a samurai. So that was Dias Crowley...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
077	Have you calmed down? What happened?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
078	Wh-what is this? What is this trembling?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
079	I'm not even Lisbeth! I can't believe I'm getting so worked up over this.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
080	You, too, have a past that cannot be forgotten.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
081	Huh...?
082	What?! What was with that response?! I totally got pulled in by his...by him!!!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
083	No way. No way, that's not me.
084	I need to focus. I have much more important things to concern myself with. I don't have time for this.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
085	So why is my heart pounding like this?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
086	Logi Crowley... I have to find you. I'll definitely find you. To do that, I...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
087	I must push aside all of my emotions. I must not let these ancient sorrows overwhelm me yet...
088	Could the Mikaboshi have fallen into the hands of the Sun King?
089	It's time to face destiny... I must head to Greed Dike.
