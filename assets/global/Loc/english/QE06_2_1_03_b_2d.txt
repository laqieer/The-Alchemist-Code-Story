001	That's the last of them. What's our status?
002	Just a few non-fatal injuries. Nothing too serious.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
003	…What was their motive for attacking us?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
004	…It's no use speculating. For now, we need to devise a plan of action.
005	…I'll continue to monitor the demons' movements.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
006	...Azami
007	...I'm frustrated with my own weakness.
008	If only I had had been stronger… Then Amane wouldn't have been--	VO_azami.azami_sys_0042
009	…
010	Everyone here shares responsibility. You don't have to bear it alone.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0039
011	…Maybe. But I--
012	If you understand, then start honing your skills--to the point where you can protect everyone.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
013	…!!
014	…I'm heading back.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
015	…Alright.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
016	We need to discover how the demons are able to use those techniques.
017	The Discarnate Power seemed invincible. It didn't matter how much we damaged him--only decapitating him worked…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
018	Besides, how could he multiply?
019	Is it possible that Jubei is somehow involved?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
020	!?
021	What makes you say that?
022	The most serious offense in the corps rule book--killing a fellow member--indirectly benefits the demons since it reduces our numbers.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
023	In other words, maybe Jubei did what he did because he was aligned with the demons.
024	…
025	…We can't rule it out…But the connection seems tenuous.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
026	What makes you so sure?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
027	For one, what would be in it for Jubei? I don't see how he would benefit from aligning with the demons.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0031
028	Maybe there was something only Jubei knew about--something we're unaware of.
029	Something important enough for him to betray us? Don't you think the price is too steep?
030	You make it sound like you know everything about him.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0044
031	…As far as I knew, he had no such motives. I have no reason to doubt him.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
032	…Don't let prejudice cloud your judgement.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
033	I could say the same to you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
034	You're both Black Star Clan members, yet you treat him as an enemy.
035	Anyone engaged in the murder of corps member is a disgrace to the Black Star Clan.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
036	There. That's your prejudice.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
037	…Of course. I'm aware of that. What we're discussing is hypothetical.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0047
038	The question remains--who would seek to ally with the demons?
039	The most obvious answer would be…Greed Dike.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
040	…
041	…It's certainly possible.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0045
042	…I pray that's not the case.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0030
043	It's common knowledge that they once experimented with phantoms. If that technology was used…	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
044	…Then we have our answer, don't we?
045	…Naturally, I thought of that possibility, too. However, if that's the case, then what should we do about it?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
046	I still don't see what's in it for Greed Dike.
047	…
048	…There's a lot we don't know.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
049	I wonder if someone's ill intentions are at play.
050	…For now, we've got to find out what information we can…huh.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
051	Seems that way. You may be right about Jubei being involved.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
052	…If only we knew where he was, we could get the story straight from the horse's mouth. Guess we better start searching.
053	…	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
054	…Ugachi
055	…The blockhead has a point.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
056	No need for name-calling.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0025
057	…Thank you, Ugachi.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
058	Don't assume he's been absolved of his crime.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
059	Well then, we should start our investigation in…
060	Greed Dike…huh.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
061	Can we count on you, Commander Celis?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
062	I was planning a visit anyway to report the latest events… I'll do a little digging while I’m there.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0038
063	Supposing that this is all Greed Dike's doing…I wonder how many people are involved.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
064	…I should have a talk with Judius first.
065	Continue monitoring the demons' activities and prepare for an ambush. While you're at it, there's something I want you to find out.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0002
066	What's that?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
067	I want you to find the whereabouts of the remaining Sacred Three of Wadatsumi.
