001	Kudan!
002	This is the end, Kudanstein!
003	Captain Kudan!
004	Kudan!
005	Captain Kudan!
006	Captain Kudan.
007	Kudan!
008	Will it not reach him?
009	This is our justice.
010	This is our truth.
011	It will reach him. It will make a difference. Both this justice we inherited...
012	And our Alchemy!
013	It can't be...!
014	Kuza...!
015	Sup.
098	So that's why you handed me your pipe. So that I could summon you.
099	I told you I wanted to choose when I die.
100	What do you think you can do with such a lazy, stopgap summon?!
101	This stopgap is all we needed.
102	This is all futile! It won't get you anywhere!
103	No... It's not possible!
104	I stalled and held him in place. Was it enough, Brother?
105	Again!
106	You already know you cannot harm me.
107	Not alone, I can't. But...
108	Yeah, you know what to do.
109	You can believe in me!
110	I'm expecting you to make this interesting, Brother.
111	This is pointless! You will never defeat me! That day will never come!
112	Unfortunately for you, I'm aggressively persistent. I'll keep going until I do defeat you!
016	Hahahahahaha! Not bad, but still not enough!
017	Farewell, Kudanstein!
018	Nngh! Th-that's—!
019	A little hand-me-down from my older brother. I told you I'm not alone.
113	Good show, Brother!
114	You still need me to babysit you?
115	No...
116	You haven't forgotten, have you?
117	No. I understand now. I'm not alone.
118	I am here with you, too.
119	Hahah! Not bad at all.
120	You seem to have found yourself a good older brother.
121	I have.
122	If you would, allow me to shoulder that which he entrusted to you as well.
123	Embrace the light that guides the world!
020	How could I lose? How could I possibly lose to weaklings like you?!
021	I told you. Our shared bond is our justice.
022	This is... This is unforgivable!
023	To force me to my knees... This is unforgivable! You all will die for this!
031	I will pave my road to conquest with your bones!
032	We are done for now. I believe it would be wisest to retreat.
033	It is not yet the right time.
034	Waginau...
035	There will be time to settle this score later. Will it not be enough to prove your strength to them then?
036	I suppose it is not wise to suffer any more losses.
037	Paladins, I will see you again.
038	It's over.
039	Did we...win?
040	I would say that for now, yes. The future is...less certain.
041	We're going home! We kept casualties to a minimum, so I say this has been a good day!
042	Vice-Captain Monzein!
043	Oh...
044	...
045	Captain Kudan...
046	...
047	Let's go home, everybody.
048	(It was your blade that struck him. I suppose you win again, Brother.)
049	(I wonder if my spear will reach him one day...)
050	(No...I will make it reach! Just watch me, Kuza.)
051	Kuza... Rest in peace.
052	When the day comes for Wadatsumi to be freed, we can build a tomb for Kuza in his homeland.
053	Before we can do that, we'll have to defeat that man, though...right?
054	Captain Kudan, why don't we swear an oath together?
055	I haven't yet fulfilled the oath I made with Kuza. How can I make another with you?
056	Allow me to join the one you made with him! Let's vow to avenge Kuza and carry out our justice together.
057	Not a bad suggestion for an airhead. Can I be part of this oath as well? Rebuilding Wadatsumi is my wish just as much as it was Kuza's.
058	A wish that Chihaya and I...both shared.
059	Right! Basheeny, you're with us, too, aren't you?
060	Um...me, too?
061	All right! Then it's decided!
062	Why don't we all make the oath together?
063	This is a serious matter, not something to be so flippant about! Ahem. I, too, would like to join.
064	If the Vice-Captain is willing, then so am I.
065	I will join as well.
066	Well, then. Let us swear this oath together and keep the Holy Guard's light of justice shining bright.
067	What’s wrong?
068	I just... I haven't grown at all since that time. I'm still so...powerless.
069	What are you talking about? You have so! You succeeded in protecting not only me, but everybody here!
070	But...
071	You were able to protect all of us. Next time, you'll be able to defeat him for sure!
072	Now, now. Let's not go making bold assumptions.
073	Oh, don't be such a downer, Monzein.
074	There is something about Kanon, though. Somehow the way she says it makes it sound very plausible.
075	She is...something, that's for sure.
076	If all of you are set on this...who am I to decline?
077	All right, then. Let's do this.
078	We of the Holy Guard will fight for our absolute justice.
079	That the tragedy of Wadatsumi may never happen again.
080	To prevent the Sacred Stones from falling into evil hands.
081	That innocent blood may never be shed.
082	To uphold my code of chivalry and protect the weak.
083	To see this all through to the end.
084	To honor our friends.
085	For the sake of people's smiles! And of course...
086	To bring down the evil that brought about the fall of Wadatsumi!
087	To this cause, we dedicate our lives!
088	Justice for the sake of all!
089	Ack...urgh!
090	Do you feel more like appreciating the little things around you now?
091	Maybe not everything, but I do wish to carry on what you believed in. Though I'm...not sure I can carry it all.
092	You don't need to worry about a thing.
093	How's the view from there?
094	This is nonsense.
095	But...I suppose it's not bad.
096	Heheh. Love to say I told you so, Brother.
097	Don't get full of yourself.
