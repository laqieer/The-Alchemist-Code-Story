001	So you knew all this time. What else are you hiding?
002	Seeing that you won't be leaving alive, I suppose I could tell you...
003	The attack on the facility your sister was receiving treatment at?
004	It was an inside job.
005	...What?
006	Why would you...
007	Suffice to say, they decided their best interests lay elsewhere. Outside of my jurisdiction.
008	We can't have that now, can we?
009	Not when Eira is useful to us. To Goetia.
010	Then what about Soren? What do you want with him?
011	Ah, I'm sure Emrys can tell you all about that cruel, cruel man, and what he did to poor Eira.
012	It would be a shame to let all that research go to waste...
013	Where did you take my sister, fiend?
014	Now that is truly none of your business. Just know that she's in good hands...
015	Better than yours, at any rate.
016	...!
017	What—
018	(This explosion again... It's Eira!)
019	What is going on!?
020	It's coming from the other end!
021	Ugh!
022	Emrys, go!
023	Find the rest and run! I'll hold them here!
024	...Got it!
025	Oof... Is everyone okay?
026	Still in one piece...
027	Eira? Eira! Say something!
028	No good... She's out cold. But I think she's unharmed.
029	...And so are you two, unfortunately.
030	I owe you one, Red. That was impressive, tanking the blast like that.
031	Now, why don't you keep our guests occupied?
032	I think Berith is itching for a fight.
033	Heh... Not every day you meet someone who doesn't hit like a wet noodle.
034	Come on, Red. It's playtime.
035	Noted.
036	Even the damned sword is talking. You Goetia are really something else.
037	Blair looks around for an exit, taking note of the crates piled along the walls.
038	(These are highly flammable...)
039	(If anything ignites them, they'll definitely cause a collapse!)
040	(And where's Shion?)
041	You're not laying a single hand on Eira while I still draw breath.
042	Fine. Then watch over her from the afterlife! Hah hah!
043	Die.
044	Urgh!
045	Emrys!
046	...!
047	Emmy...?
048	Emmy!
049	Yes, Eira. I'm here...
050	This time... I'll protect you.
