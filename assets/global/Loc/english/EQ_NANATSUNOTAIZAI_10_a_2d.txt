001	Meliodas!
002	Where the heck have you been?! You're late, Meliodas!
003	Sorry, sorry. I had to take care of some Albions along the way, so it took me longer to get here than expected.
004	But here's some good news: I'm not here alone.
005	Blackout.
006	They should be out for precisely ten minutes. Let's finish this in that time.
007	...?!
008	What...just happened?
009	Who's there?!
010	If you're curious, then I'll tell you.
011	Goat Sin of Lust, Gowther stands before you!
012	...!
013	Mother Earth Catastrophe!
014	True Spirit Spear Chastiefol Form One: Chastiefol!
015	How rude of you to take my prey from me.
016	Sorry we're late!
017	We're here now! Here to help!
018	Serpent Sin of Envy, Diane!
019	Grizzly Sin of Sloth, King!
020	At your service!
021	Urgh!
022	Hey now, you should try to be more aware of your surroundings.
023	Wha—?!
024	The Fox Sin of Greed, Ban has arrived.
025	Tch!
026	Ugh, there's so many of them!
027	We have to fight all of them?
028	The time has come. Give me some space.
029	H-huh?
030	Escanor. I'm sorry to have made you endure so much.
031	I devised a means of returning to our own world. It's about time I showed my worth.
032	Not to mention, I'd hate to miss out on all the fun.
033	Extermination Ray!
034	I am the Boar Sin of Gluttony, Merlin. This is how we repay our debts.
035	Tch!
036	Elizabeth, so...these people are...?
037	The ones you trust and believe in?
038	Yes! They're important friends of mine!
039	From this point on, you'll have to fight us all...
040	The Seven Deadly Sins!
