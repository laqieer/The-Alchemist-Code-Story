001	Who exactly is chasing Captain Kudan? You really don't know, Kagura?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
002	No, I don't. Only Kudan saw.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
003	Mostly likely, the sinister vibe I've been feeling is coming from whoever was there.
004	Look! Someone's coming this way!
005	Huh...Melda?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0009
006	Is it someone you know, Almira?
007	She's a Beast Tamer that often hunts around here. We're not exactly friends, but she's famous around these parts. She's so good at hunting!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0037
008	So this girl is the Beast Tamer, huh? I've heard of her before as well.
009	Well, I'm sure you have, Seida of the Alize people.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
010	You know about me?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
011	Of course, I do. Your tribe and mine have traded from before.
012	Wow! I didn't know you were friends with someone famous like Melda! You never cease to impress me, teacher!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0024
013	I'm not friends with her. Is there something you want? We're in a hurry, so try to be efficient with your request.
014	Heh. Right. Let's finish this efficiently.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
015	Hey?! What are you playing at? Why are you pointing your weapon at us?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
016	Forgive me. In order to fulfill my long-cherished wish, you're all are gonna have to pay the price.
017	What are you saying? Please explain yourself properly!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
018	Yes! Calm down; let's talk!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0028
019	There's no way we can talk. I've become a beast.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0040
020	I am a beast. A beast with neither reason nor emotions. My only job is to hunt!
021	He-hey?!
022	She's acting strangely. There's obviously something wrong with her.	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
023	Yes. There is no life in her eyes. It looks like she's under some kind of spell. Let's shock her and bring her back to reality.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
