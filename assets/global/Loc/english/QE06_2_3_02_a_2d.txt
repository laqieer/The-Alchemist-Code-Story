001	Koga's cooking satisfied the demons. His use of chakra worked incredibly well to provide the life force the demons needed.
002	It turned out it having Kaede as guinea pig was a good idea. The flavor received general praise.
003	Demons no longer needed to fight humans in order to eat. And there were more than a few demons who felt relief.
004	Naturally, the humans were equally relieved.
005	…Humans were just as tired of clashing with the demons.
006	And just like that, the conflict was over. Both sides were genuinely pleased.
007	All except one.

015	As do I. I'm sure there are many details that need to be worked out in order to bring about peace…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
016	Let us move forward in good faith.
017	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
018	Let us consider this as a first step.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
