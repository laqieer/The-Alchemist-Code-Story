001	How much longer is he planning to stay out drinking? Is he really not gonna come home tonight?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0022
002	You're late.
003	I know.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0004
004	Do you have something against me? I was so excited to see you...and this is how you treat me?!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0001
005	...
006	Something happened in town, right? Talk to me!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0002
007	Why did you do that?
008	What?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0025
009	Before, on the beach. I told you to leave it to me, but you intervened.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0016
010	What are you talking about? You were about to—	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0022
011	How long are you going to keep treating me like a child?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0020
012	We're...family, aren't we? Does that mean nothing to you?	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0016
013	When Wadatsumi was invaded, both father and mother, and so many other people we knew...were all killed.
014	You're the only one I have left in this world. It's only natural that I worry about you.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_1019
015	Family means nothing to me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0016
016	What...?! Are you serious?!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0020
017	I am.
018	If you're going to say things like that, then...don't come back here anymore!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0010
019	Don't come back, huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0013
020	That's right! We don't need men like you who care nothing for their family polluting this village!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0004
021	What happened to him? He always said that he wanted to become strong so that he could protect the village!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0022
022	He used to say that he wanted to become strong like that boy who saved us all those years ago. I never imagined he would say things like this to me.	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0030
023	Aaaaaarrrgggghhhhh!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
024	Tch! More monsters!
025	Haaa...haaa...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0023
026	Kazahaya, are you all right?!	VO_yuunagi.yuunagi_sys_0002
027	Don't touch me! I don't want to be protected anymore! I want to live by my own power!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
028	K-Kazahaya...!
