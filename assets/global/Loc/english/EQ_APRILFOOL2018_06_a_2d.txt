010	What else do you expect? We are not so inefficient as to just roll over and let you do whatever you want to our friend, mandra!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
011	(S-Seida! Everyone!)	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0019
012	Isn't Sabareta lizard enough for all of you?! Why am I even trying to argue with you? We're resetting this this story to its original form, whether you like it or not!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0013
