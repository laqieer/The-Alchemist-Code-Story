001	Hyah! Hah! Taa!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0007
002	Huff...huff... This isn't enough. I need to train harder! I have to be a positive example to the rookies!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
003	If I become stronger, I'll have more things to teach as well. It's the best thing for everyone at the training school.
004	All right! Let's do this! Hyah! Tyaaaah!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0032
005	... ...
006	Hyah! Hyaaaah!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0004
007	... ...
008	...Tyah! Oryaaah!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0007
009	... ...
010	Phew... Hey, you've been standing there all this time. Is my training that amusing to you?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
011	From what I can tell, your weapon of choice is the spear. Your face also seems familiar.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
012	... ...
013	He-hey, wait! Didn't you have something you wanted to tell me?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
014	...Nothing in particular.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
015	Hmph. No need to talk like that. You've been ignoring everything I've said. Do you think you're better than me?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
016	... ...
017	There you go again. If you're not going to say anything, then we'll have to see if your spear can speak for itself.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0030
018	... ...
019	So, you're willing to engage in this kind of exchange, huh? That makes it easier for me.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0044
020	... ...
021	Well then...let's fight!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0015
022	Hmph!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0003
023	What...what a sharp blow! She's strong...!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
024	Hyah!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0005
025	Ack... I can't handle her attacks!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
026	...It's over now.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0010
027	Whoa?!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0025
028	Unbelievable... I couldn't do anything to stop her. I was completely overpowered.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0020
029	... ...
030	W-wait! My name is Teona! I apologize for my earlier rudeness. Please, at least tell me your name!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
031	... ...
032	She's gone. Who was she?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0030
033	Grrrr...!
034	...No. I can't afford to let my guard down now. I need to find her and speak to her again! So...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
035	Get out of my way!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0007
