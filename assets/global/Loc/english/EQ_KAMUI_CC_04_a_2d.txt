001	...
002	All that corruption, all alone...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
003	Heheh. How was it? This is what I'm capable of! Impressive, isn't it? Well, I am older than you two dunces anyway.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
004	You two, on the other hand, have a long way to go.
005	Anyway, what were you thinking, going into the sealed shrine without permission?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
006	What was sealed in here were the remnants of an ancient corruption that my ancestors risked their lives to subdue.
007	And to wake it up without any preparation... One wrong move and it could have been a disaster, you know?
008	That's... I have no response. But how did you know we were here?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
009	I was guided by the voice of Sephiron, of course. She told me that you guys were in danger.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
010	Sephiron?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0012
011	The great Mother is always watching over us. Be grateful for her love.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
012	Always watching...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
013	And be grateful to me too! I only looked away for one moment!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
014	It's really hard watching over two big, dumb little brothers.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
015	...
016	...
017	Needless to say, ever since that day, we understood we were no match for Malta.
018	I miss those days.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
019	At the time, we thought we'd purged the corruption, yet...
020	It was only a small part of the original source of corruption, Cryphone. As long as that the true foundation of the corruption remained...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
021	We should've seen that it was only part of an old, greater corruption that Sephiron had been containing all along.
022	Therefore, now that Sephiron's blessing has been lost...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
023	There you are. I knew it.	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
024	Allow me to break free from my past regrets and finish what I started long ago!
025	Grrroooaaahhh!
