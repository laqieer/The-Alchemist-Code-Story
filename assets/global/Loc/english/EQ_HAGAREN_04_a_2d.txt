001	Strangers from another world, a gate to connect two worlds, and suspicious activity within the Order...	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0016
002	That sounds about right. The Holy Order has always been capable of such things, even in my day.
003	A Phantom specializing in intelligence? Not bad, for a dead woman. Those skills will definitely come in handy. In fact, if I didn’t know her time had passed...	VO_roy.roy_sys_0045
004	Vivi, a spy as skilled as yourself must have one or two safe havens at the ready. Could you take us in?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0041
005	Please, Miss Vivi! We need your help!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
006	I know of a good hideout east of Wratharis that should fit all of you...but traveling with this many people significantly raises our chances of getting caught on the way.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
007	Is that so? That's not a problem. In fact, that works out perfectly for Lieutenant Hawkeye and I.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0010
008	What do you mean, Colonel Mustang?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
009	We acquired some interesting intelligence in that last scuffle. We wanted to investigate it, but we'd stick out too much as a group.	VO_riza.riza_chara_1003
010	Should we split up? You two would probably be even tougher to beat without us holding you back...but...I wonder if we'll be okay...?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0007
011	We'll let you know if we find anything interesting. Vivi, could you tell us how to get to the hideout, just in case?	VO_riza.riza_sys_0002
012	There they go... I never want to get on their bad sides. There sure are a lot of powerhouses scattered about this era.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
013	Anyway, we should get going, too. We need to pass through an area full of dangerous enemies.
014	I'm not much of a fighter, but I've got your backs! Follow me!	VO_vivi.vivi_battle_0015
