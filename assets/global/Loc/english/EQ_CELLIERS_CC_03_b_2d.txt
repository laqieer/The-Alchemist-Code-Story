001	...*Sigh*	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0022
002	I wonder if Mielikki's okay? She went off to see her father and sister...
003	If they're with her, then she must be okay.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
004	(Still, I can really feel her absence when she's not around.)	VO_celliers.celliers_chara_1005

007	(Still... Who could've known it'd be this hard to be away from her smile...)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031

009	Wh-why...? I've been able to control my power just fine lately, but now...
010	Celliers? Do you have a moment?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
011	Oh, it's you, Flamel...
012	Your stay here has gone on quite some time now. How are you faring? Do you want for anything?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0001
013	Oh, well... I'm fine, really. Everyone treats me nicely.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0005
014	Good, glad to hear it. Well then, um...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
015	I actually...have something to tell you. It's about that exam you took the other day.
016	......
