001	Why am I so blind to the workings of women's hearts?
002	You look like a man who's just been dumped.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
003	...
004	Northern Pride: Headquarters of the Holy Guard (Memories)
005	She's done it again, hasn't she?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
006	Kaya... has left the Holy Guard.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
007	I knew it!
008	I hereby tender my resignation. Don't come looking for me. Sincerely, Kaya. The Crimson Dragon, former Captain of the 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard.
009	What in the world goes on inside that woman's head?
010	How many times has she quit now? I've never seen someone go through so many resignation forms.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
011	I've got to bring her back.
012	Oh, no you don't! You stay right there.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
013	I'll contact the relevant branches, see if they've seen her. If not, I'll go myself.
014	Sure you will. And has that ever worked?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
015	No.
016	Do you even have any idea which country she might be in?
017	No.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
018	And I'm guessing you aren't about to pull some magical solution out of your sleeve?
019	No.
020	Do you even know why she left in the first place?
021	I have my suspicions, but frankly, the matter confounds me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0031
022	That's your reason right there!
023	What?
024	You're never going to figure this out, are you?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
025	Figure what out?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
026	Never mind.
027	You know, I've never understood the perverse pleasure young people seem to take in being indirect.
028	You ought to be careful. Devious speech makes for a devious mind.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0014
029	Those who walk the path of knighthood should strive for readiness of will and clarity of mind at all times—and captains of the Holy Guard all the more so.
030	I believe that you are capable of great things, Othima, but you are constrained by your refusal to fully commit yourself. Is this not the time to take that final step?
031	Mental discipline, my friend. That is the key. Refine your speech and you refine your conduct. Do this, and you will secure your place as one of the greatest knights of this or any age.
032	Will you not walk this path with me? Now is the time to embrace your destiny!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
033	Gah! You're a lost cause!
034	I wasn't finished.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
035	You mean there was more?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
036	Much more.
037	Look... I don't see the point in thinking about men and women like they're different species. People are just people.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
038	Women make up half the world, you know? And without them, we men never would've been born in the first place.
039	But still, I don't know how you plan on saving Babel if you're this clueless about half of the people in it.
040	...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
041	Just some food for thought.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
042	...
043	Don't come looking for me.
044	Why am I so blind to the workings of women's hearts?
045	Don't you get it? Don't you see why I called for you?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
046	Holy Order of Babel (Memories)
047	Um... A-a very good day to you, Most Reverend Bishop, sir!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
048	Please, there's no need for formalities. I am told that you are excelling in your duties.
049	Y-you flatter me, sir!
050	Top marks in the entrance examination, if I am not mistaken, and you have only continued to impress since. Some are calling you the Holy Guard's rising star.
051	I-I could never have done any of it without the help of my friends! I'm nothing special, really!
052	It has been far too long, Kanon.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
053	I-it has, sir.
054	I was hoping to congratulate you on your successes.
055	Y-you honor me, Waginau, sir!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
056	Raise your head. I would see your face.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
057	I couldn't possibly! To look upon the face of the Most Reverend Bishop would be the height of disrespect!
058	What makes you say that?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
059	Respectfully, sir, you are the Most Reverend Bishop of the Holy Order!
060	Only the highest echelons of the Church are worthy of gazing upon your face!
061	It is an honor far beyond a humble member of the Holy Guard like myself!
062	I feel indescribably privileged to have even been permitted to hear your voice all these years!
063	I could never presume...!
064	And what if I were to order you?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
065	I... But... I couldn't...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
066	Raise your head, Kanon.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
067	Y-yes, sir.
068	Oh no, he's super cute!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
069	Desist.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
070	D-did I say that out loud?! My deepest apologies!
071	It is unbefitting of a knight of the Holy Guard to refer to her superior as "cute".	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
072	Take pride in your achievements, Kanon, and strive for greater things. In the name of Babel, and in the name of the absolute justice you must uphold.
073	I-I will! Thank you very much, Waginau, sir!
074	Pardon me, Most Reverend Bishop. Might I interrupt?
075	That time already, is it?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
076	Eek! L-Lord Commander?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
077	I'd entirely forgotten I'd called for you, Zain. Forgive me—my age must be catching up with me.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
078	Y-you don't look old at all!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0016
079	Oh? You flatter me.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
080	Do you have a fountain of youth hidden away somewhere?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
081	Nothing like that. You'd be surprised at the wonders a little Alchemia can achieve.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
082	Wow! Alchemia can do that?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
083	Pardon me, Most Reverend Bishop. Might I interrupt?
084	I'd entirely forgotten I'd called for you, Zain. Forgive me—my age must be catching up with me.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
085	You can say that again...
086	Excuse me?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0012
087	N-nothing! Nothing at all! Um, should I be leaving now?
088	No, no. You may stay. In fact, I'm glad of the chance to speak with the two of you together.
089	Um... As you wish!
090	Apologies for keeping you waiting, Zain.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0001
091	You summoned me, Most Reverend Bishop?
092	Thank you for coming. I'm sure you must be extraordinarily busy.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
093	My burden is not half as great as yours.
094	Allow me to cut to the chase.
095	Of course.
096	Kaya is... starting to become a problem.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
097	I concur.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
098	Hmhm.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
099	Frankly, if she continues as she is, she will end up damaging the reputation of the Church as a whole.
100	Welcome.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
101	The usual, please.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
102	She's been sighted investigating ancient ruins all around the continent. She's currently in... Slothstein, I believe.
103	I swear, you've bolted new pieces onto that thing every time I see it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
104	Do you like it? This is the new-and-improved Comprehensive Archaeological Surveyor Multitech Antie! Isn't it adorable?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
105	I suppose. In a certain light.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
106	It's not for nothing that she's called the Crimson Dragon.
107	Between her extraordinary inherent powers and her unparalleled historical knowledge...
108	Even the previous Lord Commander would have struggled to match her on the battlefield... or so the rumors would have me believe.
109	As someone who graduated from the same class as her, that makes me feel a little proud... and a little pathetic.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
110	Please, Zain. Who could be an exemplar for the Holy Guard if not you?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
111	You value proper learning and conduct in a way she does not. That is what makes you fit to be Lord Commander.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
112	You humble me.
113	We do not have long. There have been worrying signs from our neighbors in Greed Dike.
114	Our informants report that the tyrant emperor is marshalling his forces to sweep the continent.
115	If we are to weather this, Zain, we need Kaya. Both for her own strength and for the strength she gives you.
116	Of course, Most Reverend Bishop. I will restore her to the Holy Guard, I swear it.
117	I am glad to hear it. The peace of the continent rests in your hands.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0041
118	I will not fail you.
119	As for you, young knight, I hope you're taking notes.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
120	M-me? No! Wait, I mean... Um...!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
121	Oh?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
122	L-Lord Commander?
123	Have we met?
124	She is one of the orphans who was left under the Holy Order's care.
125	An orphan?
126	Y-yes. I wanted to repay the Holy Order for taking me in, so I decided to join the Holy Guard!
127	As you can see, she is spirited. I have great expectations for her.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
128	I... Um... Thank you very much, Most Reverend Bishop, sir!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
129	What is your name?
130	Oh! My apologies. Kanon of the Holy Guard, reporting for duty, sir!
131	I still have much to learn, but I promise I'll do my best! I won't let you down, Lord Commander, sir!
132	There's no need to get so worked up.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
133	B-but you're my idol, sir!
134	Excuse me?
135	I mean, everyone loves you! You're our most righteous Lord Commander, tasked with the protection of this world!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
136	You care for everyone—even the poor and helpless, like me! You're our guiding light amid the darkness of this world!
137	Your... guiding light?
138	Yes, Lord Commander, sir! I dream of becoming a shining beacon, just like you!
139	Perhaps then I'll be able shine my light on everyone, too! Like... Like a sparkling diamond!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
140	Still...
141	I couldn't get you to smile.
142	You...
143	You shine too bright for me.
144	Without saying a word, you...
