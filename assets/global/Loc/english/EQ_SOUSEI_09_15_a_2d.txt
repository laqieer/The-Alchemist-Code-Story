001	I thought I would try to stick around for a while, but...ugh. This town's just too noisy for my liking!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
002	I like it here, myself. It's warm.
003	Stands to reason it would be, given that it's a town of mining and engineering and such...that's floating in the air for some reason.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
004	Honestly, it's such a waste of magil to keep this rock in the sky! Has everyone here lost their marbles?!
005	We did what we had to do to keep ourselves safe from the Cursed Beast's influence.
006	Never mind that! You have everything ready, motorcycle man?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
007	Yep! After sending Nimul and the others off to the Superbia Belt, it certainly has taken some time for us to get back on our feet...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
008	But we did it, so now we can finally provide them some backup! Assuming we're able to get to them in time, anyway.
009	Yes, time is of the essence, if this constant magil rumbling is anything to go by.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
010	The barrier of corruption separating the Belt Regions is starting to wear itself down. Or maybe it's just...accumulating sin more quickly than before?
011	I've been confined to Luxuria Belt for so long, I'm not even sure what's going on anymore.
012	But I do know that we're fast approaching the future my mentors wished for so long ago. The time of creation is near.
013	You mean Nimul and his gang have finally done it?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
014	They've done something, at least. Possibly fail! It's hard to say. In any case, we should to make sure there are as many people to help as possible.
015	Then what are we waiting here for? Follow me!
016	Ugh, young people. Come along, Winnick.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
017	Right behind you.
018	Is everyone here?
019	Yes, the allied forces of Invidia and Ire Belts have all boarded. But can this ship really cross over the world's barrier?	VO_slba.slba_sys_0003
020	Sure can. Not only does this baby make use of some of Adaleigh's own designs, it was put together by some of Acedia Belt's best engineers, too.
021	It might not be as maneuverable as Adaleigh's ship, but we can move lots of people and resources all the same.
022	Could use a bit of sprucing up, though, admittedly. The interior is a bit drab.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0030
023	Stay on topic, motorcycle man!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
024	Right! Ahem.
025	We were planning to recruit more people from other regions, but—	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
026	But there's no time for that now. I understand.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
027	Are you headed to meet with Andechs and the others? If so, I'll gladly join you.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
028	He helped to save Ire Belt, so I've got a debt to repay.
029	Great! Welcome aboard, then! Next stop: Superbia Belt!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
030	So, the end is near...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
031	Within my flesh and blood, the Shell of the World... The people of the territories of the seven sins have changed far too drastically.
032	Has all of this change and progress finally altered things beyond the scope of the Dragon Realm that my Truth so fervently acted to preserve?
033	It is a but a relic now, so much has been lost. Its degradation consumes my very being.
034	Heh... Haha...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
035	This must truly be the end—both of any hope for restoring the world that the dragons once envisioned, and for the absurd dream I once held.
036	Yet in spite of it all...or rather, because of it all, the time has come for a new beginning.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
037	You, human Alchemist Nimul, who've come bearing a wish to create the world anew...
038	So long as I exist as the cornerstone of this world, your invasion will fail.
039	But there is still time.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0042
040	The world is, as it shall always be, mine.
041	Should you deny this for even a moment, I will not hesitate to show you.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
042	You shall see the revolution you so desire! Witness what truly awaits the future of this world!
043	Shall we see how well you're able to weather another trial?
044	Know what becomes of foolish humans who act in defiance of the Truth!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
045	Is everyone prepared?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
046	This will be a race against time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
047	While Eulalia and the others keep Ouroboros' phantoms busy outside, we'll recapture the tower.
048	Let's move out!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
049	...! What in the world?!
050	Is this the Temple of Beelzebub, the Cursed Beast of Gluttony? Why is it inside the tower?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
051	No, this must be...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
052	The Dragon Realm.
053	The Dragon what, now?
054	What's that?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
055	The dragons that once ruled over this domain had the ability to change the world's properties as they saw fit.
056	As spiritual beings with flesh and blood, they had the power to determine the laws of the world—to determine what was true, basically.
057	They called this Dragon Realm their sanctuary. It is the very manifestation of their power.
058	So that's the official name for this place? Anyhow, that still doesn't answer why a whole shrine's been stuffed inside here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
059	This tower's made from magil and the cores of the Cursed Beasts. Did Ouroboros activate it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
060	The air in here is decidedly abnormal. Everything here lay in the palm of my lady's hand... Or, perhaps it's more fitting to say it is like an embryo in the womb. The embryo of a new world.
061	That...doesn't fill me with a lot of confidence.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
062	But we can still move forward. Sensing the way the magil's flowing through the air, I believe something must be above us.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
063	Then we'd better get going. There's no telling what might happen if we stay he—	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
064	Eeek!
065	Emmel!
066	Who goes there?!
067	"Who goes there"? Really?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
068	As well-known as I was, that's the second time I've been asked that question today!
069	I suppose that's just the way it is when you're in a different time period.
070	This magil—and you, with it—are phantoms born of Ouroboros, I take it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
071	Correct. I am Ignacio. Esai Ignacio.
072	Huh?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0025
073	Did you just say "Ignacio"?
074	Mm, yes, you're called the same, aren't you? Quite the coincidence, isn't it? Or, rather...	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
075	It may be more sensible to assume your name is inherited. I swear, my peers never knew what to do without me!
076	Perhaps the name was passed down among the generations because I still had an unfinished role to play.
077	Lord Nimul—
078	Please don't address me like that. You calling me "Lord" is somehow...unsettling.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
079	Nimul...
080	Nimul, then. I'll handle this...vagabond. You go on ahead.
081	Are you out of your mind?! It's not like these are normal enemies fighting with spears and shields. Going in solo is suicide!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
082	Maybe so, but we can't afford to waste any more time dealing with this right now, can we?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
083	......
084	(He's right. If Ouroboros has noticed we're here, our best course of action is to strike where it hurts the most...and fast.)
085	(Still...)
086	Besides, you left those other four to keep the enemy's minions occupied. Now it's my turn to do the same.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0001
087	If their lives can be thrown away to buy some time, there's no reason you should make any special exceptions for me.
088	You're wrong, Ignacio.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
089	Eulalia and the others will survive. I have every faith in their abilities, and in their will to live. I'm not so sure I can say the same for you.
090	Oho, do I smell some discord in your little group? That will certainly make my job quite a bit easier!	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
091	Geh! Fallen?! Where did they come from?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
092	Fallen, eh? That's a good name for them. Simple and to the point.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0044
093	When one is consumed by sin, they lose all sense of self and fall into a violent, impulsive stupor.
094	Fooo...
095	And that's precisely why they cannot oppose their own sin.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0010
096	So...hungry... Always...so hungry...
097	...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
098	This is just like back in the Gula Belt, when we fought Beelzebub!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
099	Innumerable Fallen just keep on spawning from the corruption in the air around us!
100	Quite right. The very atmosphere itself keeps them coming.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
101	Ouroboros really knows how to think on her feet, I must say!
102	And she wasn't blessed with a parent who could teach her that kind of thing, which makes it all the more impressive.
103	Ouroboros has become quite fond of strong-arming her way through things, but originally her strategy was to attack people with images of the past.
104	You love to hear yourself talk, don't you? Are you planning on telling us what's really going on here, or not?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
105	......
106	I'm just here to do my job. I believe that Ouroboros called it a "trial."	VO_esai.esai_sys_0007
107	And you lot are obliged to pass it.
108	A trial? To fight her?! What, is she going to assign us handicaps based on our performance to even the playing field?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
109	She won't have to, since she is already nearly expired.
110	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
111	She'll die if nothing's done. But of course, you already knew that, didn't you...Ignacio?
112	If you're really the successor to my name, you should be well aware of the situation.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0003
113	......
114	Ignacio, what's he talking about?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
115	The Shell of the World has its limits. At least, that's what my father told me.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
116	Ouroboros documented everything, and in doing so, she affixed her Truth to the seven Belt Regions.
117	The problem is, humans have since produced too much of that sinful magil...more than the Cosmic Egg can handle.
118	So by limits, you mean that the vessel containing this world is in danger of rupturing and...falling apart, I guess?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
119	Was that what those cracks running through the sky were?
120	Naturally. And equally natural is the impending demise of the existence you know as Ouroboros.
121	If victory is your goal, you need only wait. This battle will fight itself.
122	What? Can it possibly be that simple?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
123	Of course not! Think about it! What he's saying is basically that the world's about to end!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
124	What?!
125	Wait. Doesn't that mean we've already lost? What have we even been fighting for, then?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0014
126	Is that the only thing you care about? If it's a question of who wins and who loses, I would consider you to be the victors.
127	The sins of humanity have exceeded God's ability to pass judgment. There is no more definitive sign of victory for you than that.
128	What you're saying, then, is that Ouroboros—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
129	Is essentially this very world itself, yes. As I'm certain even you've concluded by now.
130	How could she...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
131	Nimul?
132	Hmm?
133	What kind of sick individual are you? What is this talk of trials, and the death of the world? How is that supposed to be a victory for humans? And why do you seem to take such delight in it all?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
134	And...if it's all true...then how did it get to this point? We were supposed to be working together to save the world!
135	Why did none of you ever warn us? Why did no one tell us this could happen? How could you keep that from us?!
136	We did tell you.	VO_esai.esai_battle_0016
137	What?
138	I told you. Mesarthim told you. Matia told you. The surviving dragons, who believed so strongly in humanity's future, told you.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
139	The future can only be won through battle—through bloodshed. I taught her that.
140	I ensured that she understood there could be no new creation without combat...without destruction.
141	We ally ourselves with Ouroboros to atone for the sin that made her what she is.
142	Yes... This is all because of our original sin.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
143	But why does it have to be this way?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
144	This is just the Truth of the future we've built.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0006
145	The only thing humans can truly understand is bringing harm to one another.
146	Ouroboros reached that conclusion after many years of observing humanity's history unfold.
147	If you find this possibility unacceptable, then the only thing you can do is change it, through your own power.
178	What on earth was she thinking? There's got to be a way to change the future for the better...right? Isn't there?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
179	That line of thinking is a privilege afforded only to the living. For the dead, our only concern is the lingering attachments we leave behind.
148	...!
149	Andechs?
150	I don't have the foggiest idea what in blazes you're trying to say...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
151	But if you're looking for someone to take on the big-mouthed newcomer, I'm your man.
152	Except, there's—!
153	No time left, I know. So let's try this!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
154	Ignacio, we'll take on this joker together. How's that? You wanted to deal with him in the first place, right?
155	That sounds good to me. Bring it on!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
156	No matter what the future may hold, there will still be sacrifices.
157	I do believe that. And yet, for some reason I can't quite explain, I don't buy anything else this other Ignacio is saying.
158	Oh, dear! Have I made an archrival of my own kin?	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
159	To put it lightly, yes. I've hated every single word that's come out of your mouth.
160	All right, as long as you're with him, Andechs, I can approve of this arrangement. I'm counting on you two!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
161	Just don't go dying while we're gone, you hear?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
162	I've recalibrated the Hamal using Nimul's power. It should be effective now against even products of Alchemy.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
163	Got it. Just leave this to us.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
164	You ready, Ignacio? I'll take the right.
165	Then I'm on the left! You're really okay with this, though?
166	With what?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
167	With dying here.
168	What are you talking about?
169	Anyone who goes into any battle risks dying, right? It's just a hazard of the job. And one I plan on avoiding.
170	I see. Two have stepped up against me. Though your numbers are few, I'll humor this little display of bravado.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
171	You're awfully confident, aren't you?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
172	This body is already dead. There's nothing left for me to lose.
173	If what you said is accurate, though, then I'd say you have some regrets. "Lingering attachments" were your exact words, I believe.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
174	I do, of course. But those have nothing to do with the task at hand. So, are we doing this, then? Let's get to work. I've never been fond of slacking.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
175	You two have now met your unmaker. You will fall here.
176	Hyaahh! We'll see about that!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
