001	I guess that's all of the bandits.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
002	We let a few of them escape.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
003	Never mind that. Forget about them. More importantly, the squirrel pottery.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
004	Where is that merchant?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
005	...! Lord Zahar, over there.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
006	Huff...huff...he-help!
007	Hyahahaha! Hold on!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
008	Those bandits... Spica, let's chase them! That squirrel is mine.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
009	Understood.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
010	Aaack!
011	Heheh. If you value your life, give me all your money!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
012	Hey, you scum.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
013	Hm?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
014	Aghhh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
015	Wh-what the...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
016	Aghhh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0027
017	I will not forgive you for pointing your sword towards Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0010
018	Wh-who are you people...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
019	Never mind! Kill them!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
020	Hmph. You seem to have little regard for your own lives. Spica, let's take them out and then retrieve the squirrel figurine.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
021	Understood!
