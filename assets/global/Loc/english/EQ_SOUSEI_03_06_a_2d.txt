001	I beseech the supreme...!
002	There we go. All finished.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
003	Sorry, Emmel. In the end, I was the one who needed to be saved.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0035
004	Don't worry about it. Are you all right?
005	Yeah. I think I may have overdone it by equipping the Engineer Solder with the boosters...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
006	Perhaps so, yes.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
007	Anyhow, we've gotta get back to Nimul and the others. How do we get back up there?
008	Huh? Did the wall collapse in the fight?
009	It seems like it did. Also, do you hear that voice?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
010	—eeeeey, is anyone—
011	That voice? It can't be...
012	Adaleigh?
013	It's Icona! That's Icona's voice!
014	Really?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
015	That's gotta be her! Let's go, Emmel!
016	Icona!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
017	Is that you, Adaleigh? Perfect! The cavalry has arrived!
018	Huh? Why are you locked up?
019	It's a long story! Oh, Emmy's here too!
020	Y-yes! Are you all right?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
021	I'm A-OK! How about you guys?
022	Are you two hurt? No, that's no good! Let's get you properly patched up!
023	You can tell?
024	Of course! This mechanical eye here can detect magil!
025	I can tell just by looking, so I knew all along. Even about what's inside of you.
026	Huh? Wh-what are you—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
027	Can we discuss this later?! Damn, where's the key?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
028	Adaleigh, you're still living in the fast lane. It works out for me this time, since I'm in a hurry too.
029	Huh? What do you mean you're in a hurry?
030	Ahh! Another earthquake?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0022
031	There's no time! Adaleigh, you've got to get me out of here right now!
032	What're you talking about? Why are you in such a rush?! Tell me!
033	You can be so dense sometimes! It's the Cursed Beast, okay? It's waking up!
034	What?!
035	I've gotta seize this opportunity before it disappears! I've gotta make observations, get some data!
036	Wait, did you say that Belphegor is waking up? But that's never—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
037	It's true! Trust me, Adaleigh!
038	Urk...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
039	Belphegor has entered an active phase. If nothing is done, then it's sure to wreak havoc on this region.
040	But I can stop it. No one else can, but I have the ability.
041	Will you trust me?
042	I...
043	If we move now, there's still time. So let me out of here.
044	Fine! I got it!
045	Hold it, Adaleigh. You mustn't release her.
046	Huh?
047	Long time no see, Minny! Um. What's this about not letting me out?
048	The body of a member of the inspection team was discovered.
049	He was attacked. Murdered. And it happened over a week ago.
050	...
051	Strange, isn't it? According to what Adaleigh said, you were just recently in Redington.
052	Your involvement with the inspection team is a lie. That transmission that Adaleigh heard... You were behind it, weren't you?
053	Aren't you a smart cookie? Guess that's only to be expected of Mayor Fedele's son.
054	Why did you do all of this, Icona? Answer me!
055	Emmel! Are you all right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
056	Nimul? What's going on?
057	We don't really know either, but...
058	Someone has been working to awaken the Cursed Beast sleeping here. We can't let that happen.
059	What? Icona...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
060	What are you talking about, Minario? This is just a joke, right? Lower your gun, please.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1028
061	Stay back, Adaleigh. This woman is no longer the Icona you once knew.
062	What...?
063	What are you talking about, Minario?!
064	You remember when I said that the number of Fallen has been increasing recently, right?
065	Don't tell me...
066	It was her. She orchestrated the illegal mining operations, tricking the miners and forcing them into contact with the Cursed Beast's corruption. It was all her.
067	Icona, you called the miners down here as bait for Belphegor, didn't you?
068	Minario, you're a proper search dog, aren't you? I bet you've been sniffing me out like the mutt you are for ages!
069	Hmm.
070	Icona, why? How could you...?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1028
071	Wow. That's a tough question. If I was forced to answer, I guess I'd have to say I'm doing this because it was necessary.
072	Necessary? It was necessary to wake up the Cursed Beast?!
073	I'm glad you asked! I figured it out, y'know.
074	I figured out how to control the Cursed Beast!
075	Control the Cursed Beast? Have you lost it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
076	Now that's something I can't answer with confidence. I might not be sane. Even I have moments where I wonder.
077	However, I'm sure that I'm close to the truth.
078	Isn't sin something that originates from humankind? If it is, we should be able to control it!
079	By using logic to understand and analyze, we can control anything in the universe. That is the foundation of magic.
080	Think about it: if we can do it with other things, why couldn't we repurpose the Cursed Beasts for our own goals?
081	Nonsense. It does not matter that the magil of the Cursed Beasts is made of our sins. The scope of our existence is much too different.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
082	The consistent energy needed to bind that much magil doesn't exist in this world!
083	I'm surprised to hear that from you, of all people.
084	What...?
085	You're the ones who gave me the idea. You're the Sephira, and she... She is the Vessel of Purification, who has a Cursed Beast sealed within herself!
086	...!
087	That's right! I don't need to worry about having enough energy to seal the Cursed Beasts if I have a vessel!
088	You're so so so very fascinating! How can a Cursed Beast be crammed into such a tiny package?!
089	Stop it...
090	Truly, even I couldn't have imagined something so ingenious. The core of the Cursed Beast is sealed inside of you, isn't it?
091	Stop it!
092	The core of the Cursed Beast is...inside of Emmel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
093	You never noticed? The Vessel of Purification is just a container to stash the cores of the Cursed Beasts!
094	How do you know this?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
095	That is a secret passed down only to the druidic priestesses of Sephira!
096	Emmel is a container for the Cursed Beasts?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_chara_1007
097	That means we didn't defeat Asmodeus, but—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
098	And you knew this, Emmel? You knew?
099	Nimul, I...	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
100	Well, well. The secret's out! Anyhow, I was planning to use the Cursed Beast to discover new innovations in the use of magic.
101	That's why my colleague got pretty angry. I expect he'll change his mind if it turns out to be a success, of course.
102	So if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to my lab as soon as possible.
103	We're racing against time here, okay? Belphegor's gonna wake up soon, and he's gonna be grouchy!
104	You guys get it, don't you? There's really no time left, so...
105	Could you hand Emmy over to me so I can work on my experiments?
106	What?
107	No.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
108	Oh well. Can't say I didn't try.
109	Gah! We're surrounded?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
110	Like Minny said, that transmission was staged. Obviously, this whole setup was a trap.
111	Everything was calculated... You knew that if you went missing, Adaleigh would look for you!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
112	Of course! Wasn't it a clever plan? Really caught you off your guard, didn't I?
113	...!
114	Adaleigh believed in you!
115	How could you do this to him?! What is he to you?!
116	He's family, of course. Your point?
117	You're insane.
118	I'll take that as a compliment!
119	Adaleigh.
120	...
121	I can't imagine how you feel or what you're thinking right now, so either way—
122	Take the path that you won't regret.
123	I...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_2028
124	It's fine for you to stand up for yourself or to turn and run.
125	You could even choose to side with her.
126	Just commit to whatever you do. Making a half-hearted choice will only result in more misfortune.
127	I...
128	I...!
129	I will stop you, Icona!
130	Even though I'm probably the only one who could really control the Cursed Beast?
131	A lot of people will surely suffer if we do things your way.
132	This isn't what I built that airship for!
133	There it is...
134	That determination on your face... Your heart and mind set only on this one task... For once, your eyes are not veering away to anything else.
135	Good, Adaleigh. That's perfect. That's what makes you a true child of this region!
