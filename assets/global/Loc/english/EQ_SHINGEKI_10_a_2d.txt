001	Raaaaaargh!	VO_ErenKyojin.ErenKyojin_battle_0004
002	Eren, fall back! Switch to omni-directional mobility... Now!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
003	It's time for you to eat dirt, monkey!	VO_levi.levi_battle_0004
004	Groaghhhhhhh!!!
005	Sorry. We put a heavy burden on those shoulders.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0035
006	Shut up!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
007	Whoa! Okay, then. So... What exactly are you up to right now?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0027
008	I'm recalibrating the Mecha Weapon. I need to incorporate new data in order to target the Giant Taurus more accurately and effectively.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
009	Is that not what I am supposed to be doing?
010	A weapon is not just for fighting. You carry not only your father's legacy, but also the burden of your own justice and the responsibility to protect this world.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_chara_1001
011	I don't need you to tell me that.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0010
012	The Titans are falling back!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
013	Don't pursue them! Our goal here is not to take down the Titans!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0015
014	We're here to return them to their own world! If we can do that, then we'll have succeeded!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
015	If we can do that, indeed.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
016	We must concentrate on defeating the Giant Taurus first.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
017	Tch. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth to just let them go, but...fine. Orders are orders. You got that, Judith?	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
018	Yeah. Got it!	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
019	Judith, you hold the fate of Babel...and also their world in your hands. I believe in you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0041
020	Basheeny...
021	Hm?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
022	I have no intention of forgiving you and yours for taking my dad away from me.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
023	I understand... I wasn't expectating to be forgiven, Judith.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
024	I do hope that we can talk about this a little more after we've settled everything here, though.
025	Yes... I have come to see that we have the same goal. Perhaps there was just a...misunderstanding.
026	Now that I've met you, I have come to think that might be possible.
027	Thank you, Judith. I know that it is not easy, even for me, to allow for the possibility of something like that.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
028	Basheeny... Should I really believe it? World peace...	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
029	Is that really something that you believe in?
030	Of course.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
031	If that's the case, then...I guess I really have no choice!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0021
032	We've gone and done it now!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
033	The Giant Taurus and the Titans are all coming at us!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
034	Heh, what's that? You scared?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
035	As if, half-wit. Hope your knees aren't shaking too much!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0012
036	Hey. Be serious. It's time for the real fight to start.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0010
037	We'll draw the attention of the Titans around them. Eren, Mikasa, are you ready?	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
038	Ready!
039	I'll go with you. Better put everything we've got into this.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0032
040	Watch for Reiner... We've got this.	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
041	I won't forget you, even after you return to your own world!
042	Grrrrrrrrroooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr!
043	...!
044	Urk...!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
045	Tehre!
046	Don't get distracted! You're the only one who can do this! I'm counting on you!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
047	Take all of the suffering that victims of the Giant Taurus have experienced and use it to hit that monster even harder!
048	Got it!
049	That's the last time you hurt anyone else, Giant Taurus!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
050	Not only for my father's legacy, but for this world, for everyone... I fight to protect all of it!
051	Anti-Giant Taurus Mecha Weapon, maximum energy attack!
052	Wh-what? This is...all...?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
053	Wait... Is it...reacting to my Alchemia?
054	What an incredible response! With this, then it must be possible!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0046
055	Uggggrraaaah!
056	Giant Taurus, this is the end of you! I will overcome you, and everything else that stands in my way!
057	The electrifying mechanic extraordinaire, Judith, will wipe you out with a swoosh!
058	You're nothing to me! I will move forward, no matter what!
059	Do you hear me?	VO_judith.judith_chara_2002
060	I said, do you hear me?!	VO_judith.judith_chara_3002
