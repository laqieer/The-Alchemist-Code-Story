001	Good evening.
002	Lady Shion! Lady Asuka is waiting for you. Please, come in.
003	Welcome back, Shion.
004	Asuka. You look well.
005	As do you. I'm glad you were able to stop by.
006	Things are progressing rather quickly, but I wanted to check on you.
007	You know, this reminds me so much of Wadatsumi.
008	The gardens looked so beautiful bathed in moonlight.
009	Remember how we'd stay up just to watch the stars?
010	Oh, yes. I had to make sure you turned in after a while, or you'd never go to sleep.
011	Shion, will you... will you dance for me?
012	Like you used to do?
013	Would you care to join me?
014	Don't tease me like that... You know I'm no good at dancing.
015	I could never possess the finesse you have for dance.
016	Fufu. All right then.
017	Shion steps under the moonlit swathe, and with a graceful gesture, begins to dance.
018	I was born and raised a retainer to Asuka, daughter of the noble house I served.
019	Where Asuka was groomed to succeed as the future heir...
020	I was taught to dance, to protect, and if necessary... to kill.
021	I stayed by Asuka's side, even when the shadow of Greed Dike loomed large over Wadatsumi.
022	It was then that a sweeping change entered our lives.
023	As you know, tensions are rising between Greed Dike and Wadatsumi.
024	Let us speak honestly and without reservation: at this rate, war will be inevitable.
025	I may be of Greed Dike nobility, but I have no desire to partake in this... unnecessary violence.
026	It is, therefore, with great sincerity that I propose a partnership between our houses.
027	Pardon me for speaking so brashly, but... what are your terms?
028	Straight to the point. I respect that.
029	My house will shelter yours, should war break out between our countries. You will be safe from their aggressions.
030	In exchange, I seek your aid in furthering a vision of mine.
031	And the nature of your "vision"?
032	You must be curious, I'm sure. I can tell you this much: it is nothing like what these shortsighted fools seek with mindless bloodshed.
033	First, I must ask that you pass a test to ascertain your abilities.
034	I would like you to negotiate with someone on my behalf.
035	There is a rather... shall we say, stubborn, acquiantance of mine who is in dire need of a new perspective.
036	Very well. I will see to it that this matter is taken care of.
037	Shion, please continue to keep in touch with him.
038	As you wish, my lady.
039	Excellent. I look forward to how you'll resolve this. After all, I've heard good things...
040	Hmm. We may have accepted his test, Shion, but I can't say I know how to read into this.
041	Don't worry. Whatever he has in store for us, I'm certain we will be able to handle it.
042	I must admit he is our best bet for safeguarding our house against Greed Dike, if war does happen to break out.
043	And as far as I can tell, he is more interested in a mutually beneficial relationship than one of subjugation.
044	I hope you are right. Be safe, Shion.
045	I will.
