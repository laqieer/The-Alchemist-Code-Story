002	Oh. It's you. We got 'em holed up like rats in that dingy little shrine.
003	Won't be long before we smoke 'em out. Doubt there's much left after we let the monsters loose in there! Gahaha!
004	Perhaps I should remind you what your contract entails.
005	Yeah, yeah, I know. My boys are standing by and ready to grab that brat before things get too messy. I'll hand him over in one piece.
006	Alright boys, move out! After this contract is done, we can feast like kings!
007	...Such an inelegant and inefficient method of operation. I can only hope he knows what he's doing.
