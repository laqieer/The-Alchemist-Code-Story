001	The past should be left behind.
002	Yet that rarely seems to happen.
003	Instead, the past haunts us.
004	It binds us to the present, turning our gazes away from the future.
005	...
006	However...
007	The day my childhood was ended, my memories were swept away like seeds on the wind, and returned to the earth.
008	Perhaps one day they will bloom.
009	Nourished as they are by corruption...
010	They should grow well, and blossom into beautiful flowers.
011	So long as I am looking at those flowers, I will be able to move forward, even if I am looking over my shoulder all the while.
012	Even a step backward will take me forward.
013	Even if I should trip or fall on the way, I am sure that everything will be all right.
014	But as for right now...
015	Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.
016	Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.
017	Count to one hundred, and get a demon!
018	Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.
019	It's like a horde of demons passed through here.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
020	The Discarnate Power is spreading corruption everywhere it goes.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
021	The corruption is steadily turning the people of Wadatsumi, the Shiba Senko, and the soldiers from Greed Dike into demons.
022	What about Yomi?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
023	Since the Mikaboshi was taken from her, she has weakened considerably, and will not wake.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
024	But...that's not the worst of it. There's also...
025	Jin.
026	I couldn't stop it.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
027	Kagutsuchi didn't affect it. There was nothing I could do.
028	I was pathetic!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
029	...
030	The duty of the royal family...	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
031	I know. I need to pursue it, but...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
032	In that case, perhaps I...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
033	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
034	Perhaps I could...help you.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
035	Yomi was no match for it, even after turning into a demon.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0012
036	I cannot betray my country.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
037	As the General of Greed Dike, for my country, and for Wadatsumi...
038	I will not abandon a friend in need.
039	Both Yomi and Jin assisted me, after all.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
040	...
041	Did that sound immature?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
042	It was excellent. A fine speech.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
043	If possible, I'd like to...um...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
044	Come on, out with it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0006
045	T-t-to help you, as your...f-friend.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
046	Me?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
047	I'm sorry if the notion, um, offends you. I just thought that...since we share goals for the future, we could be comrades, fighting side by side.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
048	Didn't I insult you? Are you a sucker for punishment or something?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
049	That was then. This is now.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
050	You helped Yomi, too.
051	So I want to help you in return.
052	You're a good person.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
053	I am...?
054	I-I guess?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
055	What are you blushing for? I'm hardly praising you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
056	Heheh...heheheheheheh. I've never been told that I'm a good person before. Heheheh.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0009
057	Ngh... What is that laugh?! Stop that!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
058	Oh, please don't cringe!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
059	I was just...happy.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
060	I...don't dislike you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0003
061	Huh?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
062	I'm used to good people who are abysmally foolish, thanks to a certain someone I used to know.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0007
063	A certain...someone?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
064	A good person, and a fool, like you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
065	I feel like you're making fun of me.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
066	That's because I am making fun of you.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
067	Ngh.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0026
068	But isn't that part of it?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0001
069	Of being friends?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0007
070	Let's go.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
071	Yomi...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
072	Um, are you...feeling better?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
073	Yes.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
074	I don't just mean your injuries, but also, um...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
075	...
076	Thank you, Leafah.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0034
077	Y-Yomi...?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
078	The Discarnate Power is likely headed for my village.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
079	That's the only place I can think of.
080	There is a statue behind my village in the shape of a demon.
081	It has been absorbing the corruption in the world and suppressing the demon blood in the people of Wadatsumi. You could say that it is one of the guardians of this nation.
082	I believe that the Discarnate Power intends to use the Mikaboshi to release the corruption from that statue into the world.
083	If that happens, the entire country—perhaps even the entire continent—will be overrun by demons.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
084	Onigashima...
085	...
086	It's all right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
087	Huh?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
088	We made a promise.
089	A promise?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
090	My brother and I—we made a promise together...
091	And I'm going to keep it.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
