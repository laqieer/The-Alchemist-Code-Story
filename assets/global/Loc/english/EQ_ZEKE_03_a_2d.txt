001	Arghh!	VO_caesar.caesar_battle_0022
002	...Seems like that woman got away.
003	Inform all the knights! Have the castle completely surrounded, and don't let a single soul escape!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0001
004	Yes, Sir!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
005	You fiend...!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0028
006	The Magna Code is absolute. Moreover, if we leave any of Wrath's royal family alive, it will definitely give rise to new conflicts.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0010
007	We will exterminate every single root, however little blood connection there may be. If that's what's required to stop this war, we'll see it through.
008	Is that... is that really your sense of justice?! That's a horrifyingly chilling sense of justice.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0021
009	Blood Wolf Zeke... I will never ever forgive you for this!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0013
010	My soul will take roots of Wrath in these lands... until the next generation of Wratharis summons me back to their cause.
011	And when that day comes... I will definitely punish you!
012	...
013	I will see this justice through. I will utilize this Power, for the sake of a peaceful world.
014	This is the woman from before...	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0006
015	It looks like she fought the Holy Guard while simultaneously defending her king. She was able to take out so many, all by herself...
016	...
017	...She already died.
018	Both you and me have killed a lot of people for the sake of protecting what's dear to us. That truth will never change.
019	...?
020	Did I just hear something from beneath the cape of the king?
021	W-waah! Waah!
022	A baby?<br>You really chose the wrong era to be born.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0010
023	Mm... mommy...
024	...!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0025
025	(Laughter?)
026	Hee-hee!
027	What innocent laughter...
028	Heehee.. mommy...
029	Was I really about to raise my sword against a baby? What on earth have I been doing?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0020
030	Covered in blood, murdering a smiling babe... could that really be peace?!
031	...
032	Darn it... Have I really been envying and using this kind of Power?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0022
033	The future I strive for... the peace I want to build... does not involve terminating this laughter.
034	This Power is too dangerous.<br>I... should not have it!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0042
035	I should not use it ever again!!!
036	(That moment, on that day... I was saved by the baby in my arms.)
037	(It wasn't my life or my honor that was saved. It was my soul, rather.)
038	Argh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
039	What's the matter?!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
040	I've come to report! A group of Wratharis rebels who had been hiding in the nearby woods have infiltrated this village!
041	Keep your calm! If they were able to hide in the woods, it must have been a small force! Restore our formation and intercept their attack!
042	Understood!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
043	Oh no! What is Zeke the Blood Wolf doing here?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
044	Surrender yourselves.<br>If you put down your weapons without a fuss, your lives will be spared.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0014
045	Do you really think we could believe that?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
046	I haven't forgotten how many fleeing soldiers you murdered on that battlefield!
047	...I will repeat myself. Give up, and surrender yourselves. The Dawn of Wrath has ended a long time ago.
048	It hasn't ended! Nothing ever did!<br>Yes, everything is still the same!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
049	Let there be glory for the people of Wratharis!
050	What? This light! A transmutation?!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0022
051	...
052	Arghh! Ughh... W-Wratharis...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
053	...He succumbed through the excessive alchemic energy in his body? But... this phantom!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0016
054	I remember your face.<br>How could I ever forget?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
055	We met at the castle of Wratharis...<br>Do you realize that they used Alchemy to summon you?
056	...Yes, I'm aware of that. I am a dead person. In the end, no one had been able to flee that burning castle.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
057	Judging by your body, your transmutation was incomplete. Your manifestation won't last that long.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
058	It seems like the war is still continuing.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
059	No, it did end.<br>This is nothing but a flickering ember of bloody days of the past.
060	I see...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0006
061	Am I supposed to express my grudge towards you now? Or... am I supposed to thank you, hm?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
062	...What?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
063	The war did end.<br>So you were right.
064	But it does make me wonder. If that was truly the last bloodshed, then what am I doing here?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0010
065	Tell me, Blood Wolf. When is this peace you speak of finally going to come?
066	Well...	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0019
067	If you cannot answer that question, why don't we start over once more?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
068	Why don't the two of us start a second Dawn of Wrath?
069	Tsk! You fool!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
070	Ah, I'm glad.<br>You're finally starting to show some spirit.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0011
071	I always wondered. What would have happened if I hadn't left Caesar's side that day?
072	Would our combined power still not have rivaled yours?
073	Come on, tell me.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0011
