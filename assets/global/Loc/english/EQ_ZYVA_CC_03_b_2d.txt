001	Just...like...this.
002	Ahahah...ahahahahahahahah!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
003	Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0009
004	I did it! I did it, old man!
005	I wanted to kill him. Oh, how long I've waited for this day... With my own hands! Dead! Really, really dead!
006	I don't belong to anyone but myself! Everything I steal...everything I kill...is mine! All mine!
007	Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
008	This laugh... I...sound just like my old man...
009	Ahahah...ahah...ahahahah... I've laughed too much, and now I'm...crying...
010	Ahahahahahah! Unnghh... Ahahah...unnghhh...	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0018
011	Over there! That's the place indicated in the report! Some lunatic has slaughtered our soldiers!
012	G-get her!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
013	Ahah! Ahahahah! I... I did it! I've...done it!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
014	Take her away! Throw her in the dungeon! Get her out of my sight!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
015	Wh-what in the name of the gods has she done...?
016	She decapitated that soldier and placed a skull on his severed neck...then stabbed the body...repeatedly...
017	Wratharis feared that the deeds of those massacred soldiers would somehow be brought to light, so it could not allow the incident to be made public.
018	I was to be dealt with secretly, within Wratharis' borders.
019	My execution was swiftly decided.
