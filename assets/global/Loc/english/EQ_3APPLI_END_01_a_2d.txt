001	Oh? You are a human, yet you managed to come here.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_gacha_0006
002	I am Ouroboros—the observer of destiny.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
003	I acknowledge your determination for having made it here. What is your wish?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
004	I want to save Rena!
005	That's quite an ambitious request.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_gacha_0006
006	Let me see. In your current state, you should be able to open this door.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
007	Go then, free yourself from your shackles, and fulfill your wish.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0010
008	This is goodbye. But, before you leave, I will tell you this.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
009	Beyond here is the world where the three worlds you have traveled to temporarily overlap.
010	There you just might be able to fulfill that ambitious desire of yours.
011	Do not forget what it is that you wish for. Now go!
012	No...I'm going to be consumed! Destroy...me!	VO_rena.rena_sys_0042
013	I will destroy the Rayvner! I will not let you die!
014	Rena? You're not thinking of...
015	Please! Destroy me...destroy the Rayvner!
016	What? Reality is distorting...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
017	Why? When I am...at the end...	VO_rena.rena_sys_0021
018	When did I first become self-aware?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
019	It feels like just yesterday, yet a long time ago at the same time.
020	In any case, I was on my own.
021	I was alone, yet this was the only world I knew and I did not even know what it felt like to be lonely.
022	However...one day, a small hole appeared. A hole as small as the eye of a needle.
023	Through that tiny hole, I was able to observe the outside world.
024	In the outside world, there were many people living happily.
025	There were different types of people with different types of connections. Seeing this created a hole in my heart.
026	For the first time, I felt lonely and isolated. Thus, I found myself wishing...
027	"I want to connect with someone."
028	I did not know that this was something forbidden.
029	Huh? Just when I managed to successfully summon Haoumaru. Where did he go?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
030	That juvenile one is gone too! What's going on?!
031	Sakura! And Tyrfing! Both of you are back to normal! But...what is this place?
032	We seem to have been swallowed deeper into Rena.
033	<p_name>, do you know something?
034	You know...
035	Who would've thought...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
036	That small one had that much power?!	VO_sakura.sakura_battle_0017
037	It sounds like a far-fetched story, but...this situation is pretty far-fetched as well.
038	It looks like we've no choice but to believe you.
039	So...what do we need to do in order to save Rena?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
040	So there you are. Let's end this quickly.
041	If you're not going to kill me...then I'll kill you!
042	No! We've no choice but to fight back!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
