001	I was surprised to see Tina get so emotional. Somehow, it was comforting.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	Yeah. I guess you have to hand it to the chief of Voda who can control nature.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
003	There was so much truth in your words that it made the problems of human society seem so fleeting. You touched me.
004	Right back at you.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
005	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
006	What you said about Saga being on the verge of extinction and how we don't have time to bicker amongst ourselves...	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
007	I don't know...something about that moved me.
008	Tina! Yes, I agree!
009	No...forget about that. I got a little too worked up.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
010	Right...I wanted to ask you about that.
011	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
012	Why did you get so worked up? Is it something to do with Fuu?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
013	... ...
014	You called Fuu "that man." It sounded to me like you have a close relationship with him.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
015	Huh? Is that true?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
016	I don't intend to keep secrets from the two of you, but give me a little more time. When the time is right, I'll tell you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
017	No way?! Does that mean...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
018	...Okay.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
019	Huh? Are you fine with that?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
020	He's telling us he'll tell us when the time is right. As our friend, shouldn't we trust his word?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
021	Friend...! Ah...is that the way you see him?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
022	What...?
023	You can be pretty curt sometimes, so it's hard to know what you're thinking.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
024	Hey, do you think of me as your friend as well?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
025	What are you prattling on about? Anyway, I'm tired of using my brain so much. I lack sugar.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0050
026	Did you want chocolate? Sorry...I gave it all to that old merchant just now.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
027	Huh...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
028	Well...he pointed us in the right direction, so I thought it would be rude not to thank him somehow.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
029	He seemed happy and told me that Lustburg candy was rare around these parts.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
030	What?! Ack...! That man...! I'm going to get it all back!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
031	Hey...! What are you talking about?! You can't!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
032	Friends, huh?
033	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
034	I just realized that it's been a while since I was walking alongside someone I truly trusted.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
035	Mocca...
036	What is this...nonsense...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
037	Heh...I can sense the child in the wind...let's go.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0010
