001	Urk!	VO_gino.gino_battle_0022
002	That's a hit!
003	Gino, can you stand?
004	Tch. I don't need your pity. You went easy on me, didn't you?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0015
005	The outcome was obvious, but you have gotten much stronger.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
006	Tch! Why?!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0029
007	Why can't I beat you?! After all that training...!
008	I had no distractions! I kept my focus on my training in order to surpass you!
009	So why...? Why the hell can't I defeat you?!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0018
010	That is because you still haven't found your true purpose as a knight.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0023
011	My purpose...as a knight?
012	The most important thing for a knight is that they have a reason for getting stronger.
013	Had you this understanding...
014	You would not be trampling upon that which others consider most important to them.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
015	I...!
016	I didn't mean...
017	But it's so true! They're an OTP for a reason!
018	I can see the two of them building such a happy little family together!
019	It'll be so perfect! A true happy ending!
020	I already know that not all families end up happy. You don't have to tell me that.
021	But... But that's why I...
022	...
023	Umm...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
024	Yes...?
025	I'm...ry.
026	What?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
027	I said, I'm sorry!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0035
028	You are?
029	To be honest, I still can't agree with the way you think.
030	But at least you never berated me for my beliefs.
031	Just like how I have my creed, you have strong beliefs of your own, but I refused to even try to see things from your point of view.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
032	For that, I'm sorry.
033	...
034	Um... Hello?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
035	This is...surprising.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
036	Huh?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
037	I'm actually used to people not being able to see things my way. They even call me the Mad Cupid.
038	I've never had anybody say something like that to me. This is something entirely new.
039	Hehe! This is nice! It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
040	...
041	Gino? What's the matter?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
042	Uhh... N-nothing!
043	Hmm? Hahaha! I see, I see. This is so cute!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0018
044	What do you mean, Eve?
045	Hehehe. Oh, never mind!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
073	You're a good person, Gino!
056	Wha—?!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
057	Yes he is, Eve. It's just hard to see through his tough exterior sometimes. Hahah.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
058	Just last week, he was holding an umbrella up for a stray kitten, keeping that grimace of his in place all the while. It was quite charming to see.
059	Y-you saw that?! N-never bring that up again!
060	Meow...
061	What's with you? Don't you have parents, or a brother, or something?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
062	Meow...
063	You just stay there. This umbrella's all busted up, so here. You can have it.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
064	Don't you follow me. You'll just get soaked in the rain again.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0002
065	He couldn't resist helping the little thing out.
066	Awwww...!
067	Don't look at me like that!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0026
068	Don't worry about it. Moa clearly thought it was very nice of you!
069	Huh?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
070	Tch! Whatever...
071	Heheh. Isn't this adorable?
046	Adorable, huh...? What about a stuffed kitten as a present? No, wait... Never mind.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
072	I thought you were being oddly quiet. Were you thinking about what gift to get her this whole time?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0044
047	Yeah, flowers might be nice. I bet she would show me the greatest smile if I gifted her a bouquet of flowers for White Day!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
048	And that... That would make my day.
049	Come to think of it, weren't you looking for me? Is there something you need?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
050	I'd be happy to help.
051	Nah, don't worry about it. I've gotta pick out a present for her on my own. That's how it should be done.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0008
052	Heh. Today's the day I get to show what I'm made of!
053	Besides, there's someone else here who needs your assistance more than me, right?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0010
054	Regardless of how you feel about this day...
055	The cookies taste no less sweet!
