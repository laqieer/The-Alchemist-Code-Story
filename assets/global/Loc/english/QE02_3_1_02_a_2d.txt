001	Hey, hurry up. If you take your time, we'll lose the little lady's trail.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
002	This ground is loose gravel. We're moving at our maximum speed. Do you want to get carried off into the river?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0010
003	Tsk. You clumsy fool. My bike could make twice the speed.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
004	Say that again, you ungrateful...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0012
005	Stop it. This is Johnny B. Tango.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
006	His name comes from the almost dancer-like grace he employs when finishing off his enemies. If you underestimate him, you'll get hurt.
007	Heh. So you're this massive-arm idiot's underling, huh? You've really come up in the world, Tara baby.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	Are you messing with me?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
009	I was being polite because you're Don's acquaintance, but now you've gone too far! Who do you think it was who rescued you?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0013
010	Shut up already. Nobody asked you to. Go home and dance the waltz or something.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
011	You...!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0017
012	This is what he does. He pushes his friends away to stop them from getting hurt.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0010
013	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
014	But it's not going to work anymore. There's no way I'm gonna let you leave me behind again!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0013
015	Were you intentionally trying to upset us?	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0009
016	Seriously. You're giving him way too much credit.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
017	Huh...?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
018	He's not that smart! He hasn't changed at all! He's an idiot, plain and simple! Don't read into his intentions!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
019	Yeah, Ronnie! This massive arm isn't worth saving!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
020	Huh...?
021	Don, it's not looking good! Alkaroids are approaching ahead!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0010
022	Shut up!
