001	Ah, the prodigy child makes his appearance.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0005
002	...
003	Boss. We found this one trying to break into our safe.
004	I'm glad you caught him. I've been wanting to meet him.
005	You...know who I am?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
006	Any successful loan shark knows to keep up with the latest news and trends.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
007	Word on the streets is that there's been someone in this region of Lost Blue causing trouble through tyranny and pillaging. Then you show up.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
008	Heh, I figured a loan shark like you would have a good bit of cash saved up somewhere.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
009	This is the only job that gets me any real profit.
010	Aren't you the head of a pretty big underground organization?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
011	I have no interest in being a leader or helping to usher in a new age. We're all just here to make some money.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
012	Here in Lost Blue? There's gotta be other places easier to do business and turn a profit than a place filled with trouble like this one.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
013	Trouble like you?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
014	I just don't want to let any moment of this life go to waste.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
015	I see. Idealistic, aren't you?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
016	I survive by stealing what I need, and I watch out for myself. That's how you gotta be to make it down here.
017	So you value your life?
018	Of course I do.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
019	And how is this wasteless life you lead? Any fun?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
020	Huh?
021	Do you have to be so abrasive?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
022	I'm sorry, I must have left my manners behind when your men dragged me in here.
023	Rather than stealing, have you ever considered that borrowing with the promise of paying trust back in dividends might be more rewarding in the long run?
024	I'm sure those words aren't self-serving at all, coming from a profiteer like you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
025	Ha. Aren't we all just biding time until we die? In that light, maybe life itself is the waste: why not enjoy it while you can?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
026	Aren't the futile things we do the whole point of living?
027	...
028	Try to look a little bit more lively. You ought to learn the pleasures of an honest day's work!	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
029	Even if that work isn't honest?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
030	Everybody's got enemies here in Lost Blue. Why not earn a little peace of mind by finding some people to watch your back? At the very least, it might help you rediscover your manners.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
031	There's no peace of mind that I'm willing to compromise my way of life for.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
032	Well, well, the very personification of the phrase 'no rest for the weary', aren't you?
033	...
034	Do you like to read?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
035	You know how?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
036	With the leisure of time, you can read some books. You could study the past to look into the future. You might even learn to have some ambition.
037	Ambition...
038	For example: I want to bring down a dragon.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
039	You're missing a few screws, aren't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
040	Have you seen one before?
041	No, because there aren't any.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
042	Some old texts say they used to soar through the blue skies in ancient times.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
043	They used to look down upon the world, these gloriously indomitable creatures at the top of the food chain.
044	Well, there aren't any today.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
045	An unseen legendary beast. A monster no person can subdue. A nonexistent threat to the world.
046	You even just said they're nonexistent.
047	I polish my skills. I gather funds, weapons, and friends. All in preparation for my chance, when it comes.
048	You've lost me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
049	Besides...
050	Hey, are you even hearing me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
051	Dragons, you know? What is greater than a dragon?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
052	...
053	Here I was wondering what kind of person would be able to make it to the top of the Tower Veda...
054	Oh, a fan, are you? You'll be glad to know I'm actually planning to add to my record as we speak. Your support would be very appreciated, of course.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
055	I actually heard a rumor that you were severely burned in your last little escapade to the surface.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
056	Is that what people are saying? How embarrassing.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0011
057	I figured this was my chance to take you out and set myself up for life.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
058	The simple-minded thinking of an animal. So you thought you'd come after little old injured me?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
059	That's the way things are done here in Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
060	Did you think you were the first to come up with that idea? There have been many.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0031
061	And yet you're the only one who actually listened to what I have to say. You've made me happy.
062	As a favor to you, we'll play by your silly little rules. Only...if I win, I get to steal you.
063	Wh-what do you mean by that?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
064	I will teach you the pleasure of an honest day's work.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
065	And if I win?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
066	That's just not going to happen.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
