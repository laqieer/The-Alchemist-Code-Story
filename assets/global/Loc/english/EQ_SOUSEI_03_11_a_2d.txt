001	Why are you keeping me here?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
002	Hmm?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
003	I refused to cooperate with you.
004	So wouldn't the obvious response be to throw me in a cell or something?
005	Now, now. Don't be so cold. You and your friends may have allied yourselves against me, but you're still guests of my precious little brother.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
006	What kind of host would I be if I just threw you in a prison cell?
007	I just can't comprehend the way your mind works...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
008	Oh, I wouldn't expect you to.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
009	That said, I do have one reason in particular... A very good reason for giving you a front row seat.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0025
010	And that is?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
011	As a matter of fact, I was just telling your brother...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
012	This experiment may not succeed.
013	That is the nature of experimentation, after all! Failure is all part of the process. No matter how well one prepares, the unexpected will always take its toll.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
014	But then... So what you're really saying is that you're making a sacrifice of this region!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
015	Is it really that shocking? You've taken your share of dangerous risks during your travels, have you not?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
016	I suppose you could say that, but...!
017	Well, what it comes down to is planning fail-safes for when an experiment goes wrong. That's a part of a scientist's duties.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
018	And you are one of those fail-safes.
019	I...am?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
020	You are the Vessel of Purification—the trump card we can play to rescue the Gula Belt Region.
021	It stands to reason that you mean to survive, no matter the cost, and make your escape from here. Am I wrong?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
022	...
023	And yet, I wonder if you can sit patiently and watch this region meet its destruction right in front of your eyes without lifting a finger to help?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0008
024	You... How dare you?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
025	Heheh. Don't make such a scary face. After all, you might not even have to do anything if this experiment succeeds.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
026	...
027	(Nimul... What should I do?)
028	Damn! This way's a dead end, too!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
029	The architecture in here is shifting more than I thought possible.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0013
030	If we just keep stumbling on blindly, we'll only lose more and more time to this transforming maze.
031	Is there no way around it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
032	If Icona's words can be trusted, then the architectural shifts are simply the result of the tower changing in preparation to execute a different function.
033	In that case, no matter how much change the architecture undergoes, the control center at the heart of it must remain stable.
034	Even if that's the case, we'd have to find a path that leads there.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0039
035	There's a limit to how much the structure of this tower can change, no matter how much Icona has tampered with it. The skeleton of the structure shouldn't be any different.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
036	I just need a little time.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
037	Based on the route we've travelled so far and what I know of Icona's design habits, I might be able to reverse engineer the architectural patterns.
038	Are you serious? Can you really do that?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0014
039	I'll have to, won't I?! So pipe down and buy me some time!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
040	All we can do is trust in Adaleigh. Are you ready for a fight, Minario?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
041	Of course I am, but ugh. What a pain. Let's just get this over with.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
