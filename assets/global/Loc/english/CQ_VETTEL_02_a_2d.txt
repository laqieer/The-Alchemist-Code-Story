001	Phew. It appears the village is safe. You have your own selves to thank for that.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
002	Captain Vettel! Thank you! It's my dream to become strong like you someday!
003	Very well. Do your best. I look forward to the day where we fight side-by-side.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
004	Captain Vettel! When I grow up, marry me!
005	Ahahaha. We can discuss that once you grow up.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0023
006	Captain Vettel, these are presents from all of us! We worked hard to make it all together!
007	A paper medallion and this...this portrait is exceedingly flattering.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0044
008	All of you, thank you. I'll treasure it.
009	Oh, this is for you as well! It's the charm of our village!
010	...!
011	This is a charm of the holy insect that protects our town!
012	Th-th-thank you. Well then, I must return to training.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
013	Whew. Oh dear.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
014	Is something wrong with you after all?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
015	Dilga?!
016	Apologies. I've been observing your condition for a while now.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0010
017	You seem to be sweating profusely. Are you certain it's not a wound or sickness?
018	No, it's not that.
019	Hmm... I'm going to take a wild guess.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0045
020	...!
021	Do you dislike children?
022	N-n-no! That isn't the case! I love children!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
023	Everyone has such high hopes for me that I must do my best to not disappoint them.
024	I see. As long as that's the case.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0031
025	More importantly, your men are becoming disorganized. The next war is going to start soon. You need to prepare.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
026	Right! I'll have them fight with all their body, mind, and soul!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0004
027	Phew... Quite dangerous.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
