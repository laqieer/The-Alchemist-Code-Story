001	Sorry for the rough greeting, Kudanstein. It is good to see you here.
002	It can't be...!
003	The Emperor of Greed Dike...
004	I welcome you to this defiled land.
005	Orion!
006	Or...I suppose I should call it...my land?
007	What are you doing here?!
008	How nice to see you here, Princess.
009	Argh!
010	Still...how unfortunate.
011	What...?
012	There is no throne for you here.
013	Ngh!
014	I hope you have enjoyed your little visit?
015	Orion!
016	Kudan! Tch!
017	Huzzzaaaah!
018	Damn!
019	Why did you lose?
020	Wh-what...?
021	Do the Paladins of the Holy Guard not represent justice?
022	Then tell me, why did Wadatsumi fall? Why do the people of Wadatsumi continue to be vulnerable and exploited?
023	Why do you still cling to a hopeless ideal? Why? Why?!
024	Nrgh...!
025	It is because you all are weak.
026	Shut up!
027	I will ask you again. Will you not wield your spear for me?
028	Like I told you before, I will never serve you!
029	And that is your justice?
096	Absolutely.
030	Is that justice truly indisputable? You mean to tell me that you still trust in the righteousness of a justice that cannot actually defeat evil?
097	Shut. Up.
031	I do this for the sake of the peace of this world.
098	You're the cause of this suffering! You have no right to make such a claim!
032	I am eradicating the powerless filth that know only how to proclaim their so-called rights. I am respecting the warriors' will by commanding their strength with total authority.
099	I will unite this continent with absolute power, crushing the seeds of rebellion and quenching the fires of war.
100	There will soon be no war. Peace will come to this land of willpower and strength.
033	That's nothing but sophistry!
034	It is natural law. The strong devour the weak. Everything in this world⁠—be it plant, insect, or beast⁠—knows this to be true.
035	Why do humans alone disobey this law? It is because the weak swindle the righteous with claims of justice.
101	Because fleeting emotions like love and trust are considered to be unquestionable truths.
102	From our perspective, it is the weak who swindle the righteous, monopolize the power of Alchemy, and still somehow fail to maintain peace who should be considered the evil of this world.
036	Just shut up!
037	Break away from the unscrupulous masses who feign righteousness. All of your remorse stems from a lack of strength.
038	With strength, you can move forward. You can bring an end to irrational violence. Yes, you can bring an end to it. I will help you.
039	With our combined strength, we can end destruction and conflict for good. We can bring order to this continent! Kudan, look within yourself. You know this to be true.
040	I said, shut up!
041	Any justice backed by empty words is powerless. You understand that. Power is everything! Strength is justice!
042	Orion!
043	Kuza...
044	...
045	What are you doing? Why...why are you standing there?!
046	Will you not accept his offer, Kudan?
047	This is no time for jokes, Kuza!
048	This is no joke. I brought you here to give you a chance.
049	No, this can't be true. We swore an oath! This is impossible!
050	Come with us, Kudan. This is how it's meant to be. You can't protect the world with your justice. It's just not enough.
051	Kuza...!
052	What are you thinking?! Tell me this isn't true!
053	You know you can't defeat me.
054	Kuza! Huzzaaaaahh!
055	Kudan!
056	Don't try and stop me, Kagura! I trusted him! I thought of him as my brother!
057	Nnrgh!
058	Captain Kudan!
059	Don't you see? This is the extent of your justice.
060	Serve me. Then you shall gain true power.
061	You will come to understand that absolute justice is on our side.
062	D-damn it all!
063	You refuse to listen? Then I'm afraid...
064	Nngh!
065	Kagura!
066	I will show you. You will come to see the truth. Just as he did.
067	Kudan!
068	Don't you move!
069	I won't let you go! Basheeny!
070	Right!
071	You! You summoned the Phantom?!
072	...
073	Why...? You swore to defend Wadatsumi! What are you playing at?!
074	Kudan...
075	I won't let you take Kagura. She is the only sliver of hope I was able to protect! She is the spirit of Wadatsumi!
076	You leave me no choice but to make you understand.
077	Ngh!
078	Absolute Zero!
079	You know, I never expected to see this many Holy Guard captains gathered in one place. You do know how to make a man feel special.
080	We won't let you get away with this.
081	You will unhand Kagura.
082	Ngh! Urgh!
083	What incredible power!
084	Hahahahahahahaha! You want her back?!
085	Let her go!
086	Very well.
087	I will be generous. You can have her back...if you don't mind her without a head.
088	Wait! No!
089	K-Kudan...!
090	I will put her head on show for the people. With their hope dead, this country is finished.
091	However, I'm willing to make you a deal. If you come with me, I will release her. You may sell your soul to save that of an entire nation. Am I not a generous king?
092	You...!
093	This is becoming quite an interesting opening act for my continental campaign. It would be a shame to end it here. Let us reconvene another day.
094	Kudanstein. I will allow you some time to think upon the meaning of justice. The next time we meet, I expect you to have the answer I want to hear.
095	Kuza, wait! Don't turn your back on me! Kuza! Kuza!
