001	How interesting.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
002	I had always regretted that I would never have the chance to stand on the same battlefield as the Deadly Trio and the secret weapon of Wratharis!
003	I never would have dreamed that I would have the chance to meet them here.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007

005	You, there. You must be the Protector of the Sephira.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0031
006	How do you know of me?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
007	Agatha's will reached us through Satna, along with information about all of you, our new allies.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0005

012	Understood. We shall raise our swords in your defense and burn away all that stands between you and your goal.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0038
