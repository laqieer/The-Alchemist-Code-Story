001	Eep! What the heck is happening?!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0025
002	The moment I start climbing the tower, just as I was told to, this happens! What's the big idea?!
003	All I said was that we should make a start on meeting Nimul and the others.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
004	Ugh... First those machine soldiers, and now falling debris... How are we supposed to get anywhere?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
005	Stop wasting your breath on complaints and help me already, Mira!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
006	If you don't, it might actually come crumbling down! Besides...
007	Grraaaooogghhh!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0001
008	That magil-soaked roar tells me Belphegor must be getting close.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
009	Urgh... Of course this must occur when we've been split up and we don't have our best weapons...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
010	Is everyone all right?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
011	Adaleigh?! What happened to you guys?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
012	There's a lot to catch up on, but we don't have time for that right now!
013	We need to come up with a plan while Belphegor is still restrained!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
014	What do you mean, Belphegor's restrained?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
015	Ah... That explains it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
016	What, Nyx? Don't just keep it to yourself!
017	See that, Mira? There, where the wall of the tower is crumbling...
018	Huh...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
019	Grrrooooaahh!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0001
020	Whoa! Does that mean...it's locked on to this tower?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
021	The Cursed Beast is trying to free itself from the restraints Icona made to capture it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
022	If it slips back underground, it'll take forever to catch up with it again!
023	In the worst case, this whole region could sink under the power of the ensuing earthquake!
024	My... You have...an awfully good grasp of...the situation...	VO_icona.icona_battle_0019
025	You! You're...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
026	Do you never tire?
027	Never! At least... That's what I'd like to say, but...the fact of the matter is...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0011
028	Blegh... Ugh. Sadly...it seems I've taken...a fatal wound, myself...
029	...Why hang around here when you're bleeding like that?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
030	I...already told you... Preparing a contingency plan...is part...of a researcher's duty...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
031	This is...
032	It's a...high quality stone of the gods compacted...into...a very handy...jackhammer knuckle.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
033	I call it...Antares. Heh heh... Neat, no?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
034	It's packed with Sloth magil... It should be able...to penetrate Belphegor's...outer shell.
035	Why didn't you make it into a ranged weapon at the very least?! Who the hell is gonna get close enough to use this thing?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
036	Listen closely, Adaleigh... The Cursed Beast, Belphegor, is...very powerful...but it has no intelligence.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
037	It just...follows its instincts...and repeats simple attacks...over and over... You're smart enough...to figure out its patterns.
038	Well, so are you! You're way more brilliant than I am!
039	How lazy you are, Adaleigh... Look at me. Surely you can see...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0039
040	I'm done for. It's...well past...time for you to stand on your own... You're a capable adult.
041	Icona...!
042	Congratulations... You've won...our very first...sibling squabble, Adaleigh. You're...all...grown up...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
043	Ah, well... This is the end...for my research, too... I had fun, though. It's too bad, but...let me just say one...last thing...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0020
044	I couldn't...save anyone...my way. So this time...try it your way...Adaleigh.
045	I believe in you, Adaleigh... I'm proud to call you...my brother.
046	Oh, Icona...
047	Adaleigh... Now's not the time...
048	I know. It's all right. I can do this.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
049	Everyone, I need your help... Lend me your strength so we can save this region!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
050	Well, if we must... What would you do without us, Adaleigh? Don't you feel lucky you've got us?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0037
051	You did everything in your power to save the region we live in... So of course we'll lend you a hand.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
052	This blade of mine might have been hastily put together, but I will push it to its limits.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
053	We of the Sephira would never forsake those in need of rescue. My sword is at your service.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
054	I, too, will do everything in my power to help!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
055	Thank you so much, everyone!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0033
056	It would seem that all of us are in agreement.
057	Nimul! You made it!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
058	I did. And what's more, I've succeeded in completing a new technique... No, a new school of Spiritbonding entirely. I call it alchemy.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	I believe that we now have what it takes to face Belphegor.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
060	Right, then. Let's do it!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1030
061	Well, if we want to recover Libra, this has to come first. I knew it would come to this, I guess, but I'm still kind of freaking out!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
062	Mira, quit babbling and help me make these adjustments! We've hardly got any time to sync Libra up with all of this idle magil!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
063	Yeah, yeah, I know... So what do you want me to use to focus this magil, exactly?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
064	It would have to be this: Antares.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
065	You mean Icona's...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
066	Yeah. The core of this thing is made up of the stones of the gods collected in this region.
067	If you're going to sync to the magil in this region, then this is our best bet.
068	To activate Libra's Anti-Curse function, someone will have to land an attack on the Cursed Beast with those knuckles, first...
069	You know that, right?
070	Of course. Icona said she believed I could do it, so I'll get it done. Piece of cake.
071	Then I'll make the adjustments.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
072	Do we even know if this airship will fly? Didn't it need a complete overhaul when we arrived in this region?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
073	As it happens, all of that got taken care of while it was confiscated.
074	While it was confiscated...?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
075	Apparently, the mayor ordered it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
076	The dockworkers said he'd left instructions that it be returned to us in the worst case scenario.
077	In the end, I still don't know if Icona and the mayor were our enemies...or...
078	We were all doing our best to save this region in our own ways.
079	We just had conflicting ideas about how to achieve that.
080	Having the same dream for the future doesn't mean we can join forces to achieve them. This has really opened my eyes to that fact.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
081	Nimul...
082	Here we go. Engine's running! Full speed ahead! Hold on tight, people! We're about to ram that Cursed Beast!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
083	Is the vein getting agitated...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
084	Judging by the method used to restrain Belphegor, Icona must have introduced something into the vein.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
085	What better way to restrain something with such a massive amount of magil than to pump an equal amount of magil into it? That's the most likely answer.
086	However, that now seems to be increasing Belphegor's domain.
087	Now that the clocktower's functionality has been suspended, all that magil is vulnerable to Belphegor's control.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
088	If we can reboot the tower, maybe we can hamper Belphegor's movement somewhat...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
089	We just don't have enough hands to go around for that right now. We'll have to focus on what we can manage.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
090	Mira! Nyx! Is Libra up and running yet?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
091	It's happening. We've got this! Analysis of sloth-based magil complete... Distribution of magil through the domain is almost done!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
092	I think we can neutralize most of the magil within the domain, but...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
093	We won't be able to take it down completely unless Adaleigh hits Belphegor in the core with those knuckles.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
094	In that case, it falls to us to make way for him.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
095	I have gathered up every last sword onboard the airship, so leave it to us to clear the way forward.
096	This is it, then! Let's take on the Cursed Beast Belphegor!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
