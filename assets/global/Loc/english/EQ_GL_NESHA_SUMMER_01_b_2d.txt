001	Ngh!
002	...Fine. You win this one.
003	Oh, my! Giving up already? This isn't like you, Godslayer.
004	Whatever happened to your beastly bravado?
005	You talk too much for someone who spends all her time taking orders from others.
006	We're just getting started. This is barely a warm-up!
007	This isn't exciting enough. Let's raise the stakes.
008	You! Yeah, you lot, cowering behind those trees!
009	I'm going to take you all out right next to your mistress. Get on the field!
010	I beg your pardon?!
011	Hmph! You have no power here!
012	Mistress!
013	Hmm. Not a bad proposal.
014	Set the stage, my lovelies! This field of crimson has scarce begun to bloom!
015	When all is said and done, I shall revel in her defeat and savor the heady sweetness of victory!
016	What?!
017	Pile them high, I say! Surround the beast and lash her down! Ahahaha!
018	Spare me your theatrics...
