001	...
002	Not much farther until Wratharis...
003	...
004	It's been a while since I've visited Mother's grave.
005	...
006	Lady Mirianne? Is something the matter?
007	I sense a stone calling to me. If you don't mind, would you wait here for a moment, please?
008	Mother... They finally accept me and my powers.
009	Not only my magic, but my Kinetic Force too.
010	At last, I can come home with my head held high.
011	Training was tough, but I toughed it out because I wanted to be stronger. And it definitely helped having a great master...
012	They were some of the most fulfilling days of my life. I mean, compared to the days of being treated like some underling and being told I would never amount to anything...
013	(Even if my powers are to be used for the sake of Wratharis's national interests. All as he planned.)
014	...
015	Mother... I have to go to Father now. That was the deal that was made so that I would be allowed to go into that apprenticeship.
016	But... Should I really go to him? To that man who abandoned us?
017	Mother...
018	How beautiful.
019	Hm?
020	That pendant in your hand.
021	Ah, this? Thanks.
022	A high quality stone. That must have been the one calling out to me.
023	Calling out?
024	I presume that stone is an onyx. It represents both encounters and farewells. Many people carry them as a good luck charm.
025	Huh...
026	Please pardon me for being so forward. As a gemstone merchant, I consider it my duty to listen to the voices of these stones.
027	Huh, I never thought of stones having meanings, let alone voices of their own. This one just happens to be a keepsake of my mother.
028	As far back as I can remember, Mother and I only had each other.
029	She always had a smile on her face. They're contagious, you know? We were poor, but she always managed to make me smile.
030	A smile is the greatest gem in this world, she said as she sold off most of her jewelry and worked her fingers down to the bone.
031	That's why I've never seen her wearing any jewelry.
032	And yet, she chose to give you a piece of jewelry to keep.
033	Mother...
034	Hey! Gem lady!
035	!
036	You really shouldn't wander away from your carriage alone. You might end up getting robbed. Now hand over your valuables!
037	Who are all of you supposed to be?
038	Were they following me this whole time? I had thought I'd given them the slip, but these highwaymen seem to be more tenacious than I had originally thought.
039	Highwaymen, eh? Hey, didn't you say the onyx represents encounters and farewells?
040	I personally prefer to avoid encounters like this.
041	Who the heck are you?!
042	I must agree. I suggest we say farewell as soon as possible.
