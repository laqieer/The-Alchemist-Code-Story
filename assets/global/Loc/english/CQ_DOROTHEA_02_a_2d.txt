001	I managed to shake her off, but...how do I get out of this place?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0002
002	These ruins were constructed as a labyrinth of sorts to prevent intruders.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
003	If we continue to fight, there is a high probability that we will lose our lives. I propose a truce for now.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
004	Fine, whatever... You know, you talk an awful lot.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0037
005	Only when it is required of me. I take little enjoyment in your style of futile fighting.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
006	...
007	(She's annoying, but I'm pretty sure she's the first girl to have blocked my attack...)	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0029
008	...Hey, Najum is your codename, isn't it? What's your real name?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0002
009	My name? What good would it do to you?	VO_aswad.aswad_chara_1001
010	The next time I buy a doll, I'm thinking about naming it after you.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
011	What a weirdo. My name is Aswald. Happy now?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0018
012	Wow, I didn't think you'd tell me. Was it because you were tired of dealing with me...and you thought it'd be the more efficient route?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0006
013	In any case, I plan to dispose of you once we reach the surface. Now hurry up. If we fall behind, we'll be surrounded by monsters.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
014	How many times do I have to tell you to stop ordering me around?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0014
015	This isn't an order. I'm giving you instructions.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
016	What's the difference...?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0039
017	What's that?! It's huge!!!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0026
018	...Be quiet! Let's hide!	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_0019
019	It looks like those two managed to handle the monsters around here.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
020	So, they've snuck in from a safe place after all. They're trying to excavate a Demon and sell it off as a weapon...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0042
021	A-a Demon?! That big fella? As in to use in war? They're weapon merchants?!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0027
022	Not everyone is as naive and simple-minded as you are.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
023	If that Demon enters the market it'll be responsible for even more unfortunate orphans.
024	Hey, wait. What's going on? What is your mission?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0025
025	Boss! There's someone behind the shadow of that pillar!
026	The style and color of that hair... Is that you, Dorothea?! Are you...attempting to hide?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
027	Your head is protruding from behind the pillar! Hahahah!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0008
028	...Why did you come to battle with such an excessive hairstyle?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
029	No one asked for your advice! We just need to defeat them, right?!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0029
030	Your simple-minded way of thinking mirrors your simple-minded way of fighting. Try and think a little more before acting.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0021
031	What? Umm...do you mean I should play hard to get with him?	VO_dorothea.dorothea_chara_1004
032	When did this conversation become about your love life?!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
033	For me, all is the same in love and war! ...But, you're right, playing hard to get is important.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0007
034	...Sigh. Don't get in my way.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0030
035	Right back at you!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0016
