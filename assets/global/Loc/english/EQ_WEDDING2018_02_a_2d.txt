001	Something feels...different from before.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
002	What do you mean?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0004
003	It always felt like there was a wall between the men and women of Lustburg.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
004	Now though...I don't really know how to put it, but it seems like they're both working to be equal in the relationship.
005	Hehehe. It makes me kind of happy.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
006	This won't do.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
007	Huh?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
008	No! There's still not enough love! Hey, you!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
009	Hmm? Me?	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0025
010	You've been hiding and watching that boy, haven't you? That must mean you're in love!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0002
011	Huh? What are you talking about?	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0025
012	If you just sit there looking, you'll never have a chance with him! If you never make a move, then you'll never get married!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0014
013	Go talk to him! Now! Get over there!
014	Uhh... E-Excuse me!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0026
015	You've been watching me, haven't you?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
016	I want you to know that...I've been watching you this whole time too.
017	R-Really?	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0025
018	I think you and I would go well together. Would you please go out with me?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
019	Oh my gosh! Of course I will!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0005
020	You have to be kidding me...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0027
021	I was the perfect Cupid, huh? If we keep at it like this, it's just a matter of time until the weddings get started!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0023
022	All right, let's keep this going!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0032
023	You never stop to rest, do you?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0018
024	She's just forcing everyone who makes eye contact into relationships...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
025	This time she's demanding those two over there date, simply because they tried to grab the same book at the same time...	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
026	Oh, look. She's leading a boy around the back of the School of Magic! Oh... She's forcing a girl to confess her love back there!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_1011
027	She's being a total nuisance.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0030
028	So this is why they call her Mad Cupid.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0011
029	Why do you think she's so crazy about weddings?	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0001
030	Hmm...now that you mention it, there must be some kind of reason.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
031	Well, you see...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
032	I'm back! I paired up sooo many couples!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
033	Yeah, we saw. It was pretty...amazing. In more than one way.	VO_lucretia.lucretia_sys_0004
034	Now then! Now that I understand how things are going in Lustburg, and I got to play Cupid a bit, the next thing we need for our bridal rehearsal is...	VO_mor.mor_sys_0010
035	Hey, you!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0001
036	Ah, you're the girl from the Academy of Magic!	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
037	Since you forced me to confess, the mood was completely ruined and he turned me down! How are you going to fix this?!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0012
038	Umm...	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
039	I'll never forgive you!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0013
