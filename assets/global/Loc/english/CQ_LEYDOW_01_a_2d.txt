001	You fiends... I will never forgive you!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0012
002	...
003	This endless fury... It fills me with strength!
004	I'm going to make sure that you never even think of kidnapping my sister, ever again!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0010
005	Reida, please... Please open your eyes...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0018
006	I'm sorry I brought those brutes into our lives. I'm truly a worthless older brother...
007	Oh, Reida...
008	...
009	Reido...?
010	...
011	Ack! Urgh!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0043
012	(I don't have much longer left to live...)
013	Reido?! Are you all right?! That sounded really painful!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
014	Don't worry about it, Reida. It's just a cough.
015	I can't just let it go! What would I do without you?
016	Here, have some tea. It’s supposed to be very good for you, so I ordered it in specially.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0002
017	I see. Thank you.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0004
018	How is it, Reido?
019	It’s very nice. I feel a bit better now.
020	(Reido fades away a little more every day, hour by hour. It's...surprisingly beautiful.)
021	What is it?	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0006
022	I was just distracted by how pale you are. Your skin is almost translucent. It's rather...pretty.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0005
023	Oh.
024	I'm sorry! I know it's terrible of me to think such things when you're suffering so much!
025	No, it's fine.
026	I'm the one who should be sorry. I'm just a burden to you all the time. It is...frustrating.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0016
027	What are you saying?! Reido, you are everything to me! You're no burden at all!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0021
028	I will always be at your side, no matter what happens. The only thing you have to worry about is getting better.
029	Thank you, Reida. I'm sorry I cannot do more for you as your brother.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0007
030	I don't need anything! Stop talking like that!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0025
031	I might have been born to a family of samurai, but my body is frail and I cannot fight...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0016
032	All I do is cause trouble for you, my beloved sister.
033	Reido, what did I just say? I don't see you as a trouble or a burden!	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0029
034	Just listen to me, all right? I'm with you.
035	Thank you... Urgh! Hrmgh!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0043
036	Reido?! Are you alright? You should retire for the day and rest.	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0042
037	Ack... That's a...good idea. I'll do just that.
038	Reido...
039	What is it?	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0006
040	It's...nothing. Rest well.
041	Forgive me for not being able to do more for you, Reida...
042	Reida's already asleep...
043	Heheh... Now that it's nighttime, some of my strength has returned. Heheheh.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0007
044	Now, it is time. With these hands, I will destroy the evil that has infested this world. Those despicable cretins who dared lay their hands on my sister will meet their demise at my fingertips...	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0010
045	Heh...heheheh... It is times like these when I can seek revenge on the world for treating Reida so indelicately that I know that my existence has value.
046	Yes... The night is my domain. This is when the chains that usually bind me fall away and I am free. Time to hunt!	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0023
047	Who's there?!
048	Heh...heheh... You... You are the ones who have been causing a ruckus in this area, yes?
049	Hooligans... I will not forgive you for casting your dirty eyes on Reida! Die!	VO_reidow.reidow_battle_0012
050	Wh-what the...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
