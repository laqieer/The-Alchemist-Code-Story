001	Huff... Huff... Not bad, is he, Nyx?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
002	Yeah, I'm surprised he can keep up with our Space-Time Manipulation.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
003	...
004	Do you believe the enemy is going to be using this "Space-Time Manipulation" again?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
005	They went through the trouble of making fake versions of us. I'm sure they'll be back again.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
006	Besides, there's something I want to confirm.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
007	The skills you're using... They're different from the Spiritbonding techniques that Waginau and Emmel use, right?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0002
008	Yes. I don't even have a name for this yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
009	It's an art I'm developing so that all people can match the power of the Sephira.
010	So you mean we might be able to learn it as well?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
011	That's the idea, but I still have more to do before that can become a reality. Are you interested?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
012	Those dark versions of us mentioned that they've never seen anything like it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
013	My guess is that means Asmodeus doesn't know anything about it either, since he's the one who created them.
014	If so, it could be the advantage we need to turn the tables on them.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
015	I see...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0045
016	There's something I wanted to ask you two as well, if you don't mind.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
017	It's only fair that you do. What's up, Wagi-baby?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
018	Excuse me? I will thank you not to call me such a ridiculous thing again. Tell me about the incantations you do when casting.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
019	Libra has granted us control, was it?
020	Is that the same Libra that Miss Ambrosia used to wound the Cursed Beast?
021	Well, that's... Are we allowed to say?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
022	Are you even able to explain it, Mira?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
023	Ouch...
024	I'm sorry, you'll have to ask Ambrosia about that.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0036
025	Now children, don't let me down like that.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
026	Ambrosia?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
027	You shouldn't be up yet! How are you even awake?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
028	How can I sleep with you two blasting your magil like that in front of the mansion?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0002
029	Are you well?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
030	Ha. Not really, but now is no time to be napping.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
031	We have an actual chance at defeating the Cursed Beast Asmodeus. You can't keep me out of  your plans.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
