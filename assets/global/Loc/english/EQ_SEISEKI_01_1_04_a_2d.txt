001	Huff...huff... Sorry, Chloe. You saved me again.	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
002	Don't worry about it. Anyway, I'm sure the monsters here are consuming Philosopher's Stones.
003	That's why they're much larger than the monsters we've encounter until now.
004	Does that mean there are Philosopher's Stones up ahead?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
005	I'm sure of it! Let's hurry!
006	Ch-Chloe?
007	Hm? What's the matter?
008	Next time, I'm going to be the one to save you!
009	Huh?
010	I feel bad that you're always the one rescuing me. Next time, it's my turn!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
011	I'll become stronger! So...!
012	Heheh. Okay, Kanon. That's a promise.
013	O-okay!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
014	Look! There's a large cave! I'm sure that's a mine for Philosopher's Stones!
015	We've arrived! This means we'll finally become Paladins! Yay!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0009
016	Wait. It's a little too early to celebrate.
017	Huh? Why?
018	Judging from the terrain, I'm certain this is a mine.
019	Then...
020	But there's not a single Philosopher's Stone!
021	What? Did the other Squires take them all?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
022	No, I don't think there were that many of them ahead of us.
023	Th-then, why?!
024	What's that?
025	Ohh! It can't be!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
026	What the...?! Are those the Squires who arrived before us?!
027	Th-they've...all been taken out! Is there an even stronger monster here?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
028	Monster? Now that's not very polite.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
029	!!!
030	Wh-who's there?!
031	Young Paladins, this will be your grave.
032	Oh! It can't be!
033	Heh... Do you know who I am, young Paladin?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
034	Chloe...who is he?
035	He's a knight of Wratharis...Zahar! In Wratharis, they call him a hero!
036	In Envylia, there isn't a knight who hasn't heard his name!
037	I-is he that strong?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
038	Kanon, he used to be a knight of the Holy Guard!
039	Huh?! A Paladin?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0025
040	Are you from Envylia?
041	Zahar...what are you doing here?! Why did you harm our fellow Squires?!
042	Envylia, huh?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
043	He's coming! Kanon! Be careful!
044	Huh?!
