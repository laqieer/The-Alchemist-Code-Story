001	Ronnie... She must be mad.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
002	Ronnie is our friend, aye! I'm sure she'll understand.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
003	Yeah. Once everything calms down, I promise we'll come pick her up.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
004	Right now, let's concentrate on reaching Big Bridge Station.
005	We won't make it at this rate, aye! 14 o'clock is impossible!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0012
006	Are there no shortcuts or routes that can buy us time?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
007	I've checked all the routes on the map!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0011
008	No matter how fast we go, we'll reach there after 15 o'clock, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0014
009	Tsk...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
010	Ethan!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0018
011	Don't worry. Ethan is the key to finding the Sacred Stone. They won't kill him that easily.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
012	Yes...
013	By the way...can you tell me a little bit more about Ethan?
014	Huh...?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
015	Our paths only crossed when I took you with me. I want to know a little more about the guy.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
016	Squeak...! Guard Droids fast approaching, aye! Be careful!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_demo_0001
