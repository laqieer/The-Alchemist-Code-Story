001	Lord Alvarez, may I speak to you for a moment?
002	What is it?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
003	We've just received a report.
004	Edgar L. Leonhart has taken Miss Fiona and boarded the convoy.
005	I see...and the mercenary?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0016
006	My apologies. We cannot seem to contact him.	VO_aj3000.aj3000_sys_0029
007	Never mind. Let him do as he pleases.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
008	In the case of unforeseen circumstances, that man is our last resort.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0031
009	Do you think it's odd for the creator of Alkaroids to rely on a human?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
010	Don't overthink it. Humans can sometimes act unpredictably.
011	Thus, I thought it would be suitable to have a human handle it if such a situation were to occur.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
012	My apologies. I will report to you as soon as Miss Fiona is apprehended.	VO_aj3000.aj3000_sys_0029
013	Hopefully, Miss Fiona possess the Sacred Stone that Ethan stole.
014	No matter. Once we apprehend Fiona, Ethan will spill everything.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0010
015	It's no big matter whether that girl has or does not have the Sacred Stone.
016	Yes, sir! Well then... I will go to prepare for the final synchronization test.	VO_aj3000.aj3000_sys_0006
017	Of course. As soon as we reacquire Belphegor, we'll perform the test. Inform this to each location.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
018	Yes, sir!
019	Father...soon...the day will come...when the evil that infests this world will be wiped out!	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0031
