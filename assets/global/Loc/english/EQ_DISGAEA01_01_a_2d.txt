001	...Lia...salia...Usalia...!	VO_killia.killia_sys_0001
002	...What?! I'm not asleep! I was looking into the Carbon Dioxide Reduction Proposal, plip! ...Wait, what's going on?	VO_usalia.usalia_chara_1009
003	What's gotten into everyone, plip?	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0003
004	*Sigh* Are you serious?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0030
005	Li'l Usa...don't you remember? We ran out of curry and you started going super berserk.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0001
006	Exactly! Thanks to your rampage, my pocket Netherworld is in shambles!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
007	Then, you used the Dimension Gate to run off somewhere, so we chased after you, dood. We've just finished feeding you curry, dood.	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0030
008	Ohh... I-I'm really sorry for inconveniencing all of you, plip.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0022
009	No...actually, if anyone is to blame, it's me. I misjudged how long it would take to stew the centaur tendons in the curry.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
010	Who would've thought centaur tendons were so tough! Oh...the humanity!	VO_killia.killia_sys_0035
011	Anyway. Usalia looks like she's fine, so let's hurry on back.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0030
012	...Oh? What's this? Umph! Hey! Open, right this second! I command you to open now! Gahhh!!!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0025
013	Hey, what are you doing? Super hurry up and open it, Sera.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0001
014	Shut up, you muscle-brained monkey! I don't need the likes of you to tell me what to do! Come on! Uff! Hyuuuuh!!!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0012
015	...It doesn't open?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0001
016	Urghhhhh! Seriously! Those Dimension Prinnies are gonna get a tongue-lashing.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0043
017	...By the way, what is this place? I've never seen a Netherworld like this one before, plip.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0001
018	Yeah, that reminds me! When we were wandering through the Dimension Gate, some jabroni named Uroboro...something was going on about Alche...something.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0031
019	What was all that about?	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0002
020	It's Ouroboros and Alchemy, plip. Why do you always skip the final syllable?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0022
021	Alchemy...like this?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0044
022	Yip, yip! Are you the ones who called me?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0003
023	My name's Rin! Nice to meet all of you!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
024	Whoa! What the...fox?!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0026
025	...So, this is Alchemy.	VO_killia.killia_sys_1045
026	Miss Rin, my name is Usalia, plip. What is the name of this Netherworld?	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0001
027	Netherworld? This is the Continent of Babel.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
028	...I remember Ouroboros saying something about how we're responsible for "entangling the Dimension Gate with the Door of Truth."	VO_killia.killia_sys_0020
029	En...tangling...? As in engaging in battle...? Oh! That explains why I'm dressed differently than usual! But this outfit also suits me pretty darn well!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
030	Entangling...? Is that some super kind of warfare?	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0004
031	Why does everything always have to be so violent with you, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0004
032	I guess that means...this isn't our world.	VO_killia.killia_sys_1045
033	...Come on! I've got no signal on my phone! And the Gate is giving me some serious attitude problems!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
034	Hold on...are you telling me we can't get home?!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0025
035	Yeah, pretty much.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0022
036	I can't believe this! I've got to get back to my mission!	VO_killia.killia_sys_0025
037	What?! Are you all going home?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0022
038	Yeah...we've gotta get back to our own world, plip.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0006
039	I feel so lonely...and I was so excited about making new friends...sob.	VO_rin.rin_chara_1008
040	Well, it doesn't look like we're leaving any time soon, so we can be together for now, plip.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0001
041	But...you're leaving eventually, right?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0018
042	Yeah, but... Oh, I have an idea!	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0031
043	While we're here, let's find Miss Rin some other new friends, plip.	VO_usalia.usalia_chara_1002
044	What...?! Really?!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
045	Really, plip. If you have friends, you won't be lonely, right?	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0006
046	Yeah! I wanna become friends with a lot of humans!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
047	Alrighty! Leave it to me, plip!	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0037
048	Usalia...are you sure it's okay to make that kind of promise, dood?	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0002
049	Yeah, Li'l Usa. Why are you helping out that fox?	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0006
050	Well...being alone...can be really painful, plip. I've experienced that pain before.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0022
051	Hm...mmm... We-well, Red Magnus is super okay with being alone!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0031
052	Either way, if we're gonna find a way to get back, we'll have to traverse this world.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0030
053	Traverse...? Why, Sir Killia? If we wait here, we'll eventually...	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0004
054	The curry I just gave to Usalia was the last of my ingredients.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0022
055	What...?! Then if we run out of curry again, Li'l Usa is gonna go berserk!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0026
056	Yeah. That's why we'll need to procure ingredients.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0006
057	That'll be a handful to deal with if she goes berserk now, dood!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0020
058	Sigh... Oh well, looks like we've got no other option. Prinny, carry me.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0030
059	Huh?! Madam Overlord, I can't carry you on my own, dood! You're too heavy...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0012
060	Yikes! I take it back, Madam Overlord. I'm sorry, dood...	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0027
061	All right...let's go, Miss Rin.	VO_usalia.usalia_sys_0007
062	Yup!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0006
063	Heheh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
064	If I can kidnap and sell that thing, I'll be able to make a lucrative profit...heheh...
065	Hey, how far are we gonna walk? I'm exhausted.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0029
066	We're almost there! I'm pretty sure the village is right over that hill!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0007
067	If we can find the curry ingredients and the fox's friends, we'll have super achieved our goal!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_battle_0018
068	Hold on. What're those?	VO_killia.killia_sys_0003
069	Those are...Phantom Soldiers?! Why are there so many of them? They've surrounded the village!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
070	Please, everyone! Help save the village! I'm begging you!
071	Hold on. You know we're demons, don't ya? Saving people from jabronies who aren't even the Lost sounds like a super hassle.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0004
072	For once, I agree with this muscle-brained monkey. As for the ingredients we need for the curry, we can find them in another village...	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0006
073	Don't say that...please!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0018
074	Miss Rin...I understand! I'll fight!	VO_usalia.usalia_battle_0004
075	Oh, miss! Thank you!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0034
076	Unbelievable! What kind of un-demonic melodrama are you spewing?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0050
077	Just so you know, the rest of us are continuing on ahead. Say something to her, Sir Killia.	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0010
078	...Um, Sir Killia, what are you doing?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0025
079	I'm eating an Orc Cutlets Rice Bowl. Sorry, but that was the last of it. There's none left for the rest of you.	VO_killia.killia_chara_1004
080	What's on the menu is the least of my concerns right now. Why are you eating?	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0012
081	...I'm refueling myself before battle.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0010
082	So, you're gonna fight?!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0039
083	Yeah. Even if we're not up against the Lost, if someone is suffering, I can't turn a blind eye to them.	VO_killia.killia_sys_0006
084	You're the best, Killia!
085	Sir...thank you so much!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0024
086	Tsk. Oh well...if Killia is up for it then Red Magnus is in as well.	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0010
087	Come to think about it, I've been wanting to lay the smackdown on some random jabronies!
088	This'll ensure that the Overlord of Scorching Flame is super remembered throughout the entire Continent of Ba...something. Bwah-hahahaha!	VO_redmagnus.redmagnus_sys_0008
089	You even forgot the name Babel, dood?!	VO_prinny.prinny_sys_0025
090	Are you serious? I absolutely refuse to do something that won't even gain me a single HL!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0016
091	...Um, Madam Overlord? Are you okay, dood? Everyone's already left, dood.	VO_prinny.prinny_chara_1003
092	Wha...ahhhh! You've gotta be kidding me! I will not be left unattended! Wait for me, Sir Killia!!!	VO_seraphina.seraphina_sys_0026
