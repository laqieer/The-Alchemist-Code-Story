001	N-no... It's impossible...to bring this much darkness into this world!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0028
002	Wh-what's happening?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
003	I-I miscalculated the extent of the situation... Now Kanon is the only one who can do anything about this with her powers of light!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0035
004	And...it's time to pull my last trick out of my sleeve. I was planning to use this as a last resort, and it seems that we've come to that.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0025
005	Wh-what is it?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0028
006	I must also draw upon the darkness that this body has absorbed without completely losing my mind in order to stop Zahar.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
007	B-but then you might end up trapped with Zahar again...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
008	It's better than setting him loose on this world! Making sure that the darkness doesn't win takes precedence over my own well-being!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
009	B-but...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
010	Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0026
011	A-ahhh!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
012	I have to do this now before it's too late! Miu, I leave the rest to you!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
013	W-wait, what?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
014	C-Captain Cadanova! It's almost...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
015	Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0023
016	Ack?! Uwaaaahhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
017	Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
018	Agh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
019	Huh...?
020	Ug...ugff...!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0021
021	I'm...sorry...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
022	Spica?!
023	I-I'm sorry... I...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
024	The darkness is abating?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
025	S-Spica...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
026	Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
027	Y-you...struck me...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
028	Forgive me... I... I always hoped for this...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
029	What...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
030	I...always regretted that...I did not stop you before you went too far.
031	That I could finally take advantage of the chance to stop you this time is a gift beyond all others.
032	Gah... Ngh... S-stopping...m-me...is...a gift...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
033	Yes.
034	I have struggled to come to terms with my own failure to recognize it last time...
035	It has been one of my greatest regrets...
036	...!
037	That I have the chance to take action this time... It allows me a chance to redeem myself.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
038	If there is no way for me to calm the anger you cannot suppress, then at least I can divert it away from the world with my own sword!
039	Don't be a fool! The darkness already has a strong hold on him. The Zahar you see before you is not the one you know!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0027
040	Stand back! This is between me and Lord Zahar. If you try to stop me, you'll have to answer to my blade!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0040
041	Huh...?!
042	Spica...
043	Hehe... You... You still have so much to learn...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
044	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
045	Stand up...for what you believe in... Even if...it means...the world...turns against you...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
046	That is...the justice I believe in. You... You should be able to...carry that on...
047	Me...?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
048	C-Cadanova! Haha... I'll see you when you rejoin me in hell!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
049	We'll settle...our differences with...each other...then. Haha... You had better...be prepared!
050	Hmph. That is my line. The next time we meet...will be our last.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
051	Ha...haha... I look forward to it, my old...rival...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
052	On that day...I will finally...tear your...gutless "justice"...apart.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
053	L-Lord...Zahar...? Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0019
054	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
055	He disappeared...?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
056	Our true bodies are still trapped on the other side of the Door of Truth. This body of mine...it is not real, not in the same way that yours are.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
057	What?! Like...a Phantom?
058	Ah... Something like that.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
059	Spica...
060	Lord Zahar said that I must stand up for what I believe in, even if the world turns against me.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
061	Huh?
062	I... I believe in the world that you want to create, Kanon. Making that happen...will be the justice I devote myself to.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
063	Spica!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
064	As long as I have breath in my body, I will stand with you. For myself...and to pay my respects to the man who once saved my life.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
065	I understand. Thank you, Spica!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
066	By the way, Captain Cadanova, what in the world is going on? How are you even in this world? I thought the two of you were still sealed in the other world.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
067	Has the seal been broken?
068	This world and the other world were connected for just a moment. Don't worry, that bridge has already been taken care of.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
069	Only three people managed to come through back to this world.
070	Three?! Meaning...there's another person out there like Zahar?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
071	Ah... That reminds me. This is of no small consequence to you as well. I had best tell you all I know.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
072	Huh?
073	That temporary bridge was created between the two worlds...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
074	...when a certain man arrived in the other world from this one.
075	A certain...man...?
076	And...the third person who returned from the world on the other side of the Door of Truth...is that man?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
077	Exactly. When that man arrived, his very presence distorted space in the other world. Perhaps it was because he had not completely fallen into the darkness.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
078	I see... So...you knew this man?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
079	Indeed, I know him. As do you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
080	Huh?!
081	That person should not have been there. He couldn't accept where he was and his strong emotions caused a disruption that forced the two worlds to be connected again.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
082	And so you...pushed him back here?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
083	Yes. I managed to return him to this world.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
084	However, Zahar took advantage of that disruption and slipped through just before it could be resolved.
085	I followed him, but I barely made it through. It was pretty close.
086	W-wait... A man I know that fell to that other world... It can't be...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
087	Yes. It was Kudan. He should be somewhere here in this world.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
088	Captain Kudan...?! Here?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
089	Yes. I believe that he should still be in his own body, unlike Zahar and I. Somewhere in this world, Kudan lives on.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
090	No!!!
091	Wh-whoa!!! What was that?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0027
092	What an incredibly large military force! And flying that huge flag... Greed Dike!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
093	There's smoke rising from the palace walls! I have to go!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
