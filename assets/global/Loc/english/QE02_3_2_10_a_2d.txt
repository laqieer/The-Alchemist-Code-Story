001	There are destroyed Guard Droid's here as well! No doubt about it. He's here!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0042
002	Yeah. Causing conflict in a holy church. Someone's gotta teach this guy some manners.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
003	This is called stained glass, isn't it? It's beautiful. I'm surprised it's still intact.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0001
004	Indeed. The men who raised the sun, huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
005	Under that, you have a colossal island floating in the sky.
006	Looks like the Elester family's lore is depicted here.
007	If I remember right, they took down the colossal island that carries destruction with it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
008	I can think of a few others I wished they destroyed while they were at it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
009	Are you turning to the gods now? Sorry, but that's one wish the gods won't hear.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0010
010	Edgar!!!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
011	Unfortunately, I'm not very religious.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
012	I only believe in one thing... This gun! Back off, Ronnie!
