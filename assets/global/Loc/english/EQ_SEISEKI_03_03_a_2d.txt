001	Thanks to Almira, we managed to avoid being splattered across the valley floor, but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
002	Now that the bridge has collapsed, we can't cross this valley.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
003	I guess we have no choice then. Although there may be plenty of monsters, we must advance forward with our heads held high.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0009
004	Why do you look so happy?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
005	D-don't be an idiot! Of course, I'm not happy! Not in the least!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
006	Right. This inefficiency will delay execution of our strategy.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
007	But it's not like there's another way.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
008	There is.
009	What?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
010	From what I recall, around these parts there should be...yes, I found it!
011	Oh, that's a Fucheti grass vine.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0026
012	Fucheti grass? What is that?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
013	It's a really lightweight but durable vine! We use it to make bags and build tents!
014	I'm going to tie this vine onto an arrow and aim for the fallen bridge that is hanging on the other side.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
015	I've calculated that pulling up the bridge and securing it again will the most efficient solution for our current circumstances.
016	That's impossible, even for you, teacher! The wind is too strong! You won't be able to hit your target!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0028
017	I think Almira is right. The valley wind is almost strong enough to push us over as we stand here.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
018	When why don't you leave me here and make preparations to take the long route?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
019	I'm sorry, but there's no time. I'm going to do this and go on ahead.
020	You're serious about this.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0021
021	The wind that blows from down in the valley is approximately 20...a left lower correction of 15.5...
022	I've known the wind of this valley ever since I was a child. Of course, I can read it!
023	Wow, amazing! Did you actually manage to hit the bridge?!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0024
024	Now all that's left is to pull it up...ack!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
025	Seida?!
026	I-it's heavier than I thought...!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0028
027	Oh, no! Let it go! At this rate, it'll pull you down too!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
028	I-I can't do something so inefficient!
029	Fyuuuuah!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
030	V-Vice-Captain...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0025
031	Stop trying to do things on your own!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
032	I'll protect my comrades at all cost; that's also part of Code of Chivalry. Are you ready? Let's pull it up!
033	I'll help too!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0009
034	Me too!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0047
035	All right! One, two, three!
036	Huff... huff...! Yes!
037	I can't believe you actually fixed that suspension bridge! That was amazing!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0046
038	We've no time to rest. Let's move forward.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
039	Seriously?! Monsters at a time like this!
040	We can't let the newly hung bridge to collapse. Let's take them out!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
