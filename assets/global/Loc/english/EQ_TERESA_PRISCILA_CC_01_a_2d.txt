001	To eradicate war, all seedlings of conflict must be snuffed out before they have a chance to bloom.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0029
002	This experimental use of human blood to create a mock Philosopher's Stone is abominable.
003	And yet, as incorrigible as those who conduct such experiments are, there is no shortage of parties to seek and fund this work.
004	It has always been these simple whims that spawn conflict, which inevitably blossoms into war. No one can escape the cycle.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0016
005	Now, now. When your heart is singed by flames beyond your control, just take a moment to stop...and smell the flowers. Nothing cools a scorched heart faster.
006	You're right, of course. I do tend to succumb to my anger, don't I? It's just that in my experience, determination—and determination alone—is the ultimate key to success, in all things.
007	Of course, my roots are planted firmly in the field of battle, so perhaps I'm not one to talk on such matters...	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
008	Huzzaaah!
009	Aaagh!
010	Hey! Get up! Pull yourself together!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
011	I'm...sorry. I can't... Ghh...!
012	Don't talk! Conserve your energy. Just leave the rest to me.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
013	Curse you, Wratharis! I'll take every one of you on, if I have to! Hyaaaah!
014	Gah! Our formations have broken! We can't hold the line! Company, retreat!
015	You think you can just run away?!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0013
016	That's enough, Priscilla!	VO_kalmia.kalmia_battle_0019
017	Huh?!
018	Rrg... You're right. I'm sorry, Kalmia.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0035
019	That's more like it. Feeling a bit calmer now?	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0001
020	I am.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0004
021	It's a very bad habit of yours to lose your composure in the heat of battle, you know.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0030
022	I'm...aware.
023	Then be aware of this, too. We're knights. It's our primary duty to ensure the safety of the people. But we can't do that if we start rampaging like wild boars.
024	Are you making fun of me? Of my contradictory nature?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0016
025	I would never! We all get a little "boarish" from time to time. And we all have our own contradictions, as well.
026	You find pleasure in combat, yet you utterly despise war. That is an internal struggle of some significance. Certainly not something to joke about.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0004
027	Still, I can't help but wonder...
028	Wonder what?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
029	Tell me honestly. Do you...hate Wratharis, Priscilla?
030	They were my father's bane. And they took him from me. Part of me can't help wanting to avenge that injustice.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0031
031	But my father and disciple alike stood their ground on the battlefield to protect the people, and I've inherited that duty from them. Fulfilling that duty must be my top priority.
032	It can't be easy to keep your personal emotions out of it, though.
033	It's only natural to want to fight tooth and nail for your disciple's sake.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0003
034	Besides which, you have such a forthright devotion to your principles, and to the art of the spear... I consider both to be virtues, and you to be a veritable avatar of them.
035	You...do?
036	However! Such virtues won't mean a thing if you die prematurely. All your accomplishments stand to falter if you do. So please, take better care of yourself, will you?	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0031
037	I will.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0005
038	Now, now! Don't pout. You always do that when you feel you've let someone down, don't you?
039	At least you don't cry like you used to.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0005
040	Wait, what's that sound?
041	Waaah! Daddy! Daddy!
042	You're okay, right? Come on, Daddy! Please wake up!
043	Ohhh, no...
044	Dozens of civilians were lost in the chaos of war again. And the orphanage really couldn't take in any more children.
045	Just when is this war going to end?!
046	It always stings deep to hear such lamentations from the people.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0030
047	The same desperate question was on the lips of every villager: When will the war end?
048	Sadly, there was no good answer to this question, as the prospect of peace was far from the horizon.
049	The situation was dire for Wratharis when Envylia declared independence, taking all her fertile land with her.
050	The remaining lands of Wratharis were mostly barren, forcing the nation to find a means of survival beyond its borders.
051	Having lost much in their war with Envylia, the powers that be in Wratharis believed the country could not flourish on domestic policy alone.
052	They saw war as the only means of survival left for their kingdom. Envylia was forced to repel invasion after invasion, year after year, and the common folk were the ones who paid the price.
053	(This cannot go on forever.)	VO_kalmia.kalmia_battle_0019
054	I believe in you, Kalmia. You must end this cycle of hate. You have it in you...to end this war.
055	And I will.
056	I remind myself of those words before every battle. I think back on the future that they were meant to portend.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0006
057	I mustn't let hatred consume me. I will smite the enemy with righteousness, not with wild fury.
058	I will seal away the dark, abhorrent emotions within me. The question is...how long must I repress them? How long can I?
059	This is a key point in Envylia's defense! We cannot let them break through! All of you, make ready!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
060	Rraaagh!
061	Good! Now, follow me! Huzzaaaahh!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0015
062	Glad to see Priscilla's back to her usual spirited self. Morale is always up when she's at her best.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
063	There really is something about her that rubs off on those nearby, isn't there?	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0005
064	The battle seems to be going our way, too. The enemy doesn't have an ace fighter quite on par with Priscilla, as best as we can determine. As long as that remains true, we'll have—	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
065	Aaaaarrghh!
066	What was that?!
067	Y-you!	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0025
068	Priscilla...!
069	It's the Ruinmaker! She's come for us!
070	Any takers? Let us bring an end to this war, once and for all.	VO_teresa.teresa_battle_0015
071	With the Ruinmaker on our side, we're sure to win!
072	(Bring an end to the war?)
073	I knew they'd send reinforcements, but I didn't expect it to be you, Ruinmaker. This won't be like before, however.	VO_priscilla.priscilla_battle_0019
074	You're...? Ah, right. I remember you.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0002
075	I'm more confident than I was last time around. And I've got Kalmia by my side.
076	Isn't that right, Kalmia?	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0001
077	Step aside, Priscilla.
078	I will face the Ruinmaker alone. You assist the effort elsewhere.	VO_kalmia.kalmia_sys_0002
079	What? Why?!
080	I've always wanted to fight the Ruinmaker. Please... Just do this for me, won't you?
081	Kalmia? O-okay...	VO_priscilla.priscilla_sys_0002
