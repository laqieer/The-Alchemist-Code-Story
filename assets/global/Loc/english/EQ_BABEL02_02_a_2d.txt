001	(From the moment I was born, I was alone. I grew up in this room without a single companion.)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
002	(I knew nothing of my parents. I knew nothing of myself.)
003	(Three times a day, the sound of a key turning in the lock announced the arrival of the servant girl who brought my meals.)
004	(The girl called me Zahar. I guessed it was my name.)
005	(She always looked at me with eyes filled with scorn.)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
006	(Perhaps it is hard to imagine, but that was the time when I felt most keenly that I was hated by those around me.)
007	(Even though I didn't know why. No one ever told me. No one ever even spoke to me.)
008	Look, look! The flowers are blooming! How pretty!
009	(Sometimes, I heard the voices of other children outside.)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
010	(It was forbidden to open the curtains, but I would open them just enough to peek outside.)
011	(That room was always dark. My life was inextricably linked to that darkness.)
012	(That was why I so desperately envied those who existed outside of it.)
013	(There were a great many books to read in that room. I read all of them to learn about the world.)
014	(One day...)
015	I am pleased to make your acquaintance.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
016	My name is Letitia. I shall be your caregiver from today.
017	...
018	(She looked right at me. She even spoke to me.)
019	Hello, Zahar. I am only a little older than you, I hear. I could be your sister. Heh.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
020	Sis...ter?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
021	Yes. I also heard that you have been on your own all this time. It must have been very lonely.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
022	From today, I shall be your sister. We shall be less lonely together.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
023	I have not been lonely. I have no need of a family. After all, I never had one before.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
024	I see. Even here, there is no place for me.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
025	Excuse me?
026	Ah, it is nothing for you to concern yourself with.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0036
027	This is just the same as everywhere else I have been.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
028	Why are you looking for a place?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
029	What? You... I see. I am a dark elf.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
030	Dark elf...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
031	Yes. I suppose nobody ever told you... You really were all alone all this time...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
032	Y-you... Would you tell me? Can you tell me who I am? Who my parents are?! And...what is a half-elf?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0021
033	It might not be what you want to hear. It may even be painful to hear.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
034	Yes. I want to know. I have to know! Tell me!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
035	Okay. I will. Let me start from the beginning...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0038
036	(Letitia is the one who taught me everything...)
037	(I was the unwanted spawn of a high-elf princess and a human.)
038	(My father was executed when my existence came to light. My mother died soon after I was born.)
039	(My family was, apparently, highly regarded among even the highest of high-elves. Knowledge of my existence would have been a stain on their reputation.)
040	Dark elves like me are also despised by the high-elves.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
041	But why?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
042	Once upon a time, one of my ancestors slayed their friend in cold blood.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0019
043	The ill-gotten dark power they received for slaying a high-elf caused their Alchemia to transform them into a fallen being.
044	We carry the blood of those traitors in ourselves. That is why the pure-blooded high-elves disdain us.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
045	Why did your ancestor kill their own friend?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
046	I do not know. It happened too long before either of us were born.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
047	Letitia... Why are you here?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0049
048	This family... They bought me.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0018
049	Bought you...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
050	I am a slave. The dark elves challenged the high-elves, and lost.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
051	I am, essentially...a prize of war.
052	That is why I am here. It is my fate to come here, to be with you.
053	Slave...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
054	(I had learned of slaves before, in books.)
055	(So I understood that the two of us were the same. We were both people with no home left to us.)
056	Letitia... Would you stay here?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0049
057	Oh. If...it is all right...but you...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
058	I want to learn more from you. So...please. Stay.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
059	Thank you, Zahar. I will stay with you as long as you want me to.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0033
060	(We were inseparable after that.)
061	(When she wasn't with me, I stayed in the room, alone again.)
062	(I learned so much from her about the world; things that were not in my books.)
063	(Things...I would have never known if I had not met her.)
064	Look, look! I found a seed!
065	Wow! It's so round and cute!
066	...
067	Zahar, it's time to eat. Oh... What are you looking at?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
068	There are children outside. If I strain my eyes, I think I can see a huge tower in the distance, as well...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
069	Zahar... Do you want to go outside?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
070	No. It's better in here, with you. I mean...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
071	You mean...?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
072	It is too bright outside. It's...uncomfortable.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0049
073	"Throw off the chains the glitterati have laid upon thou and rise to be the King of Darkness."	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
074	What...? What is that?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
075	An old saying of the dark elves. "For whom does the King of Darkness rise? For whom does the King of Darkness fight?"	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
076	The King of Darkness...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
077	The dark elves have always been the target of abuse from other elves, especially high-elves.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
078	For us, this is a prophecy of hope; one that promises that a hero will rise up to save us from our suffering.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
079	I would do it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
080	Huh?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0006
081	If someone ever tried to hurt you... I would rise up and become the King of Darkness to save you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
082	Zahar... Thank you. That's a promise, isn't it?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0033
083	Yes. I promise.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
084	Well, in that case... I had better teach you some alchemy so that you can keep your promise.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
085	Alchemy?
086	But it has to be our little secret, okay? It is forbidden for those outside the Holy Guard to use alchemy.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
087	However...if you truly wish to become the King of Darkness, you will need alchemy. I believe that you can do it.
088	I will do it. If it will help me protect you, I will do anything.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
089	Heheh. Thank you, Zahar. Then, here is a present to seal our promise.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
090	A necklace...? Made of wood?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
091	It's a special handmade necklace, just for you. Take good care of it, okay?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
092	Okay... Thank you.
093	(One day...)
094	(Letitia was late bringing my food. I was hungry...)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
095	What is...?
096	My liege... Please, no...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0022
097	(Letitia...?)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
098	You pathetic, disgusting dark elf! You've gotten dirt on my clothing!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
099	I-I didn't do it, sir... You crashed into me...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
100	Listen to you. Are you talking back to me, dark elf?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
101	N-no...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0022
102	Tsk... Well, you can pay me back...with your Alchemia.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
103	(What is happening? I can see a little through the keyhole...)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0049
104	Get on your knees, dark elf. I'll take it myself.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
105	Ngh...!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0019
106	(Letitia!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0021
107	...
108	I said to get on your knees. What are you, deaf?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
109	Tch, dark elves are all the same. Dumb as cattle.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
110	I understand.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
111	Good. Then get on your knees.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
112	(Letitia!!!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
113	Stop! Stop!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0024
114	Wh-What is...?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
115	Z-Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
116	Leave...her...alone!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
117	The half-elf? How dare you leave that room, you festering half-breed!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
118	I will tell my father! You, who killed my wife... You will die, just as your father did!
119	No!!!
120	Nngh?! Urg... H...elp...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
121	Zahar...
122	Grr... Graaahhhhhhh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
123	Zahar!
124	(I don't remember anything after that.)
125	(Some elf elder I'd never seen before showed up and ordered us to leave.)
126	(My prison and my paradise...I lost them both in one fell swoop.)
127	(Reborn, and cast out into the world, I finally got to see what lay behind those four walls.)
128	...
129	So? What do you think?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
130	It's...big.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
131	Haha! It gets bigger than this! The towns are bigger, the mountains, the oceans, the forests...and the tower.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
132	Tower...? The Tower of Babel? That we could see in the distance from the house?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
133	Yes! Do you want to go see it?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
134	Hm... I think I do.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
135	Okay! It's a little far, though. I don't know if we'll be able to make it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
136	Come on, let's go! The two of us can go anywhere we want!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
137	That's true. You're so strong, Zahar. It was amazing to see you in action.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
138	I didn't know I had that in me... I just completely lost it when I saw you being treated like that.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
139	Actually, I've been feeling off since I killed that elf...
140	It's probably because you've become a dark elf, like me.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0018
141	When an elf kills another, the Alchemia in the blood that is spilled transforms them into a dark elf.
142	I'm...a dark elf? Oh... Oh! That makes me...happy!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
143	Wh-what? Why? Dark elves are despised by all of elven society!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0027
144	What does that matter to me? But that I could become someone a little more like you... That's an honor.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
145	Zahar... You really have become my defender. Thank you.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0034
146	Of course I did! I promised you, didn't I? I will become the King of Darkness to protect you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0023
147	Yes, you did. You... Well. Yes. I believed you then, and I believe you now.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
148	My King of Darkness.
149	(Ever since then, we have travelled all over the world.)
150	(The world is truly as great and wide as she said. Filled with struggle and cruelty...but also kindness and beauty.)
151	(I had grown to hate it when all I could see was a tiny sliver of what I couldn't have, but I fell in love with the world that I could move through freely.)
152	(We battled goblins and the occasional human on our journeys. Our coming of age was filled with danger and adventure.)
153	(Hundreds, thousands of days later...)
154	Hey, did you hear? A forest in the west of Wratharis has completely withered.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
155	Oh yeah, I heard that. I even heard that it's become an actual desert!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
156	No way! Isn't that where the elves lived?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
157	What?! That stuck-up lot? I didn't know they lived outside the dominion of the Holy Order...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
158	Yeah. Well, they're probably dead now, if that forest has fallen to desertification.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
159	Still, it's crazy how all these forests and towns are just dying out like this, huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
160	The world's totally gone curdled... There're goblins and ferals everywhere, fights breaking out all over...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
161	...
162	What's on your mind, Zahar?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
163	Nothing. We should head out soon.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
164	Now that I think about it, we've been travelling all this time and we haven't made it to the Tower of Babel yet.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
165	Hmm, you're right. Well, it's not really easy to get to it with the Holy Guard patrolling the surroundings, and the prohibition on alchemy...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
166	But we still have time. We'll get to it one day.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
167	One day... You're right. I wonder... I wonder if the elves in that forest really are gone. Those high-elves who imprisoned us...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
168	Huh. Well... They were the kind who were quite stuck in their ways. I suspect they died along with that forest.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
169	What? Do you mourn their loss?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
170	Hmph. Of course not. I feel nothing. Really.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
171	I am the same.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
172	I'm more concerned with the future than the past.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
173	The future?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0006
174	Yes. We elves live for a long time... I'm starting to wonder how to fill that time.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
175	It's been on my mind for a while.
176	This world is a bright and beautiful place, but...war and suffering...never seem to end.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
177	In fact, it only ever seems to get worse...and worse...
178	On top of that, the forests are dying and turning to desert. I've been thinking that this world needs to change.
179	It seems to me like the only ones who are able to do something about it...are us elves.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
180	I've gotten much stronger compared to when I was young. I've seen and experienced much, as well. I feel like...this is something I must do.
181	Once I started thinking about it, I just couldn't stop.
182	I see... Well, wherever you decide to go, whatever you decide to do... I will follow you.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
183	Thank you, Letitia. Let us work together and do what we can to change this flawed world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
184	What...? What was that? Did you hear that?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
185	Someone is screaming. It's coming...from that village!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
186	Let's go!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
187	Hyaahhhh! Graaaaaaaah!
188	G-goblin! S-someone! Please, save us!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
189	Cleric, where's the Holy Guard?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
190	I-I'm not... I'm just—!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
191	Cleric?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
192	N-No... It's nothing! Everyone, run! Run!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0029
193	That village is under attack! Letitia, let's go save them!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
194	Yes, I'm right behind you!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
195	With this many goblins, we have no choice but to use alchemy...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
