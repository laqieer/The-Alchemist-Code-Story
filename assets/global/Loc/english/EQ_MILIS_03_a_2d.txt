001	So this is the deepest part of the ruins.
002	Captain, there's an altar here!

004	Aghh?!
005	What the—ughh!

007	I-it can't be! How—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020

019	So that's what killed them all?!
020	Eeek! It's so fast! And black!	VO_milis.milis_battle_0021
021	These ruins are too close to Lustburg! If this thing were to escape outside... We can't leave it like this!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
022	All right. You and me! Let's stop it here!
