001	Too fast...! So cold...! Ambrosia, can you put the same spell that you gave these guys on us too?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
002	Just hang in there, child. I've spent what magic I'm willing to spend on the insects carrying us.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
003	And on myself, of course.
004	That's just not right.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
005	Settle down, Adaleigh. You need to train your constitution more.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
006	Ack...! I'm just the brains of this operation! I'm not built like you!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
007	Cut it out, both of you. We're here.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
008	I think the exterior of the airship is frozen solid. It might be difficult to get in.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
009	We did leave it out here for a long time. I hope at least the emergency power is still functional.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
010	Let's check the reactor first! Attaching the magic rod will mean nothing if the airship's system is dead.
011	Wait, Adaleigh.
012	What?
013	Looks like we have company.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
014	Grrrrrrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
015	Aw man, it's totally overrun...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
016	We don't want them interrupt our work. Let's clear them out.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
