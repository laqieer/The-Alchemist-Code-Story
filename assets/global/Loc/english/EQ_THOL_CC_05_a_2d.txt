001	Do not look upon me so.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_chara_0013
002	You, who heed me.
003	Horns...a tail, and scales...	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
004	Would you look at that. Another dragon here.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0017
005	Dragon...?
006	Is this the end of Veda? Is this the Truth meant to be reached?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
007	Truth? What is this Truth you speak of?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
008	Is...this not your tower?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
009	It is where I...am. Where I sleep.
010	There is much I do not know. What is there above? What awaits out there? Why was I born?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
011	So you don't know...anything?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
012	Do not ask anymore. It has been long since another came to heed my voice, and so I am delighted.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0016
013	Still, do not ask anything of me. I do not have any satisfactory answers for you.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
014	So you want me to heed you...but not ask you anything I want to hear?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
015	Ask no more.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
016	You're a spoiled one, huh?
017	And also... Could you sheathe that blade of yours?
018	No.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0040
019	You dare defy me?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
020	I am in the middle of fighting my way through this tower to obtain power. I will cut down—	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
021	I'm scared.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
022	...What?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
023	It's sharp. It looks...scary.
024	Uhhhh... Y-yeah.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0020
025	What is it?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0005
026	Right... Yeah, you don't know anything.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
027	So, you too crave power?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
028	That...was the plan.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
029	If you so desire, I can give it to you. That is the only thing I know. The only role I can carry out.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
030	(The legend states that one will gain power in exchange for some sort of compensation at the top of the Mystic Tower Veda.)
031	(I could not find a single person in Lost Blue who had achieved such power. I was beginning to think it was all a superstition.)
032	But...you will most likely break. Much like the others. If you are full of greed, imprudent, unable to reflect upon one's self...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
033	You're wrong.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
034	I'm not the one this power is for.
035	Who else is there?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
036	I want power for Lost Blue.
037	I want it to herald the world's end.
038	...
039	I won't take it for free. What do you want in exchange?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
040	...
041	Oh, oops. Am I not allowed to ask that?
042	Someone...
043	I want...someone. Anyone...to be by my side.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
044	J-just one person would do.
045	...
046	Though...I know it cannot be granted. Humans have a home to go back to. Back to the world below this tower, far from me.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
047	I'll grant it for you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0037
048	Wh-what...?
049	Can you let me do one thing, first?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
050	I... I don't think you understand. To be with me means for all of eternity, you will—	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
051	I just need to leave a path behind for a particular someone.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0031
052	Y-you're just going to leave and never come back, aren't you? You can't go! There is no way that you—	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
053	Being so restrictive isn't an attractive trait, you know?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0003
054	A-attra—?! Wh-what...?!	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
055	You're feeling lonely, right? Don't worry. I'll be back soon.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
056	I could use some help to make sure I can, though.
057	Even if you ask me, I...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
058	I'll be needing a mount to rush back up here.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0031
059	I mean, I'm going to be dedicating my life to this. I think I deserve a little extra for my pains.
060	If you could give me an advance payment, that'd be great.
061	Huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
062	I like it. It's right up my alley.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0023
063	I've been called a lot of different things, but nothing seemed to suit me.
064	Nihil... Nothing... A word that equates to the number zero. I like it!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
065	Perfect. That'll be my name from now on.
066	I want you to give power to will.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
067	...
068	An evil power that can defeat that of righteousness.
069	A destructive power that can shatter the peace.
070	Power is everything, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
071	So why not take it for ourselves and flip this world on its end?
072	That's one crazy, futile ambition.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0020
073	Not big enough for you? What about world domination?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
074	We, who have never been given the space to really live, taking on the world with power from another dimension...
075	Pretty cool, don't you think?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
076	Do you not believe it is pointless to get this power now?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
077	You accepted me, didn't you?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
078	You are...different, Vanir.
079	When I was in the lower levels of Veda, I saw countless vile humans.
080	I saw wretched greed, self-righteous malice, egregious claims, compassionless violence...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
081	And yet I was elated to be sought after.
082	Back when I was entirely too clueless, I gave those humans power.
083	But that power changed them. It changed them into something inhuman.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
084	Inhuman...?
085	All I am able to do is provide the chance to gain power. And to do that...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
086	Whatever makes that human who they are, and whatever it is that human has that keeps them going... Those things must be given up.
087	By doing so, they are able to explosively boost their power, but the power changes them.
088	Every single one of those who sought power while still immature and weak-willed... They lost sight of who they were, destroying themselves.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0016
089	There were those who howled vile words at me, some who tactlessly fell to the Phantom soldiers of the tower, and some who ended themselves after losing their purpose in life.
090	Those inhuman fools who lost their human soul cast the blame upon me. "Why did you give us power?" they asked.
091	I did not understand their reaction, and that brought over me a sense of discomfort. Is it not predestined for humans to perish? Is it not always humans who long for destruction?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0027
092	And so I destroyed them with my own hands.
093	...
094	It was never my intention for things to come to that...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0030
095	What about that lengthy process you were so proud of?
096	This is necessary for selection. Of her powers, her personage...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
097	I believe you're doing something similar, yes?
098	...
099	What drives humans to desire power so? Why would they sacrifice what makes them who they are for the sake of destruction?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
100	All just because they had something they considered worth protecting.
101	...
102	So I gave power to those who desired it. When they inevitably broke, the cycle would repeat. Over and over again.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
103	I could not bear getting to know another. So I escaped to the higher levels of Veda, still clinging on to a grain of hope.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0018
104	I thought if there was one who was able to reach where I stood... If they had the strength of will to make it here... Then perhaps...
105	Those walls you've put up around your heart must be the many floors of Mystic Tower Veda.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0045
106	Could that be so?
107	The summit of Veda has still not manifested itself yet.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
108	The floors of Veda that remain unmanifested are proof that you believe in humankind's unworthiness.
109	You created the structure within this tower to reflect your desires: none without the Alchemia to pour into the tower, to prove their strength, are allowed to proceed through the tower.
110	My heart's desires... Reflected in this tower...?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
111	It seems likely.
112	Vanir... You call me a dragon. Yet we can come to understand each other.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
113	What am I?
114	Why am I here?
115	Don't fret over it. I'm the same.
116	What?
117	I need someone beside me in order to know who I am.
118	And that someone will be here soon.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
119	You're late, prodigy child.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
120	Vanir...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
121	What did you go by now again? Nihil?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
122	What are you doing in Veda?! I... I heard you disappeared!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
123	Such rumors do me discredit. It's only that my mount is a bit slow...	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
124	What is going on? I thought you would have moved on far ahead. What are you doing at such a low floor level?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
125	Let me ask you this.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
126	Do you have something you consider important to you? Do you have something or someone that ensures you never lose sight of yourself?
127	So you won't answer my question?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
128	Tell me. Is there something you base your sense of self on?
129	...
130	I'm still looking for that. Hence, my name now.
131	Would you be willing to give that up for the sake of strength?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
132	I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about, but if I were to give you an answer...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
133	Will you be able to hold on to your humanity, even if you lose sight of that one thing?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
134	Yes!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
135	How can you be so sure?
136	Why are you asking me this?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
137	You made me this way!
138	?!
139	I used to value my own life above all else, until you taught me otherwise.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
140	I used to have nothing until you taught me how to dream.
141	I inherited your crazy wish to bring a blue sky here to Lost Blue.
142	...
143	Humanity's will...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
144	Thanks to you disappearing, I'm happily enjoying a spin of nihilism.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
145	But I will find—
146	Good answer.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
147	?!
148	I'm now the vanguard of Veda.
149	Show me the strength of your will.
150	A vanguard for...?! Are you saying you're no longer human?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
151	Show me that you're not just all talk.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
152	Dammit, you're being very uncool!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
153	Am I? Here we are, at an impasse... I aim to make my way ahead, and you aim to surpass me.
154	You said I was special to you! N-not that I believed you or anything...!
155	Well, let me treat you specially now. Face me.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
156	So you're trying to hammer down the nail that's sticking out? You'll do anything to make it further ahead, regardless of what happens to those behind you, won't you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
157	What of it?	VO_eins.eins_sys_0006
158	You are being absolutely uncool right now!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
159	Did you notice the dragon watching us?
160	Vanir!
161	I'll teach you one last bit of the basics.
