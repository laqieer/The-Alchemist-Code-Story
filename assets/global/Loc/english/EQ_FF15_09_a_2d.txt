001	Well well. Looks like we meet once more.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0026
002	Are those Magitek Axemen working for you?	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0002
003	I guess you could say that.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0005
004	But they've stopped listening to me...which has proved to be somewhat problematic.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0030
005	...They've stopped listening to you?	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0025
006	They went rogue and somehow ended up in this bizarre place. I've tried various means of escape with little success.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0021
007	We're in the same boat!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0044
008	I'd really like to be getting home. What about you, boys?	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0022
009	I'm here to investigate the mysterious monsters that have been appearing around these parts.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
010	He's accompanying us as we believe our appearance here may somehow be related to that of the Magitek Axemen.	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0004
011	So, you've joined forces.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0025
012	And the Magitek Axemen came with you?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_1041
013	Probably.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0020
014	We're currently making our way to Slothstein.
015	Been there done that. There was some sort of commotion going on there. Doubt it has anything to do with us.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0030
016	Slothstein has nothing to do with this...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
017	Not as far as I could tell.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0005
018	(This isn't related to the power of the Sacred Stones...?)	VO_dios.dios_sys_0022
019	It appears we've hit a dead end. Any other suggestions?	VO_ignis.ignis_sys_0012
020	My investigation is based on the information I received regarding strange occurrences happening simultaneously within Slothstein and on the country border.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
021	If it has nothing to do with Slothstein...then the only other alternative I can think of is Babel...or the Door of Truth?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
022	What's that?	VO_noctis.noctis_sys_0006
023	...But...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
024	Dude, another one!	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0026
025	...	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0010
026	Something tells me it's not here on a diplomatic envoy.	VO_aranea.aranea_sys_0027
027	Is this also an Alkaroid from Slothstein?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
028	It appears to be an upgrade from the last one.	VO_prompt.prompt_sys_0027
029	I won't go easy on it.	VO_noctis.noctis_battle_0013
030	Don't get ahead of yourself.	VO_gladiolus.gladiolus_sys_0007
