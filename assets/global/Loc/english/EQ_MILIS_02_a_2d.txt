001	Yep! That's one big catch! Now I can make lots of water lizard cuisine!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0023
002	Wait!
003	Huh? What's the matter, Lofy—
004	Just hide over here! Quickly!
005	Hey, hold on.
006	...
007	Wow. What strange people. Looking at them crossing the forest in such heavy armor.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0025
008	The Holy Guard? What are they doing so near Lustburg?
009	Lofy?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
010	I'm sure the Court Mage Order wasn't contacted. Did they cross the border without any notice?
011	There's something fishy going on.
012	Lofy!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0017
013	Eeek?! Wh-what?	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0019
014	You went quiet all of a sudden. I got worried. Are they bad people?
015	Not exactly, but...all people have the potential to do bad things.
016	Milis, go back to Lustburg.
017	What about you, Lofy?
018	I need to fulfill my duty. It's necessary to find out what they're up to.
019	Then I'll go with you! Two are better than one! I won't get in your way.
020	It's true that your skill with the bow may be useful, but...
021	Then rely on me. We're friends, right?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0038
022	Um...yeah.
023	Let's get this over with. Then we can go back to Lustburg and eat water lizard cuisine!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0032
024	I'd prefer sweets.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
025	Don't say that! It's my favorite food!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
026	Then let's pursue them! A Saga hunter never loses her prey!
027	We've scouted our nearby surroundings. There are no signs of suspicious activity.
028	There are traces of a landslide throughout the entire area. The ruins were mostly likely exposed as a result.
029	Very well. It seems our intel was accurate. Too accurate.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
030	What shall we do?
031	As the Holy Guard, we cannot abandon the ruins.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
032	The main squadron will enter the ruins with me. Keep a lookout at the entrance.
033	I don't think that's necessary.
034	It's a precaution. This mission is shrouded in secrecy. We must be prepared for any event.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
035	Understood!
036	Look! Over there! There are ruins!
037	Ruins in a place like this? I've never heard of that before.
038	Judging by the movement of the Holy Guard, could they be from the ancient age of Alchemy? But where did they get the information from?
039	Well, what should we do? Should we report back to someone important?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
040	Fortunately, there aren't many guards, and they seem careless.
041	Milis, can you lend me your strength?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0041
042	All right.
043	Okay. Let's move on my signal. 1, 2...3!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
044	What?! Who are you—
