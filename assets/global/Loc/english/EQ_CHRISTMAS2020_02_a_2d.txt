001	Where is that peddler? No sign of them yet. Maybe I should keep going...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
002	Wait… Who's that over there? Oh… Just a couple of kids.
003	Hurry up, sis, or they'll sell out before we get there!
004	It's my mission to buy one for everyone in our family this year, and I don't wanna miss out!
005	I know, but you can't just run off on your own! Hold my hand, okay? We'll make it there together!
006	I'm not a little kid, you know! I don't need your help with every little thing anymore!
007	Heh... That's such a little kid thing to say. I should know—I used to be like that.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0008
008	And Glanz always played the part of the big sister, worrying about me and stuff...
009	I...
010	I wonder if they'll really be there? At the party, I mean.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
011	I know they were invited, but after the way we left things last time...I wouldn't be surprised if they opted out.
012	They were just trying to help me, and I threw their good intentions back in their faces. I yelled at them, said some awful things...and I didn't even apologize.
013	And after all that...have I even done right by the Unicorn Knights?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0043
014	A place for girls who have nowhere else left to go.
015	That's what the Unicorn Knights are all about, but I'm not sure I've upheld that reputation.
016	It kind of feels like all I've done since I became captain is fight in their...in Glanz and Rochelle's stead.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
017	But I...
018	I can't face them now! Not yet. Not until I've become someone who can restore smiles to the faces of those around me and keep them there!
019	Aha! Found you.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
020	Icona! What are you doing here?
021	I just thought I'd join you.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
022	Join me? But you said it wasn't even my place to do this! What changed your mind?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
023	Don't tell me you suddenly developed a soft spot for kids?
024	Haha. Nope! Mini humans and their emotions aren't my concern.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
025	I figured. But then...why are you here?
026	I need a few components for my machines, and I heard there might be some I can salvage nearby.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
027	Besides, it's better to deal with problems sooner rather than later. Makes life easier in the long run.
028	So, by accompanying you on your little mission—illogical and inefficient as it may be—I can help ensure that any hiccups are dealt with the second they pop up, thus saving future me a headache.
029	Geez... You sure love the sound of your own voice, don't you? Listen, I can handle this on my own, so why don't you just—	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
030	Slim as it may be, there is a chance something could go wrong if you're alone. That would impact future missions, robbing me of precious research time.
031	So! How about we stop arguing, and start finding that peddler?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
032	Ugh... Fine.
033	However...was there really any need for us to get involved in the first place?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
034	This again?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
035	Issues between buyer and seller belong in the marketplace. They're not for us to settle.
036	Maybe, but...like I said, that guy was in a really foul mood.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
037	I'd hate to see him ruin the Winter Holiday for his kids. This is meant to be a happy day, a time to laugh and have fun with your loved ones.
038	I suppose that is the theme of the day, although I confess I don't understand it.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
039	What's there to understand?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
040	Everything is more fun when you do it with friends or the people you love, right? Even stuff like going swimming, or learning new things...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
041	Really?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
042	Y-yeah? I think so. At least...it's always been that way for me.
043	I see.
044	That's where that saying comes from: time flies when you're having fun.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0020
045	But time is finite—I understand that better than most people. That's why it's so important for us to really enjoy the time we have with the people we care about.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
046	Wasting a special day like today on being annoyed at somebody is just...sad. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy!
047	Interesting... So that's what's motivating you.
048	And? Is there something wrong with that?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
049	I wouldn't say that. I'm well aware that there are a number of people in this world who think like you do, and put the needs of others above their own.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0039
050	I just don't understand them.
051	Well, don't you think that's...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0042
052	Hang on... Someone's coming!
053	All right, missies, which one of you is the peddler with the exclusive goods?! If you value your life, drop all your valuables and run for the hills!
054	I knew we'd run into a lowlife like this eventually.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0030
055	Well, don't just stand there—get ready! We're in for a fight!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
