001	A breeze caresses your cheek.
002	It's a strange breeze, unlike any that you've felt before.
003	At first, when you open your eyes, you're not quite sure where you are.
004	Where... am I? It looks like there's a school over there, but... Wait...
005	Is that... It can't be... the Tower of Babel?
006	As impossible as it may seem, you are standing in the world of TAC.
007	No way! Is that the Venus School of Magic?!
008	Okay, okay... Let's just take a deep breath. I've read a story like this before. Someone must have called me here...
009	But... that's weird. I don't remember anyone calling for me.
010	I'm pretty sure I was just farming seals until a few seconds ago...
011	Grrrrrrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0021
012	Okay, here we go. If an enemy's threatening me, that means someone's going to come along and save me any moment now!
013	N-no one's coming! Crap, I've gotta make a run for it!
014	I-I can't run... anymore...
015	Haa... haa... Grrrrr!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0003
016	Come to think of it... maybe this is just a dream! It's still pretty cool that I got to see the Tower of Babel, though.
017	Graaarrgghhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
018	You've been saying some very curious things.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
019	Phew! That was a close one. Dream or not, you saved me! Hang on... Have we met before?
020	Perhaps. Regardless, I'm afraid you're not out of the woods yet. You're surrounded, if you hadn't noticed.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
021	Oh, dang! Please save me again! Pretty please?!
022	Hmm... I don't know. Should I?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
023	C-c'mon! Please?!
024	Hmhm... Just teasing. Now, step back a bit. I'm going to let loose a little.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
