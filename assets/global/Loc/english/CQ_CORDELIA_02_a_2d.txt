001	Eeek!
002	You people always do this to me! You come barging into my peaceful world with your muddy boots on!
003	I won't allow this to go on for a moment longer!
004	Oh...
005	(This is that plant Alyu was talking about.)
006	...
007	Y-you monster! We'll get you soon enough! Just you wait!
008	Vampire...monster... That's all these people have to say about me. Ugh...
009	I wish I really could drain them of their blood!
010	Cordelia? Are you okay?
011	Oh! S-sorry! I promise I'm not really a vampire!
012	But...I was scary just now, wasn't I? I suppose it can't be helped that people think I'm a vampire...
013	But why? It's only natural to get mad when people just barge into your home!
014	They're the ones who should be sorry! You maybe even let them off easy...I think.
015	Oh... Well, thank you, Alyu.
016	Still, those people don't see it like that. They're here to vanquish an evil vampire, or so they think.
017	You...shouldn't come here again.
018	I would hate that.
019	Wh-why?
020	From the looks of it, I think I'll be able to find more rare plants in this garden. So...I might want to visit you more often... Maybe.
021	B-but then people might think you're associating with a vampire.
022	Merchants have to see things with their own eyes and think with their own heads. We can't let ourselves be swayed by rumors.
023	I think you're a good person! I mean, you listened to me even though I trespassed in your garden.
024	And I noticed that you carefully avoided stepping on the plant I said I was interested in.
025	I meet a lot of people in my line of work, so I can tell good people apart from bad ones by now...I think.
026	...
027	Whoa, it's already so late! I think I need to get home and check tomorrow's stock. I'll be back tomorrow.
028	Th-then I'll pick some of these plants for you in the meantime!
029	You'd really do that for me? Then I think I'll see what I can find out about that plant. See you tomorrow, Cordelia!
030	Right! Until tomorrow, Alyu!
031	Haaaahmmn... I'm awake so early again. But I feel like today is going to be a really good day!
032	Now then, let's see how many of those plants I can find before Alyu gets here.
033	It was too dark for me to find any last night, but this is the perfect time to go take a look.
034	I hope she'll be happy if I fill this basket with those plants she was interested in.
035	That brat won't be coming today.
036	Who's there?!
037	Vampire wench! What are you doing out in the sunlight?!
038	I bet you're gathering ingredients for some dark ritual! That's exactly the kind of sick stuff vampires do!
039	It's none of your business what I do in my garden! But more importantly...
040	What exactly did you mean when you said that she won't be coming today?
041	We let her know that this mansion is a vampire's nest.
042	And we told her we'll never buy from a merchant who's had dealings with a vampire, and that we'll tell everybody else to do the same.
043	How cruel...
044	She didn't seem to get how dangerous you vampires are, so we had to make her understand, for her own good.
045	She was shuddering in fear when we told her how vampires prefer the blood of young girls. She'll never be coming here again!
046	...
047	(That has to be a lie. Alyu said she believed that I'm a good person...)
048	(But what if they convinced her that I'm a vampire and scared her off?)
049	(Everyone in town believes I am one, no matter how much I deny it.)
050	...
051	Oh, no!
052	Give it up, vampire! This silver knife will take care of you!
053	Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
054	Alyu!
055	Just as I thought! This item packs a punch!
056	Y-you! What are you doing here?!
057	What do you think? I'm not just gonna let you bully my friend around!
