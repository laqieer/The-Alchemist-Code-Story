001	Dangit! It wasn't supposed to be like this!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0021
002	Why is this happening?! We were promised a life of luxury if the army took Saga!
003	Who was it that instigated all of this in the first place?!
004	General Georgios is dead?! The Flame-Armed General is dead?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
005	It's a conspiracy!
114	It's the nobles! They're making the army their own with our tax money!
006	Y-you're right!
007	Yes... Yes, of course!
008	Who's at fault?! Who can we blame?! Who stole our profits?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
009	Father.	VO_selliord.selliord_favorite_0003
010	We must take action. The people are preparing an uprising, and the nobility... Now that they have privatized the military, they are absorbed in expanding their dominion.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0016
011	This country... Gluttony Foss is on the verge of collapse.
012	Please allow me to make a public declaration. We must admit that the Saga expedition was a folly and reprove the nobles of their rampage.
013	If we do not—
014	I will not allow this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0039
015	F-Father, please!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0006
016	Those dang cattle... They've grown fat off of my blessings, and yet they still demand more.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
017	Hmph. I suppose that is what makes them citizens of Gluttony Foss. They take, devour, and yet still their appetite continues to swell.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
018	They had better prove that it was worth my time to feed them as I have.
019	Wh-what are you saying?	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0029
020	The people are gasping for air, drowning in insecurity! They're losing hope for tomorrow, and yet reaching out with desperate hands in search of salvation.
021	Is it not our duty, as the administrators of the state, to provide them with that salvation?
022	Ah, Seriolde. My blood, my scion. How naive you are, Seriolde Ceclidis IV.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
023	It may not have been wise to provide you with tutors of ill breed. You still fail to understand the true nature of the governance of this land.
024	What?
025	Order the military to suppress the uprising. They are now the hands and feet of the nobility. They would do anything to protect the benefits that it gives them.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
026	B-but...think of the casualties the people will suffer! The entire country will fall to ruin!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0020
027	That is all fine. Thirst and hunger, the gluttonous impulses, these are what propel this country forward.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
028	The time for harvest is nearing. We must drive the people further.
029	Grasshoppers cannot become locusts until they swarm. Ah, I feel it! The time for the resurrection ceremony is upon us!
030	Heheh... Hahahahaha!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0009
031	No.	VO_selliord.selliord_battle_0019
032	I cannot let this be! This country will be ruined if this is allowed to continue!	VO_selliord.selliord_favorite_0001
033	But what can I do? I am merely a puppet sitting on a false throne.	VO_selliord.selliord_favorite_0002
034	Lord Seriolde? Are you all right?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
035	Ah, it's you. I'm fine, but I suggest you leave this country.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0016
036	The discontent of the people runs deep. They would reproach those who are even slightly associated with the nobility.
037	B-but Your Highness—
038	Do not call me that.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0029
039	I'm not the true king of Gluttony Foss. You know this, don't you?
040	...
041	I am nothing more than a puppet. I exist only to hide my father's—that monster's—truth.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0018
042	There is no end to his appetite. The slaves we buy are insufficient.
043	I daresay that the recent incident of those children going missing could also be...
044	In any case, civil war is not the only danger we face in this country. You shouldn't be here.
045	That may be, but I am a noble of Gluttony Foss. I have a responsibility to my family name. Please, you must allow me to remain by your side until the end!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0021
046	I will not! Don't you understand? I do not have the power to keep even a single person safe from harm!	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0012
047	I cannot protect you.
048	I am powerless against my father's rampage, and so I must ask you to do something for me.
049	There is an ancient tribe living in the Desert Zone south of here.
050	We need to make contact with them and ask them for their help. I believe that this is something that only you can do.
051	Me?
052	However slightly, you have inherited their blood and their powers. They may just lend an ear to your words.	VO_selliord.selliord_sys_0037
053	Marie, my love, please help me save this country.	VO_selliord.selliord_favorite_0004
054	The Sephira—
055	My lord, I guarantee you that I shall gain their favor. Please, be well until I return.
056	Urgh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
057	Come on, get up. We're almost at the oasis. You can make it.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
058	Y-yes, sir. Thank you, Captain Logi.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
059	I think my old self would have told all of them to take it easy.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
060	You must be getting used to being in a leadership position. We all know that now is not the time to be idle.
061	I guess you're right.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
062	It's been two weeks since we entered the Desert Zone.
063	It might be wise to find a village we can rest up in for a while.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
064	We are low on food and water. We should at least replenish our supplies.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
065	Hopefully the next oasis will allow us a brief sojourn.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
066	Well, just one more dune to climb! Over that dune is the oasis where we can—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
067	Huh?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
068	Is everything all right, Captain Logi?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
069	I...just saw someone on top of that dune.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
070	You did? I didn't see anyone. Hey! Did any of you see someone over on that dune?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
071	Never mind, I must have just made a mistake. Let's hurry. I have a bad feeling about this.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
072	Yes, sir! All right, everybody! One last push!
073	Huzzaaaahh!
074	Sorry, but I ain't sellin' you lot nothin'!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
075	But...why?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0021
076	You're them Blue Tongues I've been hearin' about, ain't ya? The remnants of the Blue Flame Guard and Lizard Brigade.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
077	Well...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
078	Some folks praise you as a righteous militia, but some of us see you as the leftover fragments of the great sinner.
079	It ain't my place to say, but even Northern Pride's been makin' their way into the desert.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
080	I doubt any merchant would dare show you lot support with those kinds of eyes watchin'.
081	That's all I'm willin' to say. Go along, now.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0035
082	This is troubling. I didn't think the Blue Tongues would be known out here.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
083	No luck, I take it?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
084	You, too?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
085	Nothing. They yelled at us for being the remnants of the Blue Flame Guard.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
086	I never expected the Holy Guard's influence to stretch all the way out to this remote region.
087	Until just a few years ago this place still had some merchants with rebellious tendencies.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
088	The Holy Guard is growing increasingly active all over Babel.
089	Much like they did when that conflict arose in Envylia.
090	It might not be long before we have to take up arms again.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
091	Right—but first, we have to find out for sure.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
092	We must know the truth behind what is happening to Babel, and the truth regarding the Sacred Stones.
093	It is up to us to stop their schemes, so that no more blood and no more tears of grief are shed upon this continent.
094	We have nowhere else to go. We will follow you to the end, Captain Logi.
095	We will be needing supplies first, at any rate.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
096	Where can we go? The merchants here aren't willing to help.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
097	Well, the merchant over there said that no one would help us with "those eyes" watching.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
098	The Desert Zone has always existed in between competing forces.
099	Places like these have been known to give rise and fall to rebellious forces. I'm sure that is the case, even to this day.
100	Captain Logi? What is that?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
101	That merchant from earlier gave me this letter of introduction. A courier guild—the Fruit Peddlers, huh? Let's go see what they're all about.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
102	Welcome, welcome! What can our guild do for you?
103	Whatever your package, we'll deliver it safely to any place in the desert!
104	I was told that even we might be able to do business here.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
105	Do you have a letter of introduction?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
106	Would this be it?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
107	Ah! You must be the Blue Tongues.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
108	This desert is full of some rather shady people. We happen to have a lot of opportunities to get information about them.
109	Our boss praised that rebellious spirit of yours very highly. It's good to see that you've kept up, even after being chased out of your country.
110	Of course, we cannot offer you supplies for free, however. I'm sure you understand.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
111	Absolutely. We don't have much on hand, but we will pay what we can.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
112	Oh, no. Your money's no good here, but you do have something far more valuable that you can offer us.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
113	Huh?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
