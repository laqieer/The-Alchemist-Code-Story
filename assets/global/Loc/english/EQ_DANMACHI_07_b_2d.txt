001	Hyaaaaaah!!!	VO_eyes.eyes_battle_0007
002	Uuurrrgh...	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0019
003	Now!
004	Oooooooooraaaaaah!!!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0032
005	...Did we get it?
006	...
007	We won!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0008
008	The demons are all taken care of, too.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
009	It's a victory all around, Bell!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
010	All thanks to you, Kevin and Ila. Not to mention Ais, of course—and you, Goddess!
011	Yeah! Go, team!	VO_hestia.hestia_battle_0011
012	Thanks to...the goddess?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
013	You got a problem with that, Kevin?!
014	No, no, of course not, Goddess! Heaven forfend.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0011
015	Hmph! The nerve of this guy...
016	Oh! Is that...?	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0025
017	Hey! You're that diva who snatched Bell away from our world in the first place!
018	I've got a bone to pick with you, putting my Bell in danger like that!
019	You have done well, boy who aspires to be a hero.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
020	Hey! Listen when I'm talking to you! Heeeey!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0025
021	The experiments performed by those villains set off a discharge of Alchemia that spread disarray even as far as your world.
022	Of course it was them. It had to be!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
023	Now, at last, the natural order has returned.
024	What about the children?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
025	They are safe and sound.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0004
026	...Good.
027	Bell Cranel, you have shown me one page of your hero's tale in great detail.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
028	I'm not a hero, though.
029	Can't you just drop the modesty already?! Sheesh!
030	Your achievements are a part of who you are, so when people praise you for them, you should just accept it!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0003
031	I-I do. But I didn't accomplish any of this on my own.
032	I couldn't have done it without all of my friends here helping me.
033	So their contributions belong in that hero's tale, too!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
034	Ahh, okay! I can get behind that!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0008
035	Usually, tales like that are all about a hero coming to save the world from some impending crisis...but it'd be a real honor to be included alongside that dashing protagonist when this one's passed down!
036	And I'm glad to have had you by my side, Kevin.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
037	Unfortunately, this hero's tale is one that cannot be passed along.
038	The distortions in time and space will soon mend. Your memories of this place, too, will dissolve away into nothing.
039	What...?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
040	Everything shall return to the way it was before, as if none of this ever occurred.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
041	Whatever might happen to our memories, if Bell can go back to his family, and those children are safe...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
042	That's good enough for me.
043	Your story, and your battles, will continue. As will mine. You need only turn the page.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
044	Well said!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
045	Ila... Ais...
046	Well, I guess that's how it's gonna be, Bell.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0005
047	No sense dragging things out. Let's get back to our Familia!
048	Yes, Goddess!
049	And Wallen-whatever, Loki's worried about you.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0001
050	Loki is...worried?	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0001
051	You know, since we're gonna lose our memories anyway, I might as well just say it: you can be really thick-headed when it comes to people's feelings. 	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0030
052	And as long we're being totally honest, I've got something to tell you about Bell that might be of some interest, too...
053	Goddess, please! Not that!
054	We'll miss our chance to say our goodbyes, at this rate.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
055	Hmph. Fine. I guess I'll hang on to this particular morsel until it can do maximum damage.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0016
056	But aren't we going to forget everything?
057	Oh, crap! You're right!
058	Umm, perhaps you might...hold off on all this until you get back home?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
059	I know you won't remember it, but I wanted to thank you again, Bell. There might be more bad guys around like the ones earlier, but this is my homeland, and I intend to keep fighting for it.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0033
060	And it's still here thanks in no small part to you! So, yeah. I owe you one, big time! Take care of yourself back in your world.
061	You too, Kevin! ...Er, actually, do phantoms even need to take care of themselves?
062	Hahaha. Don't worry. Whoever summons me next will be well taken care of in my place!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
063	...
064	Ila? Thank you, too.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
065	I should be thanking you.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
066	So...I will. Th-thank you...Bell.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0034
067	I'm glad we could save those children.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0007
068	Me too.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
069	Keep working toward that dream of yours, with your friends at your side. Promise me you will! Even if neither of us will remember it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
070	I promise.
071	I suppose my role here is done as well.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0006
072	Oh, no! We're parting ways before I could even see Ais smile! Uhh... boogedy-boogedy-boo?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0026
073	...
074	No reaction to the bitter end, huh?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0042
075	Hahaha...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
076	Okay. For real this time...
077	Let's go home, Bell. You too, Wallen-something.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0007
078	Yes, Goddess!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
079	Let's.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0005
080	This story may disappear from your memories...but your hero's tale will ever be etched unto mine, Bell Cranel. Turn the page...
