001	Here I go! Huuuzzzzaaaaaahhhhhhh!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
002	Haaa...haaaaa... I can't...do it. The Mecha Weapon isn't...dealing enough...damage.	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
003	Unngghhh! The miasma! This is bad! Huh...?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
004	What's that? The back of the Giant Taurus' neck is...glowing?	VO_judith.judith_chara_1002
005	Unnnnnggghhh!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
006	Armed-Leap Assault!!!
007	Grrrrrrrrrrroooooooaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!
008	Now! Get the miasma!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0032
009	H-huh?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
010	Well? Did it work?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
011	Perfectly! I got a skin sample from the neck area, too! I'll go and examine it right now!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0037
012	Ah! The Giant Taurus is getting away!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
013	Stop! Victor! There's no need to be reckless! It'll come back, one way or another!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0015
014	Got it?! So calm down, you idiot!
015	You're the idiot! Idiot!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
016	Still kicking, Judith?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0002
017	Thank the gods! It looks like we made it just in time.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
018	Y-you! Why...?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
019	I'm sorry about before.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0035
020	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
021	I kept pushing myself too hard because I wanted to be the perfect Lord Commander.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
022	I want to protect everyone that I possibly can. If I do that, I will be upholding the justice of the continent. That's enough for me.
023	...
024	Your father's blood is on our hands. Nothing can change that...
025	But right now, defeating the Giant Taurus is our top priority.
026	I want your help with that. No... I need it. This is something that only you can do. I'm counting on you, Judith.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0041
027	Ah!
028	Wh-what's all this, all of a sudden?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0012
029	If you'd said that just a little earlier, then my dad, h-he... He might not have...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0013
030	I'm sorry. I have no words.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
031	All right! I figured it out!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0032
032	You! When you attacked and cracked that bit off the Giant Taurus, I figured it out!
033	Wh-what...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
034	What's with you?! This is fantastic! Where's Tehre?!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0027
035	Have you figured it out?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0025
036	You bet I did! This bit that Tehre had, this piece that Judith cut off...	VO_hans.hans_sys_0037
037	And this last bit we just got our hands on!
038	It's all come together! There's absolutely no doubt about it! This neck part, you know, it's totally like—!
039	The Alchemia was particularly concentrated in those areas?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
040	Yes! Exactly!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0008
041	I see! Thank you, Hange! This is going to have a huge impact on our effectiveness in battle!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0007
042	Are you certain?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
043	Yes. With these materials, we should be able to... Hmmm. Judith?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
044	Yes?
045	If the Giant Taurus is defeated, your father's hopes will be answered, correct?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
046	Tehre...
047	There's no time to explain in detail, but if we destroy the core of the Giant Taurus, we should be able to defeat it.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
048	There is no doubt about it: the core of the Giant Taurus is on its neck. Did you notice anything about it during the battle?
049	Now that you ask... I remember that when the miasma was expelled, something on the back of its neck glinted!	VO_judith.judith_chara_1002
050	That must be it! Then the core is on the back of its neck!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
051	Great! Now we know what to do! Weird that both the Titan and the Giant Taurus have the same weak point.	VO_budd.budd_chara_1005
052	I believe that we have also discovered how to send all of you back to your home world.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
053	You think it has something to do with the Giant Taurus?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
054	Yes, I do. In fact, I believe that it has something to do with specifically this Giant Taurus that is here in Saga.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
055	Every time it roars, the air itself vibrates strongly in response.
056	Then, the Alchemia contained within the Giant Taurus' body is influenced by the vibrations of the air.
057	I suspect that is how the Titans were called here from another world. Those vibrations connected to another space and time and brought them.
058	Why only this Giant Taurus?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
059	Recently, the balance of nature in Saga was torn asunder. As a result of that instability, both great and terrible things become possible.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
060	Just talking about it is frustrating... I want to bring all this to a quick end.
061	I'm sorry. I don't understand how this is connected to sending them back to their world.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
062	We must overwhelm the Giant Taurus' core with Alchemia and connect this world to theirs.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
063	It is very possible that in the process of returning to their world, they will lose their memories, however.
064	Huh? Is that some kind of multi-universe defense system or something?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0025
065	No, it's nothing like that. Simply put, once the balance is restored, all traces of the previous imbalance will be erased.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
066	Ah. That makes sense. Well, that's only something to worry about once we've actually managed to connect our worlds.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0031
067	Yes. Our first problem is figuring out how to best combat the Taurus.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
068	Judith, please, could you lend us your strength? There's no way we can do this without you and your Mecha Weapon.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0041
069	That's the only way that we can stop this all now, before anyone else gets hurt.
070	B-but I...!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
071	Don't you want to claim your father's justice by protecting that man?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_chara_1001
072	Reiner...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
073	I'm not a fan of the way you're manipulating me, but...I'll show you that I can take care of this with a swoosh!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
074	Whoa! That Titan is crazy huge!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
075	We have no choice! We must figure out some way to deal with it!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
076	Look! That Titan's not our only problem!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
077	What?! They multiplied?! What're we gonna do against this horde of giant monsters?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
078	No...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
079	It's not over yet! Hey, everyone! Sorry to have kept you waiting!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0001
080	You came!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
081	I did some tinkering using that miasma from the Giant Taurus.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0008
082	The results of my experimentation mean that we can fight just like we always have! The ODM gear is back in the game!
083	Those hulking nuisances are from our world. It's our job to deal with them.	VO_eren.eren_sys_0016
084	Listen. We'll deal with this Reiner ordeal later.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
085	We need to handle your world's problems while in your world.
086	We'll settle things with Reiner once we're back in our own world.
087	Right!
088	Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
089	There's no time! Judith!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0012
090	Bud! Victor! We can't let them show us up!
091	Right!
092	Let's go!
093	Eren, I authorize you to bring forth your Titan form. We just need to get through this.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
094	Got it! We're counting on you, Judith! Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawr!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0037
095	Eren...is a Titan?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
096	It's complicated. There's a lot going on in our world... Too hard to explain.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0004
097	Your job is to focus on being ready when the time comes to bring the Giant Taurus down. Take care of yourself until then.
098	It's our turn to show off!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0008
