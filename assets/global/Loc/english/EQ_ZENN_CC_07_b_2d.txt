001	L-leave us alone!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0019
002	Mia!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
003	I haven't forgotten what Zehn did for us.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
004	The only reason we were able to spend all those happy days with these kids is because Zehn kept us safe.
005	I haven't forgotten our home with the Shadow Messiah, either...
006	Because Zehn fought to keep that memory intact for us!
007	And if he can do all that for us...I can do this!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0011
008	Wh-what the...?! This brat is going to be more of a nuisance than I thought!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
009	Sorry to interrupt, but I have a message for you from the Bishop.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
010	What?! Now?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
011	Yes. It is urgent.
012	Huh?
013	But the Lion Monarch's Charge is underway! What is the meaning of this?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
014	That's why it took me so long to get here.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
015	I was told to pass on these orders before the Charge began, but I was delayed by its progression. The message is this: the remnants of the Shadow Messiah are no longer your targets.
016	Hm? What's going on?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
017	I suppose we'll only incur further losses on our side if we continue...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
018	Very well, then. We will retreat.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
019	Not that I'm complaining, but...why? You were prepared to kill us!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
020	Yeah! What reason would you have to spare us?
021	Papa... P-papa...
022	Why are you here, samurai?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
023	Not to fight. I have a proposal for you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
024	And you just strut in here like a proud peacock and expect me to hear it? Such arrogance.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
025	I humbly beg your consideration.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
026	(Hmm... It's not a bad bargain.)	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
027	(If Zehn joins the Templars...)
028	(He can act as Greed Dike's agent, and have them operate in our favor.)
029	(In exchange, all we have to do is leave the remnants of the Shadow Messiah alone. We lose nothing, but gain much.)
030	Hmph. You overestimate your own worth.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
031	Whoever you were to me, I no longer recall. There is no reason for me to hunt you or your ilk any longer.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
032	But...
033	Yet it would seem that there is someone in this room whose arrogance eclipses even yours, for he saw fit to dispatch assassins without consulting me.
034	Wh-what? Surely you don't—	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
035	Ngh... Aaarghh!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0042
036	You dare trample on the pride of a warrior?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
037	I...!
038	(Zahar, the King of Darkness, and the person most feared by the Holy Order has been sealed away.)
039	(The Shadow Messiah now number so few, they might never have existed. It is somewhat wasteful to send assassins after them, at such a critical juncture as this—however...)	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
040	I merely thought it possible that, if Zahar should one day return, he might try to rebuild the Shadow Messiah.
041	That could have potential consequences for Greed Dike as well, so I took preemptive action. What say you, Zehn? How would you take responsibility for this outcome?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0002
042	I would give my life.
043	...
044	Do you swear it?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
045	Upon my wife's grave.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
046	Very well.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0045
047	My lord...
048	Get out of my sight. I never want to see your face again.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
049	Then I bid you farewell.
050	It was awfully kind of you to let him go. Are you sure it wise to trust someone who once betrayed you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
051	He could come back for revenge...but he won't.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
052	It may seem pointless, to sacrifice so much to carve out one, tiny slice of peace in this vast world...
053	But I know he would prefer to end this conflict without drawing his blade.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
054	For that is the spirit of Iai. "Victory is won in the sheath."
055	Ahh!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0020
056	Well fought, my daylily. Well fought.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
057	Checkmate.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
058	No way!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
059	You can do this, Sol! Oh, um... I'm afraid that move doesn't work. Pawns can't move laterally.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
060	You really should have kept more of your pieces alive. The king can't very well protect himself, can he?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
061	Damn it! Do I really only have pawns left?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
062	Like me, everyone here is an empty vessel, unable to move from their place on the shelf.
063	Perhaps once they were full, but they have been upturned and emptied by the world, by their enemies, by their allies...by everyone and anyone.
064	So now they seek to turn the world on its head, that they might be put right again.
065	I hate this world. Every last inch of it.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
066	Not just Greed Dike?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
067	I despise every last member of the brainless masses. People are only too happy to go along with the movement of the crowd, regardless of the consequences.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0022
068	I will never forget what I have suffered.
069	...
070	It's just like our leader always says!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
071	"Those who harm our friends will be killed by any means necessary." It's the Templars' code for the Unforgiveable.
072	We'll do whatever it takes to see it through, even use people we hate.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
073	We're going to take on the entire world, starting with Greed Dike!
074	Then we're going to turn everything on its head, reversing everything that's wrong with the world in one fell swoop!
075	Bold plan.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
076	The situation is kinda like that game you were playing. The pieces can only move within a set range, right? And in set patterns?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
077	And if you slow down, the enemy will quickly overtake you, and use your territory against you!
078	That's why you have to be fast, and take the enemy's best pieces before they come for yours! Are you following along with this okay, gramps?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
079	Must you call me that? I'm not that old, you know.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
080	Would you prefer "papa", then?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
081	Wh-what? That's not at all what I—	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
082	Anyway, now that you're one of us, we're not letting you go! Don't forget: you're a Templar for life!
083	I won't. After all, that is the commandment I was given: Forget not thine purpose.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
084	I have sworn to uphold it, and will not break my word.
085	Good! You're our samurai now.
086	You should know that, considering my birthplace and creed, many would say I cannot truly be called a samurai.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
087	So what?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
088	Hm?
089	You earned that identity! Your sword, your mastery of Iai, your samurai soul...all of it!
090	So you are the real thing! Okay? Don't let anyone take that from you!
091	Oi, Zehn!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
092	Hmph.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
093	You'd better not be thinking of joining the fight.
094	Of course I am. How else can I repay you for giving me shelter?
095	You only just got your power. Your wounds aren't even healed up yet.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0002
096	Füry and Vier did everything they could, and even they weren't able to put you back together again properly.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
097	So you're staying out of this one, unless worst comes to worst.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
098	Don't worry. We'll protect you!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
099	From one scarface to another... Hang in there, yeah?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
100	R-right.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
101	And don't go getting hurt again, okay? We can't afford to lose you.
102	I...
103	Ungh...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0019
104	Huh? Are you crying?! Is it 'cause of what I said?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
105	There's no shame in it! Sometimes you've just gotta let it all out. Don't I know it! Come on, Zehn, let's have a beer together! Gahahaha!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
106	Geez... Crying's pointless, you know. Especially at your age.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
107	Hah...haha... Hahaha!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0008
108	I thought I'd never cry again...but it seems I've been holding my tears back all this time.
109	Now I... I can't seem to stop.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
110	I...will not...force another...to sully their blade!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
111	I can no longer hear the narration in my mind. I suppose that means my tale is at an end.
112	Wait! No! Please, wait!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
113	Live by the blade, die by the blade... This is the path I choose!
114	I have done everything and anything I could to protect my home. I have played the part of the villain, allowed myself to be smeared with dishonor, and lived only by the blade.
115	This sword which has been at my side through it all... It now gives me a clear path forward!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
116	Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?
117	(This will be the last life I take.)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
118	Fare thee well.
119	Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me? Or, if I am to be reborn, do you think I will find love.
120	Guess we'd better start searching for a new home, huh?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
121	Hmm... Where should we go?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
122	Well, we can go anywhere now! The whole world is ours to explore!
123	Yeah... I guess it is.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0006
124	Pa...pa...back...
125	Mimi? What's wrong?
126	Papa! Papa back! Ahahahahahaha!
127	Papa! You're back!
128	Huh?
129	Someone's coming.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
130	Crap! Don't tell me those Corpse freaks changed their mind!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
131	O-oh...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
132	Who the hell are you?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
133	Um...
134	Ila... Please stop biting the head off every adult we meet.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0030
135	State your name and business!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
136	My name is...Na Zhu.
137	Na...Zhu?
138	Forgotten by my homeland, I am like a weed without roots, carried aloft by the wandering breeze... I apologize for startling you.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0016
139	Wait... Na Zhu. That Na Zhu?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
140	It has to be! How many Na Zhus can there be?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
141	I'm sorry. Have we met before?
142	Mister Zehn told us about you! In the story, you're the prodigy swordsman who taught the clumsy samurai hero how to be a better warrior!
143	Wh-what? I... That's not...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
144	But you're clumsy, too! Just like Mister Zehn, throughout the story you keep stumbling and getting lost while you try to make things right!
145	Mister Zehn said you were like a son to him, or a younger brother! He said he'd never forget you, as long as he lived!
146	I-I... I'm sorry. There's been some mistake. I'm not the person you think I am.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
147	Ahahahahahahahaha!
148	Mimi! Don't laugh at Mister Na Zhu. That's very rude.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0014
149	Mimi's never this cozy with strangers, so I'm pretty sure you're not one. There's only one Na Zhu, and you're him.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0011
150	I...!
151	Zehn said you showed Mimi mercy. You let her live.
152	I-I... But I...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0029
153	This is a bit exciting, isn't it? I must admit, I'm a little starstruck. It's like the picture book came to life!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
154	Y-you're wrong! I'm not... I don't deserve—!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
155	Papa! Hahaha! Papa! Papa!
156	Urgh... Nngh...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0019
157	I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry! If I could take it all back, I would!
158	Aha?
159	I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0036
160	The blade is chipped, the vessel cracked. The pariah will always be rejected and attacked.
161	It's all my fault! I ruined everything! I'm so sorry! I wish I could change it! I wish I could undo it all!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
162	Yet now they are full to bursting...
163	M-Mister Na Zhu?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
164	C-can I...stay with you?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
165	Really?! You wanna stay?!
166	That's...why I came here. I want to face what I have done.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0016
167	I'm going to remain faithful this time.
168	(I'm going to carry this sin around with me forever.)	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
169	I want to protect his family.
170	You'll help us? You really mean it?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0001
171	I do. I will. Please allow me to stay... Let me be useful to you!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0041
172	My skill at last finds the purpose for which it has been yearning.
173	Sure! If you're anything like you were in the story, you'll be an asset!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0038
174	The...story?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
175	Ila and I have been putting together a picture book, to preserve our memories of Zehn. We often do reenactments of the stories.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0004
176	Yep! They're just retellings of the stories Zehn used to share with us, but we're gonna use them to instill the samurai spirit in a whole generation of orphans!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
177	As the truth of all I am finds its place within my soul.
178	Aha?
179	What is it, Mimi?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
180	Ahahahaha!
181	...
182	Mitsu...
183	So...did you find out if there's a heaven, after all?
184	I did.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
185	It was the home I shared with you.
186	...
187	I'm sorry.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0035
188	The only reason I am yet able to laugh is because you held on to me.
189	...
190	So don't be sorry anymore.
191	I'm so glad I met you. I'm so happy we were able to celebrate your birthday together. I'm so lucky that you were the one I fell in love with, and who loved me in turn.
192	It was such a journey... The memories are so good, I still laugh to recall them now. I enjoyed our time together. Didn't you?
193	I did. Thank you, Mitsu. For everything.
194	I'm going to live on, for as long as I can. Wait for me. Watch over me.
195	Mitsu...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
196	Yes?
197	I...
198	Go on. Say it.
199	I'll always love you, Mitsu. In this life, and the next; even should I be reborn. My heart belongs only to you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
200	Hmhm. You could have been a poet, you know.
201	Live long, my love. Live long, and fill the world with the music of your laughter.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0002
202	I will.
203	No one can hurt you anymore, my darling.
204	And no one is going to forget you.
205	I... I'd like to hear some of these stories. May I?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
206	Hee hee!
207	After all...
208	Take a seat! The show's about to start!
209	Your story is at an end.
