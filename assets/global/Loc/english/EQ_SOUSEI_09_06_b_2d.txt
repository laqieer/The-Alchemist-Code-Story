001	Lucifer!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
002	Go, human child! The future you shall craft is the dream that we once dreamed!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0001
003	Mesarthim?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
004	Yes, I know.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
005	?!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0019
006	I shall be your opponent, Ophioneus.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
007	Matia. She who put in motion the sacrifice of the Sephira.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0003
008	You and Nidhogg both endorsed our goals.
009	We would take our shot at a god, and put our own lives on the line so the humans could have a proper chance to reach their full potential.
010	That was your purpose in creating the Sephira. Have you now forsaken those long-held beliefs?	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0020
011	I am, as always, an ally to the world's weakest. That is and always has been my role.
012	Then why do you raise your weapon in opposition to me? If you truly do fight on behalf of the weak...	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0002
013	Then I should take down Ouroboros? Is that it?
014	And what would that accomplish? She's crumbling even as we speak. I think you're failing to see the big picture here.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
015	What was it that you once said?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0002
016	"Humans will keep growing stronger with each generation as their history grows. One day, they will surpass us dragons."
017	I'm just testing the veracity of that statement.
018	Hot-headed fool. You're clearly just drunk on your desire for battle!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0021
019	I am what I am.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
020	Ahh, and how fortunate I am! I'm sure you'll make this worth my while.
021	Cursed Dragon, who once sharpened your cruelty and claws alike for the purpose of piercing through the Shell of the World...
022	It's been too long since I last hunted a dragon. I'm quite looking forward to this!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0011
023	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0028_a
