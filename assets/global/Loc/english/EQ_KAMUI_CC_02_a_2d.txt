001	Urgh... Where is this?
002	Oh! You're awake, Kamui!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0001
003	Agatha?
004	Wait! Logi! Logi, Kamui's awake!
005	What?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
006	Good. You were asleep for days. I didn't think we'd have a chance to talk before we left.
007	We're in Eos? Is everyone safe?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
008	Yeah, the civil war is finally coming to an end.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
009	Right now, Seriolde has stepped up as the heir apparent to the throne and is in charge of reconstructing the country as the next king.
010	Dias... I mean, the Holy Guard won't get involved in the kingdom's internal affairs anymore.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
011	I...see.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
012	If that's the case, then this country is about to change drastically.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	Ceclidis made a mess of this kingdom, burning its bridges to other nations and making its people victims of his ambition. I'm sure there will be more problems to come.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
014	But finally, I feel like some weight's been lifted off my shoulders.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
015	Yes, I know what you mean.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
016	We, the Blue Tongues, are planning to leave this kingdom once the situation calms down.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
017	Do you have any leads?
018	No. There's so much information I gleaned here that I'm still trying to sort through.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
019	If we are to stay true to our ideals, where do we go from here? What battles do we still have to fight?
020	Everything is still unclear to me.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
021	I see.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
022	What about you, Kamui? What are you going to do?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0003
023	Ah... I don't know. I didn't even expect to survive.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
024	But I suspect I will be leaving this place soon.
025	I still have some debts to settle.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
026	Then why don't you come with us?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0007
027	Logi?
028	I told you. I still have a lot to learn from you.
029	Besides, as long as we're trying to shed light on the darkness of this continent, we'll probably have to deal with the Sacred Stones again.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
030	When the time comes, I'd like you nearby so I won't make the wrong choice.
031	...
032	No rush. I'm planning to stay in this kingdom for a while.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0007
033	I'll come by to see you again. I hope you'll have an answer then.
034	Yeah...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
035	Leaving this kingdom, huh?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
036	Yeah... That's exactly what I want.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
037	But before I leave, there's still something I need to do...
038	A few days later...
039	Hm... It seems like I'm fully recovered now.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
040	...
041	As I suspected, Sephiron's blessing no longer rests upon me.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0022
042	From now on, I can't rely solely on Spiritbonding.
043	Alchemy... I must deepen my understanding of it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
044	...
045	Grrrrrrr...	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0021
046	The mayhem is over and the beasts are returning to their homes.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
047	But I'm afraid I don't have anything to quench your hunger.
048	I'm sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0039
