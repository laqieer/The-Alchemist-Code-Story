001	Ack! It's as resilient as ever. I don't think I can hit it!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
002	It seems to still remember our way of fighting. It's predicting my sword blows as well.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
003	In a small place like this, we can't make any unpredictable movements. What should we do? The way it is now, it's just like you said before.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
004	What's that?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
005	You told me that it's easy to dodge a straight-on attack. I guess that's especially true when it comes to machines.
006	Hahah. You idiots! This advanced technology has evolved this city! This is the power of our civilization!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0011
007	The time of the old mafia is over! I'll use the Messiah to rule all of Slothstein!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0023
008	You're trying to use humans to restore something that could be done with machines. Just watch what I do to your stupid—
009	Heh. You seem to be misunderstanding something. You're not using the Messiah. The Messiah is using you.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
010	What did you say?!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0013
011	You're a leech. All you did was trade me for this piece of junk. Not once have you stood on your own two feet.	VO_taras.taras_battle_0017
012	You...just keep talking! I'll...! Huh...? Wh-what's this?! My body is so heavy!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_sys_0043
013	Krchhh... Energy... Give...me...energy...
014	Are those lines of light sucking energy?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
015	It doesn't seem to learn, does it? It consumed enough energy to make its belly explode, but it still keeps eating.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
016	Aghh...ahh...I can't control...my legs... What's happening? What's going on?!	VO_mafia-c.mafia-c_battle_0025
017	I told you, didn't I? You were just being used by that piece of scrap.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
018	This is what you get for refusing to grow up. No matter how many times a leech conveniently changes its host, it'll never learn to walk on its own.
019	...!!!
020	Hey look, Edgar. These flat lines intersect vertically and horizontally...creating a three-dimensional effect.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
021	Of course, if lines intersect like that they...hold on...three-dimensional!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
022	Do you get my meaning?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
023	Yeah. It's a pretty crazy idea, but one worth trying!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
