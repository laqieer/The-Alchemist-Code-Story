001	N-no! Stay away!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0027
002	Hraaahhh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0002
003	Silma! You're not hurt, are you?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
004	S-Sis! Hng... Waaaaaah!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0019
005	It's all right. You're okay.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
006	Whenever I cried, my big sister would rush to my side. She protected me.
007	When our home was burned down while I was away in boarding school and I had nowhere to return to...she was there.
008	Even when the Shadow Messiah was still active, she was there for me.
009	She was my hero, my knight in shining armor, always prepared to swoop in and save me.
010	Just when I thought we could finally be together, I was so happy, and yet...
011	Lord Zahar... He's really...?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0020
012	Don't, Silma. He has entrusted me with this stone, the Guard Stone. That is all we need to focus on for now.
013	Holding it makes me feel...peaceful.
014	Sis...
015	Please. I would like to be alone.
016	Lord Zahar faded from this world, taking my hero's light with him.
017	Haa...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
018	I thought I'd climb a tree for the first time in a while, but I'm not enjoying myself at all.
019	Please. I would like to be alone.
020	Sis has always been there for me if I called for her...until now.
021	Silma.
022	Sis!
023	Sis...? What are all those bags for? Are you going somewhere?
024	I will leave the forest tomorrow. I need to learn all I can about what happened to Lord Zahar.
025	T-tomorrow?! But that's so sudden.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
026	Well, I'll still go with you, of course, but...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
027	Silma. I want to go alone.
028	Huh? Wh-why?
029	I'm sorry.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
030	Wh-what do you mean, you're sorry?
031	Why can't I go with you! W-we're finally together again!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0040
032	If you don't wait here for me, Silma, I'll have nowhere to come home to.
033	B-but...where are you even going?
034	I'm going to go find Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1003
035	S-Sis!
036	You know that the Holy Guard...!
037	...
038	Y-you could be killed!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0017
039	Even so...
040	I want to know. In fact, I need to know.
041	What about the forest?
042	I leave it to you. Please, Silma...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0041
043	Y-you're leaving me behind?
044	Forgive me.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0036
045	You're being stupid, Sis! The Shadow Messiah are no more!
046	...
047	Huh? Polyma? Minera? What's the matter with you two?
048	Wh-what?! Something's happening in the forest?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
049	Lead the way!
