001	Yup, yup. Looks like most of my powers have come back to me.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0032
002	That's good to hear. Are you sure your friend is in this village, though?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0008
003	Yeah, my Magic Sense is never wrong. Huh?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
004	...Something is happening down there.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
005	Let's check it out!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0005
006	Hgnh!	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_0007
007	Curses... Just one after another... When will this end?! If only I could use Hell Flare...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_0019
008	Tch!
009	Yah!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0005
010	?!
011	Haaahh!	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0007
012	Phew! That's the last of 'em.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
013	Who are you people? Identify yourselves!	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0002
014	We're friends, not foes. We're here to guide the little slime.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0003
015	The slime? Does that mean that...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0025
016	Benimaru!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
017	Rimuru! What are you doing here? Weren't you headed for the Kingdom of Ingrassia?
018	Hm...well... That was the plan, yeah... Someone else had a different plan for me, though. What about you?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
019	...I'm not sure. I was training at the forest edge, but before I knew it I was in this place.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
020	(It's just like Ouroboros said. The others were summoned to different locations. How annoying...)
021	But this is bad news. I can't feel my powers. It's like all the magicules in my body have left me.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0030
022	Do you know where we are? And who are the humans with you?	VO_benimaru.benimaru_chara_1007
023	Calm down, Benimaru. Let's assess the situation first.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
024	Have you had anything to eat since coming here?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
025	No, I haven't... I only just got here.
026	One of the villagers found me wandering the nearby grasslands and brought me here.
027	But then the village got attacked by all these monsters... There was no time for food.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0030
028	I see.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0004
029	Thank you all so much for protecting our village!
030	I feared for your life when you told me that you'd repay us for helping you by protecting the village from all those monsters! Though I suppose my fears were unwarranted.
031	I've prepared you all a meal as a sign of thanks. Please have as much as you'd like!
032	Oh? So that's why you were fighting those monsters all by yourself.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
033	...In the end I wasn't that much help. I couldn't fight like I could back in our world. It would've been the end of me if Rimuru hadn't come looking for me.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
034	Aw, it's no biggie. Besides, you just told me you hadn't eaten yet, right?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
035	What does that have to do with anything?	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0025
036	Well, we just got a bunch of food.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0010
037	Ah. Right.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
038	We can discuss things while eating. We can't let such a carefully prepared meal go to waste. Let's eat before it gets cold!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
039	Orcs?! But that's impossible...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0025
040	I'm afraid that's the only conclusion I can draw from Ouroboros' description. Orcs... No. An Orc Lord.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
041	She called us to this world to do something about it.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0030
042	But those orcs...
043	Hey, are orcs really that scary?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
044	An orc by itself is nothing to write home about, but things are different when an Orc Lord comes into play.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
045	The Orc Lord feeds off of the fear of its allies. It's got a tremendous and overpowering energy that makes the other orcs obey it.
046	Even a small number of orcs can devour an entire human village if they are led by an Orc Lord.
047	...Or a village of trained warriors. Like our Ogre Village.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_0019
048	...
049	Hmm, but here's the thing. We kinda already solved this whole orc problem back in our world.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
050	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
051	Rimuru already defeated the Orc Lord.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
052	After that, all the surviving orcs regained their minds and decided to live under Rimuru's rule.
053	Maybe one of them betrayed you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
054	The reason the orcs rampaged in our world is because they were starving due to a famine.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
055	But there isn't a single starving orc under the Jura Forest Alliance. They wouldn't have a reason to betray us. Besides...
056	I don't think the current leader of the orcs, Geld, would ever go back on his vow.
057	Yeah. Pretty much.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
058	I also think that something's up. Though I can't say what that might be yet.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
059	What we do know is that this village lies in their path.
060	No matter what the reason, we can't just overlook their actions!
061	Besides, the people of this village took care of my friend, so now I'll take care of them!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0007
062	Sounds about right. I'm in.
063	Are you feeling better?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
064	Yeah. It's just like you said, I feel much better after eating something. I won't perform so poorly again.
065	Good. I'm counting on you.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
066	(But I can't help but wonder about those orcs...)
067	...
068	What?	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0002
069	I'll join you on lookout duty.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
070	Those beasts are more active than usual. It'd be bad if they caught you off-guard with no back-up.
071	"He's still recovering, so he shouldn't overdo it." At least that's what Rimuru told me when he said I should come and join you.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
072	Rimuru saw right through me, huh? Seriously, I'm no match for that guy's perceptiveness...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0008
073	You really put your trust in that guy, huh?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
074	I wouldn't recognize him as my ruler if I didn't.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
075	Following the strongest is the way of life for us demonic beings... But that's not the only reason.
076	Rimuru forgave me after I pointed my blade at him in misunderstanding. He even granted me a name and a place to live.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_chara_1007
077	A name?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
078	There are many monsters without names in our world.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
079	Granting a monster a name makes them grow much stronger, but it also expends a significant amount of the namer's magicules.
080	Considering all of this, naming someone is a highly dangerous act.
081	Who would've thought that he'd perform such an act of benevolence towards those that had tried to kill him? That alone was plenty of reason for me to recognize him as my master.
082	I see. He forgave your past actions and instead welcomed you as a comrade.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0045
083	Rimuru appears to be a gentle man, someone who prefers to win without delivering any mortal wounds, much like what we practice in Sosenko, but...
084	What about you, Benimaru?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
085	I don't find it so easy to forgive those that robbed me of all the things that I held dear.
086	...
087	Do you hold a grudge against the orcs that wiped out your village?
088	You look like you know your way around a sword. Aren't you planning to take revenge?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
089	I'd be lying if I said that I didn't resent them at the start.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
090	But then...one of the surviving orcs—Geld—confessed to his mistakes. He was prepared to offer me his life in order to repent.
091	"Please, I ask that you take my head as penance and have mercy on my people." That's what he said.
092	...And what did you do?
093	I said, I will show no mercy to anyone who would harm us.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
094	But I also said, if you join the alliance and accept Rimuru as your leader, then you and I are not enemies.
095	Taking his life wouldn't bring back the people my village had lost.
096	Before I met Rimuru, I would've never forgiven them. I would've wanted to kill them. Give in to my weakness.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_0019
097	But the orcs said that they'd work for Rimuru's sake. Their strength and labor force is not inconsiderable, so they had a lot to contribute.
098	That's when I realized I couldn't just get rid of talented people because of my own grudges.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0003
099	I'm the Samurai General of the Jura Tempest Federation. I've got to put the country's interests first.
100	...
101	I dunno what kind of answer you were expecting from me here, but that's it. That's what I did.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0001
102	No, it's fine. It's a good answer.
103	Freeing yourselves from the shackles of the past and living for the future alone. That's...an incredibly strong way to live. It allows you to wield your sword without anything clouding your judgment.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
104	(Hey, Great Sage. Do you know why we're dealing with another Orc Lord?)	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
105	Answer: There is a possibility that the current orc army was brought to this world from a different point on the timeline.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0015
106	(So from the past then? How is that even possible?)
107	(But it would explain a few things. So I can't rule it out.)	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
108	(There's also a chance that the Orc Lord of this world isn't the same one I ate.)
109	(Great Sage, can you tell if it's a different one?)
110	Answer: It should be possible to analyze this matter once we are close enough to the Orc Lord.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0009
111	(I see... I guess we'll find out whether or not it's the old Geld then.)
112	Lost in thought?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
113	Albea!
114	I was surprised that you're a rather important personage, leading so many monsters by yourself.
115	Heh, I guess. I do lead the Jura Tempest Federation.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0007
116	The orcs are among my subjects, too.
117	That's why I've got to take responsibility if there really are orcs rampaging around this world.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
118	I can't afford to ignore this matter.
119	...
120	What is it? Something on my face?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
121	No, there isn't. Honestly, I'm not even sure where your face starts or ends.
122	You just reminded me of someone.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
123	Huh? Of who?
124	Someone who also had a strong sense of responsibility, who tried to shoulder all burdens by themselves. A very reckless person.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
125	That person knew I was alone as well.
126	Huh?
127	Rimuru. We're under attack.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_chara_1007
128	Ah!
129	Wh-what's wrong?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
130	We're under attack! Let's move!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0042
131	Benimaru, Creto!
132	Careful, Rimuru! These guys look riled up.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_battle_0019
133	I can tell. What made them come all the way out here?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
134	Answer: The orc army chased them out of their forest.	VO_daikenja.daikenja_sys_0015
135	(I see... Maybe we can still negotiate with them then.)
136	Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!	VO_Mlizardman.Mlizardman_battle_0028_a
137	...Never mind.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0030
