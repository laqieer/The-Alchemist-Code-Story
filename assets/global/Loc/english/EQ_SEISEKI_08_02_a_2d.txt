001	Not good! Victor, hurry up with the evacuation of the citizens!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
002	Understood!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
003	Ack! How could they launch an attack over such a short period of time!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
004	It's not just their unified leadership...their capabilities are on a whole other level!
005	Huh...?! Yikes! Commander Chloe, we're surrounded!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
006	Oh dear! Victor, dodge it!!!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
007	Huh...?! Wh-whoa!!!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
008	Uh...? H-huh?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
009	It seems like we're destined to be together, little frog.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
010	Basheeny...?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
011	Dyaaaaahhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
012	Huh...?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
013	Pay attention to the walls as well, Chloe. Their swords can easily pierce the average wall.	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0010
014	Captain Monzein!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
015	The situation is more serious than expected. Still, don't worry...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
016	From here you have the support of us the 2nd Regiment. Let's reverse the tide of this battle!
017	Y-yes!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
018	Hurrah!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0046
019	Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe has joined us. He has the strength of 100 men! Look out, you scum of Greed Dike!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
020	That being said...I get it when it comes to the little frog, but I'm surprised to see someone as adept with the sword as you being chased into a corner.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
021	Do you think they're using prototypes again?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
022	Prototypes...? Oh, you mean that immortal warrior?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
023	I knew it...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
024	We'll find out the details ourselves. You did well here.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
025	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
026	You've managed to successfully merge with the Scarlet Flame Guard. It's your duty to report that to Kanon, right? Come on, go on then.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
027	Huh...?! Wait, hold on! My duty is to intercept Greed Dike along with the 2nd Regiment...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
028	There's no need for that anymore. We've got enough help here. Go on and get out of here.
029	Are you still...upset about my past?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0022
030	Of course I am, idiot!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
031	Spies are the lowest of the low. Fighting by your side goes against my code of chivalry! Now leave!
032	I told you, that was in the past! I've chosen to believe in Commander Kanon!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
033	Shut up! Get out of here!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
034	Seriously, I can't believe Kanon. Why would she send a guy like that with me?! I can't even focus on battle with someone who's such a liability lurking about.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0030
035	Hmph! Who are you calling a liability?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
036	I'm talking about you possibly betraying me to Greed Dike!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
037	Are you gonna say that to my face?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
038	Tsk... No matter how much I try to explain it to him, he doesn't even attempt to listen.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
039	This is why I hate working with people! You stupid boar.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
040	I heard that! I heard that just now! You called me a stupid boar!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
041	I'm sorry, but I follow Commander Kanon's orders not yours!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
042	What did you say?! You scum!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
043	Commander Chloe...he seems to be upset over something.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
044	U-um...right now isn't the time for this.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
045	Ugh...!!!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
046	Captain Vettel!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
047	H-here they come! Those immortal creatures!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
048	Stay away! They're not people you can stand up against!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0023
049	Just as you say, they're special beings. Leave this to me please!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
050	Idiot! How can I leave it to the likes of you! Stand back!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
051	Banishment!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
052	Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
053	Whoa?! Th-that's impressive! You blew those immortal creatures away!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
054	Is that...Captain Monzein?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0046
055	Yes! The 2nd Regiment of the Holy Guard has come as backup!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
056	You scum! I told you not to get in my way! Didn't you hear me?!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
057	What are you saying?! Now is obviously not the time for that!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
058	They seem to be fighting about something...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
059	No...there isn't anyone more reassuring to have as support than Captain Monzein!	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
060	Captain Vettel! It's been a while. I'm glad to see you're well.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
061	You saved us. I appreciate your support from the bottom of my heart.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0033
062	Not at all. I'm honored to be able to help out an old friend of Captain Cadanova.
063	Enough with the formal greetings. What is the current situation? Is the royal castle safe?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0035
064	The thing is...	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
065	...Captain Vettel!!!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
066	That was close! Thanks, Chloe.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
067	These creatures! They're still standing up even after being hit by my attack?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
068	...?! Wait, where's the other one?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
069	Little frog, behind you!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
070	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
071	Victor! Run!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
072	Wh-wha...?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
073	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
074	They're still unfinished products...having not reached their full potential yet. You're lucky they're still capable of dying.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
075	...! You...?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
076	I am Fung Liu. I am what you call...a completed version of them.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_chara_1024
