001	...?
002	What's the matter, Kagura?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
003	I felt like I just heard Kudan's voice.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
004	We don't have time. Right now we need to focus on reach the Mikaboshi.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
005	...Yes.
006	Ack...!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
007	Stop. Kagura, get down.
008	Huh? Oh...okay!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
009	Embrace the light that guides the world...Rising Sun!!!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0024
010	Wo-wow!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0024
011	Kagura...you don't have to fight. Save your energy for your mission ahead.
012	I know. My Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi is the key to destroying the Mikaboshi.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
013	As the last survivor of the royal family...this is the destiny that I must fulfill.
014	I'm sorry...for putting you through all of us this.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0018
015	Huh?
016	Kagura...are you in love?
017	Lub? Love?! Wh-wh-what are you talking about?! And at a time like this!
018	Someone around your age would usually be falling in love and enjoying life.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
019	They'd be making friends with those around their age...enjoying themselves to their heart's content. That would usually be the case.
020	Huh? What's the matter, Lord Zain?
021	I am suffering from my own lack of strength.
022	I can neither remove your destiny...nor take your place. I feel so helpless.
023	What are you saying? You're my sun, Lord Zain.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
024	Your sun...?
025	When my family was killed and my country destroy...I was trapped in the depths of despair...and all I could do is cry.
026	But...Kudan rescued me from there. And you, Lord Zain, engulfed me with your warm light!
027	The two of you gave me back my strength to live! That's why you don't have to worry...
028	I see. I didn't know that. Honestly, if Cadanova could hear how weak I sound right now, he'd laugh at me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0033
029	Hehe...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
030	...?! Kagura, get down!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
031	Huh...? Whoa?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
032	Ack...! Now that we're getting closer to the Mikaboshi...the goblins here are on whole other level!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
033	Lord Zain! I don't think I...!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
034	No! I will not let you quit!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
035	Ill Atmosphere!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0010
036	What's this...?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
037	How rare. I can't believe I got you in the back, Lord Zain. Are you getting old?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
038	What?! Y-you coward! Don't say such rude things to Lord Zain!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
039	I'm sorry, Lord Zain...I'm late, but I got here.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0035
040	You guys...! Oh dear...I guess you've saved me.
041	I'm sorry for being late. Oh, this...! Before I forget, here's that thing we discussed.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
042	Ah! Good job. How is the quality?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0024
043	Seriously, my schedule was so hard...and, half way through, I was just coming up with one disaster after another.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
044	So it's quality...well, it's great.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
045	Huh...what is that?
046	In the case that someone thing bad were to happen...it's the last means to protect your life.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
047	Huh?!
048	Let's just hope that you won't have to use it. More importantly, where is everyone else?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
049	I think they'll catch up after us, but...there was a lot happening?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
050	A lot happening?
051	How can I put it? Well...some how Kudan heard about it...and he showed up.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0046
052	Kudan...?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
053	Captain Yauras is holding him back down there, but...
054	Well...he is up against the Holy Guard's strongest swordsman Captain Yauras...so let's just hope he gives up and goes home.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
055	I'm sorry...but I don't give up that easily.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
056	?!
057	Kagura...I've come to save you.
058	Kudan?!
059	You...?! What happened to Yauras?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
060	Argh...that woman... If she hadn't come at me with all her strength, I would've held back.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
061	Don't tell me...did you...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0021
062	Lord Commander...I want to ask you...which is the real truth?
063	What...?
064	Is your aim really to destroy the Mikaboshi?
065	Or is it to obtain the Mikaboshi and use it to dominate the world?
066	Huh? What are you talking about, Kudan?! Of course not!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
067	Kagura, you don't understand that you're being placed in danger!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
068	You shouldn't be following this man blindly without having confirmed the truth!
069	Kudan, you imbecilic! What do you mean by that?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
070	If the Lord Commander were plotting something evil, who would stop him?
071	If he was planning to kill you just in case, Kagura...
072	There will no longer be any Kagutsuchi wielders in this world, and the ability to destroy the Mikaboshi will be lost forever!
073	How can you say that...?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0021
074	Kudan...is that something you thought of yourself?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
075	...What?
076	That worst case scenario...did someone put it into your head?
077	Sh-shut up! This is the path I thought of!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0011
078	We don't have time! You can talk later. Let's go, Kagura!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
079	Tsk!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
080	Ack! Wait, Kudan!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
