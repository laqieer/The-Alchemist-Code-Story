001	Ramses! Are you okay?! We need to get back and tend to your wounds...	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0018
002	No. We haven't gotten enough of the mineral yet.	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
003	As the Successor of the Sun, there is no way that I can withdraw until I have completed your request in its entirety!
004	But...oh!	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_battle_0026
005	Screeech!
006	Here they come again. They don't learn, do they?! I won't back down!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
007	I must always remain strong! For I am the Successor of the Sun!
008	You've taken out all those monsters instantaneously! When did you get so strong...?	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0026
009	I must be worthy of my role. That is all.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
010	Come on. Let's gather up the mineral and return! Hurry up and paint my portrait! I'll take back as much of it as you need!
011	...Yes! Let's do that!	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0004
012	Oh?! So, you've completed my portrait.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
013	What do you think? Isn't it beautiful?	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_chara_1004
014	Thanks to your assistance in gathering the glowing paint, it's turned into a wonderful portrait.	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0033
015	You're right! This beautiful color is perfect for me!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0024
016	(More than the color of the paint, I wanted Ramses to compliment the radiance emitting from the portrait itself...)	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0029
017	Heheh. Quite brilliant. I will continue to grow stronger so that I can be worthy of this portrait.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0023
018	...Ah. So, you do understand.
019	Hm? What's that?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0005
020	Heheh. Nothing. Please, do assist me if I run out of paint again.	VO_sheherazade.sheherazade_sys_0007
021	Tsk... Only if I have time! I'm the Successor of the Sun. I'm busy!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1002
