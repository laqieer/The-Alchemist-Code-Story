001	This is where it ends for you, Venus Dota Lustburg.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
002	All your soldiers have scattered. Choose once and for all now. Surrender or die here.
003	Di-Dias, wait!
004	What are you saying? I still have a solider right here!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
005	I told you, didn't I? Right now, I am a single witch. I am a single warrior who is fighting for my country!	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0016
006	You gotta be kidding, right?! We're already exhausted over here...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
007	And now we're supposed to take on the strongest witch in this country?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
008	Hmm. So, you're still going to put up a fight. In that case, goodbye, queen of ice. If you're not going to melt, then I'll shatter you.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
009	Wait! Please! You can't kill her!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
010	What are you saying? Haven't you realized through all this fighting?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0040
011	Ideals don't matter once you're engaged in battle with your enemy. The time for seeking a dialogue is not on the battlefield.
012	It's true that each time I was nearly killed. I didn't want to die so I fought desperately.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
013	Because I was fighting, there was not time to talk...
014	Still, Salomo spoke while fighting. He told us about his sad past.
015	He told me that the Bugmail people use anger as their motivation to live.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
016	They told me that the court mages use fear to motivate themselves.
017	I think their rage and anger comes bumbling to the surface to mask their sadness.
018	They don't want to become sad by dying, becoming an insect, or separating from the one they love.
019	Because they want to run away from that sadness, the men and women fight to be separate from each other. They've forgotten that Asmodeus is the true cause of their sorrow.
020	When you fight, you cannot talk. When you die, you cannot talk. That's why I don't want to kill or be killed. If I hurt someone, I would at least like to heal them.
021	I want to get rid of the curse that is born from sadness. That is what I want Your Majesty to understand.
022	... ...
023	My words alone will be drowned out immediately. That's why, Your Highness, I would like the person who stands above the other witches to understand first!
024	You have only lived for 10 or so years. I have protected this country for over 200 years. Isn't it clear who is in the right?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
025	Please, no!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
026	If you believe that you are right, then show me after 200 years!	VO_venus.venus_favorite_0002
027	... ...
028	If I exceed you now, will you listen?
029	What...?
