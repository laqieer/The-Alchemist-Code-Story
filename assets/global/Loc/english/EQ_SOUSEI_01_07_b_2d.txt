001	Chief! Captain! Are the two of you all right?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
002	Yeah, we're fine. How are the villagers faring?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
003	We've managed to evacuate the majority. That is... Thanks to Yna Ku's assistance.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
004	Yna's...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
005	I borrowed your airship, Adaleigh. I hope you don't mind.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
006	Not at all. In fact, nice work.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
007	Adaleigh... Yna... You've both done so much for my people.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
008	W-well, duh! Why wouldn't we help out?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0047
009	What reason do you have to be bashful? I am the one who actually orchestrated the evacuation.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
010	Sh-shut up!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
011	What do you intend to do next, Nimul?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
012	...
013	(Slaying the Guardian Dragon... Preventing the revival of the Cursed Beast...)
014	(Eradicating sin from this world... Changing it for the better...)
015	(This is my chance to do it all.)
016	(Just as I told the Godwolf Asena, I have already taken my first step toward the reformation of this world.)
017	What the...?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
018	Oh, no... The divine protection of the Guardian Dragon is fading from the village!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
019	Already?!
020	The Great Nidhogg's divine protection...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
021	Oh, Chief...! Is this further punishment for our sins?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
022	We depended so heavily on Sephiron...and now her wrath, and the wrath of the Great Nidhogg, descend upon us!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
023	Does the All Mother turn on us?! Does the world itself want to tear out our throats?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
024	Wh-what's that?!
025	Look at the sky!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
026	What the hell is that thing?! It's huge!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
027	Guardian Dragon...Nidhogg.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
028	It is...colossal. And its scales have turned black as tar.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0020
029	Where's the airship?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
030	It's already taken off!
031	N-no...! The villagers!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
032	Th-there's nothing we can...!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
033	No!
034	There is something we can do. There's something I can do!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
035	From nothing comes infinity, and from infinity arises infinite light!
036	From the infinite light the crown emerges, and the crown begets wisdom...
037	What is this chant?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
038	From wisdom comes understanding, from understanding comes mercy, from mercy comes severity, from severity comes beauty, from beauty comes victory, from victory comes glory.
039	Glory is the foundation, and upon the foundation does the kingdom form! With hidden knowledge in hand, heed my voice!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
040	The Great Nidhogg...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
041	It's changed direction.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
042	Where is it headed?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
043	North... Toward the Great Forest of Suga. No one...lives there, at least.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
044	Your efforts have bought us some time, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
045	...
046	Emmel... What—?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
047	N-Ni...mul...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
048	Emmel? Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0019
049	Hold on, Emmel!
050	I-I think I...used up...too much...p-p...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0043
051	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
052	L-Lady Emmel!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
053	She has merely fainted. Hardly a surprise, given that she expended so much power.
054	(Why? Why is this happening?!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
055	(Why does Emmel have to suffer?!)
056	(This world is all wrong... It must be destroyed. I must put an end to it all!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0021
057	(I will change the world... No!)
058	(I will remake it. I am going to remake this world!)
059	Urrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
