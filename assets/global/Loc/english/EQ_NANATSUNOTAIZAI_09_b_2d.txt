001	I've had enough.
002	I should have taken care of you earlier.
003	...?!
004	Die.
005	Ah...
006	So this...is how I die.
007	In some unknown place outside of Britannia.
008	My will shall be carried out by the others. I know this.
009	Still, I...
010	I wish I could've seen you again.
011	Meliodas...
012	Wha—?
013	No...!
014	M-Meliodas?
015	Yo, Elizabeth. Good work holding out for this long!
016	This fight...
017	It was won by you, who believed in me to the end.
