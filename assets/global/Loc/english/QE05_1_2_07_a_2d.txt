001	It looks like you have decided.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0044
002	Yes, Chief. I would be honored to take on the role of Protector.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
003	Heh. You really are just like Judah. Now then, it is time for your trial.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
004	"I am the one who shall accept the crown. The arboreal vessel lies within Sephiron's boundless embrace."
005	Th-that is...Alchemia in a humanoid shape? Like a Phantom?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
006	This is Spiritbonding! A secret technique that can be wielded only by one such as yourself, one with the decimum sephirah.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0037
007	A technique in which you summon forth Phantoms to do your bidding!
008	Phantoms?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
009	I was never any match for Judah, so this is my limit. You should be able to do much more.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0016
010	Now, show me what you can do, Kamui! Show me what Judah saw in you!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
011	Nngh!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
012	(This is the secret technique of Spiritbonding?! What? How do I...?)
013	Wait a second...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
014	(I do know how to do this, somehow...?)
015	(No, it is the decimum sephirah... My body is following its inherent memories!)
016	Very good, yes! Now, go!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0005
