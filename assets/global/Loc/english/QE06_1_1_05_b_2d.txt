001	Huff... Huff...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
002	Come on. There's no time to be tired.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
003	I know that! Rrraaaaah!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
004	Grraaaaaaaarrggghh!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0028_c
005	...
006	Azami!	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
007	Hey, we're in the middle of a trial here. Didn't anyone tell you?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
008	It's been going on long enough. If they can't defeat the demon after all this time, they shouldn't be allowed to pass.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0030
009	That's Ugachi's right hand for ya. Strength is everything, eh?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
010	But I'm the proctor this year, so I'll be the one making the decision.
011	You're too soft on them.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
012	Looks like you could use some brushing up yourself.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
013	Well, hello there, Captain Ugachi. You're looking handsome as ever.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0044
014	You'd better watch that attitude of yours.
015	If you're the proctor this time around, I suppose we can't expect much from recruits this year.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
016	If we left it to your standards of strength alone, we wouldn't ever have new recruits.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
017	Why recruit so many if they'll only end up dead? How about we retrain your feeble Third Squad?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
018	Who cares which squad defeats the most demons? Don't you think it's more important that we can protect those we meant to protect?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
019	You've always been a smart aleck. Let's go, Azami.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0017
020	Yes.
021	Azami!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
022	You should forget about becoming a member of the Blade Fox.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
023	Huh?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
024	If you can't even handle a demon like this one, you don't belong here. It's too late to regret anything once you're dead.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0030
025	But...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
026	I'll cut down your share of demons in your place. That's all there is to it.
027	Azami!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
028	Well, that was severe. Is she like that at home too?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0027
029	Azami moved into the dorms recently, so...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
030	To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!
031	To bring about blissful days of joy!
032	With our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!
033	Azami...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
034	All righty then. Let's go home.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
035	Huh?	VO_amane.amane_chara_1006
036	We got rid of all the demons. I see no reason to stick around here anymore.
037	A-and the trial? How did I do?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
038	Hm. Let's talk about that once we're back home.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
039	...!
