001	You sure held your own out there! The name's Kevin; pleased to meet you. And this here is—	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0044
002	I'm Ila. And you...are stronger than I gave you credit for.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
003	My name is Bell Cranel. Nice to meet you both as well.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
004	Likewise. We're your companions on this quest. And as long as we're around, you should think of us as friends, too.
005	"Friends"? Speak for yourself!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
006	Umm...
007	Don't worry about her. Come time for battle, she'll have your back either way. Our homeland is in peril, after all.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
008	I couldn't care less what happens to Wratharis, frankly.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
009	Though I suppose...
010	You...suppose?
011	I suppose there are some things here worth protecting.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
012	I'd hate it if any children had to suffer because of this fight, for example.
013	And there you have it! Calling it now: Us friends are gonna get along great.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
014	Hmph! I can't stand it when you talk like that.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
015	Acting all buddy-buddy as soon as we meet anyone at all, instantly calling them "friends"...
016	My only friends are the ones I made long ago.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
017	Oof! Well, sor-ry.
018	That being said, let's try to start off on the right foot, shall we? Thanks for your help, Bell.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
019	And thank you for yours. I'm sure we'll get along great...is what I'd like to say, but I admit, I have a few concerns about that!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
020	Don't worry. I'm sure we'll naturally grow closer as we work together.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
021	So, that knife of yours... It's kind of intriguing. Does it have some kind of special power or something?
022	Yes, actually. This knife is a weapon gifted to me by a goddess.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0006
024	A knife bestowed by a goddess, huh? That's sure nothing to sneeze at!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0044
025	Yes, it's very—wait! My goddess!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
026	Huh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
027	Oh, sorry. The person who summoned me here said she called for additional help from my world, and it dawned on me that she might mean my goddess, which would be worrisome.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0035
028	If she were summoned here to help, then she'd have to be pretty strong herself. What's the problem?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
029	Well, she can't...exactly fight, you see.
031	That's a strange way to put it. If she can't fight, though, then she probably wouldn't be summoned here to help, would she?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
032	I certainly hope not.
033	Hmm. Well, if this goddess of yours isn't the one joining our ranks, do you have any other ideas who it might be?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
034	It could be any of a number of my comrades from the Familia: Lili, Haruhime, maybe Welf or Mikoto...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
035	Oho! A lot of those sound like girls' names. Seems I've got something to look forward to!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
036	And just what might that be?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
037	Regardless of who it is, they're not safe here alone.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
038	That's true. We can't just stand idly by when a girl is potentially in danger!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
039	Not to mention the fact that gaining yet another friend will bolster our strength in battle.
040	I am not a friend to either of you.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
041	Traveling companion, then. Better?
042	Hmph.
043	Not the best start to this adventure, is it?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
