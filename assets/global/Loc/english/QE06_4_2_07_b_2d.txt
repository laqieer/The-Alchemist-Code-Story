001	Mind if I cut in?!	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0001
002	Ngh... What?!
003	Jubei!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
004	Sorry it took me so long.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0035
005	That blade... It worked, then?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
006	Yeah. I owe you one, Ugachi.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
007	Forget about that right now. Let's just keep those two safe until they come out of their trance with Kagutsuchi in tow.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
008	Give me...that blade.
009	And just what do you want it for?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
010	Something about it feels familiar.
011	Does it, now?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
012	Ever since I awoke, I've had this strange sensation. What is it that I wanted to do? What is it that I must protect?
013	I feel like if I had that blade, I might remember.
014	So don't get in my way.
015	Agh...	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0022
016	Looks like Tanosuke was right. Tamba doesn't wish for humanity's destruction. Not completely.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
017	Fools!
018	Why else would he seek out his own horn? He wants to return what he's lost, because he's lost sight of what he wishes to protect.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
019	No! You will stop talking, now!
020	If this is what you desire, then we are not the ones you should be targeting. But you already know that...don't you?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
021	...
022	Don't you see how they're using you? They're pitting us against each other for their own gains! Why are you still helping them?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0042
023	You talk too much.
024	If that sword is truly forged of my horn, then I would gladly kill you all to reclaim it.
025	Ngh...!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
026	!!!
027	Those wounds are quite deep. It's surprising you're able to move as readily as you do...and baffling, as to why you'd bother.
028	Compared to getting one's arm cut off, this is little more than a scratch.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
029	Besides, if I can't get you to open your eyes, Tanosuke won't ever be able to come back here for me to chew him out!
030	So I can't very well afford to be defeated here!
031	Captain, think of your wounds! Leave this guy to us.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
032	I don't care about my wounds. I will not be held down. Not by some fool who's lost sight of the things he wants to protect.
033	Very well. Then you shall be the first to fall this day.
034	Don't you go forgetting about me, now!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0010
035	Curses!
036	Hyaaaaaaah!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_battle_0007
037	Tch!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
038	I grow bored of these childish tactics of yours. Let's end this!
039	Gahh... No...!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0043
040	(He's got us entirely outclassed... No, wait. The difference in strength between us isn't that great. Rather...)
041	(The problem is that our attacks aren't entirely landing. We'll get nowhere at this rate.)
042	Come on, Logi. Get back here soon! We need you!
