001	Hear that noise? The beasts are in a frenzy.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
002	Looks like there was an Alchemia explosion around here.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
003	The beasts must sense the presence of an outside threat, and it's got them all riled up.
004	But that could mean we just have to go to where the beasts are making a racket, and we'll find whatever it is that's popped in here from Bell's world.
005	That's the second time I've heard Alchemia mentioned now. What is it, exactly?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
006	Huh? Oh, it's kinda like the source of power in this world.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
007	Ila and I were actually summoned here by the Alchemia. "Phantom Soldiers," we're called.
008	Summoned? Summoned from where?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
009	We're dead.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
010	Dead, but granted bodies as Phantom Soldiers so we can exist physically once more. That's how we're able to be here talking to you now.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
011	And fight in battle, of course! As you saw earlier.
012	The two of us were summoned here specifically, in fact. This world may have already moved on after our deaths, but neither of us can just stand aside and do nothing when somebody threatens it again.
013	And I swear to you, I won't let any girls cry even a single tear. Not on my watch!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
014	Ugh, I really can't stand you.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
015	Oh, so Bell, how about you tell us a little about yourself, too?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0003
016	Well, in my world there's a huge labyrinth people just call the dungeon, sprawling deep underground. Those who dare venture into the dungeon are called adventurers, and I'm one of them.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0006
017	What kind of monsters are there in that dungeon? That's the sort of info that might clue us in on what's happening here now.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
018	I was on one of the middle floors when I got transported here. The one monster type that poses the biggest threat in that part of the dungeon would have to be minotaurs.
019	How strong are they?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
020	They're not exactly weak, but at my current level, I wouldn't normally think of them as anything to worry about, either.
021	Then what makes them the biggest threat?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
022	Well, the figure who brought me here said this threat was absorbing that...Alchemia stuff. And there's no telling what a minotaur imbued with energy from another world might be capable of.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
023	...
024	Still, however strong it may be, there's no enemy we can't beat if we work together as comrades—as friends!
025	Oh, great. Another sunshine-and-roses type. Just what I needed.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
026	Scoff if you'd like, but the friends I have in my Familia mean everything to me.
027	Comrades working together, facing challenges together, overcoming them together, and helping push each other forward through thick and thin—that's what being an adventurer is all about!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
028	Hmph.
029	Being an adventurer sounds pretty great to me!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0044
030	It's the best! The person I look up to most in the whole world is an adventurer, too.
031	Oh? Are they why you chose this path, then?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
032	No, um, actually...the reason I became an adventurer is so I could pick up girls.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
033	I'm sorry, what?
034	See, my grandpa told me that a real man should always strive to get himself a harem...
035	Ah, I see! Not the worst advice, and if you can make a lot of girls smile, that's wonderful. But I dare say in a harem, you're bound to make some cry instead.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0011
036	Unbelievable. You're just as bad as he is. I can't stand you, either!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
037	Wait, no! It's not like that!
038	Ah...	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
039	Uhhh...
040	That noise... It came from over there!	VO_bell.bell_battle_0019
041	That's the way Ila went. She might be in trouble!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0042
042	Now's your chance to redeem yourself to her.
043	Do you think I even can?! She seems pretty set in her ways.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
044	I certainly hope so!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
