001	Tch! I thought we'd already taken care of those two!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
002	Ambrosia's in danger! If they're using Space-Time Manipulation, then we should be there to help!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
003	No, Mira. We can't.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0040
004	Nyx! Why?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
005	That those two are here can only mean Asmodeus is close by.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
006	If the Cursed Beast shows up before the magic rod is ready, we have no way to face it.
007	We need to be here, doing our part in this plan! Nobody else can!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
008	Nyx is right. We have to focus on getting the magic rod Libra ready.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
009	That is what we must do to help the others out there.
010	But Ambrosia was wounded so badly by them last time!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
011	If she gets hurt again... If she were to die...
012	If that happens... I-I...!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0020
013	Mira...
014	She'll be okay.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
015	What?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
016	Nimul said... My friends said to leave it to them!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
017	So I'm going to do what they expect me to be doing! I know I can trust them!
018	...Okay. I'll trust them too. So, what do we have to do?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
019	The old man and I are going to fire up the reactor.
020	But it's going to take time. I need you two to prepare the magic rod to be connected.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
021	It's all a race against time! I can do this! I can definitely do this!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
022	I'll show everyone what an engineer from the Acedia Belt Region can do!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0032
023	Over there!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
024	Asmodeus... You've summoned a replication of my apprentices again, I see. I take it you've grown attached to them.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0044
025	Hah, well, they are my apprentices. With a teacher like myself, I'd be more surprised if they weren't excellent!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
026	Now is not the time to be bragging! We cannot let it damage the airship more than it already has!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
027	I know, I know. Let me show you the true powers of a witch of this region.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
028	Space-Time Manipulation, activate! For I am the life that devours the fruit of the Holy Spirit! I am the one who embraces the seven virtues!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0032
029	...?!	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_battle_0019
030	What the...?!	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0025
031	Nng! Something is being pulled out of us...! This is...our essence?!
032	What have you done, Ambrosia?!	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_battle_0022
033	Hah, you dare call me by my name? Still feeling chummy with your teacher after all that you've done?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
034	Well, shall I explain, friend? It's very simple.
035	You two are nothing more than concentrated aggregations of the possibility contained within my true apprentices, molded from the Cursed Beast's magil.
036	From your head to the tip of your toes, you are vulnerable to my Anti-Lust magic.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
037	But this is... If that's true, why didn't you use this in the last battle?!	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0027
038	Indeed, you really kept me on my toes the last time. When I was fighting you, I'd already spent almost all of my magil to get one good hit in on Asmodeus.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
039	But now, I am fully recharged. Undoing your being is child's play to me now.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
040	(Well, honestly speaking, I wouldn't be able to keep this up for long without Libra's support.)
041	Argh...!
042	This is it, younglings! Quickly, while I have them pinned down!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
043	Let's go, Waginau! We will defeat them now and remove them from the equation!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
044	Right! Let us repay our debts from our last encounter!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
