001	No good. We're boxed in on all sides.
002	I've never expected any of my targets to simply lay down and take orders, but one can always hope.
003	Of course, if you aren't able to run in the first place...
004	That won't be necessary.
005	They won't be leaving anytime soon. They'll wear out soon enough.
006	Your efficiency has ever been a boon, Grimm. I'll take over from here.
007	Who...
008	Eliza...the mastermind behind the attack on Roxanne's manor, and leader of the Slothstein Branch.
009	You've done your homework, that much is apparent.
010	We couldn't have been carried far. Where is this?
011	The deepest level of the branch. The facility's bowels, if you will...but we made sure it was just outside of Slothstein.
012	Borders extend underground too, you know. We have enough rats sniffing around as it is.
013	How did you find out about Lachesis and the Elylon Teg?
014	I doubt you're using her powers for charity.
015	That's not your concern. You should be more worried for your friends if they choose to resist.
016	Eira is integral to Goetia's plans...as are you. Notice how little it takes for us to come to an agreement?
017	Unless you'd rather have us search in vain for an alternative, in which case I suppose we will procure as much Alchemia as is needed to wake Lachesis.
018	Slothstein's full of rats we can use.
019	You're playing with fire.This will never end well!
020	Zheng Yi's ambitions failed because the Constructs cannot differentiate good or ill!
021	I don't need a lecture from you of all people!
022	A shame you don't see things our way. You are so adamant on undoing all of your past work, and all for what?
023	Some twisted sense of responsibility?
024	You don't even remember your creations. You've already relinquished your right to dictate what others should do with it.
025	...!
026	I...
027	That's a blatant lie and you know it.
028	No matter what he did and who he was in the past, he remains the sole creator of these Constructs.
029	Lachesis herself called out to him. What better evidence is there regarding his authority over them?
030	Enough. I've no time to be philosophizing.
031	Queen. Have your men locate the fugitives and demand they hand over Eira.
032	The heavy metal door at the far end suddenly slides open.
033	...What...?
