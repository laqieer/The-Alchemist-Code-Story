001	Umm, our victor today is—
002	Nobody cares!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
003	Why don't you just give the trophy to that boy who sat there and gazed glassily on as the kitten and I fought?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
004	Wha— How rude! You may be of noble descent, but that does not mean you can do whatever you please!
005	Yeah, this is unacceptable! You can't just barge your way in and take over like this!
088	Just look at you! Absolutely covered in blood. Not a hint of elegance in your fighting style!
006	I am not the inelegant one here.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0016
126	Inelegance is deciding the worth of one's emperor through something as crude as this sham of a tournament.
007	What power is there is such low-stakes combat? Your poison cup is empty; you're just playing house. None of this matters.
008	Might. Makes. Right. That is the law of this land. Can't you even understand that much?! And to think, we're all of the same bloodline!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
009	Do you think the Sacred Stone Mammon would accept a people who can't understand such a basic tenet of life in Greed Dike? Something so fundamental?!
010	...Well? Do you have anything to say?! Show me what you've got. I'll fight each and every one of you if you'd like!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
011	...!
012	...
013	Pitiful.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0030
014	The image of her walking away burned itself into my half-conscious mind that day.
090	She knew Mammon was torturing me, and she was testing the extent of that torture. Yet in spite of it all, I found myself captivated by her intensity.
091	While her strength differed from my ability to tolerate despair, as long as she maintained her focus, she stood to become a barrier that must ultimately be crossed.
016	Well, aren't you a glutton for punishment? Are your wounds feeling better, at least?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0004
092	Yes, thankfully.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
093	Have you come to silence me? I hate to break it to you, but I'm the stronger between us, so you're not going to be able to accomplish much.
017	I just want to know how you found out.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
094	About Mammon's affection for you? Or about how you don't use your whole strength because your life force is being constantly sucked away?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
018	If you know all that, then you should also know that fighting me is meaningless.
019	So why couldn't you just leave me alone?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0012
020	Isn't it obvious? Because I don't like things the way they are.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
021	What?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0025
095	I don't care for the fact that you're what it wants most. And yet you do nothing in response, even though you're its favorite. You just sit back and let it feast on you.
096	...You're one of Mammon's favored too, aren't you?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0031
097	I'm just a backup. Above the riff-raff, but frustratingly, below you.
022	If we just leave things as they are, someone will kill off all the other successors sooner or later, leaving only the two of us. You've been targeted numerous times yourself, I presume, so you know this to be true.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
023	...
024	But Mammon would never let you die. It's clear after our fight that you truly are the favorite. That's why you're still here.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
025	Such a shame not to take advantage of the hand you've been dealt. Luckily for you, the other successors haven't realized your little cheat.
098	It's no surprise, though. Who would ever imagine that someone displaying not even the bare minimum of pride, or even a will to live, could be Mammon's favorite?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0016
099	Or, as I am to understand it, one who yearns for travel to foreign lands he is forbidden to enter, yet who can't even work up the courage to take the first step out of these gates.
026	Ngh... You don't understand anything!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0016
027	Ha! Perhaps I don't. But I want that strength you can't handle more than anything.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
028	...
029	Power is all that matters in this land. You get at least that much, don't you?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
030	...So, I take it you researched me, then?
031	I researched everyone. I will do whatever it takes to get my hands on Mammon.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
033	But why? Why would you go to such lengths? Why does it mean so much to you?!
034	Have you ever been nearly sold by your father?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0003
035	What?! By His Majesty?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0025
036	"Your destiny was decided the moment you were born a woman." That's what he told me.
037	What he wanted for me was that I become the wife of some noble in a foreign land.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0029
100	But those noble types bore me to tears, so I kicked them to the curb and decided to go after the throne myself instead.
038	Defying His Majesty's will is not the smartest idea.
039	Maybe not. But it's that determination that won me special entry as a successor, and led me to become a top contender. Not that that actually means anything.	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0019
042	Ngh...
043	Tell me. If you find your position so distasteful, why not just disavow it? Why not throw it away?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
101	Having no power means losing your family. It means fighting your brothers and sisters. It means losing everything, simply for what you don't have.
102	That's why I aim to become Empress and change this land. With just these two hands, I will make this a land of absolutes. No more half-measures.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
044	...!
045	I could choke you right here and now and see if that would kill you, you know.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
046	But there's no point. So I'll just let you go. I don't know what I can possibly do to make Mammon reconsider me as its favored one, anyway.
103	Besides which, you clearly still haven't recovered. And there's nothing to be gained by kicking a kitten when it's down.
047	There's no pleasure in killing those who've already given up living.	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0016
048	But know this: I won't back down for anyone. Anyone who tries to get in the way of my goal will be...expunged. The path I walk has no room to consider opposition.
104	You are strong. But that strength may one day bring pain to a lot of people.
049	That's why I seek the power to surpass you! Haaaa!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0032
050	I suppose this isn't enough to lure out Mammon, is it?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
105	Only when the host is near death, or...in other words, if his blood is taken by another...
106	Does that mean Mammon is unwilling to share even the smallest piece of its chosen host with anyone else?
107	That's true Greed... So, what more must I do to bring you out, then...?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0017
051	Curses!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
052	Well, now, that's quite the look you're giving me.
053	It'll be interesting to see if you stay a kitten under Mammon's control, or one day grow into a lion.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0008
054	Just leave me alone.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
055	No.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0039
108	Until such time as Mammon gives up on me completely, I will persevere!
056	You're...in my way.
057	Ha! How funny. Fine, then; how about this?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
058	When Mammon chooses me and I take the throne, I'll look you right in the eyes as I kill you.
059	I won't let that happen. I'll get stronger.
060	And why ever would you want to do that? Ahaha! I look forward to the attempt, little kitten.
061	For now, I think this'll do. You've got a long way to go if you want to kill me.
062	It's not over yet!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0016
063	You should have tried this hard from the start if you still have so much energy to spare!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
064	I hunt prey like a proud lion, and ring through the skies like a crash of lightning. Do you truly think you can kill me?
065	...! Gaaah!
066	Urk! Oough...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
067	Best not give up mewing for your supper just yet, kitten.
109	Ah! G-gah...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0022
110	Cheer up. You're not going to die. You have Mammon...remember?
111	But...the pain is...!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
112	Considerable, I imagine.
113	Aghh...!!!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0042
114	Cursed monster!
115	Ooh, someone's angry.	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0016
116	Ngh, ah...
117	Tell me how to transfer Mammon into myself.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
118	Even if I knew, do you really think I'd say?!
119	Wouldn't you? Why not?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0004
120	I am the only one keeping Mammon at bay. If I were to allow others to claim its power—and worse still, wield it—I can scarcely imagine the terror that would unfold.
121	Hmph. You really do fancy yourself the tragic hero, don't you?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
122	That title means nothing if you don't possess the power to back it up. Observe!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
123	What are you...?
124	Ghaaah!
068	Please...take your foot off me.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0016
069	You lost. Who are you to demand anything of me? Remember, might makes right around here. And I'm the one with the might.
070	Hooaaagh...
078	Tch. Just when I was getting to the good part. Who put you up to this?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0030
079	Though I suppose that doesn't make any difference. I've made more than my fair share of enemies.
125	Or are you looking for this kitten here?
080	Just shut up and die!
081	Get back. I can deal with this myself.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
082	Ooh, tough guy all of a sudden.
083	Look, I can handle it on my own, okay?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0010
084	I'm sure you can. But you have an ulterior motive here, don't you?
085	I... I want to be the one who kills you. Nobody else.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
087	Ha. Good answer, Orion!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
