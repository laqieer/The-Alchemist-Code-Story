001	We finally made it.
002	To the harbor? I know a lot of imported goods from other lands come here, but what exactly are you planning this time?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
003	About that... Oh, there it is! That's what we need!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0031
004	That's...
005	So this what you were thinking when I said foundation!
006	After seeing your reactions to my piece the other day, I did some thinking and made a new arrangement. Please take a look.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0003
007	Here I was wondering what kind of bizarre flowers you'd bring this time, but it seems you've used conventional ones. But this vase is...
008	Yes, I used one from a foreign land.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
009	A vase from another land... I tried to recreate an image of Wadatsumi floating within a wide world. What do you think?
010	So you've tried to part with tradition again by using a vase from another land. What are you trying to do?
011	Is this one unacceptable, too?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0016
012	...There's something weirdly intriguing about it. It's as if the otherworldliness of the vase is accentuating the elegance of Wadatsumi's flowers... I like it.
013	The contrast is drawing out a different beauty from our flowers.
014	N-now that you mention it, this odd unfamiliarity has its own charm.
015	Really?! Thank you!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0034
016	Phew. This one got a better reaction than my prior piece.
017	Hozuki! I saw it! Those everyday Wadatsumi flowers really went well with that foreign vase. It was really cute!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0002
018	Heheh, thanks.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
019	It'll take some time for them to understand the benefits of incorporating another land's culture in, but...
020	Yeah... But your piece was the first, big step in getting your fellow students to accept it!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0004
021	Right. Our culture was cultivated little by little over a long time. That's why, just like with this piece...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0004
022	If our people come to understand other cultures, our culture will also reach those other lands.
023	And then I'll be able to show people even more shinier, glorious things! Won't that be wonderful?	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0008
024	For now we'll just have to patiently build the foundation for that day.
025	I also realized I love Wadatsumi's culture more than anything else, too.
026	That's why I have to value the feelings of those who love Wadatsumi's culture just as much I do.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
027	Hozuki, you seem a bit happier. Like some of the stress has left your shoulders.
028	Okay! I want to be as strong as you! I'm going to write another book that'll wow you!
029	Ugh, please stop mimicking me! It's so embarrassing!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0047
030	But I'm glad your interest in books has come back.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0007
031	It was thanks to you that I could figure out a path forward. If you hadn't given me advice, I wouldn't have been able to clear this hurdle.
032	So let's continue to work hard and motivate each other as rivals.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0001
033	Yes, let's do it!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0004
