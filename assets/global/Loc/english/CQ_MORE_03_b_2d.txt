001	Phew... I'm glad we took care of them.
002	…
003	…Moa?	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
004	My dad must have become as hideous as those creatures…	VO_mor.mor_sys_1043
005	That's why mom couldn't be with him anymore, even though she loved him.
006	Moa…
007	That's why my mom hated me. I was the reason the person she loved became an insect…	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
008	That's why mom said she wished I had never been born…
009	If I made her feel that way, then I'd rather never have been born either.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0019
010	No. Don't say that. EVER!
011	I don't know exactly how your home life was…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
012	But your parents loved each other enough to have you. You were WANTED.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
013	…
014	When you meet the person you love, you go through stages of romance, fighting, making up and deepening your bond.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
015	Even if their love was doomed, they wanted to create a legacy…and that's why you're here.
016	…
017	Loving one another, they managed to survive long enough to have you.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
018	Your parents chose that path…as do many people in this country-- Even my parents.
019	…
020	…You know, there was a time I didn't know how to cope with it either.
021	Really?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
022	Uh-huh. When I learned that lovers were doomed to become insects, I felt so depressed.
023	I even cried alone…thinking happiness will never find a way to our land.
024	You looked like I did back then, so I thought I had to do something to help you.
025	For me, training helps drive away all those negative thoughts... I wanted you to experience that, too.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
026	Eve…
027	…
028	I'm sure even you don't want the person you love turning into an insect, right?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
029	Moa…
030	If that ever happened… Even you would probably start to hate your children, too.
031	You'll probably end up miserable…and yet… Why do you still--	VO_mor.mor_sys_0020
032	…
033	…Of course, there are people who can't cope with the curse.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
034	…But the moment you fall in love--it's the happiest time in your life. Anybody would agree!
035	At least, that's what my mom always says.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
036	Even my mom had a difficult time coming to terms with my dad's curse.
037	But it didn't matter. They wanted to have me no matter what.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
038	The reason I'm here is because of my parents' love.
039	That always cheers me up. That's why you should think that way too.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
040	…
041	…But you're right. I'd hate it if Fraise were to become an insect.
042	So, I've got to keep training!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
043	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
044	I thought I already told you! I've got to train to be a happy bride!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
045	I'm looking for a way to break the curse.
046	Is that why you don't want to commit to any organization…	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
047	Exactly. If I'm a free agent, I can find a way to break the curse on my own terms.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1023
048	I'll overcome all obstacles in my way to break that curse. But in order to do that, I need more strength.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
049	There's nothing I won't do in order to marry Fraise and build a happy family.
050	So, I train. Day in and day out! That's why I call it bridal training.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1020
051	…Isn't it a tad too sports-oriented?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
052	I mean, can you really break a curse with strength alone?
053	You don't think it'll work?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
054	It's not that…it's just the thought never occurred to me.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
055	But if anybody can use their muscles to break the curse, I'm sure it's you, Eve!
056	I guess that's what you mean by taking care of it on your terms.
057	It's not just me, either.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
058	Hm?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
059	Everyone in this country who has someone they care about is fighting the curse in their own way... To build a brighter future for our children--	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
060	…
061	…I wonder if my mom fought against the curse, too.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
062	She must have had me knowing that dad would turn into an insect…
063	I wonder if she had hoped to build a happy family.
064	…I'm sure she did.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1023
065	We're all fighting this thing…That's how Lustburg is still here.
066	…Yeah. You're right.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
067	(…Then I want to prove it.)
068	(I want to prove that we can beat this curse and build happy families across the land!)
069	…
070	Eve, starting tomorrow, I want to do the same training course that you do!	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
071	No way!? What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Are you a bridal trainee now?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
072	No…not a bridal trainee, a Cupid trainee!
073	I want to bring lots of people together and fill Lustburg with happy families!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
074	I'll take down the curse with brute force and restore happiness to our people.
075	(If I succeed, then maybe I'll find the reason I was born…)
076	There's nothing I can't do in order to achieve my goal!
077	I'll overcome even the harshest training! Just wait and see!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
