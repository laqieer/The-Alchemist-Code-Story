001	Come on, Mimi! Sit properly.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
002	Be a good girl, now. Look! Mister Cuddles is sitting down!
003	You like Mister Cuddles, don't you, Mimi?
004	Haha. Good. She's finally settled down.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
005	On to the next part! This one's my best story yet!
006	Isn't this fun?
007	Om nomph... Question.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
008	Umgf... What?
009	Why don't you ever get angry?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
010	Angry? At who?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
011	Me.
012	What for?
013	Well, where to start? I've done so much, I don't even remember half of it anymore.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
014	What would be the point?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
015	But don't you ever get annoyed? I'm always rude to you. I tried to provoke you during our battle. And now I've made myself at home in your house.
016	Station and age do not determine whether someone is worthy of respect. I'm sure you are merely being true to your feelings.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
017	Th-that's not how the world works, you know.
018	If you believe that, then the fact that you have treated me rudely anyway means that either you bear ill will towards me, or I am somehow at fault.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
019	Neither of those things are true! I have nothing but respect for you—and there's no way you could be at fault!
020	Care to explain your conduct to me, then?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
021	Well...you know... Haha... Ahahah...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0011
022	Trying to infuriate your enemy, to provoke them into making a misstep, is a valid strategy.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0007
023	A-and to be frank, having you around has been...useful.
024	Oh! R-really?!
025	You know...now that I think about it, I've never had anyone to get angry at before. In fact...I've never had any attachments worth getting angry over to begin with.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
026	Perhaps that's why I believe that if I were to let anger overcome me, something inside me would...break.
027	I suppose that makes me a coward.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
028	Okay...I feel like we got a little personal there...
029	However...if there does come a time when I must get angry at you, Na Zhu...
030	I will endeavor not to break.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0008
031	Whoa!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
032	Umgf... Om nom nom nomph!
033	Wh-what's wrong? Why're you stuffing your face all of a sudden?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0026
034	Umgf! I-I'm just really happy! Sitting down to a meal like this with someone, chatting about random things...
035	It's...nice. Haha. Is this what it's like to have a family?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
036	I...wouldn't know.
037	Well... Sometimes protecting your home means going foraging beyond your garden fence. Just like how soldiers have to fight and bring back glory.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
038	...
039	Boss, I'm going to show you that your training wasn't for nothing. I'll put it to good use out there. I promise.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
040	You're...talking about the war?
041	Yep. I'll be fighting for our nation on the front lines.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
042	It's a foolish endeavor.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
043	Wh-what?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
044	Greed Dike is weak.
045	Y-you're kidding, right?
046	Our emperor is the King of the Jungle himself! Not to mention, we have you on our side. How can you call that weak?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0039
047	Because we lack something all other nations have: a source of power.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
048	We possess no order of knights, and our land is graced by no natural bounty.
049	We can boast of few exceptional magic users, and we have little national wealth to speak of.
050	But—!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
051	Our people have been divided by the struggle for the throne, and many of our strongest warriors have been executed for their defiance of the emperor.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0016
052	N-none of that can be denied—but don't you see? Those are the very reasons why this war is necessary!
053	Civil conflict is draining our coffers and military strength! If things continue on like this, we're going to collapse in on ourselves!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
054	However, if we take the enemy off the throne and put him outside the borders of this nation, our people will come together as one to protect their home!
055	We can't win. We'll just end up losing what limited military power we have to injury and death.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
056	You're wrong! We can win!
057	For years now, we have been steadily chipping away at Wadatsumi's strength by draining them of their resources. We have willingly paid incredible sums to possess their goods and personnel!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
058	Furthermore, by not dealing with the royal family directly, we have ensured that that money has been diffused among rebellious factions in Wadatsumi who oppose the throne.
059	So now the lower classes languish in poverty, as their goods and relatives are wrested from them and carted off to Greed Dike. Naturally, their rage at this injustice is directed at the royal family, who sit above them with full bellies and bulging pockets.
060	In recent days, these seeds we have sown have at last born fruit. Civil war has broken out in Wadatsumi.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0003
061	It is in the midst of this chaos that Greed Dike will strike. Wadatsumi's forces won't stand a chance.
062	That's...monstrous! It will be a massacre!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0015
063	Perhaps, but it is a necessary step for us to regain what we have lost!
064	Besides...without war, where would I be? I am a soldier! My sole purpose is to fight! To do battle!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0039
065	Na Zhu...
066	And you know as well as I do that a tool without a purpose is doomed to be disposed of.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0029
067	Did you bring me the bouncy ball?
068	You don't look well.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
069	It must be the light down here.
070	Even your voice is...fading.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
071	...
072	Wadatsumi may be the island of demons, but this place is hell.
073	Indeed.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
074	The idea that the weak are fodder for the strong is drilled into these soldiers' minds, until they truly believe that a warrior is only worth something for as long as they continue fighting.
075	Day after day they fight, wearing down their hearts and minds until, like ghouls or ravenous beasts, they know nothing but bloodlust.
076	Though perhaps I am no less a demon in their eyes.
077	Y-you are no demon.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
078	Wounded soldiers are brought to me, only to be sent right back into the fray the second I have healed them.
079	They are given no time to rest. Physical relief is no longer a blessing to them, but a curse. For though I can heal their bodies, their minds and hearts remain broken.
080	...
081	And that is worst of all. There is nothing I can do for a shattered spirit.
082	There is going to be more death, soon.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
083	More? Oh dear...
084	Are you... Can you bring people back from the dead?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
085	There is no remedy for death, I'm afraid.
086	I am able to heal others by projecting their wounds onto my spirit.
087	I can't do that with death.
088	I...see.
089	Why are you asking me this? Don't tell me you've been asked to fight to the death?
090	Well...tools of war aren't likely to die of old age.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
091	But at present, dying in battle is the highest honor there is in Greed Dike.
092	And you actually believe that, do you? Even now?
093	I...
094	Hmph.
095	No battle ends without a sword being drawn.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
096	You say that, but I don't think that's how you really feel. It sounds to me like your heart isn't in those words at all. Am I wrong?
097	I...don't know what you mean.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
098	You want to go back, don't you? To who you were before.
099	I...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
100	You want to win without unsheathing your katana. And when you do draw it, you want it to be to protect your place in this world.
101	I can't go back now. It's far too late for that.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0040
102	It's human nature to aspire to be different, to improve. There is no denying the existence of that compulsion.
103	Tools may not be capable of a change of heart, but people most certainly are.
104	Wouldn't defying my own principles make me...dishonest?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
105	The path of life takes many forms. For some of us it's a straight line, faithfully followed from beginning to end, with all side paths ignored.
106	For others it is a maze of indecisions and mistakes, with many forks in the road, much backtracking, and not a little wandering astray.
107	Who could blame you for grieving to witness death?
108	I don't have the right to grieve. Not after all the people I've killed!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0022
109	In Wadatsumi, it is said that the love we feel for an object imbues it with a soul.
110	Perhaps that is what happened to you?
111	You will not be lost forever. No matter how many wrong turns you take, or how many stops you make along the way...
112	So long as you have a home to return to, you will find your way back, in time.
113	I...!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
114	Even if you are a pathetic coward.
115	Ahh. To what do I owe this pleasure, Lily?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
116	...
117	Come on, out with it. I don't mind telling you that unscheduled visits are a bit of a nuisance.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
118	I just wanted to tell you that I'm stepping down as head of Imperial Security. I won't be serving you anymore.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0004
119	Hmph. I see... How kind of you.
120	I'm also here to ask you to reconsider the attack on Wadatsumi.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
121	Hah. I'm not in the business of taking suggestions—especially not from past employees.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
122	The rest of Babel will not sit back and watch Greed Dike invade its allied nation without comment. The Holy Guard is apt to get involved.
123	Is that your concern? We have plenty of justifications prepared to forestall that very outcome.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
124	We don't even have enough soldiers to fight this war! It's only going to hurt innocent civilians, and line the streets with corpses!
125	You're probably right.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
126	If you're not careful, you could wipe us out!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
127	I've been thinking of a way to fight this war without involving life, heart, or will.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
128	We both know that's impossible.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
129	There's no place for the frail in war, nor those wracked by fear or plagued by weakness, nor the injured who lack the strength to fight any longer.
130	All that is needed to fight a war is power. Pure and simple.
131	But hearts and wills can be molded; soldiers can be modified. Life itself can be overcome, with undead soldiers. Such research is being conducted in Greed Dike, even now.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
132	Wh-what?!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
133	We will be able to fight countless battles without putting the smallest dent in our nation's strength, regardless of how many weaklings lose their lives.
134	This innovation ought to make your life easier, too, Lily.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
135	B-but if you go to war now, the healer upon whose powers you are counting will die before the battle is even won!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
136	So? We can simply claim another shrine maiden from Wadatsumi.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
137	And who are you planning to send into battle? The soldiers already worn down by our own civil war?!
138	Can't you think of a way to do this that doesn't involve senseless injury and bloodshed?!
139	Hah! I never thought you'd be the one asking me that, assassin.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
140	I...!
141	History is already in the making. Its mighty tide cannot be stopped.
142	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
143	Enough talk. I tire of this discussion.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
144	If you will not listen...then you leave me no choice.
145	You would draw your sword on me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
146	I would.
147	I merely spoke the truth. My truth.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
148	I realize that. All you do is for Greed Dike, and there is a certain logic to your words, but still...this plan is too cruel!
149	What has changed you, my Lily?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
150	All this time, I believed that it would be wrong of me to change. I thought only of fulfilling my duty.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0004
151	I turned my back on my own heart and soul to become your tool.
152	But then, I...!
153	Come, rise and fight, brethren!
154	I realized that that's not who I am. I didn't learn to use this katana to end the lives of everyone I meet—quite the opposite.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
155	Now the long-used tool, the blade shaped by ringing steel...
156	If I cannot stop the tide of history...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
157	Stands against the great river of history with unflinching zeal!
158	Then I will stop you instead!
159	You conceited fool! You think you can topple an emperor? You, a lowly tool?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0012
160	...
161	Have you no loyalty to your own creed? What about the duty you swore to fulfill?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
162	If my duty is the security of the empire, I must first eliminate the cause of its civil conflict.
163	You think yourself so capable? You overestimate your own abilities! You think you know what this nation needs better than I?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0017
164	I know what I think is right. If that makes me conceited, so be it!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
165	You are no better than a child throwing a tantrum when denied what he wants!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0039
166	Me? You take what you want, without considering the consequences!
167	Of the two of us, you are the brat!
168	Hmph!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
169	You are no better than a mindless beast!
170	This is getting us nowhere.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
171	Indeed.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0005
172	Then let us end this!
173	Yes... Farewell, Orion, and...sorry, in advance.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0012
