001	Haaa... I'm here again...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0030
002	Phew! I finally caught up to you!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0030
003	Eek! Fujika?! What are you doing here?
004	I peeked in on the viewing party and saw them say all those things! I was worried about you, so...	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0004
005	So you saw, then... Why don't they get it?
006	Hozuki...
007	I've always liked this place since I was a child. I always come here when something bad happens.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0001
008	I find Wadatsumi flowers soothing, too. Was... Was trying to introduce another land's culture into ours a mistake after all?
009	When you said you saw my book and resolutely created that arrangement, I was proud but also a bit worried.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0001
010	I wondered if you'd get the same reaction I did.	VO_fujika.fujika_battle_0019
011	You too, Fujika?
012	I disliked the furor my book caused so much that I no longer write much these days.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
013	But I think incorporating things from a foreign land into Wadatsumi culture is a good thing.
014	R-right?!
015	Yes. But when I think about being rejected because of it...making things stops being fun.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0004
016	I think that maybe after spending so much time cultivating its culture in isolation, Wadatsumi doesn't know how to accept new ideas into its foundation.
017	Its foundation, huh...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0031
018	Culture is made and cultivated in the hearts of the people who live in a place. All culture that exists today is what has been passed down from the generations that came before.
019	Oh yeah... I think I've been ignoring the feelings of the people here.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0016
020	I suppose it makes sense that if I was suddenly shown flowers from another land when I don't know much about them, I'd be perplexed, too...
021	True. Plus, your flowers were like a fountain from another land.
022	That's because that was the thing I saw outside of Wadatsumi that left the biggest impression on me.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0004
023	There were things outside of Wadatsumi that I'd never seen before, things that almost seemed to be from another world entirely, and they still sparkle in my mind.
024	I wanted to share that such wonderful things exist so badly that I...
025	I wanted the people here to experience the same brilliance through my arrangement.	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_battle_0022
026	I understand how you feel, wanting to share nice things.
027	Exactly! I was so sure it'd make everyone happy...	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0005
028	In my case, I think I forced the thing I thought was good onto people.	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
029	I think that to people who think what they already have is wonderful, it seems like all we're doing is ruining the things they like...
030	What we need is to introduce a new layer to the foundations of our culture so that they'll accept bold changes like ours.
031	I see! Then...!	VO_hoozuki.hoozuki_sys_0006
032	Ah! Where are you going, Hozuki?!
