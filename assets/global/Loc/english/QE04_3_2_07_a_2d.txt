001	Well, well. What a rare guest. I suspected something like this might happen...but I'm not sure I quite believed it.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
002	It's been a while. You look well. That's the most important thing...Tehre boy.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
003	It's high time you stopped calling me that. How long do you think it's been since I've been appointed Earth Sprite?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
004	Tehre boy, you'll always be a boy to me. Well then, there's a lot I want to ask you about.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
005	Try and keep it brief. I'm busy.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
006	Oh? Well, that's not very polite. I specifically went out of my way to take advantage of this time we have while we wait for Tina and Mocca's return.	VO_voda.voda_chara_1002
007	Old fox...I have long disliked your cryptic way of speaking. If you have something to say, then say it.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
008	I don't intend to speak cryptically. Asena's fountain lies within my land. It has merely shown me various things.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
009	However, it has not revealed to me your true intentions. Thus, I have come here to confirm them today.
010	You sent the two on their way, yet why do you return to your own land?
011	There is no need to tell you everything. However, let me just say that it is a necessary step in order to achieve my objective.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
012	Well, aren't you an unruly boy? Then why did you send Tina and Mocca to Asena?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
013	For the sake of Saga's future. You yourself are well aware of how exhausted Asena is.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
014	So, you wish for them to witness this with their own eyes... I'm sure you have another hidden reason, Tehre boy.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0045
015	In order to restore the Wind Matter, it is necessary for them to possess at least enough power to overcome the trial.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
016	Ultimately, someone must become the Wind Sprite and restore the balance.
017	I was merely ascertaining whether they were the appropriate vessel to serve this purpose.
018	If you're contemplating this situation that seriously, I'm assuming you haven't sold your soul to the Gluttony army.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
019	Hmph. Of course not. There's no way I'll stand by and watch the Saga that Alia wished to protect fall into ruin.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
020	In that case, why have you joined forces with the Gluttony army? There is no doubt that they are the ones who are spurring Saga towards its destruction.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
021	It's human nature only to notice true danger when a crisis befalls them. Right now is just such a situation.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
022	People will unite in order to overcome a crisis.
023	So...you anticipated all of this? In that case, do you mean to tell me...you were responsible for the Jam outbreak?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
024	Someone has to sound the alarm bells. A few must be sacrificed for the greater good.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
025	Saga must learn to co-exist with nature in the truest sense...just as it once did.
026	The revival of the Wind Matter was something that everyone desired. I am certain there were solutions.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0021
027	We cannot allow things to continue like this any longer. Someone must release Asena from that burden!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0013
028	Ever since Alia's death...Asena has suppressed Beelzebub...in our stead.
029	Enough. I cannot bear to watch Asena grow weaker and weaker. Humans must change Saga with their own hands.
030	I see. I noticed that you had occasionally been visiting Asena's fountain...but I now I know the reason why.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
031	Neither faction nor tribe has anything to do with this. Asena has been shouldering the burden of Saga all this time...of course, it worries me.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
032	Someone who possesses the lost power of the wind should make Asena understand how much humankind is trying to change.
033	If the two of them realize this, I am certain they will bring back the token. If they cannot, then Saga will not change!
034	Heheheheh... If only you had accepted my words, you would not have had to suffer!	VO_adne.adne_sys_0008
035	Is that...me?! What is going on?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
036	This is the truth...the darkness inside of you. There are two sides to truth. The reverse is no less true. Do you have the strength to ward off the darkness?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
037	Let us put it to the test here and now!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
038	...!
