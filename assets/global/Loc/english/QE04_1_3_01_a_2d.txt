001	Mocca's...Fuu faction destroyed the wind tribes?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
002	Yep. Everything is their fault!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
003	No way...?! Is that true? Mocca?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
004	... ...
005	It's all true.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
006	All this conflict within Saga was triggered by my Fuu faction. I cannot excuse a single thing.
007	That's terrible!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
008	But right now isn't the time to get caught up in such matters. The Jam are threatening to destroy all of Saga.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
009	Saga itself is on the verge of being destroyed. We don't have time to be bickering amongst ourselves!
010	I belong to no faction or tribe. My only wish is to protect Saga!
011	...!
012	Mocca...!
013	You can dress it up however you want, but it doesn't change the fact that you belong to your faction.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
014	Sorry, but there's no way I can believe the words of someone from the Fuu faction.
015	Fuu faction, huh? Neither those constraints nor Lilith’s Hill matter to me!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
016	Hey, hey...you sure it's a good idea to be banging on like that? The Fuu faction is here as well.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
017	I don't care!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
018	No matter how you look at it, it is unforgivable to destroy another tribe!
019	I can speak with confidence when I say...what that man committed...was a grave mistake!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
020	Mo-Mocca...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
021	That man...?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
022	...! Sorry...I got a little heated up.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
023	... ...
024	If you truly want to help, then hurry up and leave.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
025	He-hey! We helped you just now. The least you could do is say thank...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
026	It's fine. Let's go.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
027	Yes.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
028	... ...
029	Seriously...
030	Gluttony Foss...
031	Huh...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
032	They've been spotted numerous times around the areas where the Jam have appeared.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
033	Apparently, they're chasing the Jam as well. I've seen it several times myself.
034	This information comes from a dependable customer. I didn't pry for too many details, but there's no mistaking its validity.
035	Try your best to stay out of danger.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
036	...!
037	Old man...! Thanks!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0034
038	Gluttony...
039	So the Jam appears where the Gluttony Foss army appears...?
040	What exactly does that mean?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
041	Even in the village of Lezario, they showed up right after the Jam outbreak. He showed up as well.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
042	Georgios, huh?
043	Do you think he's been pursuing the Jam as well?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
044	But...why would they do that? They don't seem to be pursuing them to destroy them.	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
045	Maybe they want to research the Jam's curse?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
046	... ...
047	What should we do, Mocca?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
048	It'll take too much time to get the merchants of the Tehre faction to talk.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
049	For now, let's try and talk with anyone from Fuu tribe that's in Paza village.
