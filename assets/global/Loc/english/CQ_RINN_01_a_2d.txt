001	Ohh... What should we do for fun today? Hey, Rin?
002	... ...
003	Hey!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0012
004	Yip?! Wh-what?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0032
005	What's the matter? You've been spacing out.	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0001
006	Actually...I met a boy tanuki the other day. He seemed like he wanted to say something, but he ended up just scurrying off.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
007	A boy?! Wait, is that...is that...?!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0006
008	N-no, it's not like that! It's just that when I wonder about him, I get worried.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0025
009	Worried?
010	Yeah. He was all alone. I worry that he's lonely. I wouldn't like to be all alone.	VO_rin.rin_sys_0030
011	Mm... Hey! Where did you see that boy?
012	Umm...umm... Where was it again? Oh! I think it was near an old shrine!
013	A shrine? Was there a shrine around here? Well, anyway, let's go!
014	Huh?	VO_rin.rin_sys_0005
015	You feel worried, right? In that case, let's try meeting that boy again! I'm curious as well!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0007
016	Oh! You're right! We can ask him directly!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0044
017	All right then... Off we go to find the shrine!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0005
018	Yip!!!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0003
019	...So, which way is this shrine?	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0031
020	I forgot!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0031
021	Th-then, let's go to the places you're prone to visiting, Rin! At the same time, we can engage in a little mischief!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0011
022	Hey, you! Wait! I've had enough of your tiresome mischief!
023	It's not tiresome! It's real entertaining to see your angry face, old man!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0023
024	Ohh! Wait! It's dangerous to run off over there!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_sys_0025
025	Oww...ahhh!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0043
026	Grrr....graaaahh!!!
027	This angry face isn't entertaining at all!	VO_hazuki.hazuki_battle_0025
