001	Ha... Za...har... You will see...how meaningless your ambitions...are...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
002	Ngh...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
003	I appreciate your words of wisdom...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0044
004	Now hurry up and choke on your own meaningless words!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0004
005	Eek!!!
006	Zahar! The fire's spreading! We have to get out of here!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
007	Agreed. We've no more reason to be here.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
008	Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
009	Is this your home?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
010	Y-yes.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
011	(I guess we're taking her with us.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
012	We're leaving!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
013	Are you okay?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
014	Did you save me?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
015	I did. You've been through much, but you can rest easy now. Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
016	As you wish. I will take her to the army medical center.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
017	Th-thank you... Sir.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
018	There's no need. Rest up, now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
019	My name's Spica. Um, what's yours?	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
020	Zahar.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
021	(The Wratharis army grew larger and larger with Zahar at the helm, and finally...)
022	Long live Captain Zahar of the Knights of Wratharis! Hoorah! Hoorah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0009
023	Congratulations Za—Captain Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
024	At last, we have the power of a nation in our hands; the power we need to build the new world order.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
025	No, we need more.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
026	More power...? How much more do we need?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
027	Enough to bring the world down upon its knees!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
028	(Even the military might of an entire nation isn't enough to satisfy your ambitions?! To what ends will you go in your quest for power?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0021
029	(Calm yourself, Evil Eye! We were right to follow this man into darkness!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
030	(Once Captain Zahar prevails in his conquest of the world, I shall be appointed the new king's right-hand man!)
031	Captain Zahar, I will follow you until the end of time.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0011
032	I would expect no less from you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
