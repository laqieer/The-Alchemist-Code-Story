001	Ugh, what is it now?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
002	Mira... Right now, the defensive line...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
003	You're not supposed to be moving! All that Space-Time Manipulation's got your insides all discombobulated!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
004	I had to speed you up wholesale to match that other shield lady, and it kinda pushed you to your breaking point!
005	What?! You mean, you manipulated time for my entire being? Isn't that dangerous?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
006	Yeah, it is! That's why I'm telling you to stop moving!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0001
007	We've secured a path to retreat. Grab my shoulder and hold on tight, okay?
008	What? No, I should...!
009	Holy crud! You're heavy!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0022
010	That's the shield. And my armor, too.
011	Well, I'll manage. I'm use some more Space-Time Manipulation, if I have t—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
012	Whoa! What was that? It sounds like it came from where Nyx and Eulalia were fighting!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
013	He reported in earlier to say that they'd won the battle, so I thought they were in the clear. C'mon, Nyx! You'd better be okay!
014	"Hey! What's happening over there?"	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
015	Can't you tell from the sound?	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
016	This battle is not yours to win!
017	She looks like she should've dropped dead a thousand times already, but somehow, she's still going at it!
018	That voice! Has Mesarthim been defeated?!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
019	......
020	(She can hear me over the link with Mira?!)
021	It appears she, too, can hear the voices of spirits.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
022	Why do you think I answered your call to battle? Why do you think I'm here now?!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
023	This is a battle for the fate of the world. I've no choice but to defeat you!
024	Now, shall we continue?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
