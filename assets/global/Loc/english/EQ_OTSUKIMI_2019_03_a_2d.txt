001	Yaah!
002	That settles it.
003	Let's just put these purple dumplings away. They're too dangerous.
004	You're so smart, Evelika! How did you know these were the cause?
005	I wasn't sure about it, but I have heard about the Rainbow Cacao.
006	Magical engineering is my specialty though, so they're a little outside of my expertise.
007	You're very studious, aren't you? Not to mention daring!
008	Right after quitting school, you started working as a mercenary to earn money while doing research related to magical engineering.
009	It was you who told me that being a mercenary would allow me to get a firsthand look at the most cutting-edge of magical tech.
010	That's true. I did give you the idea. That's why I felt responsible for giving you the test.
011	I needed to make sure your skill and determination was battle-ready.
012	And I take it she passed with flying colors! Amazing!
013	I-it wasn't a big deal!
014	It was! Caris recognized your talents, so you must've been an amazing mercenary!
015	Heheh, I have an eye for these things! Evelika's a tenacious one, but... Try not to carry too much on your own shoulders, okay?
016	Caris...
017	Well, I'll be off now. Later!
018	Now that I don't have a package to worry about, I can go as fast as I want! Hahahaha!
019	...
020	Sh-she really is something.
021	Yeah, aren't Phantom Soldiers summoned as they were in their prime? This must've been when she was the fastest.
022	Prime...?
023	Evelika?
024	Ah, uh... It's nothing!
025	...
026	Is this how we're supposed to stack the dumplings?
027	I think it's fine. I mean, it might all come down if we're not careful, but...
028	No! Don't say that! Now I have the urge to see how far I can push it...
029	What?! You better not!
030	Aw, okay.
031	The silver grass goes here? Like this?
032	I think that's probably how it's supposed to be.
033	Probably.
034	I'm sorry. This was our idea, but you're doing all the work to get everything ready.
035	Huh? Oh, it's fine.
036	I'm just happy that I get to do things with you again.
037	...
038	Evelika...
039	...
040	Evelika... Can you hear me?
041	Wah?! Huh?! Y-yes?!
042	You haven't had a dumpling yet, have you?
043	What? How could I have? I've been too busy!
044	What the... They're mostly gone!
045	Wow! I shifted my attention to the silver grass for just a moment, but now we're missing so many!
046	The dumpling tower I made is ruined... What's going on?!
047	Could it have been the kids from Real Heaven? I wouldn't mind if it was them.
048	Theft is theft! They need to learn how to ask, at least! ...Hm?
049	Evelika? Did you notice something?
050	Those people there... They kept looking this way and when one of them caught eyes with me, they scurried away.
051	That's suspicious.
052	It's not right to blindly accuse, but they are acting like they have something to hide.
053	You really are a perceptive one.
054	Kon says the smell of dumplings are coming from the bag they're holding.
055	That's some damning evidence. We worked so hard to put this event together...
056	If they were children, that'd be one thing, but they're just simple thieves! How dare they!
