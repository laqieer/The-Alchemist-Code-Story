001	That being said, Lustburg is really cold, right? Isn't our clothing a problem?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
002	On the way, we'll get some cold resistant clothing...hey! Hold on, Edgar!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
003	Aren't those your friends over there?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
004	What?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
005	Little lady! Even you're here, Ronnie! You've been waiting for us all this time. You're making me get teary-eyed.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0024
006	Now isn't the time for that! Don... They've abducted Don!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
007	...? Hey, hold on, Ronnie. When people get abducted, they usually go for the women or children that are lightweight and easy to carry off.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
008	The thing is...a bunch Alkaroids closed in on him and Don wasn't able to resist...and...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0030
009	Alkaroids? Didn't they stop moving after the Messiah was destroyed? And are you telling me that Taras just let them take him?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
010	It's because he doesn't have any energy in his right arm! He used the energy to save this city. And, because of that, he's now been abducted!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0042
011	...!
012	Please...Edgar! Logi! Please save Taras!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0041
013	Wh-what are you talking about? We shouldn't be wasting our time...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
014	I see. Very well then, I'll go on my own. I owe him a debt. Without his help, the Messiah would've finished me off.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
015	You too, Logi? Argh...fine! Not that I owe him anything!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
016	Edgar!
017	Little lady, Ronnie, lead us in the direction that they took that idiot!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
018	Is this some kind of factory? It's pretty old. Maybe it's an abandoned factory that the Beckram's destroyed?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
019	Thank you, Fiona, Ronnie. It's gonna get dangerous from here so the two of you best return to the city.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
020	Wh-what kind of nonsense is that?! We've come this far and you're gonna try to ditch us again?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0013
021	That's not the case, Ronnie. Right now, the city is in a state of chaos with all the restoration that is going on. What I'm saying is that you should help them out.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
022	The volunteers that I brought along with me are the ones who are working on restoration. I'll show up later so do you think you can look after everything until then?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0041
023	Uck...fine. But you better come later, Edgar! Just right now, you wandered off without saying anything!
024	Fine, fine. Hurry up and go! From here it's...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
025	...time for the grown-ups to get to work.
