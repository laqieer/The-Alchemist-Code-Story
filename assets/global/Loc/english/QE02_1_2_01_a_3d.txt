001	I'm blown away... The glimmering neon lights are too much for my eyes.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0069
002	High-end clubs, casinos, and...whoa...even those kinds of places! This is amazing. I've never visited such a massive entertainment district before.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0069_02
003	Aye, this is Little Heaven, Slothstein's greatest entertainment district.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0012
004	Rumor has it that the Don Taras Family has a mansion somewhere in this city.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0012_02
005	To think that Fiona is somewhere in this filthy place is almost enough to fry my circuits, aye!	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0012_03
006	Seriously, even the women walking down the street are excessively elegant.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0070
007	Are you listening to me, aye?! Now isn't the time for indecent thoughts!	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0013
008	D-don't be stupid. Of course, I know that! It's not like I was getting my hopes up or anything.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0071
009	Actually, when you look closely, there are also a lot of oddly shabby people.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0071_02
010	Aye, hidden behind Little Heaven lies the slums of Real Heaven.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0014
011	Those inhabitants are here seeking alms.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0014_02
012	Real Heaven lies hidden behind Little Heaven?	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0072
013	In other words, the true reality of the city named Heaven is the slums that lie hidden behind it. How ironic.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0072_02
014	Aye, humans never cease to amaze me.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0015
015	Anyway, the Don Taras Family mansion is said to be located in the center of Real Heaven.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0015_02
016	Said to be? That's not very reliable.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0073
017	Aye, the details of this area haven't been laid out on any map.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0016
018	A city that doesn't exist on the maps, huh?	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0074
019	In places like that are where the real image of the country emerges.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0074_02
020	Ow!	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0074_03
021	Whoops. My bad.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.ronnie_story0201_0001
022	Jeez. There are a lot of bad guys around here. You better watch where you're running, okay?	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0075
023	Okay! Sorry!	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.ronnie_story0201_0002
024	So you're just gonna let him go, aye?	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0017
025	Of course. Listen, Alkemono...	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0076
026	Looking down on someone just because they're a child is a disgraceful thing for any adult to do. Remember that.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0076_02
027	You gunslingers are a generous lot—even willing to remain silent when you get pickpocketed, aye.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.alkemono_story0201_0018
028	Hah. Well, generous is overstating things a little.	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0077
029	If I got agitated every time I was pickpocketed, I wouldn't be...wait, what did you just say?	QE02_1_2_01_a_3d.edgar_story0201_0077_02
030	Huff...huff...heh. Foreigners are the easiest...huh?!
031	Finally found you, aye! It was no easy task!
032	Ehem. Well. Let me tell you this as an adult.
033	Being a thief is a blatant crime. You better reconsider your actions—
034	Look, I don't have all day. Can you get to the point?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0006
035	Give me back my fortune, you punk!!!
036	So much for your generosity, aye.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0020
037	Your fortune?! No way. That's all you have?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0007
038	My head is swirling with indescribable emotions right now.
039	Ack! I've got more important things to deal with! Hurry up and give it back!
040	Hey! Let me go!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0008
041	Huh? Hold on a second.
042	What! Argh... I can't deal with idiots like you!
043	Ouch!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0026
044	Ron Shubert, 11-year-old resident of Real Heaven with multiple thefts and petty criminal records.
045	A Guard Droid!
046	The sum of money you currently possess places the probability of theft at 85%.
047	Estimated from your current heart rate and criminal record, I have determined you should be restrained.
048	Wh-wha...! Hey! Let me go!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
049	Huh? What's a Guard Droid?
050	Alkaroids deployed by Alvarez to maintain security, aye.
051	Their excessive enforcement has been problematic.
052	Le-let me go! I need this money to buy my mom's medicine! Come on, let me go!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0009
053	Let him go. I gave the boy that wallet.
054	Huh? Wh-what are you playing at?
055	I'm stating the facts. Let the boy go.
056	I cannot.
057	What? Why? I'm the owner of that wallet, and I'm telling you to.
058	Estimating from the gun in your possession, you are a gunslinger. The contents of the wallet are far too little for someone of your profession.
059	In comparison to the average income of a gunslinger, there is a 4% probability that the money belongs to you.
060	I think I'm gonna vomit out of embarrassment.
061	Furthermore, you bear a striking resemblance to Edgar L. Leonhart,
062	the suspect guilty of abducting Mayor Alvarez's bride from their wedding. The probability of this is 95%. I will now restrain you.
063	So, that's how it's gonna be, huh? It makes everything a lot easier! Time to vent all my frustrations!
