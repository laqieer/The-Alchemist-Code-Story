001	Heheheh... Catch me if you can!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
002	Haa... Whew... Wait!	VO_annerose.annerose_battle_0019
003	Where are you going?! I was in the middle of reading up on some magical—!
004	I came all the way here to see you, but you aren't spending any time with me at all!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0016
005	Y-you really shouldn't be running in that dress, Klima!	VO_annerose.annerose_sys_0030
006	And where's that incantation gear I made you? I'm always telling you to take it with you when you go out, but you never listen!
007	L-look at you! You're all exposed! You should really put some stockings on, at the very least!
008	I hate wearing clothes! I like feeling the wind on my skin!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0017
009	Here, I'll share some with you. Wind!	VO_clima.clima_battle_0004
010	Eeek!	VO_annerose.annerose_sys_0027
011	I just love the rain, too. It's nice and cool, don't you think?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
012	Rain shower—refresh!	VO_clima.clima_battle_0012
013	Whulfgh?! Shdpp dhat!	VO_annerose.annerose_battle_0021
014	Ahahahaha! Oops! Poor Annerose, you're soaking wet!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0008
015	Y-y-you...! Grah. I wouldn't have thought you capable of such tomfoolery, since you're always so drowsy and inattentive. I suppose you aren't called a genius for nothing, however.	VO_annerose.annerose_sys_0018
016	What am I saying?! Listen here! You shouldn't use your powers so lightly!	VO_annerose.annerose_battle_0019
017	If you meddle around too much with nature, the Alchemia in the atmosphere could become unstable, resulting in goodness knows what kind of—
018	We're still playing tag, you know! Get ready, 'cause next I'm gonna... Hm?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
019	Aaaaargh!	VO_annerose.annerose_battle_0025
020	Huh? Annerose...?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
021	What is the meaning of this?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
022	I-I... Um...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
023	I saw that lightning bolt. You attacked this girl, didn't you?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
024	N-no! That's not—	VO_clima.clima_battle_0022
025	Seize her! Quickly!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
026	No! Annerose!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0027
