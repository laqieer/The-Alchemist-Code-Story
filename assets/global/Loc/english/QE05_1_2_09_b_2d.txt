001	I knew it! It's Alchemy!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0020
002	What?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
003	You meddling Paladins of the Holy Guard are just here to take advantage of the strife in our country!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0016
004	Holy Guard...? What?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
005	(Seeing my Spiritbonding somehow validated this idea for him, but how...?)
006	Call for reinforcements! The enemy uses Alchemy, but we can wear them down with numbers!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0012
007	Urk... This overwhelming number of soldiers...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
008	Well, well, well. It looks like you could use a hand, my friend.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0001
009	Who—?! No, that voice...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
010	That armor... There's no mistaking it for anything but that of the Holy Guard!
011	So the army was looking for you?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
012	W-we still have the advantage of numbers!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0021
013	Hmph. This numbers game is easy to settle with a little head-crushing.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
014	Sir Waginau, what should we do with the rest of the soldiers from Gluttony?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
015	There is no reason to waste unnecessary energy chasing after them. If they were searching for us, then they already knew we were here.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
016	Roger!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
017	Now then—
018	Lord Waginau!
019	Kamui, you have made a rather poor showing of it. However, it is good to see that you are uninjured.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
020	Now, it has been a while since I made my way back to the village. Would you mind leading the way?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
021	Chief, I have brought Lord Waginau to you.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0003
022	Welcome. Thank you for coming such a long way. I am sorry to hear that you met some obstacles along the way.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0009
023	It was nothing. As knights of principle, we are used to being enveloped in the envy of lower men.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
024	I shall take my leave of the two of you, then.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
025	No, Kamui. Stay. It is for this reason that I have asked this man to come.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
026	Ah, then this is the one you spoke of, Chief?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
027	Yes. This is the one who will become the next Protector.
028	I see. Well, I have no objections to this appointment. He is indeed one who is fit to bear the burden of Compassion this role requires.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0045
029	Please allow me to introduce myself properly now. I am Waginau of the Holy Guard.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
030	I am Kamui, successor to Judah, the former Protector of this village.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
031	Kamui, this man was once this village's Protector.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
032	This village's...? But in my memory, the last Protector was Judah. After he died, there was no successor, and so...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
033	Yes. Waginau was the Protector several generations ago.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
034	Generations?! I-I suppose I had heard in Saga that Protectors can gain an unusually long lifespan...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
035	Alchemy is a deep and varied art. While pushing the limits of its possibilities, at some point I realized I had become more spirit than human.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
036	This immortality is my curse for plunging into the most forbidden depths of Alchemy.
037	However, the silver lining of this dark cloud is that I am now able to help guide new Protectors to their full potential.
038	It is generally more ideal for the Protector's duties and knowledge to be passed down directly from predecessor to successor.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
039	Ah, but since the line of succession was broken by Judah's death...
040	Yes. Luckily for us, we still have a former Protector who has plenty of experience and knowledge to share.
041	It is indeed fortunate, as we are entering an era where we will need the Protector.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
042	As a result, Kamui... You will learn all of what it means to be the Protector from me.
043	I understand. I am in your debt.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
044	Waginau, I suspect you will be needing rest after your long journey.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
045	Now that this has all been settled and introductions made, it would be best for the both of you to rest before the training starts.
046	Thank you, Chief. Excuse me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
047	Kamui! There you are!	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
048	I was so worried when I heard you'd been attacked by soldiers of Gluttony!
049	Ah, it's nothing for you to worry about. I'm fine.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
050	I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said anything about the caravan.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
051	There's nothing to apologize for. It was my own choice to go. At least—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
052	You must be the Chief's daughter. You carry yourself much like he does.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0044
053	Um... Who might you be?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
054	This is Lord Waginau. He is a Paladin of the Holy Guard. I wouldn't have made it back if not for him.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
055	I see. Thank you so much, Lord Waginau. I am indeed the daughter of Chief Iakov. My name is Malta.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0033
056	And you are also the druidic priestess of this village? I see...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
057	Chief Iakov did say that the current druidic priestess was impressive, even compared to those who came before her.
058	With you at the helm, the resurrection ceremony should go off without a hitch. Sephiron will be pleased.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
059	Lord Waginau, you know of it?	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
060	These things once fell under the purview of one who was the Protector. I suspect I know most, if not all, of this village's secrets.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
061	Then... Kamui...?	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
062	Who is to say? Well, you do have your honor as a priestess. For your sake, I will keep this quiet.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
063	However, do not forget this: Sephiron demands devotion and resolution before all else.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
064	Of course...
065	Then, if you will excuse me.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
066	...
067	Malta. What were you and Waginau speaking of?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
068	Oh, um... It was nothing. Do not concern yourself with it.	VO_malta.malta_sys_1050
069	Just... I don't know.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
070	Something about him makes me worry. I am not sure why.
