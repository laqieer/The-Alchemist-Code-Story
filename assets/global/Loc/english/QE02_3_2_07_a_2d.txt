001	Well, well. I'm impressed by how fast you recovered. It seems I underestimated you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0021
002	We'll see how long you can maintain that smug facade of yours.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
003	For a knight in shining armor, you're pretty rude. Let me ask you this: have you reached the Door of Truth?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0022
004	You...know about that place?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
005	Heh. Your honesty is much appreciated.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0023
006	I see. So you received that power of yours from her. No wonder you're so strong.
007	Yet therein lies my chance to defeat you!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
008	What...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
009	I turned down her offer.
010	I don't cling onto power like you. That difference in our mental strength should define which of us ultimately wins!
011	You think that I cling onto power...?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
012	I'll rely on my own power to win! Take that!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0009
013	I don't care how you perceive my actions. In order to fulfill my justice...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0024
014	I'll do whatever I can to be victorious!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0025
015	Huzzzaahhh!!!
016	What...?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
017	There's a burden that I shoulder. I cannot afford to stop here!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0026
018	Agh! Agahh!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0022
019	Edgar!!!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
020	How did you reach the Door of Truth? Do you know where the Sacred Stone is?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
021	Ugh! Wh-what kind of nonsense are you spewing?! Aghh!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0043
022	You're an outsider. I guess you just happened upon it by accident.
023	That's all I wanted to confirm.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
024	I'm finished with you. Don't bother me any further. Let's go, young lady...Alkemono.
025	Wa-wait! Edgar!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
026	Let Fiona go, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
027	Ugh! Wa-wait, you...!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0027
028	Edgar! Are you okay?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
029	This fight still isn't over yet! Get on the bike, Ronnie. We will pursue them!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
