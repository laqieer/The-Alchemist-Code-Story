001	Nothing but wild animals.
002	Wonder if Professor Minerva has better luck with that crystal of hers.
003	Meep!
004	Find something, Chip?
005	Eh?
006	Chip scampers up Soren's arm and peeks at the shining creature trotting closely behind it, licking its lips.
007	Arf!
008	Aren't you one of Eira's foxes?
009	Big Bro!
010	Eira! Weren't you taking a nap?
011	Does anyone know you're here?
012	Eira hear...singing.
013	Pretty...voice.
014	Singing...?
015	There you are, Soren.
016	Oh, hello, little one.
017	...Hello!
018	Teacher...sing?
019	Me? Not one for the stage myself.
020	That's not what you meant? Hmm...
021	Minerva pulls out her crystal and begins concentrating.
022	A soft hum begins to permeate the frozen air as it resonates in low tones.
023	Shiny...
024	Oh, dear... Is everyone all right?
025	Yeah, but that voice... I heard it too!
026	The singing?
027	Yeah!
028	Ah, it makes sense now...
029	I believe Lachesis could have a strong connection to Alchemia particles, specifically those of the Elylon Teg.
030	In this regard, Eira's signature may be synergetic with hers, allowing the child to perceive her in such a manner.
031	Proximity may play a part, but to what extent I am unsure. A lead is better than nothing, however!
032	But...is she a Construct? Or something else?
033	A little more difficult to deduce, I'm afraid. Perhaps she is a different project?
034	And if Goetia is after both her and Eira, then it stands to reason they have need of this power.
035	Eira may be one of the "keys", for if it was only an Elylon Teg clansman they needed, they could have taken Emrys instead.
036	Bad people...
037	Eira...cause trouble?
038	It was never your fault, Eira.
039	Come on, what say we head back for dinner? It's getting late.
040	Okay, Big Bro.
041	To make contact with such a being, Goetia would have need of a prodigious amount of Alchemia.
042	For a mercy, this does mean that, like Atropos, she cannot be sequestered within the country.
043	And if Eira can perceive her even from here, we may be closer to her location than expected.
044	All that remains is for us to get to her before Goetia finds out.
045	Easier said than done, though.
046	One step at a time, my dear Soren.
047	- Minerva's Residence -
048	So, if I got this straight... We're looking for Lachesis by following her phantom singing?
049	That is the gist of it, yes.
050	I fear that our movements may rouse the attention of any Goetia operative who happens to be scouring the area, however.
051	No worries, Teach. We'll be on the lookout to cause a scene if necessary.
052	A diversionary force, hmm? It might just work.
053	Granted that being out of Slothstein would embolden them to take more drastic measures, they won't hesitate to attack us on sight.
054	Heh. It'll be their last mistake.
055	Then Eira and I will remain here for news of Shion while I conduct further research on our singing friend.
056	Eira...foxes...help!
057	That leaves myself and Blair, then.
058	Good thing I thought to bring my toolbox along.
059	Maybe we'll run into illegally disposed scrap I can use.
060	Right, everyone. Let's get to work.
061	Wait for me, Roxanne.
