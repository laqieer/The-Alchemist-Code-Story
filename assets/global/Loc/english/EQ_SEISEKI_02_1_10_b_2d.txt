001	Agh...ahh...	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0027
002	Now for the final blow!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0012
003	Take that! Kagutsuchi!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0014
004	Miracle Kanon Slash!	VO_kanon.kanon_skill_0001
005	Uck...	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0024
006	How's that, Zangetsu? This is our power...the power of the Holy Guard!
007	Ugff... It appears that I've lost this time.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0023
008	However, my domination will not end here!
009	Huh?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
010	No. He's gonna make a run for it!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
011	Young knight, we'll see how long you can maintain your distorted version of justice.
012	I'll maintain it forever!
013	Heheh... What an interesting girl you are.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0007
014	Wait? Did he just...laugh?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
015	Phew... Well, we managed to survive somehow, even though Zangetsu escaped. We were also able to rescue Chihaya.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
016	I guess you can say we accomplished the minimum of our mission.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
017	Come on; it was a big success! We were able to save both of them.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0016
018	She's right! You're allowed to compliment yourself sometimes, Kudan♪	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0007
019	Heh. You might be right.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0023
020	Thank you so much, Paladins...and you, Princess.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0018
021	You don't have to call me that. My country no longer exists anymore.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
022	I did what anyone would do.
023	I did for you what I would do for anyone who loves Wadatsumi!
024	Heheh. Thank you.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0010
025	Captain Kudan...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0002
026	Please value your comrades. When you are in danger of being consumed by darkness, it is them who will save you.
027	I'll remember that.
028	And you, Kanon.
029	Y-yes!
030	You truly surprised me.
031	However, remember this. Vast darkness often accompanies the brightest light.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0012
032	Understood! I'll remember that.
033	Heheh. Please do, all right?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
034	Well then, let's get out of here. Kagura, Kanon, don't let your guard down until we've completed our mission.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0015
035	Yes!
036	Thank you, Paladins. We will be fine from here.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0034
037	What do you plan to do now?
038	Of course, rebuild our homeland. I'll return to Wadatsumi and assist in its reconstruction efforts.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0037
039	I'll go with her!
040	I see. I must inquire; isn't there a possibility of history repeating itself?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
041	... ...
042	I am aware of that possibility. However, I desperately want to return Wadatsumi to the beautiful country it used to be.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
043	I understand how you feel. I have a proposal. How about you rely on us for support?
044	What?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
045	Shrine Maiden Chihaya, there's no doubt that what you're doing is the right thing.
046	The fact is that there are those who will not take kindly to it.
047	That's why I want to station a few knights from the Holy Guard by your side.
048	As the Holy Guard represents a presence of peace and justice, no opposition would be likely to lay hands on you.
049	I see...so you're offering to assist in the restoration. In other words, your proposal in the same as Zangetsu's.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0045
050	N-no...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
051	It's different!
052	Of course there are similarities, but we Paladins want to protect the peace for everyone.
053	We won't disturb the peace as he did!
054	I was joking. Heheh. For Wadatsumi's sake, I would gladly accept your support.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0010
055	Understood.
056	Well then, let's go home, Mizuchi.
057	Got it! See you all!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
058	Yeah, see you! Don't cause problems for Chihaya, all right?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
059	Eheheh. We'll see about that.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0023
060	Kanon... I'm truly grateful for everything you've done.
061	Y-you're welcome.
062	You truly might become the light that swallows the darkness. Please continue to uphold that heart of yours.
063	Of course! Leave it to me!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
064	Off they go.
065	Now we've truly completed our mission. Good job, both of you.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
066	Come on, let's go home too.
067	Hold up a second!
068	Kagura, Captain Kudan, how about we make a vow?
069	A vow?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
070	Yes! Just like Chihaya said earlier...
071	It'll be a vow to uphold our hearts of justice forever as we advanced towards our goals.
072	All right, Kanon!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0023
073	I am Kagura, Paladin of the Holy Guard! I vow to use this flame to defend all people from tragedy! And, to one day...restore the smiles to those of Wadatsumi!
074	I see...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
075	I am Kudanstein, Captain of the Holy Guard! I will fulfill my own destiny and destroy all who threaten this world.
076	Indeed, destroy.
077	Alrighty, I'm last!
078	I am Kanon, Paladin of the Holy Guard! I will become the light that illuminates this world, and someday...
079	Grrrrr...
080	H-huhh?!
081	Come on! You messed everything up, airhead! Heheheh!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
082	Shrine Maiden Chihaya has returned!
083	We've been expecting you!
084	This is quite some welcome, Chihaya!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0024
085	Yes, it is. We can, once again, continue our reconstruction efforts.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
086	Now that the Holy Guard is gonna join us, I'm sure it'll go well.
087	We'll use our own hands to make it a success.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
088	Okay!	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
089	By the way, Chihaya, about our plans...
090	... ...
091	Mizuchi...what's the matter?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
092	Mizu...chi? Mizuchi! Answer me!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0042
093	So you are the Shrine Maiden Chihaya, savior of Wadatsumi.
094	I have no personal grudge against you, but I will take your life.
095	...?!	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0027
096	Not here...not yet...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0022
097	Shrine Maiden Chihaya! Is something wrong?!
098	She's been stabbed! Summon a healer! Hurry!
099	What's the matter, Kanon? Don't stop so abruptly.
100	Sorry, Captain... I just had the chills for a second.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0035
101	Huh?! Right after we sworn an oath?! That's horrible luck! Did you catch a cold or something?
102	N-no, I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0010
103	Don't hold back from reporting to me if it worsens. Keep your guard up until we return.
104	Ye-yes, Captain.
105	After a moment of uneasiness, Kanon and the others continue on their way back.
106	They still remain unaware of the true enemy that they must defeat.
