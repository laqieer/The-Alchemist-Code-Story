001	Carla? Um... What? Why?	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1002
002	Is that information necessary for you to know? Are you telling me that you are ready to take on more responsibility? My, how reliable you are!	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
003	I-I would never be so bold as to even think myself sufficient support for you!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
004	In that case... Well, I simply wish for you to provide her with assistance when she is in need, though I hope such a time never comes.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
005	Of course, magnificent sister! I apologize for being such an unworthy brother. I hope that in time, I may become someone you are be able to rely on more often!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
006	I wish to help you in any way I can. You are always taking all of the burden upon yourself.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0018
007	I am touched by your concern, Ramses, but there are things you do not need to be burdened with.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
008	This is my burden to bear. Do not let it concern you. I only need you to go now, to Carla.
009	......
010	Are you still disinclined to do so?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
011	For reasons I do not know, you ask me to protect someone who is not even nobility. I understand she is the head of a mercenary guild—a vigilante leader, even, but...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
012	I am very disappointed, Ramses... Was it a lie when you told me you wished to help me?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0022
013	N-no! Of course not!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0027
014	I'm counting on you, Ramses. Do not let me down.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
015	Y-yes! I'm on my way now!
016	Go now, Ramses. There is no reason for you to bear the burdens that I must carry on my own shoulders.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
017	Retreat. We must revise our strategy.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
018	Hmph. This is it for us as well. We now know where to find you. Come, Zofia!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0022
019	Zofia, wait! There's no need for you to do this! There are other things you can fill your days with!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
020	You can make friends; go out and play with them! There are so many more things you can do instead of fighting as a slave to this fiend!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
021	Above all else, I can't bring myself to fight you! We promised, remember?! We were gonna go eat some good food together!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
022	Bean soup, remember?! Don't tell me you forgot! We're friends now, aren't we?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
023	......
024	Zofia!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
025	Gosh darnit, why are they even after me?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
026	Good! You are unhurt.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0046
027	Ramses, thank you. I'm just wondering: Why?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0035
028	I do not have the answer to that. The angel of this desert, my own dear sister, refused to give me any information. If she had not implored me to do so, I would never aid the likes of you!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
029	Your sister asked you to...?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
030	Yes. She requested that I protect Carla.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
031	Nefertiti definitely knows something. I knew she was hiding something! She's being so—dangit... N...n...negligent!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
032	How dare you speak of her like that! She is not negligent! She is charged with so much more than we can ever fathom, and she's doing it all alone!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0015
033	Oh? Well...I guess you're probably right. Sorry.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0036
034	So the desert is under attack again. This is bad.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
035	Balt...?
036	(I have to keep Carla safe. She is the future of this desert!)	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
037	(I will never again lose my way. I will keep my promise to you, Hawk!)
