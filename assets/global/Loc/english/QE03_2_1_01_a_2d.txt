001	Yawn... With so many days off, it's starting to get boring.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0022
002	It's understandable, after a terror attack like that. They still haven't finished repairing the school.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
003	But I can't get my hands on any interesting rumors when I'm cooped up like this.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
004	All I hear are a bunch of stupid rumors.
005	Stupid rumors?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
006	Wow...it's Liz.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0017
007	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
008	Wh-what?
009	You're putting me off. If you have something to say then why don't you say it?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0012
010	Why don't you say how you're scared witless after hearing the stupid rumors that Liz used Alchemy!
011	Huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
012	Someone said they heard you and the headmistress talking about Liz using the forbidden power!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0010
013	We-well...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
014	Then you must have also heard how I denied it.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
015	Rebecca...!
016	I explained to the headmistress as well that there was a misunderstanding.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
017	As far as I can tell, Liz's power is nothing more than an eccentric form of magic.
018	As far as you can tell? There's no basis for...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0013
019	Are you saying that there is a student who has a deeper understanding of magic theory than me?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0016
020	Ack...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0012
021	Let's go, Liz, Alma.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
022	Ah...um, yeah...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
023	Are you sure it's okay for one of the most popular girls in school to make enemies?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
024	Let them say what they want. They're nothing more than lackeys.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
025	Even if they turn against me, ultimately, money will have them flocking back with their tails between their legs.
026	...?
027	I want to become true friends with the two of you...whom I've fought side by side with.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
028	Rebecca...!
029	Huh? And here I was thinking that we've been friends all this time.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
030	...!
031	Yeah, it's a little too late in the game for that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0038
032	Alma...Liz...!
033	In that case...Liz, if you think of me as a true friend, then try not to hide things from me, okay?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
034	Oh...
035	I agree... At least tell the two of us what you know, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
036	Hmm...all right. I can't really believe it myself, but my power might really be—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
037	...So it is after all.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
038	Alma, didn't you say that Vermin were insects who'd evolved because of Philosopher's Stones?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
039	When I used this power to make the Vermin chrysalis evolve, I thought that might be the case.
040	If it is...well, it means that there's no need to dispel everyone's misunderstanding.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
041	Aren't you scared of me...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
042	Do you think I'd avoid you over something like this, Liz? That thought scares me even more.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0017
043	Alma...!
044	In that case, there's only one way to regain your trust, Lisbeth.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
045	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
046	We need to let the other students know that Alchemy is not a dangerous thing.
047	Alchemy...is not a dangerous thing?
048	At any rate, you saved us using Alchemy.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
049	That's why I can believe in you and your strength.
050	If only I could save all the others using this power.
051	That's right. I was seeking this power so that everyone could co-exist together!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
052	Co-exist together?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
053	Both men and women, being able to live together as if it were the most natural thing. Right...I know what to do!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
054	Hey, where are you going?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
055	I'm going to ask the professors how to put an end to this country's curse!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
056	If I can do that, then we can stop the fighting!
057	Curse? You don't mean...?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
058	Sh-she was saying something pretty outrageous things, wasn't she? W-well...in some ways, she saved me the trouble.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
059	The trouble?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
060	Our professor said that she wanted to have a meeting with Liz. She asked me to bring her to school.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
061	It sounded really fishy, so I was planning on not telling her about it, but...
062	Rebecca, that sounds pretty bad.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0021
063	Yes, yes. I know. I'm well aware that this so-called meeting is far from innocent.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0045
064	Let's chase after her!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0032
065	Of course.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0038
066	Oh! I wanted to ask you something, but—
067	I've been waiting for you.
068	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
069	Lisbeth Finn Lustburg...you will now be detained and taken to the Royal Palace of Lustburg.
070	Most likely, you will be sentenced there.
071	...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
