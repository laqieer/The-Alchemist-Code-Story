001	A cacao planation in Old Wratharis near the Desert Zone.
002	Recently, this place has been frequently attacked by monsters. Thus, a guard request was made.
003	Phew. We worked well!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
004	I hope we don't have to worry about the planation anymore.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0030
005	No really! Thanks a lot!
006	Besides your reward, I'd like for you to take some of our famous Rainbow Cacao! You can make delicious chocolate with it!
007	Chocolate?! It's perfect for this season!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
008	Yeah, chocolate! But...how do you make chocolate?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0009
009	When it comes to making it from cacao...it's difficult unless you work together with others.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
010	... ...
011	Um...why is everyone getting so excited about chocolate? And what do you mean by...it's perfect for this season?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
012	Huh?! Wait...Albea...you don't know about Valentine's day?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
013	Y-you know about chocolate, right?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0025
014	I know about chocolate, but...what is Valentine's day? Is it some kind of holiday?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
015	Well, I'll be...!
016	Albea! Valentine's Day is...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
017	The day that men give women flowers and stuff as a present and women give men chocolate...and stuff!
018	Hmm. Let's talk about all of that while we make chocolate...like it's a girl's only event kind of thing.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
019	Huh, wait, that sounds a little...over the top?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
020	Let's do it! I wanna bring home the rainbow chocolate!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0046
021	Yeah!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
022	I still don't know why the monsters attacked yet, please be careful.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
023	Hmm...? It seems like they're already here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
024	Huh?! Wait...Albea...you don't know about Valentine's day?!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0028
