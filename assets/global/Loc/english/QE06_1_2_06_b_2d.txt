001	Well, aren't you adept at running away.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
002	Heh, you could say I've got some motivation to get away.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
003	Unfortunately for you, I can kill you faster than you can run.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0003
004	We'll see if it comes to that.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
005	I knew it. You do have some sort of plot.	VO_azami.azami_battle_0019
006	Didn't I tell you I don't need to explain myself to you?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
007	Then die.
008	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
009	Azami! Are you all right?!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
010	Hmph, I don't need you to worry over me.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0007
011	This is... I see, so you are—	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
012	What?
013	Killing me off will not change the path you all must tread.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
014	All that waits you is death. Except for her, that is.
015	Except...me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
016	I'm surprised you can still joke at a time like this.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0027
017	What is this that I'm sensing...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
018	!!!
019	Azami!
020	I leave this place to you.
021	Azami!!!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
022	It's useless.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
023	Captain Tanosuke!
024	Thought it was a Hidden Ogre, but looks like we made a horrible miscalculation.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
025	We should go!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
026	Yeah. The situation seems to be worse than I thought.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0004
