001	Huh?! Wh-what's going on?!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0022
002	Emmel! Mira! Are you alright?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
003	Huh? Brother? With Nyx and the others, too...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
004	That's good you seem to be unharmed...but where's Emmel?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
005	She was taken off somewhere by that Icona person...
006	So we're too late...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
007	Tch...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
008	But how do you plan to escape from here?
009	Magil is inhibited within this facility, so if we can't even use magic well—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
010	Taking out all of the Engineer Soldiers on the premises with only Nimul's special technique is preposterous, right?
011	I have an idea. 	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
012	An idea...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
013	Speaking of which, you were picking up parts from that destroyed security device a minute ago, huh?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
014	You remember how I mentioned that I was the one who developed the Engineer Soldiers?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
015	In other words, I was entrusted with the fudamental design of most the autonomous machines here in this floating city.  
016	So I'm very knowledgable about the control center for them. So now, if we just do this—
017	NEW ORDERS ACCEPTED. 
018	Nice!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
019	...So you overwrote the thoughts of this Engineer Soldier and made it change sides?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0044
020	Yep! I do sort of get the feeling that I've got one foot outside the bounds of the law though...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
021	With this, the battles within this facility should be a little easier.
022	...Still, we're in trouble. If what Mira said is true, it's possible that Emmel isn't even here anymore. 	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
023	If that's true, then what should we do? Staying here won't help our odds.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
024	...For now, all we can do is temporarily drop out of sight. From there, we'll have to track down Emmel somehow. 	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
025	But are you suggesting we hide here? We're totally isolated and helpless right now. And our airship is surely under the enemy's control. 	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0031
026	Hold on, let's think about this.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
027	...So we need someone who would take us in even knowing the danger it poses... If only we had some means of contacting Minario—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
028	Ah...! We've stayed in one place too long! Nimul, how can we escape from h—
029	You seem to be in a pickle, my friends.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
030	Minario...?! Why are you here?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
031	What do you mean why? I came to help you guys, of course. 	VO_minario.minario_sys_0030
032	I had gone to all the trouble of pulling strings with a connection in the Special Detectives hoping to quietly extract you all from here, but... I guess what you've done works too...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0017
033	Yeah... Sorry about that. 	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
034	Nah, don't sweat it. It's my fault for being slow to mobilize. 	VO_minario.minario_sys_0039
035	Well, no use regretting anything now!
036	Everyone, stay quiet and follow me. I'll take us to a hideout I have for times like this!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
037	Nimul...
038	Seems we have no choice but to take him up on this favor. Let's go, everyone!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
039	Hmm, I see... By regulating your lineage, it's been possible to expand the maximum amount of magil you can handle...	VO_icona.icona_sys_0045
040	Applying selective breeding to humans... Hah, even in this region we haven't stooped to that yet.
041	...What do you plan to do with me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
042	Hmm? No plans, really. I also have no intention of subjecting you to anything painful, so please relax.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
043	All I want is to conduct research. On you all, the Sephira people, of course.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
044	In an era far back in the past, your people were able to contain the Cursed Beast with the aid of Dragon's Blood.
045	Your reign was basically, perfection.
046	Sins were contained. Corruption was erradicated. It can easily be stated that this was the most prosperous land in the region.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
047	Our...region?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
048	It seems you never realized the utopian state you'd been living in. It's time to wake up.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0027
049	But I don't blame you. You'd never seen or known about the rest of the world.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0025
050	By only seeing one side of the fence, you never had anything to compare it to. And so everyday life continued as normal for you.
051	It's a little like me and the people of the Acedia Belt conducting our research and living in our own bubbles for a long time.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
052	What are you trying to say?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
053	It's simple. You've finally left your nest.
054	And now it's time to make your decision.
055	A decision...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
056	Basically, are you willing to team up with me, Emmel?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
057	Your abilities are crucial to achieving my goals, and together we can bring peace back to this region.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0003
058	I... I...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
059	...can't?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
060	The Cursed Beast is not to be controlled by human hands.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
061	To do such a thing... To have a mortal to do a godlike deed... It's inconceivable.
062	I figured.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
063	But people are naturally bound to make mistakes. There are crossroads to face and even the wisest person in the world is going to trip and fall some time in their life.
064	That's right. The people of Sephira chose to live this way by not involving ourselves in sinful conflict.
065	So you're saying it's fine that people should be controlled by something more powerful than man? Is that right?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0038
066	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
067	I'll let you in on a little secret, Emmel.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
068	You see, this clock tower...is alive!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
