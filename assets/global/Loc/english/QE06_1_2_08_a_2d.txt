001	Tch!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
002	You're pretty strong.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
003	But you are nothing compared to me.
004	Nngh!
005	Give it up.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
006	Azami! Where's Azami?!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
007	...
008	Do you mean that pitiful wretch there?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
009	...
010	Charging at me headfirst without a second thought. What a fool she was.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
011	Azami!
012	It's dangerous. You wait here.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0039
013	But...!
014	You promised you'd do as I say, didn't you? Wait here.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
015	Ngh!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
016	That's not a foe you can rush in against without a plan.
017	That is the lord of the pure-blood demons. The Discarnate Power.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
018	You humans always amaze me with the extent of your foolishness. It does not matter how many you gather against me, you cannot defeat me.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
019	How are you alive?! I saw Celis take you out!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
020	Ah, that's right. I haven't yet thanked you for back then.
021	Ngh!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
022	This is not good. Captain Ugachi, will you follow my lead?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
023	Though I'd like to remind you not to tell me what to do—	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
024	Fine, go on.
025	Slug Bind!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0004
026	Ugh, gross! What is that, a slug?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
027	You know, this is a highly technical art.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
028	Sure, but... I just can't.
029	Geez, can you stay out of it, Amane? Captain Ugachi!!!
030	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_battle_0007
031	Amazing! Is it done?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
032	Not yet.
033	Blade Fox, huh? You lot are more formidable than I thought.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
034	It can't be...!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0022
035	Ha! Thanks for the compliment!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
036	You will soon regret ever facing us!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0010
037	Tanosuke! Now!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
038	As if I will let you.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
039	What?!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
040	So you thought you'd cut off my escape with a force field, huh? Do you really think so little of me?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
041	Huzzzaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0032
042	Unbelievable... Not a scratch even after everything we've done!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
043	Don't get me wrong, it stings a bit. It just so happens to be insignificant in comparison to how important our goals are.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
044	Your goals?
045	We're looking for something we've lost.
046	What we desire is behind a force field hidden deep within the Castle Aquila Rubrum.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
047	!!!
048	I just figured if I ate some foxes along the way, I'd be doing a service in helping Wadatsumi become more peaceful.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
049	Peace...? What are you talking about?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
050	If there is a howling fox, it's best to devour it. Devour enough foxes and the human world will end.
051	Then comes the age of demons! That is as Wadatsumi should be!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
052	And there is one who will reign supreme in that world.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
053	How dare you! It is your kind that is devouring people, plunging Wadatsumi into chaos!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
054	How dare you even speak of peace!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
055	Demons do not fight other demons, yet humans constantly fight amongst each other.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
056	And as a result, they destroy the land. The corruption born from human greed will surely bring an end to Wadatsumi.
057	It is humans who bring chaos to Wadatsumi. Is it not natural to think they ought to be eradicated?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_c
058	Constantly in fear of being eaten by a demon, tormented by doubt against their neighbors, humans stain the ground with their corruption.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
059	The earth needs this corruption. When enough of it has saturated the soil, the one we serve will rise again.
060	I just wanted to find what we lost before that happened.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
061	You mean to tell me you destroyed Azami's clan and home for such selfish reasons?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
062	The Kagomurasaki were going to be a nuisance. It's best to get rid of future obstacles as soon as possible.
063	Besides, it's the humans who tyrannically wielded their ideologies over us first.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
064	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
065	Why now? Why...
066	It was not only one thing that we lost. And...we have discovered the existence of another lost thing.
067	There is one among you who uses a strange art, am I correct?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
068	What are you saying?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
069	Now, let me hunt some foxes. That should reveal what we've lost to us.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
070	Here it comes!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
071	Agh!
