001	…! I see... You are also a mixedblood… You've attained power surpassing “despair."
002	However…
003	It's no match for the power of the king. Yours is an incomplete awakening--you can't control your power...let alone--
004	…defeat me without your horns!
005	…!
006	…
007	You are powerless.
008	...If you blame anyone, blame yourself and your own stupidity.
009	Still, I should thank you. Thanks to you and the others, I was able to attain this body.
010	This body has made me king and with the power it grants...Wadatsumi will belong to the demons!
011	…Huzzaaaaaaah!!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0007
012	…Worthless insect.
013	…Cheeky, aren't we--brushing me aside and calling yourself king of Wadatsumi!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
014	That is the reality.
015	…I received a report of a disturbance at Koga's place… What on earth is going on here?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
016	…You don't have to answer. One glance tells me all I need to know. Time to lay down the law.
017	You think you can stop me--a puny human?
018	Koga… Kaede…!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
019	Chief of humans, you shall meet a similar fate.
020	…Heed my words, demon. Is there no turning back from the brink?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
021	It's too late for that.
022	…You really intend to destroy the future that Koga and Kaede envisioned?
023	Without hesitation...
024	...!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
025	That was always my intention. Wadatsumi is mine.
026	…So there's no turning back…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
027	What need is there to go backwards… This will be your resting place.
028	…You're forgetting one thing.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
029	Slumbering Phoenix, heed my call. In the name of the Aquila Rubrum royal family, I beseech thee--
030	Imbibe my royal crimson blood, beat your wings and reign divine fire unto the earth--
031	...Kagutsuchi!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_favorite_0002
032	…!
033	…My blood has resurrected the phoenix... If you hadn't broken the peace…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
034	We would have never had to fight again...!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
035	The arcane power--Kagutsuchi…
036	…Time to reconsider. We can still turn back. We don't need to break our truce.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
037	Now that I have this body, even Kagutsuchi is no match for me.
038	Your fate is sealed. Fade into oblivion!
039	…You're wrong. You misjudge mankind's power.
040	…!
041	Koga's vision of the future fortified by Kaede's willpower--
042	That is what I shall inherit!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0032
043	…What is…this power!?
044	The capacity for people to care for one another is limitless. Even after countless trials and tribulations--
045	That capacity remains infinite…That is the power of human emotion.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
046	…!
047	…May you burn to ash. These are the true wings of the phoenix...The power of our combined wills.
048	…The love I have for Koga and Kaede… And for this great land of Wadatsumi!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
049	This is the pinnacle of it all!
050	...!
051	Kagutsuchi-Kiraboshi!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_favorite_0003
052	Gr…urrrrhhhhhhhh!
053	…Urf…How could a such an insignificant human--
054	…I didn't want it to come to this... However, doing nothing would have cost more lives.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
055	…If you must hate me, then hate me… I will carry that burden.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
056	…Do not think you can be done with me so easily! I will destroy all humans...and…
057	I will make Wadatsumi the kingdom of demons!
058	...Farewell.
059	Your existence cannot be erased. Therefore, it must be sealed tightly away.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0016
060	It is my hope…that you remain sealed away from this earth for all time.
061	...I prayed that this day would never come…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0019
062	…Koga, Kaede…
063	Forgive me… Forgive me…!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0019
064	…What is this…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
065	How did they manage to hide their children in a place like this?
066	In the wake of that event, the balance between humans and demons collapsed.
067	The demons' exploded with resentment after losing the Discarnate Power and Tamba.
068	As for the humans, they could no longer produce food capable of satisfying the demons without a visionary chef.
069	Above all, they lost Koga and Kaede. They turned all their resentment...on demons.
070	…And thus
071	The reconciliation was broken--taking with it a fleeting moment of peace.
072	…That's awful! How could it be…!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0022
084	The Discarnate Power! That's who's to blame... Wait a minute! No…there was someone else!
073	All is for Wadatsumi.
074	That's right! It wasn't just the Discarnate Power. All this time, I thought that if we defeated the demons, our problems would be solved, but…	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
075	…Who is that man!? Does it mean that the demons aren't our only enemies?
085	Not only did he lead the Demon Hunters, but you're saying he's connected to the Discarnate Power and the demons? I don't believe it. And yet…	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
076	It's the truth.
077	This is…evil. It's as if everything that happened was this person's doing…
078	Yes…it is evil. The heart of man can be just as "demonic" as a demon's.
079	Then...we shouldn't only be fighting demons...!?
080	…That's how it seems for now.
081	…?
082	Not all the truth has been revealed yet. Until we meet again.
083	Wait... Hey! WAIT!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
