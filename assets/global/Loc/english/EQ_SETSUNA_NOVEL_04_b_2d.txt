001	Looks like we got away.
002	That was so sc—ahem. I wasn't scared at all!
003	Really? It was very scary for me. It's okay if you thought so, too.
004	I didn't! I wasn't scared at all!
005	Hahaha. You're a tough one, Jayme. Still, I'm surprised my blade couldn't even make a scratch on that thing.
006	Perhaps that was the keeper of this shrine?
007	A keeper? Did you know this place had something like that, Macherie?
008	I wasn't given many details about any of this, but there are legends that tell of a guardian of some sort.
009	I had assumed that there would be some form of trial, one that happened to be called the keeper.
010	Legend says that only those with the power to overcome the keeper will be able to reach the jewel.
011	You mean to tell me that the people of the shrine knew there would be a trial like this, and they still sent you here alone?
012	I-I doubt even the Shrine Monarch knew exactly what would be here.
013	Even so, this isn't something they should have tasked you to handle alone!
014	It's for the good of the village.
015	Macherie...
016	(Not only Jayme, but Macherie, too, is dedicated to doing what she must for the people she loves.)
017	(They fight, protect, and care for one another in this village.)
018	What's good for the village is good for Jayme.
019	Sis...
020	For that, I'm willing to sacrifice myself if—
021	Macherie!
022	Don't you dare finish that sentence.
023	We don't want to hear you say that. Urk!
024	Setsuna?!
025	Setsuna!
026	(What she was about to say... A life lost will only ruin another life.)
027	(Because those who lose the people they love can become...can become...)
028	Those with people whom they want to protect should never say such a thing.
029	Setsuna...
030	Yes...you're right. I'm sorry, Setsuna.
031	Setsuna... If you'd like—
032	Don't ask me that.
033	But...!
034	You're kind, Macherie. But please, don't ask me that.
035	(If she does, I'll probably be unable to resist.)
036	(If I allow myself to be dependent on them, I'll never be able to stand on my own again.)
037	I decided that I would never again have something I needed to protect.
