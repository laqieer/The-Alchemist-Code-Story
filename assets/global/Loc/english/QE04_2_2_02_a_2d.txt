001	Argh... The blasted Jam! They just won't stop springing up everywhere...	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	Let's keep our guard up. We can't afford to suffer any further casualties.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
003	Well then, let's hear the continuation of your story.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
004	Come now, boy...if you remain silent, you could very well bring about the destruction of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
005	Saga will not perish! I will keep my promise at all costs!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0017
006	Hm...so now you admit that you did make a promise. Isn't it about time you told everything?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
007	This is a brutal story about how I destroyed the wind and was burdened with the consequences.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0027
008	Are you prepared to allow Tamis to hear all of what I have to say?
009	...Well...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
010	Mocca, don't worry about me. I'm fine, Fuu. I will accept anything for the sake of protecting the future of Saga.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_1011
011	The future of Saga, huh? Here we go again...	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1019
012	Do you feel like talking now?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
013	Protect the village and guard it against harm.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
014	As I must manage the Matter, I cannot afford to exterminate the Jam. Those are the conditions I am setting forth.
015	...Understood!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
016	First, let me give you a history lesson...about Gluttony Foss' Sacred Stone Beelzebub and the containment of its gluttonous power.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
017	What...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
018	Long ago, in the south of Gluttony, there was a large tree called Sephiron that was decorated with a mysterious pattern.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
019	This pattern was detailed, and, if deciphered, it was rumored that you could obtain a vast variety of knowledge.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
020	It was a holy tree that was said to hold the power of purification.
021	The power of purification...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
022	Thus, it held the power to suppress Beelzebub's gluttonous power!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
023	The people who prospered under the tree of Sephiron...the Sephira...they received mysterious powers and wisdom from it.
024	Due to this, many of them held a high concentration of Alchemia within them.
025	Furthermore, they were able to use Alchemia to wield their Spiritbonding.
026	Is that kind of like Alchemy?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
027	Yes. However, seeing this power as a threat, the Gluttony army went on a rampage and destroyed both Sephiron and the people of Sephira.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
028	So...the power of purification was lost.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
029	Yes. Beelzebub's rampage resulted in turning southern Gluttony Foss into a desert.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
030	Beelzebub's rampage...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
031	However, the rampage was suppressed immediately.	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1008
032	How?	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0025
033	We used the power of the four Matters that exist within Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
034	Wait, Beelzebub was in Gluttony's possession...so why was Saga's Matter used?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
035	At the time, the Kingdom of Gluttony and the successor of the Alize people formed an alliance.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
036	In order to contain the berserk Beelzebub.
037	?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
038	Gluttony Foss and...Saga were working together?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
