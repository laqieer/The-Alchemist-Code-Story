001	We've withdrawn for now...but their main forces are still there! Argh! Why at a time like this...?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
002	I'm not even sure how many of them there are! Is there any other option besides advancing forward? No. Our only option is to advance forward and do everything we can to reach Port Nahema!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
003	We can't turn back, but...if we advance forward, we'll be practically signing our death warrants.	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
004	Let's go. Standing around here won't change anything. I'll lead the way. Let's aim head-on for Port Nahema!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
005	There's always hope if we don't give up...isn't that right? We're not alone. Rega is here with us as well. I'm sure we'll be all right!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
006	You guys don't need to be so worried! Leave this to me!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
007	Rega...?! What do you think you can accomplish here on your own?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
008	I'm good at these kinds of things. Don't you remember the first time I met the two of you?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0038
009	Now that I think about it...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
010	This is one way to use the power of the wind! Just watch! Hyah!!!	VO_rega.rega_battle_0012
011	What...is this?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
012	Orders aside...it doesn't feel right to surround three kids with this many troops.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0030
013	I wish they would hurry up and give us the signal! Maybe we should just go ahead and end it quickly.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0010
014	What...?! The Jam?! Argh! What are they doing here?! Ahhh!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0025
015	?! What's wrong with you...?! What are you doing?! Wahh?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0026
016	The Jam...?! Noooo! Dieee!!!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
017	Ugfff! How dare you?! Hey, you just hit me! Arghhh!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0025
018	What's going on?! Why are the Gluttony soldiers...fighting amongst themselves?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
019	Give it a bit more time. The confusion should spread. Let's take advantage of that opening and advance forward!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
020	Rega...what did you do?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
