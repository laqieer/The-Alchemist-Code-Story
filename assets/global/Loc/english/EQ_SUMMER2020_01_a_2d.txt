001	There's the beach!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
002	Wait, what's with this?! It's covered in garbage!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
003	I brought things to play on the beach with, but we won't be able to with all this. Jeez.
004	We didn't come here to play, you know... Still, is our mission this time to pick up trash?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
005	No... We're supposed to be on guard duty and deal with the recent rash of attacks by humanoid machines on the beach.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
006	Humanoid machines...
007	Why would anyone throw their trash away in a public space?! Unforgivable... Unbelievable... Unacceptable!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
008	But who left this trash here?
009	Regular trash, oversized trash, mechanical trash... I can't imagine it's all just trash from beachgoers.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
010	Yeah...
011	I understand your anger, but I think we should get a handle on the current situation first.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0001
012	B-but how are we supposed to do that?!
013	Haa... Not good, not good. Gotta hold it in. Calm, calm...
014	It's just like Albea said. I have to keep calm...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
015	It's understandable that you're angry. I'm angry, too.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
016	It's unthinkable to throw machines away like this. That's why we have to look into this.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0017
017	Wait, wait!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0008
018	Ahaha! Over here!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0008
019	...
020	Aw, no fair!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0022
021	You...really want to do that?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
022	We came all the way here to get to this beach, after all! I wanted to quickly finish our work and have fun with everyone!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
023	There there. Let's just clean up the beach until the humanoid machines show up for now.
024	We can't just leave it in this pitiful situation, after all.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0030
025	Awww...
026	Well, it can't be helped! In order for all of us to have the most fun, we've got to knock these problems out!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
027	Still, it's pretty rare for Noah, Emma, and Pamela not to work together.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
028	I-is that not allowed?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
029	No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I just thought that it might be easier for you to interact with people that you're familiar with.
030	That is...probably true. I'm always with those two.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
031	They help calm me down when I get angry and give me a silver spoon when I'm about to blow my top...
032	(A silver spoon?)
033	They always take care of me. But I decided things can't stay this way.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
034	I want to change myself. That's why I decided to try working separately from them this time.
035	Struggling against yourself in order to ease the burden on your friends... How wonderful, Noah! I may not be able to do much, but allow me to help you where I can!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0044
036	Suzuka...
037	Well, with that decided, let's get to cleaning this beach...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
038	...
039	Isn't there too much trash here? Why? Why is there so much of it? Isn't it crazy that people would dump trash at a beach in the first place?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
040	Noah.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
041	Oh!
042	...It's all right. I got it under control.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
043	Getting mad at this solves nothing. In order to solve this problem, we've got to stop the source of this garbage.
044	You're right. Albea did say that we should get a handle on the current situation first and all.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
045	Albea...
046	It's understandable that you're angry. I'm angry, too.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
047	It's unthinkable to throw machines away like this. That's why we have to look into this.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0017
048	Albea is amazing. She said she was angry, but she didn't look like she was at all.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
049	I have to do better, too!
050	This would totally still work if it just got fixed up a bit.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
051	They probably thought there's no need to fix it. I guess not everyone wants to repair things.
052	...
053	(This... Is this what running my repair shop, Magbea, can bring?)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0010
054	(I can't put a smile on my face and say that my brother is proud of me.)
055	(This is why I still haven't figured out the mechanism in the comb my brother gave me.)
056	That's a cute comb. Is it yours, Albea?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
057	Um, yeah...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
058	Sorry, I got lost in the clouds for a moment. Let's get to cleaning this beach.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0035
059	You're really worried about those humanoid machines, aren't you?
060	You get straight to heart of things, don't you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0011
061	I'm not that worried about them. I understand that machines can hurt people.
062	However, actually seeing the consequences of it... It upsets me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
063	I don't build and maintain machines so they'll be used like this. At least, that's how I feel about it.
064	That's why I don't feel good about machines being used like this even if I didn't build them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
065	Albea...
066	Eeek!
067	Huh?!
068	Ahhh! A robot took the seashells I found!
069	It took my water donut!
070	What in the world?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
071	Why are Alkaroids...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
072	Aren't those AJ2000s and AJ2500s?
073	Grrahck! Gah!	VO_aj2000.aj2000_sys_0043
074	Uh...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
075	They're coming, Albea!
