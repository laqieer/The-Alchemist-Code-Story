002	Sumeragi?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_favorite_0001
003	We...did the right thing, didn't we?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
004	......
005	What our father and mother did had many effects that profoundly impacted the land. But among those effects was the loss of someone's entire family—everyone dear to him.
006	As the children of those responsible, we must accept the consequences for that.
007	At least, that's what the people of Wadatsumi seemed to think. But that's not very fair either, is it?
008	Grrah! It's all your fault! All because your parents were naive dreamers who thought humans and demons could just get along!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
009	If only you were never born... If only you didn't exist, my family wouldn't have had to die! You don't deserve to live!
010	Really? We don't?
011	Even though we were born from so much love?
012	And you! You're our queen, yet you have the gall to shelter these demon spawn in our royal castle?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
013	I'll thank you not to refer to them in such a manner. Have these children done anyone any harm? I think not!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0014
014	Yet you, driven by fear and blind rage, have taken it upon yourself to attack defenseless children in their own home. It's clear who is truly the "demon spawn" in this scenario.
015	You dare speak to your own subject that way? After everything I've been through?! I see now the rumors were true. Our queen is in league with the demons!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
016	You aim to slaughter the people of Wadatsumi!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0024
017	...!
018	Stop harassing our queen! Come here at once, you cretin!
019	Mikaboshi!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0027
020	Let me see your wound... Good, it isn't deep. You'll be okay. I'll call a medic and see to it you're properly patched up.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
021	I should be protecting you, not the other way around...
022	I just want to see you smile.
023	How can I smile when you're hurt?!
024	I'm sorry. Just...
025	Please, don't blame that man. He's not a bad person.
026	What?!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
027	Father and Mother weren't bad people. Lady Mitsuha, you aren't either. And of course, neither are Sumeragi and I.
028	Mikaboshi...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_favorite_0001
029	Everyone's just scared. Everyone just wants to be happy.
030	Which is why we... We, and no one else, have to be the ones to bear this burden.
031	Mikaboshi...
032	We promised ourselves that we would realize our parent's will.
033	We promised to return Wadatsumi back to its true, former, glorious "normal."
034	And we promised to make you happy, Lady Mitsuha.
035	Mikaboshi...
036	......
037	Of course we did the right thing! Come on, now. Don't be so glum.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
038	But...we left without saying a word...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
039	Well, yeah! You think Lady Mitsuha would have let us go if we'd asked her?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0030
040	I suppose not.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
041	Staying in the castle any longer would have just caused further problems for her.
042	Is your eye okay?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
043	Completely fine. It actually healed super fast! Probably because of my demon blood.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
044	Hmph. If you're bragging about that, I guess you really are fine.
045	......
046	Is that...Father's knife?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
047	Yeah. And his recipe journal. I have something in mind for them. Something I need to do.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
048	What is it?
049	I've just been thinking, that's all.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
050	About what?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
051	The demon that's ahead of us.
052	Huh? Are you trying to make fun of me or something?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0016
053	No, no. That's not what I'm saying. I just think...
054	Well, I think it's clear that someone's will is behind everything that's happened. Someone harboring a great deal of malice in their heart.
055	Oh?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0025
056	Wadatsumi, our parents, Lady Mitsuha, you and I... We've all been thrown into absolute bedlam by the demon called malice.
057	That is the real enemy you and I must face.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0027
058	...
