001	So you are telling me nobody knows where the Sephira have gone?	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0005
002	Exactly. They simply disappeared without a trace.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
003	Someone must be sheltering them. Any information on that?	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0022
004	No.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
005	Then you are of no use to me. Kill him, Zofia.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0045
006	Work! Clean up!	VO_zophy.zophy_battle_0030
007	Pity. If he had more information... Well, no matter. I'll just have to scour the entire desert.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0006
008	I suppose this is as good a time as any to officially begin the campaign. Zofia, let's go.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0031
009	Kay.	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0004
010	Nefertiti! Are you here?!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
011	Balt. My, what an unexpected delight to see you here. Is everything all right?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
012	Where's Carla?! She hasn't returned since you had her come here! What have you done to her?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
013	Please, calm yourself. I can understand why you might be worried, but she should be just fine.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
014	So you do know what's happened to her! You nobles never change, always hiding things from the people of this desert!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
015	I'll say it again. Please calm down. I know nothing.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
016	What did you do with her?! I already know that there's no changing the way you nobles only think of yourselves.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0017
017	Just keep Carla out of your schemes! Hawk entrusted her to me! I will not allow any harm to come to her!
018	We all have our own ideas on how to help the desert. We aren't as self-centered as you think.	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
019	Then why did you not respond to Hawk when he needed you the most?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
020	......
021	Dang it!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
022	Balt. I envy that you fight for those you wish to protect.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
023	Are you willing to talk?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
024	It's not that. I was simply reflecting on how some share their burdens, while others shoulder them alone.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
025	To protect the entirety of the desert, we need all of its inhabitants to work toward the same goal. Unfortunately, there are too many desires and needs among the people.
026	So each individual must fight in their own way for their own justice. That is all I can say.
027	...!
028	......
029	You! Do you know where Carla is?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
030	Wha—?! I know nothing. Nothing, I say!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0012
031	You do know, don't you? Please, I have to protect her!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0041
032	I said I don't know!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0013
033	Tch! You and Nefertiti both, what are you hiding?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
034	I have someone I wish to protect... That's all I want to do! You nobles are always...!
035	You keep so much from us, and yet you do nothing with what you hold back. I will never understand you!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
036	What do you know of my sister?! You have no idea what she has to endure!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0015
037	She is kind. People may not understand or see it, but she thinks of the desert and the well-being of its people more than anybody else!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0018
038	Then why can you not understand how I feel?! That I would do anything for Carla!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0013
039	...!
040	I made a promise to a friend, and...I will not allow myself to lose another friend!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
041	I have to be there for Carla! I swore to myself to protect her!
042	Then...come with me.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
043	What?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
044	To tell you honestly, I find you all so unpleasant. You wail and fuss without knowing all the facts.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0016
045	And yet, I too wish to be there for my sister, so...I may understand how you feel...slightly.
046	I'll take you to Carla.
047	Thank you, Ramses!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
048	Walk. That way.	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0004
049	......
050	Hm...mnn. Wh-where...? Where am I? Nefertiti summoned me and—	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
051	Carla! Thank the gods you're okay!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
052	Balt! Ramses?! What's going on?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
053	There she is. Seize her.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
054	...?!
055	What the—?! What do you want?! Whoa!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
056	I won't let you take her! What happened to the guards outside?!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0004
057	It is the height of folly to think we can be stopped by mere guards. If you get in our way, you will share their fate.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
058	Were they tailing us?! I was too careless!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0021
059	Take the girl. Kill the rest.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
060	What are you—?! What do you want?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
061	Go!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0017
062	You'll have to get through me first!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0007
