001	Hahhh!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0009
002	Argh! Why does it disappear?! Perhaps, like Dias said, I still have doubts in my mind!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0029
003	He's continued to move forward.
004	Yet, I remain the same, allowing the gap to widen between the two of us!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
005	Don't be impatient, Logi.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0002
006	Dad!
007	Irritation is an emotion that can also lead to the craving of power.	VO_zeke..zeke_sys_0031
008	In order to avoid a situation where your heart is consumed by your power, you must make an effort to remain composed at all times.
009	...!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
010	We of the Blue Flame Guard head towards the ruins of Fort Mugarde, one of the two large forts within the territory of old Wratharis.
011	Sabareta should re-gather all of his troops there. We must capture it and rescue Agatha at all costs.
012	Don't doubt yourself, Logi. Instead, single-mindedly immerse yourself in the mission. In time, your hesitation will disappear.
013	Okay, dad.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
014	Reporting!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
015	A Paladin...?	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
016	A report? What's occurred?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0006
017	A-at Fort Gilrack...the ancient weapon...the Demon was resurrected! The Holy Guard has been devastated!
018	The Demon?!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0026
019	The ancient weapon?! Is that the weapon that Agatha said led to the demise of ancient civilization?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
020	So, it truly did exist! If we do not take care of it quickly, it will have grave consequences. We must hurry!
021	No, Sir. The Demon was defeated by Sir Dias!
022	However, the damage to our Paladins has been tremendous. We are currently requesting reinforcements to rebuild our army.
023	That concludes our current status report.
024	Dias defeated it!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
025	He defeated the Demon on his own?! He didn't...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0012
026	What's the matter, dad?
027	It's nothing.
028	There is a possibility that the Lizard Brigade possess another Demon. Please be careful.
029	We'll need to hit the Lizard Brigade's main force as soon as possible. Logi, let's hurry to the ruins of Fort Mugarde.
030	Dias took down a Demon on his own. He truly is amazing. As for me...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
031	That's too much power...for Dias to wield on his own.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
032	Huh?
033	There's no time to feel depressed. We need to hurry. Let's go!
034	Y-yes, Sir! Right... There's no time to hesitate.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0018
035	I can't let Dias shoulder any more burden than he already has!
036	Just you wait and see. I'm going to create a world where Agatha can be happy in!
