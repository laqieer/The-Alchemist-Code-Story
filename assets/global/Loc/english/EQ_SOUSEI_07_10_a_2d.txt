001	...
002	It's working! Then this should...
003	Wait, Seeker! "Make room!"
004	Huh?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
005	This Cursed Beast can control weather?! It can control lightning?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
006	That...was a human? But one not of this region...with a power also not from here.
007	Then, you should leave, human. I know not what methods you used to reach this closed off region.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0001
008	However, this place is a land of ruin forsaken by the gods. There is nothing you for you here.
009	Did that Cursed Beast just...
010	Did it just speak to us?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
011	.........
012	Hold on. Wait a second! What do you mean this place was forsaken by the gods?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
013	You were the one who ruined this region...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
014	Or did you not?!
015	I see. You are a visitor from the future. Then I must have fulfilled my role.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
016	Listen well, human. Creation was destroyed by the flood of sin. And yet the fires of hope have not been extinguished.
017	Wait for it. Crave it. A new era will come once again! Those golden days will return!
018	I am but a pillar protecting the human world until that day arrives.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
019	A Cursed Beast...protecting humans?
020	If so, then what are you doing right now?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
021	What is your reason for driving these people—the people of the Avaritia Belt—into a corner like this?!
022	Not...yet! I can...still fight!
023	Those people are failures.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
024	Failures?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	After the age of dragons crumbled, we called on the gods to bring new knowledge to this world.
026	What?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
027	(You brought about us humans... It's just as Bianca said. Then that means...)
028	Humans. You who will inherit our future. We wish for eternal prosperity this time.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
029	Because of this sin of becoming the stagnation of the human world, the ladder to the end of the world, is unneeded.
030	We Beasts are the pillars that have taken sin from you humans to give you a better world.
031	That is our duty, the reason we pillar Beasts exist.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
032	Taking the sin from humans...
033	That doesn't make sense. Aren't they made to eradicate humans?
034	That's an interesting thing you mention, my young friend.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
035	Let me ask you. Who exactly was it that told you that?
036	That's just... I mean, what else would they exist for?!
037	The Cursed Beasts threaten our lives by simply existing! This whole world has been ruined just because of their presence, right?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
038	I cannot disagree.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
039	But consider this: the fact that we will be decimated by the Cursed Beasts does not necessarily mean that their purpose exists for that purpose.
040	For example, humans cut down trees to make firewood, not for the sake of eliminating the forest.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
041	From what I've observed, the Cursed Beasts accumulate the sin of people.
042	The corruption of the people of each region, Lust in this region's case, is what feeds the Cursed Beasts.
043	So the destruction of the regions is simply a kind of...side effect?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
044	Unless even that is just a part of some greater process.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
045	So that is the true purpose of the Cursed Beasts?
046	That's impossible... You expect us to believe that nonsense? Your actions are threatening the existence of humans!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
047	You're trying to destroy this region right now! How do you explain that?!
048	They are necessary sacrifices. To overcome sin, an equal virtue is essential. Therefore, we have waited.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0001
049	We waited for the time when the power to overthrow the region was birthed and nurtured within humans.
050	...
051	The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.
052	The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.
053	And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0019
054	They were not born into this region.
055	That is what has led to this ending.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
056	Doing something so self-serving—!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
057	My, my, now this is an interesting conversation.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_battle_0019
058	I guess so. Sounds to me like all they did was put a lid on their tough situation.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0006
059	All right! We landed successfully! I'm going to head out. What are you going to do?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0007
060	Luckily, the Cursed Beast hasn't deployed its sanctuary.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
061	So I'll use this ship's resources to give it a hard time.
062	Roger that! I'll leave you to it!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
063	An intelligent Cursed Beast that understands human speech and can communicate. If this is their true form, then...
064	I might've just found myself a pretty interesting research subject.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
065	This region's people are unfit to be the seeds left behind in the new world.
066	What?
067	Aaaaaaahhh!
068	Stop! You can't wound it with your gear!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
069	Leave this to us and retreat!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
070	What are you saying?!
071	That is the strongest being! It's an obstacle that we are meant to defeat and overcome!
072	Will there ever be a greater chance to surpass that Beast, to surpass Lord Kubera?! This is the only chance for us to earn the honor of being the strongest!
073	.........
074	Do you see? These people are biologically deranged. Their natural instincts are broken.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
075	These are not the people who will inherit our next age.
076	Respecting strength rather than compassion and loving violence rather than order.
077	We cannot entrust our hope to beings such as this.
078	That is why I will decimate them. I will eradicate them. For the tomorrow we wish for, I must destroy this region!
079	Tch!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
080	Nimul! The townspeople...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
081	We cannot allow you to go any further.
082	Why do you block my path, visitor?
083	They are not worthy of your protection. I have told that they are not beings that should be given tomorrow, and yet...	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0003
084	There are no ranks to life!
085	I will admit that I do not understand their values.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
086	Fighting just to get stronger—and the mentality of using the lives of their comrades and themselves as tools to do so.
087	It's clear that they are incompatible with us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
088	But to use that to as a reason to kill them? To take their lives?!
089	That is not right. That should never be the way things are done.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0021
090	That's the future we want! The tomorrow we want!
091	Bear and accept this sin as well! There's more life yet to come!
092	Incomprehensible. That contradicts our duty. I will not heed your wish.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0001
093	No! Listen to my words!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
094	Yes, just like they did...!
095	What?
096	Access to the Invidia Belt confirmed.
097	Access to the Ire Belt confirmed.
098	We will become stones and submit to your will.
099	So that is your power! My fellow pillar Beasts...!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
100	Here I come, Mammon! Our answer is choosing to accept our sins!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
