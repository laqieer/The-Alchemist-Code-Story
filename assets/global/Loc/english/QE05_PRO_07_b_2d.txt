001	Why?! Why won't you fight me properly?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
002	Eh. I'm not really feeling it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	What?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
004	Come on. Can you really say that you mean to kill me? I don't feel like you're really trying.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
005	I'm not joking! I'll make you leave if you don't do so yourself!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
006	I'm willing to take that bet.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
007	Then...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0010
008	I have no choice!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
009	...
010	Why aren't you trying to avoid my attacks?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
011	It's my policy to never let a woman cry.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
012	What?
013	Even if those tears, uh, aren't yours or whatever, it's part of my motto to identify the reason behind them and stay until the tears are gone.
014	You...are a strange man.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
015	Uh...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
016	Why are you so determined to help me?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
017	You've forgotten already? I told you, I can't just sell out a friend that easily, even to save my own hide.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
018	A friend?! You're saying that I'm your friend? That's ridiculous.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
019	I'm sorry to say it, but that's the way it is. I don't have that many friends, but we've been stuck together for long enough that I kinda feel like you're one of 'em.	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_1015
020	B-but...!
021	Anyway, I've got a question for you, friend.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
022	Wh-what kind of question?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
023	I wanna know what you've been all torn up over.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
024	I-I... Nngh... I...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
025	Seriously, what is making you cry like this? There's got to be some reason for it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
026	I-it doesn't matter! It's nothing you have to worry about!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
027	Yes, it is. I can't leave you here knowing that there's something you're worried about. That'd be the same as selling you out. I couldn't do that to a friend.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
028	You...
029	Do you get it yet? I'd rather die than not help you out of whatever dilemma you've gotten yourself wrapped up in.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
030	I...
031	You must be joking.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
032	I get that a lot.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
033	Why...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
034	Why won't you just listen to me? If you stay with me, you could die!
035	I knew it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
036	Huh...?
037	I kind of got that sense. Tsk, tsk. This all would have been easier if you'd just said that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
038	Aren't you scared?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
039	There's no person in this world who isn't afraid of death, but...given the choice of running from death or doing what I can to help a friend, I would choose the latter every time.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
040	I...!
041	Anyway, I think you've misjudged me a bit.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
042	How so?
043	I have intimate knowledge of how to make use of death.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
044	Y-you...
045	Well, you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. At least trust me enough come with me instead of staying here and waiting for certain death. Can you do that?
046	...
047	I... You're... You're strange.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
048	Heh. Well, then, young lady... Where can I escort you to?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
049	The man with red hair...
050	What?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
051	I must find Logi Crowley. The only thing that can change this world...lies in his blood.
052	Okay...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
053	Tamis and the others should return shortly. Let's stop here for now.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
054	Wait! One more time!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
055	What?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0025
056	Please, just one more time! I just have this feeling that if I do it one more time, I'll finally be able to lock it down!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
057	Interesting. Why not? I'm willing to believe that.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
058	Thank you! Okay, one more time...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0006
059	There's no way to save the people of Lustburg if I can't even defeat one person.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
060	I'll definitely learn Voda's technique and... Grr! Who's she calling flat-chested?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
061	Haaa... Haaa... Envylia's Leviathan and Wratharis' Satna...	VO_dios.dios_battle_0020
062	Slothstein's Belphegor and Gluttony Foss' Beelzebub...
063	Then, finally, Lustburg's Asmodeus.
064	Of the seven Sacred Stones, these five have begun to wreak havoc. Now, with the Mikaboshi making its appearance...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
065	It's obvious that the balance of power in this world is beginning to fall apart!
066	The Sacred Stones will call upon each other when the balance of power in this world comes undone.
067	The Sephira, who hold all the knowledge of the Alchemy Source, must know something about why this is all happening!
068	Agatha, just watch... I will definitely find you!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
069	Nrgh!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0022
070	Mocca! Are you all right?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
071	Y-yes, I'm fine. I still have this, which Georgios left to me. I just need...some rest.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
072	Of course. Don't push yourself too hard.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
073	The curse affecting Mocca's body is getting stronger. We must find them before it's too late!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
074	The Sephira... I will find that legendary tribe, even if it is the last thing I do!
075	Hey, so... What is the boss doing?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
076	You mean, like with the flowers and everything? Some kind of gesture to those who have fallen on the battlefield, I heard.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
077	Apparently, it's some old tradition that's been passed down from knights of the Envylia kingdom.
078	In the end, these people have become victims of the tempestuous Sacred Stones, just as we did.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
079	After all the time I've spent traveling, visiting these ruins of past lives, and meeting new people, I have learned something important.
080	I have learned that the precarious balance of this world is at risk.
081	In order to protect more people from being subject to more loss, more unhappiness...that balance must be protected.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
082	For my father, for Dias...and for Agatha.
083	That is why I must find the Sephira. I must.
084	I have this feeling that if I could just find them, I would take another step toward meeting Agatha again.
085	Agatha, I promise I will find you. Wait just a little longer!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
086	The Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance is compromised.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
087	In response, the hearts of the people shall be thrown into disarray and become agitated. Before long, the waves of emotion will swell and bring about a new era.
088	The result will be lasting peace...or a devastating tragedy unlike any that have come before, one which will inspire shudders of horror to any who think of it.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
089	After all, I have only one mission: To watch for myself how this all ends.
090	This never-ending cycle of people craving the Sacred Stones, and the Sacred Stones wreaking merry havoc upon their lives...
091	The wills of the seven Stones have begun to make their ripples in this world...and the world is growing more and more chaotic.
092	I shall stand witness to the waves of history that break again and again upon the shores of this world.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
