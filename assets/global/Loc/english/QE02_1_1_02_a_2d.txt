001	Our non-stop ride must've given you a chill. Drink this. It'll warm you a little.
002	... ...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
003	What's the matter? Cold soup won't do much to warm your spirits. Better drink up while it's hot.
004	What do you plan to do with me?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
005	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
006	From what I heard of your conversation at the cathedral, it didn't sound like you were any friend of Ethan.
007	Who are you?
008	Jeez, girl. We escaped that mess together. Can't you trust me?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
009	Well...
010	Hukk! Nooo! Don't be fooled, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0015
011	Huh? A-Allie?!
012	Well, I'll be... This thing can talk?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
013	N-no! It shouldn't have that feature! Allie, are you really speaking?
014	Of course I am, aye! I'm gonna protect you, Fiona!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0007
015	Don't let this strange hooligan sweet talk you into anything!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0008
016	Hooligan?
017	How is this even possible?! It's a miracle!
018	My father was right! He used to say, 'Treasure something and you'll give it life.'
019	True. You've been hugging that thing from since you were little. It might as well sprout a soul or two.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
020	Since I was little? How do you know that?
021	Never mind. Anyway, drink up and warm yourself.
022	If you're worried, go ahead and run an ingredient analysis on it. Can't guarantee the taste though.
023	Analyzing... Analyzing... Analysis complete, aye! No poison or harmful ingredients detected.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0006
024	It's a cheap soup for commoners with little nutrition, aye.
025	...You didn't have to mention the price.
026	It's delicious!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0020
027	Pretty good, right?
028	...!
029	Them again. What a persistent bunch.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
030	Alkaroids. They're androids mass produced by the Beckrams.
031	That's the AJ20 Model, an earlier production type, aye.
032	One energy recharge will allow it to run for three days.
033	Three days? Jeez, I guess that rules out waiting around for them to run out of power.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
034	Sorry, bud. I'm gonna have to terminate your friends.
035	They're no friends of mine, aye! Don't lump us together!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0032
036	Alkemonos are pet robots developed by us, the Elesters.
037	Unlike the Alkaroids that were mass-produced for manual labor and security, they won't harm people.
038	A pet? Why would you need something like that?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
039	My father invented them after seeing the country grow more brutal under the advances of mechanization.
040	He wanted to create something that would give peace to people,
041	The Alkemono was developed to make people aware of the importance of empathy.
042	Unlike the Alkaroids that were manufactured primarily for profit, the development philosophy itself is completely different.
043	I see. Sounds like something Mayor Edward would come up with.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
044	I doubt this new droid-wielding mayor would've sat well with your old man.
045	Huh? You knew my father?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
