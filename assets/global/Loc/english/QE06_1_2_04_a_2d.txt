001	Hic... Hic...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0018
002	You almost done? We should really get back to hunting down Hidden Ogres.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
003	But...! But I—!
004	All right, fine.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
005	Huh?
006	...
007	It's...been a while since I've been comforted like this.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
008	That's kind of sad. Well, I'm glad you're done crying.
009	...?!
010	...
011	What was that?
012	Captain Tanosuke...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
013	What is it?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
014	Is it weird that didn't feel like the first time you've pat me on the head? It felt...strangely familiar...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
015	Are you sure you're not just imagining it?
016	That's not all.
040	Sometimes I hear a voice not my own in my head. I see visions of places I've never seen before.
017	I sometimes feel like I'm not myself.
018	Yeah, I get what you mean.
019	Captain Tanosuke?
020	We've wasted enough time already. We need to get back to our mission.
021	But...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
022	You are Amane, member of the Third Squad of the Blade Fox. My subordinate. Don't make it more complicated than it has to be. You're not very good at thinking about that stuff.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
023	That's true... Wait, did you just insult me at the end there?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
024	Look, I don't want to worry about you like this anymore, so can you promise me not to go off on your own like that again?
025	Right! I promise!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
026	Meals and blades are made to what?!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.celis_story0601_0012
027	To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.azami_story0601_0023
028	To bring about blissful days of joy!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.amane_story0601_0023
029	With our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!	QE06_1_1_01_a_2d.amane_azami_story0601_0024
030	...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
031	What's up?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
032	I just remembered an oath, a promise I made when I was younger. I cannot die until I fulfill that oath.
033	An oath, huh?
034	Yes. Every promise I make is another reason why I cannot die.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
035	That is a good thing. Now, shall we get going?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
036	Right! Captain Tanosuke, give me your orders!
037	You being obedient feels kinda weird.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0011
038	Okay, let's take care of these demons and get back to searching for Hidden Ogres!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0041
039	You got it!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0038
