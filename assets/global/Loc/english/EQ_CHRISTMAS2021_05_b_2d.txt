001	N-numaaa…	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
002	Phew… They finally calmed down a bit.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
003	…They were fighting really hard to protect their tree and snow sculptures.	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0019
004	Yeah… Looks like we really did end up interfering with their holiday party. Now I feel kinda bad…
005	Mer…
006	Look, they must have made all these by hand. It looks like they were really enjoying themselves.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
007	Yeah, they're really pretty.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
008	Hey, by any chance, are you guys…	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
009	What's all this commotion? I can't focus on my work at all over here!
010	...Wait a minute. Aren't those the decorations I sent off with the delivery person? What are they doing in a place like this?
011	…
012	N-numa…	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0020
013	…I see, so they just wanted to try having a holiday party of their own.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0045
014	It sounds like they learned by watching people, but even after all their preparations, they still felt like something was missing.
015	But as soon as they saw the decorations, they knew they were exactly what they needed.
016	Rochelle, you can…understand these creatures?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
017	Well I did grow up in the forest, you know. I wouldn't be much of a black and white bear if I couldn't even understand this much.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
018	I… Wow… Never underestimate black and white bears, I guess…
019	Even beasts can tell how great these decorations are. They really do add to the the snow sculptures. The party just wouldn't be the same without them.	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0015
020	That's why they stole them from the delivery person. And then they knocked down all those trees and made a wall to prevent anyone from interfering with their party.
021	So that's what happened to all those trees…
022	When they gathered around the boy earlier, they weren't trying to surround him. They just wanted to invite him to their holiday party. The holidays are for the kids, after all.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
023	Wow, I never would have guessed…
024	Though come to think of it, wasn't there another creature before that ran off with someone's stuffed animal because they wanted presents too?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
025	…Though I can't say I don't understand the feeling. Everyone wants to enjoy the holidays, after all.
026	Yep, looks like you get it too, Ravi. But there are people back in town who are counting on these decorations.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
027	Not to mention someone who's doing her best to protect everyone's happy times spent with the people dear to them.
028	Ishi's doing her best out there, and that's why I'm gonna do my best to help her too.
029	That's why we can't let you keep these decorations.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
030	Numa…	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0003
031	Ah, quit it with the long faces, will ya? Can't say my goods have ever been this in demand before, but a skilled craftsman can keep up with any order. 
032	I'll whip up some new decorations for you lickedy-split! Can't keep the party waiting, can we?
033	!!
034	Numa!? Numa! Numaaa!!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
035	Wow! Everyone looks so happy. Isn't this great, Rochelle?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
036	They really do, don't they? Now everyone can have a happy winter holiday.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
037	Phew... Looks like we managed to make it back before the start of the contest.
038	Look, that man from earlier is making a snow sculpture of the Maruda Tribe. His son must be thrilled.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
039	It looks great with all the decorations you two managed to get back. You really saved the day.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0008
040	Hehe
041	I'll say. It sure took you guys a while to make it back, though. I was worried.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
042	But...I guess it all worked out in the end. I'm glad you were able to get a bit of your holiday cheer back too.
043	...? I wasn't cheery?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
044	Not at all. You didn't realize? I thought you didn't want to spend the holidays with me.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0022
045	! Of course I do!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0025
046	After losing Helza, it's only thanks to you that I've been able to sleep. There's no one else I'd rather be with.
047	...
048	Why would you think something like that?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
049	Well, earlier...
050	You seemed upset about something when you came back from the market.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
051	When I tried to talk to you, you barely even responded. It was like you weren't even there.
052	It was just...
053	...If I couldn't find the decorations, then your wish wouldn't come true. The holidays are supposed to be a special time for children, but...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
054	But none of that was your fault!
055	Plus... I couldn't buy you a present.
056	A present?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
057	You've been so good this year. I wanted to get you a present.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
058	I left you behind...just like that. But still, you protected everyone. You really are a good person.
059	I know how much you love the winter holiday. I just wanted to get you a present that would make you happy. I owe you that much...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
060	But...
061	...So that's what was on your mind.
062	*sigh* You're always so big and boisterous. I didn't know you had such a sensitive side to you. Come on, you didn't need to worry about something like that.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
063	But I said it to you before: It must be nice to have something to look forward to.
065	Yeah, she's always been like that. She's definitely on the nice list. I bet she'll get some amazing presents.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
066	It must be nice to have something to look forward to...
067	...Huh? You were talking about presents? You should have just come out and asked me what I wanted.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
068	And then I could have told you: as long as we're together, that's good enough for me.
069	After all, the holidays are about spending time with those you care about.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
070	Ishi...
071	...I told you, remember? No distractions. Come right back.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
072	...I'm sorry. I got distracted when I found that boy, and I didn't come right back.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0036
073	Come on, that wasn't a distraction. That was a part of the job! It's thanks to you that they got the decorations back and completed their snow sculpture. You really brightened his day...
074	And you came right back afterward. That's more than enough.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0008
075	...You've really grown, Ishi.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0044
076	Not really. I've always been taller than you.
077	I didn't mean it like that. I meant that your eyes are like perfect little knotholes.
078	...!? What does that even mean?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
079	Those two look like they're enjoying themselves.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0003
080	Isn't it great, Ravina? I know you have a soft spot for those two.
081	...I guess.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
082	It's plain to see how much they care about each other, but they still had trouble communicating their feelings...
083	...But in the end they managed to talk it out. All's well that ends well.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0008
084	Happy winter holiday to all, and to all a good night!
