001	He-hey. Are you two all right?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
002	Of course, we are. After all, he went easy on us.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
003	Went easy?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
004	Every blow that he dealt us was restrained.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
005	If he wanted it, we'd be grabbing drinks in the next life just about now.
006	He means he could've killed us whenever he wanted to. Agh! And you're sure he was wearing the Blue Flame Guard's coat of arms?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
007	Of course, I'm sure. The way he fought and that red hair of his...tsk...why didn't I realize sooner?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
008	Yeah. Now that I think about it, he's the spitting image of Zeke. Cripes!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0020
009	Zeke?
010	Once called the Hero of the Continent, he was Captain of the Blue Flame Guard from the now decimated Kingdom of Envylia.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
011	...!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
012	Are you telling me that you've fought against the great sinner Zeke who plotted the rebellion that led to the fall of Envylia?
013	Yep. We were hired by the remnants of Wratharis...and were beat to a pulp.
014	Tsk. Now there's a face I could've lived without recalling.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
015	If I recall correctly, his oldest son was called Logi. I heard he died, but...
016	What is he plotting?
017	There's no point in contemplating that now. Quick! Let's pursue him!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
018	Wa-wait, Don! What about Tango and the others?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
019	What about them?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
020	Are you serious? They're fighting against a horde of Alkaroids down there! Your right arm is at risk, Don!
021	Haha. Very funny. My right arm is right here—safe and sound.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
022	Are you seriously gonna stand by and let them get massacred?! Tango is risking his life for you, Don.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0021
023	Ronnie, once all this is over, I want you to quit the underworld. You're not suited for this world.
024	Huh?! Wh-what are you talking about?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0026
025	I'm talking about their resolve. You don't understand the resolve of my men.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
026	Resolve...?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
027	They all resolved themselves when they stepped into this world.
028	The act of clumsy kindness that you suggested would only serve to stain their resolve.
029	We of the mafia are connected through invisible trust.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0021
030	Tango!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
031	Come on. I'm not so helpless that I need worrying over.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0022
032	Don, we destroyed them all. The others are pursuing the trail of the hoof prints we discovered earlier.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0023
033	Hmph. You took your time, didn't you? There's not a moment to lose. Let's hurry on.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
034	Yes, Don. What are you standing around for? If you want to be favored by Don then you better be the first to move!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0024
035	Huh...? Ah! Go-got it!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
036	Heh. Well then. You're not going anywhere, you red-headed scoundrel!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
037	The hooves seem to be stretching on much further. They're moving at a speed beyond imagination.
038	It's best to discard logic when trying to perceive that knight's movements.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
039	Hm? Hey...wait a second. Something's coming!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
040	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
041	Wha...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
042	Whoaaa?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0043
043	Well, that shook pretty hard. Was it an earthquake?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
044	Huff...huff! Se-seriously, this is bad for my heart! Someone has it in for me!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0019
045	Actually, it didn't shake that much.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0030
046	This guy's a wimp when it comes to things like earthquakes and thunder.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
047	He looks scary, but deep inside he's a damsel. Aren't you, Tara baby?
048	Shut up! This could very well lead to a terrifying natural disaster!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
049	I'm sure this is Mayor Edward's wrath to you greedy idiots.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0029
050	Huh? The old man's wrath?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
051	Ever since he died...there have been more and more earthquakes every day.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
052	Most likely, the air pollution is the cause. The greedy idiots are trying to change the physics of the world.
053	You should bring that up with them directly. We've got more pressing matters to attend to. Here come the androids!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
