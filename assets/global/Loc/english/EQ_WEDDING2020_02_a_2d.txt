001	The mine where we can get Felicitite is around here?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
002	Sure is. The entrance is further in town.
003	Thanks to the mine, this area has flourished. Weaponsmiths, jewelers and miners all came here to work.
004	And since Felicitite is said to have purifying properties, many traveled from afar to purchase it.
005	You don't say! You know your stuff, don't you?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0044
006	A while back, I was stationed nearby for military training, so I could visit this town every now and then.
007	If memory serves me well, there should be a top-notch restaurant around here.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
008	Ah! It's still here! Sure brings back memories. I often came here with my comrades.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0002
009	Ewan, my man! Heard you spoke up to that bulldog of a drill sergeant!
010	Aw, come on. Let's not ruin our meal talking about that. It was nothing.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
011	I just warned him that our training might provoke a monster attack and cause damage to the locals.
012	How is that insubordination? Besides, I'm a first-rate soldier.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
013	Our superiors have their eyes on you, lately. You've been hanging out with bums like me who aren't devoted enough to our country.
014	I don't care what they think. I wish I had half as much passion as you do.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0022
015	Passion I have. It was passion for everyday citizens that made me become a soldier--not patriotism.
016	Ever the idealist.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0010
017	Don't worry. I’ll try not to influence you. I'm sure your father would be none too happy.
018	But actually…that's why I--
019	Hey now. Don't give me that face. You're not thinking of quitting the service, are you?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0025
020	I don’t think you've ever tried to change me. Let's just keep doing our best!
021	Besides, I'm me. I decide who I spend my time with and how I live my life.
022	I too was young once. I used to talk about a lot of things. Seems so long ago…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
023	Such lovely memories.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
024	…Yeah. They're very precious to me.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
025	…
026	…
027	But this town isn't as lively as you described, Lord Ewan. There are hardly any people, and…	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0031
028	…those we encounter all carry weapons. The atmosphere is quite threatening.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
029	Watchmen… So, the rumors were true.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
030	What rumors?
031	That hordes of monsters suddenly started appearing around here--monsters that don't usually inhabit the area.
032	Towns and villages must have hired sentries like those fellows we saw.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
033	It's a matter of survival. But the problem won't be resolved until we address the underlying cause.
034	Hmm... Maybe there was a territorial dispute among monsters, and they were driven out.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
035	It's plausible.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
036	The fact that this rumor checks out must also mean the mine is closed.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0005
037	Say what?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
038	I heard some of the monsters found their way into the mine, so it was closed.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
039	*Gasp* How will we get the Felicitite I need to make the wedding knife?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0016
040	Good question… But what's done is done.
041	Besides, the mine has always been a dangerous place. Accidents weren't uncommon.
042	I remember suggesting they find a safer site to dig, but nobody would listen.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
043	Why not?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
044	The craftsmen insisted on working with Felicitite, so the miners needed to meet that demand.
045	All this time, the miners have been working under dangerous conditions despite the risks.
046	Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. At least if the mine is closed there won’t be any more accidental deaths.
047	Aw, bummer. This really stinks.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0030
048	I hate it when I can't make what I want--even if there's a good reason.
049	…
050	With the mine closed, it will be difficult acquiring Felicitite. Will you give up, Lucia?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
051	Never! I have a "No compromises" policy when it comes to weapon-making.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0039
052	If mining has stopped, I'll go there myself and get what I need.
053	I swear I'll make a wedding knife out of Felicitite! Mark my words!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
054	Good grief… I thought you'd say something like that.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
055	…
056	Hmph. She still feels forced.
057	You were hoping we could avoid a dangerous situation, weren't you?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
058	I was. But I know how Lucia gets. She just barrels on ahead, doesn't she?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
059	How else are we supposed to get the Felicitite I need for my wedding knife?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
060	See? And besides, I'm curious to see the mine myself.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
061	I'm glad they shut it down, but I don't like that the monsters are threatening the peace.
062	Wouldn’t it be great if we could lend a hand? A soldier's duty is to maintain peace, after all.
063	A soldier's duty, huh?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
064	Be warned. All sorts of creepy-crawlies live in the mines--things without feet...that slither on the ground.
065	Yuck...	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
066	Just think if something like that were to fall from the ceiling and slide down your leg…	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0011
067	…Huh? Mei Fang, what's that by your foot?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0001
068	Eeeeeeeeeeeyaaaaaaaaaaa!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0026
069	Lady Mei Fang!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0026
070	Gotcha! Ha-ha. You should've seen the look on your face!	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0008
071	You dolt! How dare you trick me!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0013
072	Hey, this time I was joking, but the danger is real.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0024
073	Back in the day, accidents happened so frequently I was called in for more than a few rescues.
074	How dreadful...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0006
075	Come to think of it, I was stuck following a headstrong type back then, too.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
076	…
077	(All he ever thought about was protecting the people.)
078	(He said he'd die happily as long as he lived up to his motto--"A soldier's duty is to protect others.")	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
079	But he died far removed from those he wanted to protect.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
080	He and a small battalion were sent to fight a bloody war partly as a warning to others…and to crush his spirit.
081	I knew exactly who that warning was meant for.
082	Someone like me, born to a military family, mustn't associate with unpatriotic screw-ups.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
083	I was too naïve or oblivious to comprehend something so simple.
084	In some way, that fool's desire to protect the weak from senseless violence got him killed.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0018
085	"Do your best." That was the motto I shared with my men and comrades. It meant no sacrifices.
086	…In the end, they all died for their country...and I'm to blame.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0016
087	So many hopes and dreams cut short because of me…
088	(Forced from birth to follow the path of a soldier--and all I've ever done is take.)
089	…
090	You're looking glum. What's on your mind?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0001
091	Me? Don't worry. Just because I'm staring doesn't mean something's going to pop out.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0001
092	Inscrutable as ever…	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
093	Me? Inscrutable? Don't be silly!	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0007
094	We're probably thinking the same thing--like how to bypass the mine closure.
095	If you say so. The fact remains--any method we choose to enter is sure to be dodgy.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0010
096	They should've kept the mine open, in my opinion. But we’ll need to ascertain the situation in order to proceed.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
097	So, you're against the closure?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0031
098	Felicitite can only be found here. The purer the ore the higher the concentration of alchemy.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
099	The superstitions related to the ore and the alchemy contained therein have created a huge demand.
100	You're probably right to say the mine is dangerous, but for the miners--it's their livelihood.
101	…You've got a good point.	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0005
102	Besides, something about this bothers me--	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0031
103	You mean the sudden increase in monsters? It's quite strange, isn't it?	VO_yuen.yuen_sys_0030
104	Oh dear! What's this? Rattys have blocked our path. Would you mind stepping aside, little Rattys?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
105	Squeak!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
106	Oh, what nice claws you have!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0003
107	Squeak?	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
108	So sharp and shiny! And strong too, I’m sure.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0031
109	Let me get a closer look! Come here, you!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0007
110	S-Squeak!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0021
111	No, Lady Lucia! Please get back!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0014
112	S-Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
