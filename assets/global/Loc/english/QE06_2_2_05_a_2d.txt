001	Your past?
002	…After my parents died, I became a small-time thief.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
003	…When you were just a child?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
004	It couldn't be helped. Even though I was a child, nobody was there to take care of me.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
005	Everyone was fixated on their own lives--the whole country was. You had to do whatever you could to survive.
006	I even killed in order to feed myself. It's an awful story, I know.
007	I was jailed multiple times. I was miserable. I thought, "Why does this have to happen to me?"
008	…That's--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
009	I hated demons. Well, not just them.
010	The adults who neglected me, my country who ignored me…I hated everyone around me.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0018
011	I'm not going to make excuses. But...I could only get rid of that hatred by committing more and more sins.
012	It was one of those days when I was thrown into prison that a man spoke to me.
013	The man made an intriguing offer.
014	"Capture demons, get paid. The more you capture, the more money you make."
015	It seemed he made the same proposal to others, but we could operate individually.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
016	I told him, "I'm just a kid. I can't catch demons." But the man said:	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
017	"You have more chakra than most. Use it to catch demons and I'll show you how make a living."
018	"Wouldn't it be better than to waste away here, wallowing in hatred?"
019	…Who was that man?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
020	I’m not sure. He didn't seem to be from Wadatsumi, although I didn't think much of it at the time.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
021	Anyway, the reward money was out of this world. I jumped at the opportunity. And I could also enact vengeance on the demons who robbed me of everything.
022	I said "Can I really cleanse myself of hatred?" He nodded with satisfaction and said:
023	"But you've got to catch them alive--otherwise it doesn't count. There's no reward if you kill them." He said that again and again.
024	I only had one question.
025	"Why are you doing this?"
026	To which he answered, matter-of-factly---
027	All is for Wadatsumi.
028	…Then what happened?
029	When I got out of prison, I was taught how to wield chakra. There were others like me, all with a lot of chakra…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
030	And it seemed like they all had family members killed by demons.
031	...I see.
032	I got to work soon after.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
033	I captured demons like I was told and made tons of money. I didn't have to worry about what I would eat the next day.
034	Capture. Sleep. Repeat. Capture. Sleep. Repeat. Over and over and over.
035	Sometimes I worked alone. Sometimes I worked in groups. I caught scores of demons.
036	Every time I caught one, I felt myself cleansed of a little more hatred, but every time I caught one…
037	Indescribable emotions began to swell up.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
038	Indescribable emotions…?
039	How can I put it... I think I was consumed by a sense of duty to catch more and more demons...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
040	I felt that the "work" I was doing was no longer about capturing demons, but rather cleansing myself of hatred.
041	Around that time, a name was coined for people like me who captured demons for a living:
042	That name was "Demon Hunter."
043	…Demon Hunter.
044	Rumors began to spread quickly about a group that secretly captured demons and brought them to a certain man…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
045	Captured…demons…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
046	…Yeah.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
047	…
048	…What happened after that?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
049	…One day
050	I was hunting demons as usual. They appeared to be eating as there were human corpses all around.
051	At the time, I was working with other Demon Hunters to collect all the demons in the area.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
052	I'm guessing their guard was down because they were eating. We captured them without much of a fight. As I was leading them away…
053	…I felt a demon child staring at me. I could sense…hatred in its eyes.
054	At first, I thought it was angry about being captured, but the next moment…it started to cry.
055	Cry…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
056	It was the cry of an infant.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
057	…………
058	Right then, I came to my senses. demons have to eat to live, too. Otherwise they'll die.
059	That baby was hungry and crying... That's how it felt. And I suddenly thought:
060	"What the hell am I doing?"
061	Once I had that epiphany, I immediately realized the little one in front of me was just like me.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
062	We both ate because we were hungry. We experienced deprivation, and hate...
063	The hunger…and contempt for senseless cruelty… What's so different between humans and demons anyway?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
064	All those thoughts started to make me… They made me…
065	Hungry!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0011
066	…HUNGRY? Are you serious?!
067	Well, it's true... But then I started thinking seriously.
068	Everyone gets hungry, so if we can live in a world without starvation maybe we won't have to fight anymore...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
069	Isn't that a little oversimplifying things…?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
070	The reason I became a Demon Hunter was to feed myself.
071	You hated demons, too, didn't you?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
072	That may be true…but if I had food to eat, I'd eventually be able to let that go.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
073	Besides, even if I settle an old score, a new conflict is bound to spring up.
074	I'm much rather be full and avoid conflict altogether.
075	So, you don't hate demons?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0005
076	I hated them, but living in hatred...isn't it "normal."	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
077	For me...I just want to eat to my heart's content. If I can live without hunger, I can live without hating anyone.
078	And not just me. All the humans, demons, and animals that live in Wadatsumi, too. I want all living things to be that way.
079	...How can you say such flowery words?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
080	Because I know what it's like to have nothing.
081	…!
082	That's why I want provide demons an alternative to eating humans. That way we won't need to fight each other.
083	What do you think? Am I crazy?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
084	…
085	…That's what you consider "normal?"	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
086	I do--much more so than hating one another. That's how I feel about it.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
087	…
088	…What's wrong?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0005
089	...I should despise you. You may have caused our suffering.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
090	My brother wants to kill you. Demon Hunters are our most hated enemy.
091	He thinks killing them will protect me… But I don't want to always be protected. That's why...
092	I want to kill you with my own hands. I have to ... I know I do...and yet…!!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
093	And yet... Why...! Why…………!!!
094	…
095	…!!
096	Shall we eat?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
097	Oh, um…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
098	It's okay. Eat 'til you're full... You can think better afterwards.
099	Even if that means devouring you?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
100	You'll be full, so I won't fit.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0010
101	…Idiot.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
102	Maybe…but I'm okay with that.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
103	After all, I got a demon to come back and try my cooking, didn't I?
104	…Good point.
105	Well...then…time to eat!
106	Hang on while I go get more seasoning!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
