001	Move that couch near to the hearth... Nice! That table in that corner looks good...
002	Yes, put that portrait on that wall.
003	Attention employees! Your Queen has an announcement.
004	...
005	We have a new combatant joining us as of today. Introduce yourself.
006	Yes, Queen.
007	I am Red VI.
008	...
009	...
010	...
011	Now that's done, move that couch further away from the hearth. Put that portrait above the hearth.
012	And move that table to the middle of the room.
013	This is not your private quarters.
014	Huh?! But is this not "our" living space?
015	You have your own part of the mansion to decorate as you please.
016	My "part" of the mansion?
017	Correction, Godslayer. "My" mansion.
018	That's it! Someone needs to take you down a peg.
019	Lilith draws her bow.
020	Oh? You dare challenge me?
021	Protect the Queen.
022	Stand down Red, I need to show this child her place.
023	Two floating drones appear behind Eliza.
024	Grab anything you can and run!
