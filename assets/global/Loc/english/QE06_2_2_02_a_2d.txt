001	I'm sorry… I lost consciousness after I fell off the cliff. As soon as I came to...I started making my way here.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0035
002	…I see. Did any humans spot you?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0045
003	…No.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
004	I'm sorry. I wasn't able to protect you back there.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0036
005	It's not your fault, Tamba. I...wasn't strong enough.
006	Don't worry about that. I promised you, didn't I? I'll never let anyone hurt you again.
007	…
008	…Never again.	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
009	We devour because we want to live. That's all… Then why--
010	Why were we captured by the humans?
011	My eyes happened to meet those of our captor--they were emotionless, clinical eyes.
012	I could only scowl in disgust at those eyes which robbed us of our freedom.
013	What lie in wait for us was a life in chains, no better than a dog's.
014	At the time, Kaede was still a baby, so that prison was all she ever knew.
015	We were imprisoned for being demons. We lost our freedom for being demons.
016	…Everything was because we were demons.
017	The humans referred to us as "samples."
018	We weren't given proper meals, only the bare minimum to survive, which they administered through some kind of injection--
019	And they just left us there.
020	The concept of time became a cruel joke.
021	I don't remember exactly how long we were there.
022	But Kaede's steady growth marked the passage of time.
023	…Kaede.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
024	…
025	Kaede's entire world was that prison--ever since she could remember.
026	Never knowing the taste of food or the vast blue sky. Her world was that of senseless cruelty.
027	…
028	Despair was her world.
029	And then, one day…
030	Kaede asked me--
031	Tamba, is this…normal?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
032	What?
033	Is it normal not being able to move--this tiny room...this pain?
034	…!
035	If this is normal…I think I hate "normal."	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
036	…! No, Kaede! This ISN'T normal!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
037	Walking freely beneath the blue sky, the wonder of flavors dancing in your mouth…
038	Kaede knew none of it.
039	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
040	It didn't matter how hard I tried to explain. Words weren't enough.
041	…
042	I wished there were someway I could tell her. But I couldn't find the right words.
043	…
044	She fell silent after.
045	I doubt anyone could comprehend the despair and powerlessness I felt in that moment.
046	…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
047	If only I were stronger. Kaede wouldn't have to suffer.
048	If only I could set her free. But that day never came--
049	Until…
050	There. Eat your food.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
051	…!!!
052	…!
053	It was the first meal since we were captured.
054	Without realizing what I was doing, I devoured the food in front of me. The sumptuous taste that spread across my tongue conveyed that it was meat.
055	Ah! Who knew the act of eating could feel so exquisite!
056	In an instant, our days of despair were gone. We were in heaven--basking in light.
057	Uhh...Uh… Tamba… Tamba…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
058	I looked at Kaede's face and it seemed to say what I had suspected.
059	This was the first meal she's ever had in her life. She probably didn't know how to eat it.
060	But her instincts were telling her--"Eat."
061	The sensations from her tastebuds, her full stomach--I'm certain she felt happiness.
062	…Kaede!...Kaede!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0019
063	We called each other's name, savoring an indescribable emotion.
064	Tears welled up in her eyes. That alone was enough to make my emotions swell, reaching a crescendo.
065	That feeling was my light. For the first time, Kaede knew what "normal" was supposed to be.
066	That light gave me the strength to go on--
067	And the memory of that moment was forever imprinted in my mind.
068	…But
069	I didn't realize at the time…
070	That "light" was fake.
071	In fact, it was the cause of even greater despair.
072	I wonder how much time passed after that meal.
073	Certainly enough for us to forget the taste.
074	Once again, we were given a respite of "light."
075	…
076	Here. Feeding time.
077	…!
078	The "light!"
079	Just when that thought crossed my mind--
080	…!?
081	…!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
082	*Chomp*	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
083	It wasn't flavorless, although garbage would have tasted better. Every fiber of my being rejected it--my mouth, tongue, cells.
084	Blechhhh…Blechhhhhhh!
085	I caught a glimpse of Kaede vomiting as I threw up my food.
086	You bastards! What did you give us--	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0022
087	Just as predicted. XXXX was right.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
088	…What!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
089	If demons engage in cannibalism, they tend to reject human flesh… And--
090	If the cannibalized meat is that of a blood relative, such as a parent, the effect is magnified--	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
091	…Wha--
092	…Blechhhhhh!!! Urrrrrfffff!!!
093	…However the effect appears to differ on an individual basis. More research is required before submitting our report.
094	…!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0042
095	…AHH!....AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
096	What could account for the difference? Sex? Age? Physical attributes? Well, we have plenty of time to find out.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
097	Let's conduct a few more experiments, shall we?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
098	…Ooooo….Urrrrrrr	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
099	…You bastards!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
100	…How dare you! How dare you!!!
101	I won't forgive you.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0040
102	First--Let's start with the younger sibling.
103	…!!! Stop! Do whatever you want to me!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
104	Just keep your hands off my sister!
105	…!
106	Commencing experiment.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
107	…Stop!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
108	STOP IT!!!
109	I will never forget the smile that crept onto that human's face.
110	They didn't give a damn about destroying our lives, but that didn't mean they had any interest in keeping us alive.
111	Their sole purpose is to destroy lives…No--to toy with them.
112	…That's what humans do.
113	While they were cutting up Kaede as they pleased…she said…
114	…Tamba	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
115	…Is this…normal?
116	…......
117	...........................
118	...................................................
119	…I couldn't allow it.
120	Not the humans who deprived us of normal lives...or myself--for allowing it to happen.
121	Anything that deprives Kaede of a normal life…
122	This treatment, this resentment, this hatred.
123	And this senseless cruelty…
124	For the first time, I wanted to fight back.
125	For my sister--to protect Kaede.
126	The power to fight against senseless cruelty. The power to protect…
127	…!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
128	In this land rooted in sin, power itself is sin. To unearth that power is also a sin.
129	Those with power seek ever more power in the name of benevolence.
130	That evokes further sin. Sin begets sin.
131	…What you desire is already in your possession, however you have not yet realized it.
132	This land is destined to accumulate more and more sin.
133	I hate--
134	I hate the humans who did this to us--who robbed Kaede of a normal life.
135	I hate everything about them. I want to protect Kaede from all of them. That is why--
136	I must kill them. The ones who did this to us, those wretched humans who captured us--
137	Every last one.
