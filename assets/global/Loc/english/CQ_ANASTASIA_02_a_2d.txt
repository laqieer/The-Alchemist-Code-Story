001	That takes care of the enemies around here. That was disappointingly easy.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
002	That's...amazing.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0046
003	Oh, you were on this battlefield as well.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
004	Yes. Thanks to you, my job was easy. But...	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
005	But?
006	Watching you fight at close range, I was awestruck by your strength.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0006
007	But still...I feel as if you continue this way, you'll be engulfed with sadness one day.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0030
008	It seems like you're quite the worrier.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0031
009	Don't worry. I'm here to fight.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0007
010	No matter how much I hurt others, it won't give birth to sentiment.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0010
011	Fighting allows me to remain here.
012	That's...really sad.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0022
013	Is that all you wanted to talk about? If so, leave me alone.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0016
014	(Seriously, he's so annoying. Why does he keep going on?)
015	(... ...)
016	(But...has there ever been anyone who's worried about me like this before? I've always been valued by my results on the battlefield.)
