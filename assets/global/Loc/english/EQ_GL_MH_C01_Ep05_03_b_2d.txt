001	Golem slayer, wild beast wrangler... That's going to be a long list of titles to add to my card.
002	I think we've lost sight of the trail. They've chased us to some unknown part of the forest.
003	And since we don't have a map of this place, it's going to take us a while to find our way.
004	Indeed. Given the overgrown conditions of this section, this will soon become quite the task.
005	HEY! You there!
006	?!
007	Halt! This is private property!
008	State your identities and business at once!
009	Wait, what?
010	Excuse me, sirs. We are accompanying our professor in the study of ecology, and the tavern owner informed us that the trail is open to the public.
011	However, we lost our way and stumbled into the deeper parts of the forest.
012	Please do forgive us. We don't have a map, you see. Would you kindly show us the way out?
013	Hmph. My men reported hearing a disturbingly loud ruckus, and a trail of blood and slain monsters led us to you.
014	I could have you arrested for trespassing and illegal hunting in Milord's private grounds.
015	Hunting? We were almost torn to shreds by those savage beasts, and we did nothing to provoke them.
016	Maybe you should get your lord to look into these monsters. Won't do to have them escape and terrorize the locals.
017	I will report this matter duly. As for the lot of you, we will be escorting you out.
018	Stay out of these parts if you know what's good for you.
019	And one last thing... no funny business. My men are armed.
020	Certainly not, good sir. Thank you.
021	... ...
022	(This amount should do it.)
023	Hey, pick up the pace.
024	Certainly. My apologies. I was simply making sure nothing gets left behind.
025	Now that would just be TERRIBLE for your lord's hunting grounds, you know.
026	Tch...
