001	Sir Zahar, Hero of the Holy Guard, it is an honor to fight by your side.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
002	I am grateful for your warm hospitality. Allow me to return the favor by turning myself into an instrument of war for the glory of Wratharis!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
003	Your words give us strength! For the glory of Wratharis and our fellow brothers!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0009
004	Of course.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
005	Zahar, am I missing something?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
006	Why would we be welcomed by the people of Wratharis?
007	This is something I put in motion years prior.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
008	I've always intended to leave the accursed Holy Guard and defect to Wratharis.
009	So I assembled warriors of like mind to escort Letitia over to them.
010	I had no idea you'd been planning this all along. Who is she exactly?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0044
011	She's a trusted companion who I've known for as long as I can remember.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
012	A trusted companion...
013	...
014	(Zahar's trusted companion? Argh! My left eye! Are you trying to warn me about her?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
015	Corvus, how do you feel about devoting your talents here?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
016	No man would stand your equal.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
017	I would have it no other way.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
018	Corvus, Letitia, our paths begin here in Wratharis!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
019	The path to our dreams lies before us, beyond these endless plains, in far-off, distant lands. Hahaha!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
020	Will the Holy Order just sit idly by, though?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
021	We'll just have to show them that we won't be broken by the likes of them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
022	...
023	(The path to our dreams, huh? My dream lies beyond the shadows...but I shall stake it all on you.)
024	(Zahar became a sworn knight of Wratharis, and not soon after, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Gilrack.)
025	(He never even used any alchemy, for disdain of intervention by the Holy Guard.)
026	Gaaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
027	Ngh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0025
028	Hm. Utter weaklings!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
029	Who the hell is that silver-haired knight?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
030	He's slaughtering all of us! Keep an eye out! He's not like any of the other Wratharis soldiers!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
031	(His skill with a blade and strategical prowess have improved yet again. Just how high will you rise, Zahar?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0021
032	In my absence, you've grown ever stronger... Hahaha... A silver steed... No... a silver lion fights amongst us.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
033	(Letitia, you're really a complete mystery. Can you even fight?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
034	Yaaaaaaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0008
035	You're in the way!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0010
036	Ngh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0024
037	What was...?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
038	(That was blindingly fast! So this is the woman that has earned Zahar's respect, huh?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0022
039	Hahaha...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
040	What...?
041	(I can't let myself lag behind!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
042	Wha—?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0043
043	Taste my blade of gloom!	VO_niggle.niggle_battle_0004
044	(Wratharis claimed a decisive victory over Envylia in the skirmish.)
045	(We charged into battle after battle, leading Wratharis' forces to consecutive victories.)
046	(Before long...)
047	It's Zahar!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0046
048	Zahar's returned!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0009
049	Zahar, the Hero of Wratharis!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0008
050	(The people of Wratharis began revering him as a hero.)
051	Sir Zahar, our alchemical research has started making leaps and bounds in progress.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
052	The knowledge you've given us from your time in the Holy Order has been indispensable to our research. We expect more results in the near future!
053	I am glad to be of service. What was it that you wanted to show me?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
054	Look! These figures show the quantity of alchemy present.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0007
055	We produced them artificially—
056	You've been conducting all of this research in secret? For what purpose?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0044
057	The Magna Code and the Alchemist Code are shackles borne from an imperfect entity. They will be obsolete in Zahar's new world.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
058	I heard you were a Paladin in the Holy Guard at the same time as Zahar. When did you come to Wratharis?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
059	...
060	Bah. Not going to answer me, huh?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
061	Corvus.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
062	It's unusual for you to approach me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
063	What is the significance of that eyepatch?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0003
064	To...control my power.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
065	Power...? What kind of power?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
066	I possess a cursed eye passed down through the Leonhart family and inherited by a single member in each generation. The Evil Eye, as it's known, grants me great power...but causes me excruciating pain.	VO_niggle.niggle_chara_1006
067	I would be consumed by the shadows if it were ever unleashed.
068	Really now...? What a splendid sight that would be.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
069	Bah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
070	(She really is one to be wary of.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
071	The Holy Guard?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
072	Yes. We've received word that they are planning to raid a Wratharis highborn's estate.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
073	The home of the Research Director in fact.
074	I wonder...if we have a mole in our midst.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
075	No, it may have been the work of the Corpse. Those filth specialize in reconnaissance.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
076	It seems we've drawn the attention of some old friends.
077	What do you think we should do? They are still our enemy. Should we deal with them, or have you something in mind?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
078	Wratharis won't be able to fend them off unless we sortie. Although...I may have an amusing idea. What if we were to outwit the scheming wretches?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
079	Outwit them? In what way?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
080	We could, for example, arm ourselves in some very nostalgic raiment.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
081	You're saying...we should disguise ourselves?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
082	(I never thought I'd be in this getup again.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
083	Zahar, they're here.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
084	...
085	Hm... You got here quicker than expected.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
086	You're late. The house is already cleaned out.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
087	What? How?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
088	Hey! What're you wretches doing?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
089	You traitorous snakes!!!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0013
090	Say you, the snakes who turn their venom upon the world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
091	Death to the traitors!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
092	Now that we've gotten rid of the trash, let's get back.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
093	Zahar, I sense someone inside the house.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
094	What...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
095	What the...?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0026
096	It must be the Corpse!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
097	This is what they've been planning all along! They're going to burn down the whole place!	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0029
098	Still rotten to the core, I see! Stop them at once!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0019
099	Please! No!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
100	Spill his guts to the floor.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
101	N-no—Aaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
102	Kill every last one of them!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
103	You dogs of the Holy Order...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
104	Zahar, you wretch... You've made our job here quite the pain.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
105	I cannot let this sin go unpunished.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
106	Perfect. You'll die here with the rest of the them then.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
107	The incessant babbling of a dead man means nothing to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
