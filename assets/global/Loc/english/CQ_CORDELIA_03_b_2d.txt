001	Alyu! Wh-why?
002	I told you I'd come back, didn't I? I just got a bit delayed because I had some other business to take care of...I think.
003	Ugh! I thought everything I said yesterday would keep them away, but they still had the nerve to trespass on your property?! How rude!
004	You're going to stand up for this vampire?! You must be in with those bloodsuckers!
005	Get them! Both of them! Bring them down!
006	What is going on here?!
007	Great timing! They're vampires! Use your magic to destroy them!
008	Vampires? Don't be ridiculous! This lady here is the daughter of the Court Mage Sandra. She's no vampire.
009	Wh-what?
010	B-but she stays inside all day and roams around at night!
011	We heard she's been seen with blood-red stains around her lips! She has to be a bloodsucker!
012	You think that's enough evidence to treat a person like a monster?
013	Very well. I shall listen to everything you have to say. As the official statements of trespassers caught red-handed, of course.
014	N-no, please...!
015	Take them away!
016	What is a Court Mage doing here?
017	I am here at the request of this young lady's grandfather. He was worried about his granddaughter's friend being troubled by ruffians.
018	Then we realized that the location he spoke of was Sandra's mansion. There was no way we weren't going to come and help.
019	Those idiots just wouldn't listen to a word I had to say, so I went to my grandpa for help.
020	My grandpa's a bit of an eccentric, but he's not a Court Mage for nothing...I think.
021	Indeed. He is rather capable, I must admit.
022	Um... Th-thank you so much!
023	You must be Cordelia. Sandra has told me so much about you.
024	She's worried about you, you know, and sorry that she isn't home often enough.
025	Mother...
026	You seem to be doing just fine, though. I'll let her know that you've made a wonderful friend.
027	A friend...
028	Alyu. I can't thank you enough, but...why did you do so much for me?
029	Didn't they threaten to ruin your business if you kept coming here?
030	You might be able to stock up on rare plants in my garden, but what's the point if nobody will do business with you?
031	I know my products are top-of-the-line. I pride myself on that. People with the right mindset will look past all this and continue to buy from me...I think.
032	I'm gonna be just fine!
033	Oh...
034	(Alyu's so amazing!)
035	(She won't let anybody bring her down, no matter what they might say about her. She sees things for what they really are.)
036	(I wish I could be as strong as her. Able to hold my own and stand my ground regardless of what others have to say about me.)
037	I'm so sorry, Alyu. I shouldn't have doubted that you would come here again.
038	I let those intruders' words get to me. I'm really, really sorry.
039	Don't worry about it! I'm good at viewing things in the long-term...I think.
040	Anyway, Cordelia, that basket by your feet...
041	Oh, this is...well...
042	I knew it! Those are the plants from yesterday! You gathered all these for me...I think?
043	Y-yes. I couldn't find very many because it was dark last night, and...
044	Wow! Thank you! You didn't have to go to all that trouble!
045	But y'know, grandpa told me that brewing tea with this makes a powerful tonic!
046	Really? I would think it'd be very bitter, though.
047	If we try it with some sweets at the ready, it should be fine...I think.
048	Hopefully this tea will make you feel a lot better! Then we can go look for more rare plants in your garden together!
049	Heheheh. If you say so, then I believe it, Alyu.
050	Then let's have tea together next time! I'll bring the sweets!
