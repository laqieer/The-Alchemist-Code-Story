SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0001	The Emperor of Greed Dike
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0002	<br>commences a simultaneous attack
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0003	<br><br>on both Envylia and Lustburg.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0004	Regarding this as an act of aggression
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0005	<br>on a scale not seen since the devastation of Wadatsumi,
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0006	<br><br>Northern Pride announces a state of emergency.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0007	Upon receiving this declaration,
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0008	<br>Kanon and the other Paladins advance
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0009	<br><br>to engage in battle on the very same day.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0010	However, little do they know...
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0011	Behind this catalytic incidence
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0012	<br>lurks the strong will
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0013	<br><br>of one man.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0014	Even this assault that will cause
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0015	<br>the entire world to quiver...
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0016	It is nothing more than
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0017	<br>a small glimpse of the earnest plan
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0018	<br><br>this man has spun throughout an eternity.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0019	This will later be told down through the ages as
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0020	<br>the largest threat ever to have arisen
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0021	<br><br>in the continent of Babel...
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0022	This is the memory of the mad monarch bearing the name Lion.
SEISEKI08_OP_TELOP_0023	<br>And of the great war he begun that would overturn the laws of this world.
