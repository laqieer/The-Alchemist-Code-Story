001	Why did you come? I told you not to.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0021
002	But...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
003	But what?	VO_enis.enis_sys_0020
004	... ...
005	Go on! Say something! Who are you?!	VO_enis.enis_sys_0049
006	...I'm Mielikki.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
007	That's not what I mean! Seriously! Do not follow me anymore! Understood? Got it?	VO_enis.enis_sys_0016
008	Ouch...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0023
009	(I cut my leg...)
010	(Sigh... I wonder why Ennis gets so mad.)	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0030
011	Hey, why are you still following me?	VO_enis.enis_sys_0003
012	Oh! Were you waiting for me?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0009
013	Of course, I wasn't. Seriously. Wait there for a second.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0020
014	What are you doing?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
015	There were some useful herbs, so I went and got them.
016	Gonna brew this for a second, and...here. Use this.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0031
017	What is this?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
018	You cut your leg on a blade of grass, right?	VO_enis.enis_sys_0010
019	The vegetation in this forest is occasionally poisonous to repel monsters.
020	You might be okay now, but there's a chance you'll have a fever tomorrow. Put this on your leg now.
021	Th...thank you.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0018
022	Y-you don't need to thank me.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0048
023	Hey...I want to play together with you, Ennis. Can I please go with you?
024	Sigh... That's what I thought it was.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0020
025	I'll admit that you helped me, but I'm not responsible for taking care of you.
026	It's bothersome to have you following me just because you're curious. I don't have time to waste on you.
027	Why? I don't really understand.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0021
028	Isn't it more fun and better to be together instead of by ourselves?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0030
029	I'm not here to play around! Besides, it's not always better to be with others!	VO_enis.enis_sys_0015
030	I don't really understand that...but I want friends...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
031	What is that? You're super annoying!	VO_enis.enis_battle_0007
032	Huhhh?!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
033	Just because you don't understand something, is it too much to ask for you to see things from my perspective?!	VO_enis.enis_sys_0013
034	I'm sure you've never been betrayed or hurt before. That's why you're so insensitive.
035	Friends are nothing more than a self-satisfying label. It's just an illusion. Ultimately, it's nothing but trouble.
036	You end up betraying the other person or being betrayed by them. The only thing friendship does is muddle your perspective.
037	... ...
038	What? If there's something you want to say then say it.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0012
039	I would never...betray you.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
040	Is that so? How noble of you. But when people die they die suddenly.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0044
041	Huhhh...?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
042	Let's just say we were to become friends. Let's also say that you promised me we would be together forever. If you suddenly died, you would be betraying me!
043	If you have to say goodbye to someone eventually, I don't want to get close to them! I don't need friends!
044	Ennis...
045	Sigh... I feel a little less stressed after screaming. So? Did you put the medicine on?	VO_enis.enis_sys_0020
046	Ye-yes...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
047	All right. Fine. You can do what you want from here.
048	Huh...then, I can go with you?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
049	Even if I say you can't, you're going to follow me anyway, right? Just try not to die while you're at it.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0030
050	... ...
051	Grrrrrrrr...
052	There's a lot of monsters, after all.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0027
053	There's no way I can reach the nectar without taking care of them.	VO_enis.enis_sys_0020
054	I'll go. I said you can do what you want, but, if it gets dangerous, then run away immediately.
055	At least listen to me on that, all right?
056	O-okay!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0042
