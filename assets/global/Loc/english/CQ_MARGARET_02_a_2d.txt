001	All my cures are made with love! They are of the finest quality! Don't forget to dote upon your vendor, the oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
002	Hey! Little Miss Margaret! Come over here!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0009
003	Ladies and gentlemen! Thank you so much for coming to see my wares today!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0033
004	We're the ones who should be thanking you! You're the one who came to us!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0008
005	(It's been a few hours since I arrived and started selling my wares. The cures are flying off my cart pretty much as fast as I expected!)	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1006
006	Whew... I'm so tired...but I managed to sell all of my stock! Lizzy will be ever so—hmmm?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0030
007	......
008	Something wrong?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0004
009	I thought this village was suffering from an epidemic.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
010	Tee hee hee! Well, you see...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
011	The oh so lovely merchant, Little Miss Margaret, treated everyone to some of her amazing cures! For a fair price, of course.
012	They shouldn't have been able to recover so quickly.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
013	Tee hee! Hee hee hee! Well, you see... Allow me to—!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
014	You have meddled here today, you...frivolous peddler.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
015	Did I do something wrong?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
016	(Other than set my prices a little higher than usual... Tee hee.)
017	It's all but impossible for me to observe the pathogen now.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
018	W-wait, what?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
019	Tch. My experiment has come to naught.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
020	Experiment...?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
021	I attempted the same experiment in a different village several years ago. Since then I have spent my time improving the strain, but all my efforts have now been wasted.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
022	However, for it to be cured so swiftly and easily... It must not be ready. It will take some time and tweaking before I am able to present it to the queen as a weapon.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
023	Hello! Nice to meet you! The name's Elizabeth. You're going to be my test subject from today. I'm looking forward to working with you.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
024	I-is this...?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_2011
025	That's right! This is my laboratory.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
026	I... I see.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
027	Your village is in a bit of a rough spot, right? That new illness is spreading like wildfire.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0030
028	Y-yes, it is.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
029	Hey! It's going to be all right. I will find the cure!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
030	H-huh?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
031	Just leave it to me! I'll make sure you can go home someday soon!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
032	S-so...it was never an illness.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
033	An epidemic is not a mere illness. It is truly astonishing that you were able to cure it.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
034	I bet you had an accomplice...even if an unwilling one.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
035	Tut-tut. I have been flapping my tongue for long enough. Perhaps I will make you my accomplice, since you have learned so much of my plans.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
036	Ahahahah! If you're talking about experiments, I've had enough of those, thank you.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0011
037	Thinking of running away? You're looking a little unsteady on your feet, my dear.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
038	Hey! Hey! Keep your eyes up here, mister! Nobody appreciates that kind of attention!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0012
039	What?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
040	I'm tired from selling my wares, okay?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
041	Give me a break, all right? Just cool it.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
