001	Grooooaaaaaaaaah!	VO_orcdisaster.orcdisaster_battle_0028_a
002	There's no place for you in this world.
003	But that's okay. I prepared a place for all of you in the world we came from.
004	That's why I want you to be at ease...and allow me to eat you.
005	...Incredible. You ate him and separated him from his Alchemia so that he would lose his power.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
006	You'll be able to return to your world now that the calamity has been dealt with.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
007	Ah. About that... Eh, I guess it's fine. We'll figure out what to do about the timeline somehow, right, Benimaru?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
008	...Yeah.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
009	What's wrong? Any complaints?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
010	No, no complaints... I just wish you'd told me if you knew a way to get back to our original world...	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0031
011	Ah, sorry! I mean, it's not like I knew this was going to work either. It was just a gamble on my end, too.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
012	But I'm glad it did work, heh.
013	...Yeah. Me too. Those are our comrades after all.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0008
014	Aw, boo, we're going back already? I wanted to play around some more.	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0001
015	That place is full of interesting things I'd never seen before! I wanted to show some of them to you too, Rimuru.	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0007
016	You sure? If we go back I could finally let you have a taste of that suuuuper tasty thing.
017	Let's go back. Right now. Let's go.	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0003
018	Now you mention it, what kind of souvenirs did Milim get you?
019	Oh, I put them all in my Stomach storage. Let's take a look...
020	H-huh?! It's all gone!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0026
021	Huh? What happened?	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0025
022	Wh-what the—?! There's nothing in here! Hey, Ouroboros! What's this all about?!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0025
023	I would prefer for nothing from this world to negatively interfere with yours, so I took the liberty of erasing all the things you obtained in this place.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0002
024	I see... Couldn't you have told us that a little sooner?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
025	Everything we obtained in this place... It sounds a little lonely when you put it like that.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0045
026	...
027	Hey, Benimaru!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
028	What is it?	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
029	If we ever meet again, I want to challenge you to a match.
030	I saw the way you handled that sword earlier... I'd love to see if my Sosenko is a match for that trust-fueled swordsmanship of yours.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0007
031	Oh? Well, I won't be holding back then.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0005
032	I'm the Samurai General of the Jura Tempest Federation. I'm not going to drag Rimuru's name through the mud with any shameful displays.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0008
033	Haha, I was hoping you'd say that!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0008
034	By the way, Albea.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0002
035	Hm?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
036	Your words made me reflect a little. You were right, I didn't really consider the feelings of the people I left behind.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0006
037	...They believe in me so sincerely. I may have grown a little spoiled.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
038	When I get back, I will definitely listen to everyone's feelings a little more carefully. Even if it's not what I'd like to hear.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0011
039	But... Well, if any of them are angry of me then it's also my duty to accept those feelings.
040	...
041	That's why I wanted to tell you something. That person. If they don't understand how you feel, just keep at them until they get it. Okay?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
042	Because I'm certain they'll come to understand eventually.
043	I've really had a good time here... It makes it all the more sad to leave.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0031
044	But there are things you must do in your world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
045	Yeah.	VO_riml.riml_sys_0005
046	I'm glad we got to save all those people. We had fun, but it's time to go.
047	Let's head back and do what needs to be done next.
048	Leave it to us. We will protect the country in your absence.	VO_benimaru.benimaru_sys_0004
049	I have an actual job to do as well! The busy life of a Demon Lord!	VO_mirim.mirim_sys_0010
050	All right. It's time to go! Back to our world!	VO_riml.riml_sys_0032
051	...That's the end of our duties. We'll have to retire soon.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
052	Yeah...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
053	Well, I better get back to training! I'm not about to lose and drag the Sosenko name through the mud either!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0010
054	...
055	That's why I wanted to tell you something. That person. If they don't understand how you feel, just keep at them until they get it. Okay?	VO_riml.riml_sys_0001
056	Because I'm certain they'll come to understand eventually.
057	That's some unexpectedly good advice from a slime show-off...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
