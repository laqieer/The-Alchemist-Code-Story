001	A small quantity of Alchemia was discovered in the sample of Giant Taurus flesh.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
002	What does that mean?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0002
003	It means that an even larger amount of Alchemia—think of it as a kind of energy—must be contained within its core.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
004	As I have already explained, there are aspects of the Giant Taurus that greatly resemble the Ancient Dragon Bone...
005	A creature that as the name suggests, had armored scales that were as hard as bone. As a living being, it is very likely that the Giant Taurus too, has something like a core functioning in the center of its being.
006	When you say core, do you mean like a heart?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0031
007	I suppose so. According to the legends of the Saga region, the Ancient Dragon Bone's core contained an incredible amount of Alchemia. Do you know what part of the Giant Taurus this flesh was taken from?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
008	Its foreleg.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0004
009	Considering the amount of Alchemia found in that sample, it is safe to assume that the beast's core would be reasonably far from its forelegs.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
010	I would prefer to avoid drawing conclusions from incomplete information. However...
011	I believe that destroying the Giant Taurus' core will mean its defeat.
012	I see. In that case, we should do what we can to pinpoint its core.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0039
013	From what I can tell, it could be in the middle of its stomach, or even towards the tip of its tail. Does that sound about right?
014	Yes. We cannot rule out either possibility for the moment. We will need to investigate other parts of the beast—although that is no simple matter.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
015	True. If we can get a general idea of its location, and then blast it with everything we have... All right. Looks like we know what we need to focus on now.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
016	Leave the Giant Taurus to us.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
017	That's what we're here for. The Holy Guard, the Blue Flame Guard, and the Scarlet Flame Guard are a united front today.
018	You can count on us. We're rearing to go! We won't let you down!
019	I certainly hope not.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
020	As for how we can destroy the core... We will be needing Judith's help for that.
021	Indeed. I believe that the strongest weapon we possess is her...Mecha Weapon, or what have you.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
022	Did you say Mecha Weapon?! You don't mean the forbidden weapon that was made to destroy the Giant Taurus, do you?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
023	I think you just answered your own question. Do you have a problem with that?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0004
024	Of course I have a problem with it! As leader of the Holy Guard, I cannot allow that weapon to be used!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
025	It's a cursed thing! It shouldn't be used to uphold the justice of the continent!
026	Shut the hell up!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
027	Tch. I thought I told you to stay quiet.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
028	My dad made that to bring peace to Babel! It's not cursed!
029	You...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
030	My dad wished for this world to be at peace with all his heart, but you...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0013
031	You can't even do anything about the Giant Taurus!
032	But you killed my dad anyway! And yet you stand there and insult his invention?! Who the hell do you think you are?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
033	You disgust me!
034	The Mecha Weapon drew its power from the Philosopher's Stone. That's why... Your father was... We had to...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
035	You've done your homework, huh? Good work, magnificent Lord Commander of the oh-so-righteous Holy Guard.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
036	...
037	You don't understand! That kind of power is dangerous! It brings nothing but misfortune! I've seen it too many times! You don't want to go around messing with Philosopher's Stones, either!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
038	That's why...it had to end like that. You have to make some sacrifices to serve the greater good.
039	How can you say that?! The Giant Taurus have taken countless lives! The entire continent is suffering!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0017
040	I...!
041	And what have you done to stop them? That's right, a whole lotta nothing! So who's the real one bringing misfortune, huh?!
042	I will complete the Mecha Weapon without using a Philosopher's Stone! I will save this world myself!
043	And I will show you, all of you, that my dad did nothing wrong! He was wronged, and I will get justice for him!
044	He made the Mecha Weapon to bring peace to Babel! I won't let you insult it in front of me!
045	I won't forgive you, or the so-called Holy Order, for trampling over his dream!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
046	Ngh! I...!
047	Give me back my dad! Give him back! You monster!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0019
048	Judith... I...
049	I don't want to hurt a girl. Put your weapons down, man.	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
050	Ungh...
051	I hate you! I despise the Holy Order! Get the hell out of my way!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
052	Sorry.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
053	I'm gonna have to have you take a little nap.
054	Wh-what?! What's going on over there?!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
055	It's the Giant Taurus! Judith, let's finish this later! Knights, engage!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
056	Yes, Lord Commander!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
057	Tch. I have a bad feeling about this, but we can't just stand around doing nothing.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
058	On it!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0005
059	I have to do it! I have to take down the Giant Taurus!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
060	Dangit. He knew we were out of gas, didn't he? Reiner, you ba—!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0018
061	Huh?! R-Reiner?! I've seen this Titan before...but that means...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
062	Here they come! Bud, Victor! Get ready!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
063	Tehre, you handle the evacuation! I don't want any more casualties!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
064	Do not give me orders!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
065	Here I go!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0021
066	Wait, Eren! Save your strength for the Giant Taurus!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0015
067	This isn't an enemy that you can keep chipping away at until it falls down! We need to save our resources and hit it with everything we have all at once, as a last stand!
068	Ngh... Fine. Understood.	VO_eren.eren_sys_0042
069	Judith, prepare yourself! Reiner is an enemy, all right?! Get that through your head!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
070	We can't fight properly without our ODM gear, so we're counting on your Mecha Weapon for this battle!
071	I... I just can't believe it. Reiner can't be a Titan. He can't be! I... I can't fight him!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
072	Tch! I guess I have no choice! I'll slice you open myself, Reiner!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
