001	Just a few more tunnels and we're home free. I made sure to leave an escape route... Huh?!
002	How did you—
003	Why, you seem surprised to see me, Brass Rose Roxanne.
004	Did you really think I wouldn't see past your little trick? The sentries were posted at the fork of the east and west tunnels.
005	You disabled them and left them on the west side, leading my men to think you'd gone down that path.
006	Well played. But your little game ends here. You may have fooled the guards, but not me.
007	Alright, I've had one too many of these situations.
008	Tch. This one's sharper than I thought.
009	Leave the children to me!
010	We'll watch your back. You ready, Roxanne?
011	As ready as ever.
012	(...Hehe. It's been so long since we last fought together. ♥)
