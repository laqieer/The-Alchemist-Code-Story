001	Huzzaaaaaahh!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
002	Grrrk!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0028_a
003	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
004	Agh?! Grragh!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0028_b
005	Binding enemies with a giant snake made of Chakra? Yeah, you definitely belong in the Third Squad.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
006	Really?!
007	Yes, yes, now don't let your guard down. We've got more coming.
008	Wha—?! Civilians?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
009	Nope. Demons.
010	Gyahr! Grraaagh!	VO_utsushiogre.utsushiogre_battle_0028_c
011	...!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
012	They all have that demon smell. Can you handle this?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0015
013	Forgive me.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0042
014	Still can't shake that naivete, eh?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0016
015	It's just how I am.
016	But I have no doubts about what I must do.
017	That's not bad at all.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
018	Kill one and you can save a person. Kill ten, and you save a village. If you take out a hundred...
019	You can save the future.
020	Whoa!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0046
021	That's what the Blade Fox is here for.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
022	The scent is getting stronger. We're close. Let's get this over with!
023	Understood!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0038
024	Tch! Where the hell are they?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
025	What are they planning? Why did they target that rookie?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
026	If they were just plunging the castle town into chaos so that they can feed on its people, why would they do that?
027	Hm. So this game of cat and mouse has a purpose.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0045
028	Well, then...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
029	...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
030	What is this presence I feel?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
031	Could it be? You...! But why?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
