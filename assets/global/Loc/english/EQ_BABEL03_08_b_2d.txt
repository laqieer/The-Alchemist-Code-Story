001	Balt! You don't have to push yourself so hard! You're wounded!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
002	I'm not sure what's going on, but let me fight!
003	Just stay back! Don't use your powers! Urgh! There're so many of them, but I can't let them take Carla!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0015
004	It would be wise to just step aside and hand her over.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
005	Tch! You have the worst timing ever!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
006	Blood. Red. Balt. Rest now.	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0022
007	There's no way I can back down!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
008	Ah, the Corpse...expedient as ever. I'm impressed you found her before I did.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0005
009	All that's left is to see who can get her out of here first.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0007
010	Quit with your jokes! I won't let any of you have her!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0017
011	Oh, you will hand her over. The future of Gluttony Foss depends on it!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_battle_0004
012	Your pitiful needs are nothing. We need her for the greater good of this world.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
013	Your country or the world... It is a waste of time to even compare the two. The girl is ours!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
014	I do agree with one point. It is a waste of time trying to compare one against the other. We will eradicate those who get in our way. It's as simple as that.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0008
015	So, the fate of the world will change depending on who gets the girl. How entertaining! Let us finish this here and now!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0010
016	That is enough.	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
017	Who's there?!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0027
018	O, sweet angel of the desert!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
