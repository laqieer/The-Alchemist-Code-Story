001	The final destination of the time we had wound...
002	Lay in a future where senseless battles were fought in perpetuity.
003	That despair...
004	That emptiness... Do you not feel it taking form in the present?
005	To right the way of the world, we will put an end to distorted time!
006	You...
007	You are Phantom Soldiers who were originally summoned by Lisbeth.
008	I would have you face me, instead of these two. Edgar, Kasumi... Go on ahead.
009	Tina...!
010	Hurry! You must reach the Destrolurk! We cannot afford to allow Kasumi to linger here!
011	You don't have to tell me that!
012	Kasumi... I know you must be sick of all of these selfish requests, but...still, I must ask.
013	Please. You must defeat the Destrolurk! Not for the sake of this world, but for Lisbeth's!
014	Tina!
015	Do you really think that you can take the both of us on alone?
016	Their pride knows no bounds. They never tire of ordering us to fight their battles for them...
017	This is not pride. I merely seek to...make an amendment.
018	You say Lisbeth gave you orders? The fact that you saw her in that light, even as you stood by her side...
019	Is that not pride itself?
020	How dare you!
021	I'm sure you know how she feels.
022	I'm not going to let you go after them. The Destrolurk must be defeated, or Lisbeth will be lost.
023	I'm not going to go easy on you. I have to do this...for my friend.
024	You think we're just going to let you stop us?
025	I don't need your permission. For my dear friend, and for this world as a whole...I will take down anything that stands in my way!
026	Besides, this isn't my first time slaying a dragon!
