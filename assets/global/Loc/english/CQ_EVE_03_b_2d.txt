001	Are you all right, Lady Eve?	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0017
002	Yes, I'm totally fine. I came running here, so I got the perfect warm-up as well.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
003	Besides, how would you say it, I think we make an awesome team!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
004	We-well... It definitely wasn't difficult to fight.	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1008
005	Right? We're already connected even before our wedding♪ We really are a good match!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0048
006	Well then, this time, I think we managed to actually finish off the monster, so I think I'll get started with the cooking!
007	About that...I wish you won't be so careless next time.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
008	Huh?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
009	Long journeys on foot and capturing monsters...they're hardly the type of things a lady like yourself should be doing.
010	If necessary, I'll go and see you. After all, fighting is a knight's duty.	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1004
011	I'm fine. This is nothing really. Besides, the whole distinction between ladies and knights...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
012	Lady Eve! Please, listen to me!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0014
013	Huh? O-okay...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
014	I'm sorry for raising my voice...but I can't back down regarding this.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0036
015	It makes me very happy that you would put yourself at risk to come and see me, but...I do wish you would avoid making me worried in the future.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
016	When it comes to my happiness from having you come to see me and my anxiety from you being in danger...the anxiety outweighs the happiness.
017	Lord Fraise...
018	I am honestly fond of your dedication and your willingness to improve, but...that's why...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0041
019	Please, realize that there is someone who may be worried about you getting hurt.
020	You're...right...	VO_eve.eve_event_1005
021	Lady Eve, I'm sorry if I came across strongly...
022	But, I'm glad you understand what I mean.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
023	Yes. I know exactly what you mean.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1023
024	I didn't know you cared so much about me, Lord Fraise!
025	Eheheh. Oh dear. Sorry. Even though I got you riled up, I feel really happy!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
026	La-Lady Eve...?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0049
027	Don't worry. I got it.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
028	After all, just the thought of you getting hurt for me, Lord Fraise...it scares me a lot.
029	Oh...ah, yeah. That's what I wanted to convey to you.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0016
030	I feel so happy. Thank you, Lord Fraise.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0033
031	Um...not at all. Thank you...for caring about me so much.	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1008
032	That being said, I didn't think speaking to you sternly would make you so happy.
033	Eheheh. Well then, you're hungry, aren't you? Hold on a little. I'm gonna work extra hard to make something nice!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
034	N-no, I...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0047
035	Ahaha. See, you are hungry. I'll borrow your kitchen. It'll be ready right away.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0008
036	I-I'm sorry...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0018
037	No, it's fine♪ Oh, by the way...	VO_eve.eve_chara_1020
038	...?
039	I'll try to be more careful so that you won't have to worry in the future, Lord Fraise.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
040	But also...
041	I'm going to become even stronger!
042	I'm going to blow away all the danger that comes your way♪
043	Meanwhile, I would be very happy if you would protect me♪	VO_eve.eve_sys_0048
044	Lady Eve...	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_1007
045	Whoa! So-sorry! I think my stomach is at its limit...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0047
046	Heheh. Got it. Let's have lunch.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0048
047	Yes! Leave it to me! I've been practicing a loooot for you, Lord Fraise!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
048	Alrighty! I'm gonna do my best♪	VO_eve.eve_sys_0023
049	Oops...I need to be careful not to overdo it so I don't injure myself♪	VO_eve.eve_sys_0042
