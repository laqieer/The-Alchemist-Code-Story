001	Huff...huff...! Where are you? Where are you...Zain?!
002	Agghh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
003	Ughh...! Wh-who's there?!
004	Kudan...stop there!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0015
005	Ya-Yauras?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
006	Kudan! Do you understand what it is that you're doing?! Ugff!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
007	You seem to be in quite a lot of pain. How about you take it easy and rest?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
008	Uck! I-if you're gonna taunt me, then do it after you've defeated me. I'll knock you clean off your feet!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
009	You should know by our encounter just now that I'm not the same person that I used to be.
010	Get out of the way, Yauras. I don't want to hurt any more of my friends.
011	I-I'm not going anywhere. For the sake of this world's future...I cannot allow you to pass!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0039
012	Hah! How many times do I have to tell you before you understand?! Zain is...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
013	You're the one who's being tricked! You cannot seek easy power!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
014	Open your eyes! If you allow the darkness to swallow you any further, there'll be no coming back!
015	Wh-what is this?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
016	Lord Zain! He must have arrived at the Mikaboshi!
017	Kagura is in danger!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0022
018	Huff...huff...
019	Yauras...you have one last chance to change your mind.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
020	I-I told you, didn't I? If you're gonna get past me, you'll have to defeat me first.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
021	Do you want to die?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
022	If I can't stop you.
023	There's my truth...your truth...the truth Zain holds...and the truth that Greed Dike holds.
024	How many truths are there? Which is the real truth?
025	Kagura is faced with a dilemma...that too is the undeniable truth.
026	Ultimately...humans can only follow the path that they choose to believe! I will embrace the truth that I chose to believe.
027	...!
028	Yauras...do not get in the way of my truth or I'll turn you into mist!
