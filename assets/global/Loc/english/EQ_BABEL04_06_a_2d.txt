001	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0032
002	You can't beat me if you're carrying all that baggage around, you know.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
003	Nnngh...uugh! Aaaaaaaaaaagh!!!
004	Yomi?! What's happening?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
005	The Discarnate Power is separating itself from Yomi?! Is it manifesting as a kind of...Demon?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
006	It's what Sumeragi was made for! Exercising the evil out of its host! Exercising...? Whatever.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
007	Can we...save Yomi?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
008	Well...that was what I meant to do, but...	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
009	Ghaaaaah! Aaaah! Uuugh! Urgh!
010	It won't fully leave her! Why?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
011	Either the hatred within Yomi is bonded too tightly with the Discarnate Power, or...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
012	Or? Or what?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
013	Yomi does not want to have the power separated from her.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
014	What?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
015	That's nonsense!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0013
016	Yomi suffered for so long trying to subdue and overcome her hatred!
017	Either way, this is the best Sumeragi can do.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
018	Gotta go deeper.
019	What do you mean...deeper?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
020	Well...that is...uhm...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
021	Aaaagh! Aaaaaaaagh!!!
022	Argh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
023	Leafah?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
024	Didn't I tell you I've got your back?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
025	If you have a plan, you better get on top of it, now!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
026	I'll clear the way for you if necessary!
027	Don't forget, I am the General of Greed Dike!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
028	You got it!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
029	Yomi! Can you hear me?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
030	Is this how you envisioned overcoming your past?!
031	Of course it's not! Wasn't there supposed to be a better way?!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
032	Do you think that slaughtering everyone and everything in sight will settle all your problems?! I know that's not what you want!
033	Ugh... Urrrk!
034	I want to be your friend!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
035	Rraaaaagh!
036	Leafah!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
037	We'll need to revise the dispelling effects of Sumeragi to act a little more...vehemently.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
038	How can we do that? If there's anything I can do to save Yomi, to save Leafah, to save Wadatsumi... I'll do it!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0029
039	Okay, so, uh... The demonic power is too much for any single person to wield. It's best in the hands of a demon.	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
040	So someone of the Kagomurasaki Clan who is marked with strong affinity to their demonic heritage would be suitable.
041	Y-you mean...me.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
042	Theoretically, if the blood of the Black Star Clan can awaken Sumeragi, then the blood of the Kagomurasaki Clan will surely be able to enhance it to contest the Discarnate Power.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
043	It should circulate the demonic power hidden within the sword through its wielder to boost their combat prowess and make them as strong as a demon.
044	But...	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
045	What? What's the matter?
046	You could say it's a double-edged sword. Excessive power can ruin the wielder.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
047	If the wielder is not an heir of the Kagomurasaki Clan or has not held the sword for long enough to grow accustomed to its power, then...
048	Their body may not be able to handle the flow of energy. They'll gain incredible power for a moment, but death will follow soon after.
049	Hmph... You're surprisingly kind, you know that?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
050	Huh?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
051	Urgh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
052	Leafah!
053	Yomi... I see myself in you. You bear a burden much too big for yourself.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
054	You overstretch yourself to do something beyond your capabilities. I understand you. So come back, and let's have a chat.
055	We've known each other for only a short time, but I want to see you again. Wake up, Yomi!
056	Nng... Urgh!
057	Yomi?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0027
058	That's it! Come back, Yomi! I'm here!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
059	Uuurgh! Aaaaaaagh!!!
060	Nngh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
061	Raaaaaaah!
062	Are those...tears?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0021
063	Aaargh! Aaaaaagh!
064	Is Yomi...suffering?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
065	You can hear me, right, Yomi?! You can still come back to us!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
066	Ren.
067	You are kind.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
068	Wh-what are you talking about?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
069	You found a way out for me.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
070	...
071	We both despised regulations and the idea of predestination. I was lost, but then you showed me that even I have the freedom to choose.
072	I thank you, Ren.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0033
073	Jin... You're killing me here.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
074	I'm a man doomed to be killed by his little sister.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0010
075	I can't let some monster kill me in her stead!
076	Ren! Lend me a hand, all right?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
077	You got it!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
078	Leafah! Watch over me until it's done!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
079	Got it!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
080	I'm grateful to have met you both!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0033
081	Gaaaaaaaah!!!
082	Yomi... I will never leave you alone again.	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
083	Where does this road to hell end?!
084	There is no way to escape!
085	I've cast away all that keeps me trapped!
086	I am the blade that cuts down demons!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0012
087	I'm the Demonic Killer, Jin!
