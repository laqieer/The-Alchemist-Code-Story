001	The Jam...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
002	Yeah, apparently they've come as far as inside the marketplace. Honestly, what's going on?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
003	There have been massive outbreaks all across Saga. Have you heard anything about the cause?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
004	The cause of the outbreaks...? Why would you want to know that?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
005	I thought that, since you merchants go from place to place...you might know something about it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
006	If we can determine the cause, we can do something to prevent it, right?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
007	Hey, hold on...so you're not customers?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
008	Customers? We don't need your pots. We've got no money for such things.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
009	He-hey, Tina...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
010	What did you say?! Off with the lot of you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
011	W-wait! Any information would be helpful! Have you noticed anything strange...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
012	First off, what factions are you from?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
013	Voda faction.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
014	...Fuu faction.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
015	You've got some nerve...! Why would I give information to people who aren't from my faction?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
016	Hey! Of course he won't tell us anything if we tell him the truth!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
017	Excuse me...I'm from the Tehre faction.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
018	You're the worst of the bunch!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
019	...It didn't work.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
020	... ...
021	Mocca, it's a waste of time. Let's go.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
022	...Yeah.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
023	Tsk! You're the ones who wasted my time! Get out of here and don't come...eeek?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
024	Glurrpp...! Gluuurp...!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
025	Th-the Jam...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
026	Hmph. That's what he gets for being rude to us.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
027	Now isn't the time for that! We need to help him!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
028	Of course.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
029	Yes...let's help.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
