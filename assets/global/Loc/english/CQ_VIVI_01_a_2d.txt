001	All right! The day's work is done. Time to hit the town and find something to eat!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0023
002	Hey, Vivi! Come here for a sec. Are you still in contact with the Supreme Commander?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
003	Yeah.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0005
004	The top brass want information on her. Give me something, will ya? Anything will do.
005	Anything? That's vague. Who wants what, now? Try being more specific, or I can't really tell you anything.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0016
006	This is top secret information, but I guess I'll tell ya. A recently appointed Officer of hers has had some kinda backroom dealings with one of ours.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0045
007	The dealings actually aren't all that important. It's the relationship itself that could cause trouble. Depending on how this comes to light, we may need to be prepared to react.
008	I see. I don't have any information on that. Sorry!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0036
009	I'll keep it in mind, though. If I notice anything, I'll let you know! See you around!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0035
010	Information about Mei Fang, huh? I guess she is the Supreme Commander of Greed Dike.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
011	Whereas, I'm a spy for Wratharis. I guess it is pretty weird that we're friends.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
012	Ah, thinking about Mei Fang makes me want to see her again! I might have to go pop in for a visit.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
013	Reporting! It seems that Wratharis' National Secret Ops has begun collecting information on the Officer you recently appointed.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0004
014	We have also become aware of the presence of assassins. We advise you to be wary of any unidentified persons in the area.
015	Understood. You may leave.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0004
016	Wratharis' National Secret Ops... So long as Vivi is not involved, I—	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0018
017	Hey, Mei Fang! How's it going?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0008
018	Vivi. You're as impertinent as ever, I see. I am well, as always. And you?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
019	Well, I'm all right.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0011
020	What is it? Is something troubling you?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0005
021	Ah! No! I'm fine! I'm great, actually!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0025
022	I see. I would like to talk to you, but I have a war council scheduled. I will be leaving shortly. What will you do?	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0022
023	Well, I just wanted to come and see you. I guess I did that, so I might go home.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
024	Hmm... I see. All right, then. Goodbye.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0016
025	Yeah! See you later!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0033
026	I'll see her off, at least. I should be able to watch her from the roof.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0030
027	There she is! I've got a perfect view from up here!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0023
028	...
029	H-hey! What's he...? Hey! Mei Fang! Behind you, there's—!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0026
030	I am well aware!	VO_meifan.meifan_battle_0001
