001	Enough!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
002	...I grow weary of this nonsense.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0010
003	Did it work?! I think it did, but...
004	My hits simply aren't powerful enough. If only I could purify the corruption within her...
005	What the...? The ground is...shaking?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
006	Don't tell me this tower is collapsing...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
007	If I fall from this height, I can't possibly survive!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
008	Why would this tower be so fragile?!
009	Because it doesn't have enough offerings to sustain it.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
010	What?
011	The things that hold this tower together are the cores of the Cursed Beasts and the magil collected from Superbia Belt.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
012	However, the one who controls those cores now is you.
013	So the only thing supporting this feeble tower is the limited magic you have to offer.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0011
014	That can't be!
015	So...because I was suppressing the wild magil before, there isn't enough fuel for the tower to remain standing?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
016	I don't regret it. I won't! Power taken from the deaths of those I intended to save is not power I desire, regardless of the circumstances.
017	But...at this rate...
018	(I can't fight. I can't even run away!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
019	With no foothold, you cannot stand against me.
020	Huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
021	What is she...?
022	At last, I have obtained it. This tower is made of magil, just like my Shell. In addition...
023	Agh—?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
024	A new attack?!
025	Finally, I've come to a conclusion.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
026	Alchemy... Like me, it takes Truth and manipulates it to create distortions within reality. Its scope is more limited than my own, and yet...
027	It exhibits a more focused application of magil, capable of actualizing the reality contained within the record of the magil itself.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
028	Th-that's...
029	Those flames are representative of the heat from the restless volcano in Ire Belt.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0045
030	That ice recalls the freezing cold of the blizzards in Luxuria Belt.
031	You take what you have learned of other worlds and add it to your repertoire.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0002
032	Which means you should be able to do this as well!
033	What? How?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
034	(We're much too high up. There shouldn't be anyone here with us! What...was she saying...?)
035	You've finally realized, no?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
036	Wait...
037	No. It can't be. No! Did she create them with...Alchemy...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
038	This is...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
039	Hmm. Intriguing.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
040	(No! If my intuition is correct, then that's—!)
041	There is no reason for one such as I to bother fighting a human child who can barely hold this tower together.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0001
042	However, it is a good chance to give you a little test. The right opponent for you would be another human who's just a little ahead of the game.
043	Let's see how easily you can defeat someone from the past, child.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0041
044	...Ngh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
045	(A single glance is enough to know that they're made entirely of magil.)
046	(A magil of an even higher density than the average human's!)
047	Such an imposing presence...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
048	(Not even standing before Lord Kubera did I feel fear like this. I can't stop myself from shaking.)
049	Hmph. How disappointing.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
050	I thought I'd have a more exciting opponent, having been called to the battlefield of a god.
051	But you are no warrior. You're strong, sure! But you don't have the heart of a killer. You've probably never even entertained the idea of stealing from someone, much less ending a life!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0014
052	You're a sickening pillar of righteousness, standing tall in a heaven of sinful corruption!
053	I actually rather like it like this, Matia.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
054	Isn't it a good sign that this world is at peace?
055	The mere existence of such a person implies that they've been raised right, in a just world.
056	A world in which no one has to fight to live... Melvillei has always said that that's what awaits us, one day.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
057	Well, well. You haven't changed at all, have you, Mesarthim?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
058	Unfortunately, I must disagree. Humans are weak. So weak, it practically brings me to tears. Surely you must know this, too!
059	I'm not weak. I'm tough!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0019
060	Are you? I suppose in some ways. But you can be rather soft, as well.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0003
061	...
062	...
063	Anyway, since we are here, we might as will fulfill the role we were called upon to play. Let us test whether this generation of humans has inherited the will to live.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
064	Certainly. I'm quite keen to see how well humans have honed their animal instincts. 	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
065	How much have you strayed in your quest to assert your humanity? Let's find out!
066	Wh-whoa!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
067	(This isn't good. That's—)
068	Nrk!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
069	Wh-what was that? They...dodged my attack?! How did they get so close to me so quickly?!
070	I defended myself with Alchemy. I'm almost sure I did! I clearly blocked that!
071	But, my left arm... When did they get that hit in?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
072	Ah... Tsk, tsk. Two against one hardly makes this a fair fight, now, does it? Too bad, so sad!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
073	Yes, but he did manage to block my strike. I didn't expect that from a toothpick like him.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
074	Really? Then I'll let you handle him. It's much too boring for me to bother with someone who couldn't even perceive my attack.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
075	I expected better from a member of my beloved Sephira. How the mighty have fallen!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0042
076	...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
077	(I can't panic here. I've still got a chance. They're underestimating me.)
078	(The problem is...)
079	Even just one of them is clearly more powerful than I am.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
080	So what are my options? I'm not sure I have any. I should retreat for now, and live to fight another day.
081	Nnngh?! Another vision?! Are you trying to say something to me? I don't understand!
082	Taking one's eyes off the opponent? Not so smart, are you, child!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0001
083	Nngh?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
