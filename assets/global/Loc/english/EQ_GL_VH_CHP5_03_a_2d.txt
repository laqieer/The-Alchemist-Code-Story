001	- Goetia Headquarters -
002	The Doktor flips through his clipboard, nodding to himself in the stilted silence.
003	By my calculations, there should not be any...ah...disruptions to your bodies from the 'pulse'.
004	I have dispatched ground technicians to ascertain its...exact nature, but in the meantime, you are to be discharged.
005	Neither of your symbiotic links—that is, Paimon and Astaroth—appear to be worse for wear...which is most heartening.
006	That little thing shouldn't be able to knock us out like that. The sooner we figure out why, the better.
007	My best guess is that she possesses an aura capable of disrupting the natural flow of Alchemia in a specific frequency—
008	Huh. That could get messy.
009	Tch... Of all the things to complicate.
010	Y-Yes. In any case, I would suggest that you continue to monitor your...your condition for the time being, and that of Astaroth's.
011	It would help in isolating the symptoms and...and aid in my research.
012	...All right. The Director will be expecting success.
013	Now if you'll excuse me, I have my own report to make.
014	Would it kill him to take that attitude down a notch?
015	I swear, one day I should...
016	The Doktor peers around for any snooping attendants, then lowers his voice to a whisper.
017	Eliza.
018	The flare should...should not have escaped the cryotube, from what I know of the design.
019	Did you notice if its facade was cracked?
020	I wouldn't be surprised if it was, given how wildly Subject VI was swinging that sword around...
021	Speaking of which, we've yet to find her.
022	Useless dimwits. At this rate, that Li Wang is going to climb all over our heads...
023	I believe the Director will be much more concerned about Lachesis.
024	You and Grimm may have emerged unscathed, but there is no telling how much more powerful the pulse could have been.
025	You think she will pose a danger to the living weapons.
026	They are not infallible, Eliza. And as a host, if the weapon fails to function...
027	...I know I live on borrowed time, Father.
028	But it isn't mine to spend.
029	...
030	Get some rest, my dear. The Director should be expecting you soon.
031	A few days later, in a shadowed room somewhere in the Goetia headquarters...
032	A frigid silence permeates the room, punctuated by the crisp flips of a report.
033	I trust you are both recovered. I have received the Doktor's report, and will need you operationally ready.
034	Of course, Director. Shall I retrieve what they stole from us?
035	No. Until such time as we are able to determine the extent of Lachesis's Alchemia disruption, you would be wise to keep your distance.
036	Li Wang, move forward with the assessment of the Atropos Core.
037	I expect its functionalities to be restored while we perfect its new homunculus shell.
038	We have already observed favorable progress with Subject R; it will not be long before it is ready.
039	The Doktor has been notified and will be assisting you.
040	It would be my pleasure, Director. I won't let a disgraced, fallen noble bar our way.
041	We have enough of his data logs to recreate the experiments all the same.
042	I guarantee it will be far more successful than the events of late.
043	The drug regimen is not to blame for Subject VI's anomalous behavior.
044	Oh? And what about that other one—what do you call her, Godslayer?
045	She, like all of us here, owes a debt of gratitude to Goetia for our new lives.
046	Fail to live up to expectations and she pays the price with blood. You didn't think that collar was for show, did you?
047	I disagree. Never trusted her gamboling ways.
048	Godslayer has proven her worth on several occasions. And Belial resonates well with her; absent our ministrations she would struggle to control the entity, much less wield it.
049	...As you say, Director.
050	Eliza, continue the search for Lachesis, but do not engage. We will want to keep track of their movements.
051	Yes, Director.
052	As for Subject VI...Grimm I, you are to dispose of her on sight and retrieve Berith.
053	Understood.
054	Dismissed.
055	Meanwhile, at the Lustberg borders...
056	There she is! Don't let her get away, or it'll be your head on the block!
057	Yes sir!
058	How persistent...
059	I have to make it over the next hill, at least.
060	With any luck, Professor Minerva and the rest will be waiting there.
