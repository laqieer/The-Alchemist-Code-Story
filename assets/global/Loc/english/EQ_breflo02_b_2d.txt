002	You are much stronger than when you last came to the Door of Truth. I have observed your soul that burns like fire.
003	Hah. You haven't seen anything yet!	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0007
004	What?
005	I think I came to this world because there's someone who needs my power. Am I right?
006	Hm. There may be truth to that.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
007	If so, I'll become friends with those whose strength I recognize!
008	I'll use what strength I gain to help others! I'm sure that'll bring some change to this world. That's the conclusion I've reached.
009	It seems there's still others worth fighting. I'm looking forward to it.
010	Come on. I wanna take on stronger opponents!	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0008
011	Heh. You're an interesting one.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0007
