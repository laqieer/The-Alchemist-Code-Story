001	Agh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
002	I got you. We have to focus. The first ships of the enemy fleet will get to the city soon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0043
003	Most of the Purple Flame Knights are out here on the ocean! If we don't stop them now, we'll lose this battle!
004	I'm getting ready to deploy the Engineer Soldiers! But I don't have the room to make a sharp turn.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
005	If those enemies reach the city, we won't be able to stop them anymore!
006	I know that, but—!
007	Grrraaaaaggghhh!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0032
008	The corruption is still building?! We're going to have to use our trump card now!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
009	Andechs!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
010	—I hear you loud and clear! Be there in a snap, so just hold tight a lil' longer!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
011	Sorry, princess. I'll have to borrow your sacred beastie for a bit.
012	You're fighting to protect our kingdom, so there's no need to apologize. Look, Selsieg is raring to go too!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0039
013	Bwirruru!
014	Haha, perfect! Let's hurry!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0008
015	...I can...still...go...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
016	Daphne! Don't overdo it! If you keep going forward alone, then—!
017	N-no...! This shield and I must...somehow...at least protect...all of you.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
018	Worthless—	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
019	Ngh!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0026
020	You are not enough to face me.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0016
021	The will to despise the enemy, the resolve to battle for supremacy, the anger that burns straight through your soul... None of it is enough.
022	If this is all that a knight of Invidia is, then you do not have the right to call yourself my enemy.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0030
023	Ngh...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
024	Just die. You are not fit to be a soldier anyway. It's your mistake for thinking you'd be anything but unsightly on the battlefield.	VO_arius.arius_battle_0010
025	D-Daphne!
026	I can't get a hit in!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
027	Ah...
028	(Captain Imnus, Lady Nicaea, I'm so sorry.)	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0036
029	(I.. I couldn't follow through in the end...)
030	Now give in—	VO_arius.arius_battle_0012
031	(I knew it... I wasn't good enough for this shield...)	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0018
032	Huh? I'm...alive?
033	Aren't you giving up a bit too quickly there, little lady?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
034	H-huh?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
035	I told you before, didn't I?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
036	"Let's leave the questions and incredulities for later, shall we? Keep your eye on what's happening right in front of you. We're trying to prevent a tragedy over here!"
037	I...
038	Stand up and brace yourself. This battle isn't over yet!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
039	As long as we still have the will to keep fighting, no battle is ever truly over!
040	Andechs, you came!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
041	Heh, sorry for the wait.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
042	I appreciate that you wanted to prevent me from having to turn my blade against my own people. However...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0033
043	This is already my battlefield!
044	I'm burning with righteous wrath! I'm here for the weak, the just, the ones who wish to protect something!
045	Affirming all these people is the path I have chosen to walk!
046	Now that I'm here, I won't let you take anything away!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0030
047	Groooooaaaaaagghh!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0032
048	ANDEEEECHS!!
049	Be careful!
050	Well, well... A test of strength? Luckily, this just happens to be my specialty!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
051	He pushed his sword back?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
052	Mwuahaha! That's right! You would be able to!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0023
053	This knight...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
054	(His strength is one thing, but why is he so obsessed with me?)
055	(He's acting like he knows who I am...but I don't remember doing anything that'd make anyone so passionate about killing me!)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
056	...We're not backing down!
057	Everyone, pick yourselves back up! This is the moment of truth!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0040
