001	If this keeps up, we won't be able to get away!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
002	Forgive me.
003	You have nothing to apologize for. We just need to find somewhere to hide...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
004	Kamui! Over here!
005	Hisham?
006	None of those Gluttony jerks are over this way! Hurry!
007	Got it! Malta, can you stand?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
008	Y-yes...
009	I'm glad the two of you are okay!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
010	What about everyone else? Has Isidore returned?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
011	I don't know about Isidore, but the warriors that came back are at the Chief's house, buying us all some time!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
012	There's an escape route hidden behind the trunk of Sephiron. They won't catch us if we flee that way!
013	...
014	What are you doing, Kamui? We have to run!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1013
015	Hisham... I need you to do something for me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
016	Huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
017	Take Malta and go on without me.
018	Wh-what? No way! I can't just leave you!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0014
019	The Chief told me specifically to tell you to run!
020	As Protector...and as one who was raised by this village...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0039
021	These people are my family. I must do whatever I can to save whoever I can.
022	Kamui...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0022
023	Please...promise me one thing.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
024	I will.
025	Promise me that you will live...and we will meet again.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_1001
026	Of course. I promise that I will live and come to find you.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
027	Thank you. I'll be waiting.
028	Are you ready, Kamui?
029	Yes. Take care of Malta.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0041
030	Haa... Haa... Haa...!
031	You won't get away, kid!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
032	Urk! No!
033	Ugh, this business of killing kids already makes me sick, and now I have to work for it...	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
034	"Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of mercilessness!"	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_0005
035	Urgh?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0024
036	P-Protector?!
037	Follow the aqueducts out of the village! Others will be waiting for you there!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
038	O-okay!
039	And you... I will not let you take another step!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0007
040	That day, I could do nothing but channel my overwhelming yet helpless anger outwards.
041	I had seen the true face of Gluttony Foss, an insatiable, gaping maw that personified the sin of its Sacred Stone.
042	A country in which many flourish by stealing from their neighbors, in which life is stolen by engineering the deaths of others.
043	In which culture and government are built upon the cruel reality of a dog-eat-dog society.
044	In which the weak have no means of protecting themselves from being swallowed up by the greedy and powerful.
045	And yet...I believed that there should exist a means for them to protect themselves. That there should exist a way to protect everyone.
046	I lived my life believing this with all of my heart.
047	That is why, for me, that time and place was like a dream. One that was too good to be true.
