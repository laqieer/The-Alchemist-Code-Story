001	Ah... You're that kid from the other day.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0026
002	... ...
003	Hey, listen. I'm sorry about the other day. I was a little irritated.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0022
004	I'm sorry about your friend as well.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0036
005	He's not a friend; he's family.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0039
006	Family...huh?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
007	(I feel like that's a word I discarded long ago.)
008	If he's your family, then take good care of him.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
009	Yes. Of course.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
010	Well then, today I will show you and your family an amazing trick.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0023
011	Those cards of yours are so amazing, old man!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0026
012	Yep. My ability with cards is amazing, but it's about time you stopped calling me old man.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
013	I have a name; it's Magnus.
014	I'm Mia and this is Woody.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0008
015	Mia and Woody, huh? All right, watch carefully. There's nothing up my sleeves.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
016	Nothing.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0006
017	Watch this single card....one, two, three...
018	Look, now there's three.
019	Wow! How?! How?!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0024
020	And, while you're saying that, five cards, ten cards, twenty cards!	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0023
021	Wow! He-hey, Woody! It's amazing, isn't it? I wonder if it's Alchemy.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0044
022	No, it's not. I told you before, didn't I? These are just tricks. 
023	I discarded Alchemy...long ago.
024	...?
025	(That's right. I discarded both my family...and Alchemy.)
