002	I've been looking for a powerful therian like you. One with plenty of Alchemia. It seems as though my wish has been granted.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
003	Looking for one? What do you mean?	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
004	We've had reports of our targets using incantation gear that suppresses the power of therians. Be careful.
005	No...
006	Ngh... I c-can't move...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0043
007	I'd be a fool to confront a therian without having something up my sleeve.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
008	Don't worry, it's just something to make sure you don't cause any trouble. I'll show you right to our base. Isn't that what you wanted?
009	Unfortunately, your welcome will not be as a guest, but as...raw material.
