001	So you've finally made it here, Pursuers?
002	I hope you do not expect that this battle will be like those that you've faced before.
003	Beelzebub is the Cursed Beast that rules over Gluttony. Inside his body, he breathes in all of the life that has fallen into sin even now.
004	This is why the ancestors of the Sephira worked with Nidhogg to seal Beelzebub away.
005	From the very beginning, none of you could ever have the means to defeat Beelzebub.
006	The Cursed Beast of Gluttony consumes all, and from that spawns more.
007	A never-ending cycle of sin. In addition...
008	At present, three cores lie inside Beelzebub's body.
009	No matter how much you study or sharpen your skills, it is already much too late to accomplish anything.
010	It all ends here.
011	With the true awakening of this Cursed Beast, the world shall descend into sin once more.
012	The barrier between corruption and purification will vanish, and this land will be unified again!
013	What's this shaking?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
014	Ahhh! What's going on?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
015	What's happened?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
016	Sephiron... Mother of All... The Tree of Life!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
017	What happened to Sephiron! Tell me!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
018	This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
019	Sephiron... The Tree of Life has been...devoured by the Cursed Beast? It...can't be...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
020	This is the end! We've lost everything! Our salvation is gone!
021	No! Sephiron is the one symbol of hope to the people of Sephira...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
022	For them to lose that hope after suffering through all of this... This is beyond their capacity to endure!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
023	But not only that... Corruption is spreading from their sephirah?
024	Aaaahh.... Aaah...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
025	No, no, no, no, no!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0028
026	Everyone, calm down! We still have the protection of Sephiron! We can fight with the aid of the Godwolf!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
027	No... No... Aaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
028	It's over... It's over!
029	No... They aren't listening?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
030	At this rate, they will become Sinners... What should we do, Nimul?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
031	Urgh...!
032	...
033	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
034	Eulalia...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
035	"In the beginning, there was sin; the Tree of Life, our great mother, our light came to purify it..."
036	That prayer... The prayer to succeed the Vessel of Purification...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
037	"Crowns set aside and knowledge gained, to be distributed to the kingdoms..."	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0032
038	That light... Oh, this is the warmth of Sephiron!
039	My anxiety... My fears! They're gone?
040	This is...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
041	Eulalia has taken their sin. But that would mean...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
042	Is everyone...okay...?	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
043	I have become the Priestess of Sephiron. It is my duty as the acting Vessel of Purification...
044	Compared to being sealed away inside of a Cursed Beast, this is fine!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0011
045	Forget me! Now's your chance!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
046	Understood! Waginau, I'm counting on you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
047	I've got it!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
048	Warriors, remember our mission! This crumbling world needs us now, more than ever. This is where we make our last stand!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
049	The great tree no longer stands tall before us, but the compassion of its priestess is still here with us!
050	So we warriors of Sephira must rise to the occasion!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
051	Lord Waginau!
052	Apologies... We are ready to return to the battlefield!
053	Good! Let's combine our power, and continue down the road our chief Nimul has carved for us!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
054	Onward march!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0007
055	Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
056	If we encounter any Sinners, we will take care of them! Nimul and the others will head toward the source of this all—the Cursed Beasts!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
057	Understood!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
058	Hmph... This is definitely the role I'm most suited for...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
059	Let's march, fellow warriors! Now is the time to demonstrate our hard-won mastery of Spiritbonding!
