001	So what will we do now? Let me hear your thoughts.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
002	Well, first and foremost we have to think of some way to defeat the Discarnate Power.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
003	I will search for some clues in our records regarding demons. Hopefully there's a clue as to how to kill it.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
004	What I am more concerned about is the force field deep within the castle. The Discarnate Power said it was after what is kept there.
005	...
006	It has been made abundantly clear that the Demon Paragon will come for it. There is no point feigning ignorance.
007	What is being kept in the castle?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
008	...
009	Celis.
010	I guess I can't keep it a secret any longer.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0038
011	I will tell you everything.
012	What?!
013	That's everything.
014	I see...
015	How dare you keep that from us!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0012
016	I couldn't risk such information being leaked.
017	So, just as the Discarnate Power said. Demons aim to eradicate humans and build a country of their own.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0045
018	In order to achieve this, they plan to eliminate potential obstacles. It makes sense.
019	This is why we cannot allow Castle Aquila Rubrum, the home base of the Blade Fox to fall.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
020	To do that, we must defeat the Discarnate Power.
021	I will find a way to kill that thing.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
022	I'll do what I can too. I don't see myself ever taking a good nap in a world run by demons.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
023	I'm counting on you two.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0041
024	All right! Now that we're done here, let's have ourselves a feast!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
025	What makes you think we have time for such frivolity?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0005
026	What?
027	We need to focus on the mission at hand. I'm going to be—
028	Did you just call meal time a "frivolity?"
029	Ugachi, you shouldn't have said that.
030	Your mind cannot work properly without a good meal. You do know this, right? Do you not know this? Are you or are you not the captain of the Second Squad?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0013
031	Do you think someone who can't appreciate the little things in life is fit to be a captain? Are you qualified to bring peace to Wadatsumi? Answer me, Ugachi.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
032	It's just that... Uh... I—	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
033	Three meals a day is the foundation of life! Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!
034	Say it!
035	But I just—
036	You want to stay home for the next mission? Is that what you're telling me?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
037	H-hey...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
038	Repeat what I said if you want to be part of this mission! What's the foundation of life?!
039	Strength of mind and body comes from a hearty meal!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0018
040	Good! All right, I'm going to go prepare now.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0006
041	Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
042	Every. Single. Time.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
043	You should just stop talking back to her.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0027
044	...
045	Azami?	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
046	Thank you for the meal.
047	Hey! Where are you going?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
048	Training. I can't just stand around and do nothing.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
049	Uhm...
050	...
051	What is it, Amane?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0005
052	Celis? Ahh, it's nothing.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
053	Is this seat taken?
054	Celis...?
055	Tanosuke was worried about you. He said you looked like you could use some advice.
056	Captain Tanosuke said that?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
057	He generally prefers not to get involved with other people's affairs, but he seems to really care for you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
058	He does care about his subordinates, so try not to make him so worried, okay?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
059	I know.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
060	Amane... What makes up your everyday life?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
061	Me?
062	For me, it's getting to enjoy a meal like this with everyone.
063	Everybody has something that makes up their everyday life. I used to think I had to protect all of it for everyone's sake.
064	But I could never find a way to do that. So I wield my blade so that I can come back to this.
065	I see.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0044
066	Eating connects people. Even those you left behind back home.
067	They're seated at a table with someone they love. Just thinking that brings peace to my heart.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0047
068	I want to protect times like these. For that reason, I fight the demons.
069	Those you left behind back home?
070	Hehe, even I have a little history too, you know? Oh! Let me bring you your seconds!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0007
071	My everyday life...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0030
