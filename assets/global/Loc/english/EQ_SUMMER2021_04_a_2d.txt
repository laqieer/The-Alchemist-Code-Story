001	Have at you!	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0007
002	Damn... I thought with my experience in battle I could handle these ink-spitters! But with this many...	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0019
003	I can't fight them all alone. Things are getting out of hand...
004	Ah! Nefertiti!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
005	(We have to help her! But if I fire from here...)
006	(There's too great of a chance it might hit her. What do I do?)
007	(Nefertiti is strong, though. Maybe she'll be fine on her own...)	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0030
008	Oh!
009	Su Yi! Are you all right?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
010	Yes... S-Sorry, Shenmei.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
011	It's fine! It's fine! What's important is you want to help Nefertiti, right? I got the octopuses. You focus on that!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
012	I know you can do it!
013	O-Okay! I know what to do!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
014	Nefertiti! Stay right there! Don't move! ...Eeeyah!	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0007
015	She's scaring off the octopuses!
016	(She fired the cannon far enough away for me to be safe, but close enough to drive them away!)	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0045
017	Well done, Xiao-Xiao! I can take care of the rest. I'll have these filleted in three seconds! Yo ho!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0032
018	Nefertiti, are you okay?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0002
019	Yes, I'm fine. Thanks to Su Yi. Thank you for saving me.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
020	Oh! I'm just glad you're all right! I was worried my plan might not work...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
021	But Shenmei gave me the courage to do what I needed to!
022	I see...	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
023	If that should happen again, holler our way. You had us worried!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
024	I'm sorry I caused you concern. I should've taken into account my unfamiliarity with the environment.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0036
025	I thought I wouldn't have a problem with that number, however...
026	Of course, you'd probably be fine taking on something like octopuses on your own, but...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
027	Even when you think you can deal with someone alone, you can still depend on us to help! We're in this together!
028	Depend on you...	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
029	I understand. As a leader who likes to take control, I hadn't thought of that.
030	Oof, when you put it that way, I'm sure it seems like I rely on others way too much.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0011
031	I couldn't even assess things ahead of time to help everyone avoid danger the way you could.
032	But I guess that's why everyone works so hard. It makes up for me being unreliable.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
033	That's not quite correct...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
034	Huh?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
035	Our captain may be a bit overly spirited, and also take the lead despite having no sense of north.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
036	However, no matter what we face, no matter how dangerous, she never backs down and protects everyone.
037	She trusts her friends more than anyone and keeps them safe. When I see her act that way, naturally I want to help any way I can.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
038	Liu Shen...
039	That's right. You're not unreliable, Shenmei.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0002
040	Whenever you tell me it's going to be okay, I believe you, and it gives me courage.
041	When the way out of that cave was blocked, she told us with a smile we'd figure it out and be all right.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
042	She took the lead to find another path and fought past the demons that blocked the way.
043	She said that no matter what happened, she would be first to face whatever came.
044	...
045	She always makes me want to be better and try hard... I know that whatever happens, we'll come out of it okay.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0007
046	Su Yi...!
047	You really feel that way? Thank you! You've made me so happy!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0009
048	Sh-Shenmei! Y-You're sort of squishing me!	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0019
049	You're right... We've been through so much, and there's a lot I could've done better...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
050	But we've always had fun! The best moments of my life have been with this trusting family!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
051	...
052	I feel I owe you an apology for dragging you into this motley crew.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
053	Let me assure you that you don't. Seeing the wonderful relationship you share has deeply moved me.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
054	The magic of your partnership comes by way of all the things you contribute sandwiched together.
055	...I suppose that's true.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
056	Of course, Xiao-Xiao's way of doing things wouldn't work just anywhere.
057	Indeed... I would not have been able to be like her in my prior position.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
058	But I still think it's fantastic that there is a leader like her. That there can be leaders like her.
059	I believe the reason this all works at all is because of the energy you all share.
060	I think the best thing is if we can all take strength from her and how she approaches things.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
061	...
062	(But it is true... I would struggle to be like her given my circumstances.)
063	Still, though! I want to be able to help my older sister more! I know I'm the unworthy younger brother, but...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
064	I want you to count on me... And I want to help you! If nothing else, it can only make things better!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0018
065	...
066	(Perhaps, if I'd let him help out a little more... Maybe I could've spared Ramses from what was to come his way.)	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
