001	Wow!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0024
002	This is it! The last one!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0012
003	Man, but when did the Jam start getting this aggressive? Things have changed a lot since I was a kid.
004	Has the seal on the Sacred Stone really become so weak?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
005	This is definitely becoming a problem. Gluttony can't hold off the Jam without the power of the Sephira that is capable of destroying them...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
006	With this civil war going on, if a bunch of these show up and start eating everyone out of house and home, there's not much we'll be able to do.
007	I said as much to General Leordas of the Liberation Army.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
008	When the fertility of the fields in the South was lost, the balance of this country was destroyed.
009	The destruction of this land was not all at the hands of us humans, though.
010	If not for the Sacred Stones, this level of catastrophe would not be possible.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
011	Kamui...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
012	I am no soldier, no noble, and certainly no king. There is nothing I can do for a war waged between people.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
013	However, there is something I can do about the Sacred Stone in this country... There must be!
014	Huh. That face says that you've made some sort of big choice. Careful that it doesn't get stuck that way.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0044
015	Yes... Isidore, I have decided to pursue the role of Protector.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
016	Protector... The role my father once held?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0045
017	I don't really know that much about it, but...
018	Nice! Sounds like Chief Iakov has finally come to recognize you as one of us!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
019	One of...? What does that mean? I thought Kamui was already one of the Sephira.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
020	Did I not tell you? I am like you, one who joined the Sephira village from the outside.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
021	Oh!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
022	There is a blood connection, but a weak one.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
023	It wasn't until I came to the Sephira village that I understood this mark, this sephirah, that is upon my body.
024	I lost my family to nature and happened upon the hidden village while wandering the desert.
025	I remember feeling that it hadn't all been for nothing—that all that had happened was for a reason, and that reason was for me to find the Sephira.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
026	Instead of "finding" us, it might be more accurate to say that you "returned" to us.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0030
027	For what it's worth, I've always seen you as one of the Sephira.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
028	Ha. Thank you, old friend. You don't change, do you?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0008
029	I'm so proud of you! My boy, stepping into his own, taking his place among our people! Brings one to tears. You're one of us, too, Hisham! Don't forget it!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0010
030	I-I won't!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0037
