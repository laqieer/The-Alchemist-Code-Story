001	Heheh.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
002	What's so funny?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
003	Nothing. It's just that it's been so long since I could talk to anyone like this... I'm kind of happy.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
004	You're a weird one, to feel something like that about the person trying to take your life.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
005	You just don't seem like that bad of a person, you know?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0006
006	Am I really your target? Or is it actually—	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0001
007	It's none of your business.
008	Heh heh. You're really sticking to your guns, but I think fate has something else in store for you.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
009	Shut up.
010	Hee hee. Getting so upset won't get you any closer to taking me down.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
011	What are you smiling for? Are you trying to act all composed or something?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
012	Nothing like that. I'm just happy.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0025
013	(What's wrong with her? Even after I said I was aiming to take her life, she still...)
014	(She's all alone, fated to be nothing but a tool used for others' purposes. How can she...?)
015	(Ugh. So annoying.)	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
016	Let's end this already.
017	Enough, Basheeny. There's another presence nearby. Retreat.
018	But...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
019	There will be another chance. We must accomplish our mission at all costs. Retreat and collect your thoughts.
020	You have some amazing luck.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
021	Will you come visit me again, Basheeny?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0001
022	(She's still smiling.)
023	...
024	Next time, there won't be a reprieve like this.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
025	Basheeny, huh?
026	It would be nice if fate brought our paths together again.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
027	So, the information was leaked?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0026
028	When I think about it, from that point on, the Holy Order was no longer a monolith.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0030
029	But I had been all alone, so there's no way I could have known, really.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0031
030	To think that Lord Commander Basheeny could act like a common killer...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0012
031	Lord Commander...Basheeny?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0025
032	He's the 12th Lord Commander.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0003
033	Aha... Hahaha. I was right. He wasn't a bad guy after all!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0008
034	So that must mean I ended up coming here before our fates could intertwine again.
035	Does that mean that you didn't end up here by Lord Commander Basheeny's hand?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0022
036	Right. That was just a preface to the story that explains why I'm here.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0005
037	The real issue is that there is someone I want to save, no matter what.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0002
038	There was another who was brought here and trapped while still living, like me... My only friend.
039	Saving her is what I believe to be the end game my fate is leading me toward!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0042
