001	Perish! Perish! Perish!
002	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0007
003	Arrrgghhh! Urrrggghh! It burns! It burns!
004	It took some time, but I managed to find out that the origin of that technique lies in Spiritbonding...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0016
005	Which means that I now know how to counter it!
006	Haaa... Ngh...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
007	(That attack from before got me worse than I thought. At this rate, I won't be able to—!)
008	Huzzzaaahhh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
009	L-Logi...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
010	Sorry I'm late. We'll deal with things here!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
011	Its weak point is that mark part, right? Got it!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
012	You! You dare interfere with my plans again?!
013	Grant me strength!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0007
014	Wh-what?!
015	That attack just now... I see. So you finally understand.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
016	We, the founders of Alchemy, draw and wield our power from the truth.
017	The first step is the art of making oneself that very key to the truth, and this is what gives us our startling powers!
018	That's not important right now—you're injured. Hold on, okay? I'll patch you up!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
019	Right... Thanks.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0041
020	Looks like that's the last of them. Gotta say, I didn't think they'd show up here of all places.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
021	It just shows how scared they are.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
022	The power of our Alchemy has them shaking in their boots!
023	Kamui, you need to take it easy.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
024	I can't. That girl, Agatha... We need to get her...to safety.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
025	Kamui?! Hey! Kamui! Wake up!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
026	It's been a while since I've worn this armor.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
027	It might feel like a bit of an exaggeration right now, but this armor is the symbol of our justice.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
028	So all that effort we spent keeping them polished and oiled meant something after all, huh? I'll keep that in mind.
029	As you should! May the Blue Flames blaze again!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
030	Oh, my! Don't you all look gallant!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0044
031	You think so, Lady Marie? Heh. Guess I'm not too bad, huh?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
032	Don't get excited, you dunce. Sorry for asking you to do menial things, Lady Marie.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
033	Not at all! I want to do whatever I can to help, too! Please let me know if you need anything, all right?
034	She's a nice girl.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
035	She is. I want to make this world a place in which people like her can live out their lives without shedding a single tear of grief.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
036	Well said—nngghh!
037	Oi! Who are you?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
038	I see that you have kept up your training.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
039	However, it is of little consequence. That armor of yours is truly meaningless, you see.
040	N-no way! It can't be! Y-you're...!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
041	Exactly what is so surprising? You should have known that there is nowhere for you to run.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
042	Now, answer me! Where is Logi?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
