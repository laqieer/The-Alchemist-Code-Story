001	Where...? Ah, right, I was devoured by Beelzebub...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
002	It's so cold here...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0019
003	...
004	That girl...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
005	Is this really what you wanted?
006	Agh! My head...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0022
007	Ah... Ju...lia...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
008	Silence! Don't call me by that name! I do not know her! I don't know anything about her!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0015
009	Are you...okay? I'm so sorry... Right now, I can't...use my healing...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
010	I don't need it! Just stop! Why even bother when you're half-dead yourself?! I should be nothing to you!	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0025
011	Because...you were my friend...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0011
012	That is why I believe...one day, we'll be friends...again...
013	Ah...
014	You're mistaken.	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0019
015	I am a Sinner. My existence is little more than sinful magic that consumes living things without corruption.
016	So... So I...
017	Even so...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
018	You're my Julia...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
019	I...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_battle_0025
020	Ahh... Ungh...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
021	E-Emmel...
022	...What have I done?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0025
023	This... Why have I become like this?
024	What's the point of feeling like this now, after all that I have done?	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0018
025	If this is how things are to end, it would have been better if I had just died completely...	VO_julia_dark.julia_dark_sys_0019
026	...
027	We're here! We're at Beelzebub's feet!
028	But the corruption is stronger than what we've faced already. What shall we do?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
029	I will awaken Sephiron and put Beelzebub to sleep. That was the plan...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0031
030	But... Beelzebub has grown enough to devour Sephiron... Maybe it's no longer possible to seal him away like this...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
031	We'll have to change our plan of attack...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
032	Taking on a Cursed Beast so large will be difficult, but we have another strategy we can use.
033	We will enter its body and strike its core directly!
034	How do you plan to do that? Even getting through the Beast's shell is going to be quite the task...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
035	No, there is a way. If it has truly swallowed Sephiron into itself...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
036	Yes, I will be able to open our path forward!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
037	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
038	What?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
039	It's too late to turn back, Yna. Don't worry, my Alchemy will protect us from the corruption!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
040	You say that, but...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
041	It worked?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
042	Yes, this is the arboreal altar at the heart of Sephiron... Well, currently at the heart of Beelzebub, I guess.
043	How do I say this... I feel like a sack of meat that has flung itself willy-nilly through a sea of corruption and survived it by the skin of its teeth...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
044	I see... An interesting way to describe that experience...
045	In any case, could Emmel truly be imprisoned in such a place as this?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
046	Impressive. You've made it across the corruption and made it this far.
047	To accomplish such a thing you would require a vessel of Sephiron; one with the abilities of a priestess...
048	So you readied a Vessel of Purification without my knowledge.
049	It's quite a shame, but the sacrificial daughter is no longer here. In fact, she is no longer of this world at all.
050	Zafeiris!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
051	Surrender now, pursuers of misfortune. Beelzebub has already awakened. It devours this land.
052	You are too late.
053	That's not something for you to decide.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
054	No matter how tough you act, you cannot change the truth.
055	That is a lie.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0010
056	Excuse me?
057	I can hear Emmel's voice from within Beelzebub's core behind you. It's the sound of a soul that is still fighting against sin!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0003
058	Emmel is still there!
059	Of course... You are the other priestess of sacrifice. Despite knowing, you still walk toward your demise...
060	What a shame!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0010
061	Yes. I am the one who was prepared as a spare vessel in case anything happened to Emmel.
062	I was hidden, of course. Who would go through the trouble of preparing such a thing, only to dangle it as bait before their enemies? No one smart, that's for sure.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
063	You make jokes in the face of your fate... I cannot comprehend such a way of thinking.
064	Give Emmel back, Zafeiris!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
065	Why? So she can be used as a tool against the Cursed Beasts again? As a sacrifice to save this world?
066	That won't happen. I won't allow it!
067	I will destroy the core of the Cursed Beast with the power of Alchemy!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
068	Fool.
069	Are you trying to say that it's not possible?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
070	No. Even debating the possibility is foolishness.
071	What...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
072	As I expected, I cannot allow you sway me from my path. I will not allow the dedication of our princess to be in vain!
073	I'll make you disappear right here!
