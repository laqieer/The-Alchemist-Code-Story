001	This is none of your business. Got it? Let it go.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_favorite_0009
002	Argh! Arghhh! Arggghhh!!!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0027
003	Let it go...? You gotta be kidding me! The nerve...! Ugh!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
004	Wh-whoa...not good. Did I lose too much blood? I'm starting to lose consciousness...ack! At this rate...	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0026
005	A-at this rate...I-I'm gonna...sink in the river...and...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0021
006	My arm is badly balanced, huh? Hmph. It's the boasters that always end up messing up big time. That's the law of the world.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
007	Phew. Johnny B. Tango...you've got only one chance. You better not mess up.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
008	Leave it to me, Don. I'll catch them as nimbly as my name suggests.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0006
009	Well said. Let's get this over with and go home. I'm dying for a drink.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
010	There's a 58-year-old Bleu du Goward prepared for you in the mansion.
011	Not bad. You're making my mouth water. Look...here's the idiot now.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
012	I'm off!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0007
013	...?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
014	Agh... Wh-what is this?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0043
015	I've no obligation to rescue another man. You're just an added bonus. Where's the young lady?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
016	Y-you...the...train...	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0023
017	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
018	Hu...hurry to the separated...train compartment.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
019	Tsk. How much of a clumsy idiot are you?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
020	The separated train compartment, correct?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0044
021	Yeah. Looks like the Bleu du Goward will have to be put on hold.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0006
022	Uhh...mmm?	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0021
023	So you're finally awake. Look at the state of you, you idiot.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
024	Tara baby?! So that's what happened...! Hey, where's the little lady?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
025	Shut up. We're heading to her now. Stop your grumbling.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
026	Tsk! Well, you're taking your time. There's no time to waste!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0043
027	You... How dare you speak to me like that?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
028	You've put the young lady in danger, thanks to your blunder.
029	If you're going to abduct her than at least do a good job of it...idiot.
030	Shut up. Right back at you, you waste of a massive arm.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
031	What did you say...?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0026
032	Seriously. Don't you have something to say before you try and pick a fight?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0010
033	Ronnie?! What are you doing here?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
034	You better show some appreciation. If it weren't for Ronnie, you would already be in the next life.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0008
035	...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
036	I don't need your appreciation. What I want is an apology!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0016
037	An apology...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
038	You gotta be kidding me! You left me behind!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0013
039	I thought we were friends! Argh! Just die already!
040	Whoa... After all the effort you were going through to look after him, isn't that a little harsh?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
041	Hey! Mind your own business!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
042	You were the one who looked after my injuries?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
043	Sh-shut up!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0012
044	...Let me correct one thing.
045	You said, ‘you thought we were friends'... That's a big mistake.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
046	...!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
047	You're cold. Ronnie was thinking of you when...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
048	Don't get me wrong.
049	There's no ‘we were friends.' We're still friends just as we were before.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
050	There's nothing that can sever our friendship.
051	...! Edgar...
052	You're right. I shouldn't have worried unnecessarily over someone I had accepted as my friend.
053	You're a fully responsible adult. I'm sorry for underestimating you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0036
054	Hmph. This chump is even dumber than you think he is. His stupidity knows no bounds. He didn't mean to hurt you. Try and find it in your heart to forgive him.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
055	Shut up, you massive-armed freak. Don't stick your stupid nose into our conversation.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
056	What did you say, you scum?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
057	Hehe! Come on. I'm sure the little lady is feeling lonely! Let's quickly go and rescue her!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0007
