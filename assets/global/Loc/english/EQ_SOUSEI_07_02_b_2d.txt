001	"Curse fixed. Space-Time Manipulation forced activation. I am the one who travels through time in sequence, the one who shuns the absurd."	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0032
002	Wait! Please, wait! I know I wronged you! I will pay for the damages! So, please stop!	VO_minario.minario_battle_0022
003	If you eat that, you'll definitely die!
004	Have you reflected on what you did wrong?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
005	I have! I really have!
006	Ambrosia, what is he doing?
007	I think he's prostrating himself for forgiveness. I believe this posture is the greatest expression of atonement.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
008	This is my first time seeing it, though.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
009	Please accept my deepest apologies for what I have done!
010	Honestly, young people these days...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
011	Ambrosia, that makes you sound really old.
012	I am old! Show your elder more respect!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
013	Wait, are you also—?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0014
014	Hm?
015	I see. So you're from the same hometown as Adaleigh.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0045
016	The Acedia Belt Region, was it?
017	You lot must seriously enjoy falling from the sky.
018	Once again, I apologize.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
019	We were trying to test, through trial and error, whether we could cross the Belt wall based off the findings Adaleigh left behind.
020	And, during the test, there was an accident...	VO_minario.minario_sys_0016
021	Well, if it was an accident that occurred during testing, I suppose it couldn't be helped. I often have accidents myself.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
022	I'll let the garden thing go.
023	So, where exactly were you trying to get to?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
024	Well...
025	The Gula Belt, I assume?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
026	Yes, that's right.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
027	I wanted to tell Nimul and the others about the abnormality that occurred in the Acedia Belt Region.
028	The rift running through the sky?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
029	Yes. That happened here as well?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0030
030	A little while ago, our Belt's sky...cracked.
031	It crumbled as if the dome ceiling was peeled away, and what laid beyond was exposed.
032	Do you know something about it?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0002
033	Hmm...
034	The balance of the Belts is crumbling.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
035	Th-that voice!
036	It's been a while, Minario. Ah, and Ambrosia is here as well.
037	Hey, why are you...? What about the Corruption?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
038	Apologies, but there's not enough time to get into the deeper details.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0035
039	Lend me a hand. Your powers are needed to save Nimul and the others.
040	Both technique to cross the barrier of corruption that those from the Acedia Belt Region can use and...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
041	Abstinent Witch, the magic you have to freely control time.
042	Heh... You've gotten more determined since the last time I saw you.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
043	All right. What are you planning on using my Space-Time Manipulation for?
044	To save Nimul and the others, of course.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
045	Thank you very much.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
046	This place is just like the Avaritia Belt from ten years ago.
047	Quence's technique led me here? For what purpose?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
048	I don't have enough information to know for sure.
049	What I need to do right now is...
050	I have find that girl I got separated from.
051	Also, if I am to believe that girl's words, Emmel and the others are in this Belt, too.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
052	Nothing gets solved by my just standing around. I must take action, learn more, and unravel the mystery.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
053	That is all that I can do.
054	Hm?
055	Eeek!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0026
056	I'm sorry, sir!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0035
057	It's all right. I wasn't...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
058	Is everything all right?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
059	It's nothing. Are you all right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
060	Oh! I, um...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
061	This is embarrassing...but as you can see, I'm a Fallen.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0011
062	Huh...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
063	Did you perhaps come from somewhere outside this Belt?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
064	That's correct. Why do you ask?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
065	I knew it! This is quite a rare occurrence. You're a castaway, are you not? Or are you in the Infinite Serpent, like the shrine maiden?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0009
066	The Infinite Serpent...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
067	(Their reach extended here, even this early? Never mind that. More importantly...)
068	My apologies for staring so rudely. It's rare for a Fallen to have intelligence.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
069	So they say, but the Fallen of our Belt can speak just as I do.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
070	Those that fall to the Corruption, those with weak wills, and those too weak to become soldiers...
071	In this Belt, being a Fallen is the mark of a weak person.
072	The Fallen are weak?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
