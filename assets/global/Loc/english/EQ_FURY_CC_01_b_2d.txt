001	One, two, three, four, five.
002	In the old tongue, the words for justice and peace...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0005
003	...were one and the same.
004	Ooh, ooh! Does that mean that peace and justice are the same thing?
005	Yes, that would be correct.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
006	Then why do kings love war so much?
007	Well...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0039
008	Have you been in wars too, Miss Button?
009	I...
010	A study trip?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
011	You're finally getting your chance! Isn't this wonderful, Lady Button?
012	It's thanks to your efforts that the ceaseless conflict in Wadatsumi has calmed, Button.
013	No, I...
014	As shrine maiden to the royal family of Wadatsumi, you will need to broaden your knowledge of this world.
015	I traveled around the islands myself when I was your age, Button.
016	But Mother, Father... Are you sure?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
017	You've been begging me to read you stories of other lands every night since you were a little girl!
018	Granny...
019	We know how much you long to travel across the sea.
020	Isn't that why the Samurai you summon takes the form of a powerful warrior from a distant land?
021	Well... Yes, but...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
022	Your only chance is a single trade vessel bound for the continent of Babel that stops at Greed Dike's port every two months.
023	Blue skies followed me everywhere I went, and I was always there to watch the starry skies fade into daylight.
024	The day when I would begin my journey chasing after those stars was close at hand.
025	Oho! Look who it is. The Shrine Maiden of Justice herself!
026	Hehe. Isn't it a little early to be drinking?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
027	Thankfully, we've got nothin' better to do!
028	Thanks to her, you mean! You're our savior, Lady Button! You're the one who's given us this peace and freed us up to drink!
029	Lady Button, I heard you finally got permission to leave this island! Bet you're looking forward to that!
030	That's great news! You've been talkin' about goin' abroad when we achieved peace for as long as I've known you!
031	Oh, um, actually...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
032	When you come back, you've gotta tell us all about your adventures!
033	I would, but I...
034	I refused the offer.
035	I like it here in Wadatsumi.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
036	Really?
037	Of course I understand where my parents are coming from, but...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0005
038	You're a good kid.
039	The shrine maidens who serve the royal family must use their magic to bring peace to the people. We must save them through the teachings of Wadatsumi.
040	I know that studying abroad is an option that might help bring me closer to those ideals, I just...
041	So why not go?
042	Well, I have my students...and I know that my mother, father, and granny would be lonely without me.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
043	Not to mention the fact that someone has to keep an eye on certain drunken soldiers.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0030
044	Besides, I like being here in this old shop, surrounded by the traditional wares of Wadatsumi.
045	You say that, but...
046	Every single item you've picked up in here today has been a trinket from a foreign land.
047	I... Oh.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0029
048	There are so many more things like this waiting for you to discover them across the sea.
049	I...
050	Remind me⁠—what's your life's dream?
051	Why are you asking me that?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0013
052	You've told me countless times before.
053	Oh, very well...
054	...World peace.
055	(I long for world peace.)
056	(I believe that everyone in this world hopes and prays for peace and happiness.)
057	(Meeting those people, talking with them, connecting with them... Learning about the land, making new friends...)
058	(If only I could make everyone a part of my family... If only we could live out all of our lives together in harmony... That is all I wish for, and yet...)
059	(The blurred expanse that lies beyond the infinite horizon calls to me.)
060	(Is what I believe to be just truly correct?)
061	(I keep searching for what is right in this endless world, on and on and...)
062	Found you!
063	Wh-what?
064	I've been looking for you!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0002
065	O-oh! It's you!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0003
066	Hello, Shrine Maiden of Justice. I'm here to escort you on your scholarly travels!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
067	Ikasa...
068	Are you all ready to go, Button?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
069	Go? Go where?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
070	First, to the horizon that stretches out as far as the eye can see. Second, to the lands you've been dreaming of all your life. Third, back to your peaceful homeland fading into the distance behind you.
071	Wait a minute, I⁠—!
072	Good luck, Miss Button! Study hard!
073	Don't worry about Wadatsumi. We'll take care of her!
074	Get a move on! The world isn't going to bring peace to itself!
075	You're all...
076	Take care, Button.
077	Oh, Mother, please don't cry! This isn't goodbye!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0029
078	You're right. I know. We'll see each other again.
079	Oh, Lady Button! I'm as happy for you as if it were my own dream that's come true. Brings tears to my eyes, it does.
080	Granny! Don't you start crying too!
081	Go on, Button.
082	Father...
083	Fourth, to the side of your faithful friend and fellow dreamer.
084	Fifth, to the sky above you. What do you see?
085	It's...beautiful! Blue skies, as far as the eye can see!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
086	All is well.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
087	So I ask you again, Button. Are you all ready to go?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
088	And the correct answer is...?
089	I never could have imagined that inky sky full of stars coming down to crush me.
