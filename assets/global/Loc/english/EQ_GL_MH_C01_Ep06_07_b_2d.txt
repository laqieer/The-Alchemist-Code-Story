001	And stay down!
002	That's amazing Soren! It took us considerable effort to take even a single Construct down, but they're dropping like flies before you.
003	Perhaps you've found a weakness in them?
004	I've figured out a thing or two from our battle against Asuka and Atropos.
005	A machine as complex as Atropos would require some sort of a power converter, which converts Alchemia into energy for it to function.
006	I figured the Constructs functioned in a similar manner, albeit with smaller power converters.
007	Once I figured out where the converters are, it wasn't difficult to overload them with a small burst of Alchemia.
008	And based on what I've gathered, I hypothesized that the Constructs would be far more vulnerable to Alchemia overload!
009	Like how I disabled Atropos previously! But without blowing anything up this time...
010	Wow...! That's... That's great Soren!
011	These Constructs won't be such a big threat now that we have an effective counter to them.
012	(This boy is a walking Avatar of Alchemy! Such precise control of Alchemy is almost unheard of!)
013	(And that is precisely why he must find his path correctly.)
014	(He is destined for great things, for better or worse...)
