001	Reporting! A small party of troops that appears to be some kind of rear guard has begun making its way toward us.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0004
002	Finally. How insolent of them to have made me wait like this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
003	Shouldn't we...do something? We stand a better chance of defeating them if we attack them now, before they are prepared.	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0031
004	Heheh. Well, I have a rather special plan for them, and it would be such a waste if we didn't make use of it.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
005	All troops, to me! Prepare to wipe the scum from this land!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
006	They've caught sight of us. I'm sure they are pleased to see how few of us there are. Bloodthirsty lot...	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0031
007	There is no reason for us to play their game. Everyone, split up and make use of your surroundings! We'll draw them onto our own turf and even the odds!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0010
008	It's working!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
009	Yes! The enemy really does have the advantage of numbers, though. The right flank—eek!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
010	They're certainly determined. We're already on the defensive, but Ceclidis himself is out here on the front lines...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
011	It's just as General Leordas said. He likes to get his own hands dirty.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
012	Ceclidis!
013	My, my. General Leordas. How can I help you? Were you thinking of finally surrendering? Tsk tsk, unfortunately I can't do that for you.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
014	Spare me your prattle, Ceclidis! Or are you not prepared to meet for a challenge on the battlefield from a fellow general?	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0004
015	Oh? What exactly do you mean?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
016	As a noble of Gluttony Foss, you must accept another noble's challenge—unless you would prefer to be released from your obligations?	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
017	Hmph. Very well.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0038
018	He accepted the challenge!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
019	I hear that it is considered quite a dishonor for a military man to reject a direct challenge on the battlefield.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
020	If Ceclidis is hoping to be King...
021	Yes. If he shows himself to be dishonorable here, then word would spread and his reputation would be tarnished.
022	It would be best if we could defeat him here and change the course of this war, but...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
023	As long as he holds that stone in his hand...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
024	This power! Have you already abandoned your humanity, Ceclidis?!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0019
025	Abandoned? No! I have surpassed the limits of humanity! Meanwhile, you who have bowed down to the weak and failed to take advantage of the path you chose... Your life ends here!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0008
026	As if I would go down that easily!	VO_leordas.leordas_battle_0004
027	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0032
028	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0032
029	Leordas, you dare violate the code of the nobility?!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0025
030	Unfortunately, I have spent too much time on the battlefield with more unsavory characters. I've grown rather fond of their mercenary tactics!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0008
