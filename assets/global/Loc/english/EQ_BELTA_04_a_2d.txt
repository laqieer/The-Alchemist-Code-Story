001	Your shells keep exploding and creating clouds of dust. I can’t aim...!
002	Fire! ...Sharon, I’m going to help you. Don’t do anything reckless again!	VO_berta.berta_battle_1014
003	...Aarrgghh!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0004
004	Ngh, I can’t believe you found us... But this isn’t over yet!
005	...! Ack. This sword is so heavy... Aaagghhh!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0019
006	...Huff... Huff...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
007	Sharon, are you okay?!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0019
008	...I’m fine.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
009	Liar. You’re shaking. You defeated the Wratharis soldiers, but you’ve missed all their vitals. I really think that Greatsword is...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0021
010	...Well, your shells were in the way. You kept missing the enemies and just drove them back with your explosions. It wasn’t the least bit helpful.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
011	Well... Yes, but...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0029
012	That’s beside the point. I was able to anticipate the Wratharis soldiers and take care of them. ...Shouldn’t you be happy?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
013	What you did isn’t worthy of praise... One misstep and you could be dead right now...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
014	I told you before, didn’t I? A weakness on the battlefield could mean losing your life in an instant.
015	...It turned out okay this time, but you could lose your life on a different battlefield because of that weapon!
016	...I’ll master this Greatsword no matter what. I’ve already told you that!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
017	With this...I’ve earned an achievement. With this...I’m one step closer to joining the Scarlet Flame Guard!
018	So it’s true. You want to be just like...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0030
019	Is there something wrong with that? She was also part of the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan. I look up to her.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0012
020	One day, I will surpass Nina... That’s why I’ve come this far.
021	Ever since Nina...the only therian who has won any war merits is the vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, D’Artagnan...
022	Since then...a therian hasn’t stood center stage again in Envylian history.
023	That’s why I have to do it. I have the power to do it... That’s what everyone else is wishing for, too. That’s why!
024	Sharon...
025	What is it? Why are you making such a sad face?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0012
026	I think I understand now. You’re not looking up to her, that’s just how you justify it.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
027	Everyone’s expectations... All that pressure... It’s causing you pain.
028	What?! What would you know about it?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
029	...I would like to know.
030	Bah! You don’t even have the resolve to hurt others!
031	But there are still ways for me to help.
032	...What is this?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0012
033	You’re attached to that Greatsword, aren’t you? ...But I think you should switch to this smaller sword until you’re more used to it.
034	It’s been bothering me since that first bout...so I looked in the barracks for something that’d suit your size better.
035	...You want me to use this?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
036	If you don’t want to die on the battlefield. If you don’t want someone to get hurt because of you.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
037	...It’s true that I don’t want to hurt anyone.
059	There might not be many things that someone like me can teach you.
038	But I’ve experienced many more battles than you. I...I don’t want you to get hurt.
039	...But why?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
040	Because I’m your instructor. I want to do whatever I can.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
041	...! B-but...that’s because it’s your duty. Because you don’t want to fail...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
042	That’s not why. Even if there aren’t many things I can teach you as your instructor...
043	As your friend...I believe I can protect you.
044	...!
045	Is that not good enough of a reason? I don’t want the signal gun I fire for you to be a mournful sound.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
046	I want to fire the sound of “I’m home” for you.
047	...
048	You should do things your own way. So I think you should aim to master that Greatsword one day.
049	But until then...I want you to use that I sword I gave you in order to protect your life.
050	...
051	...?! Reinforcements?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
052	When he said “This isn’t over yet,” he must’ve meant more soldiers were on their way!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0020
053	What? They were beaten by just two people? That’s pathetic.
054	But this ends now. We won’t let you get in our way.
055	...There’s so many of them! This isn’t good!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0027
056	...!
057	Prepare yourselves!
058	They’re coming!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0019
