001	Nimul?! What are you planning to do to that Cursed Beast's core?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
002	Rrrraaaahhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0021
003	It's...working! Nimul, if you do it now...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0009
004	Right!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
005	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
006	If I apply Alchemy and Spiritbonding...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
007	Yes... At long last.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
008	Now we can finally begin it...
009	The battle to give the world to humans, the Ceremony of Creation.
010	Rrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0028_a
011	Yes! It wor—
012	Nngh!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0022
013	Are you all right, Yna?
014	Asena!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
015	Phew.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
016	This power is strong, but it's also very draining.
017	I'm not sure that I'll be able to use it for long.
018	However, with this power, I'll be able to do it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
019	I'll can change this world full of sorrow and grief into a tomorrow where people can live with laughter.
020	Nimul...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
021	Have you obtained your dream? The power that can grant that dream?
022	You mean ours, don't you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
023	Heh. Yes, you are correct.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
024	I have been thinking about it ever since I saw the Infinite Serpent using that Cursed Beast's power.
025	I thought that if an untainted core could be used like that, perhaps we could use the core as well.
026	Reckless as usual.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
027	You can hardly talk.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
028	The power you have to slay Cursed Beasts is magnificent.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0046
029	Huh? Oh, it's not quite like that...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
030	.........
031	Master?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
032	I have never seen such a power before. With that power, it seems we do not need the flesh and blood of a dragon.
033	Are you extracting more magil from the reaction to the purification of corruption?
034	No, that is not all. That power is something more... How fascinating!
035	Heh. It seems my friend has found an object of even greater interest than dragons.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
036	Then—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
037	What I seek is not the life of a dragon. All I long for is the ultimate gear.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
038	Therefore, there is no longer any reason for us to draw our swords.
039	Whether you are satisfied with that is another story.
040	No, that's fine with us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
041	Then what of my sister?
042	She had no intention of dragging this land into corruption from the outset.
043	Baring our fangs at someone harmless would only bring shame upon the people of Avaritia.
044	What is it, Benika?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
045	Something...is coming.	VO_benika.benika_battle_0019
046	I feel it. Something bad has awoken. That's the sensation that I have.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0042
047	What?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
048	I've come to report, Lord Kubera!
049	What happened?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
050	The Cursed Beast Mammon is attacking! It's advancing on the capital!
051	I see.
052	Then the time of destruction has finally arrived.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0005
