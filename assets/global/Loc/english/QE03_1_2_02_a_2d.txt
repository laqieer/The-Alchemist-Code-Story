001	Bwaaa!!! I can't fight well like this, and I can't run away because there are too many trees!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0026
002	That's why you need to ride on it standing and fight. It's good practice, isn't it?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
003	This is way too Spartan!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
004	There's a knack to doing it.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
005	Just like when you stand on the ground, you need to believe in the Broom Ace.
006	I can't!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
007	Oh? What are you two doing here?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
008	The same as you, Rebecca. We're practicing.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
009	It's not practice if you're mounting it.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0044
010	Ack.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
011	No way... I can't believe you don't know how to ride a Broom Ace.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
012	For starters, why are you using such an old Broom Ace?
013	It doesn't match your body size. Is it a hand-me-down?
014	A-and what if it is?! I was the one that said I wanted to use it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
015	I wanted to use the same Broom Ace that my mother used!
016	I guess if you're gonna be at the mercy of this hand-me-down then I've got nothing to worry about.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0010
017	Ack...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0019
018	Oh no! Here comes another herd of monsters. Let's chase them off first!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0021
