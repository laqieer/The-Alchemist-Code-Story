001	You might be a heartless bunch of cowards...but you're pretty capable fighters, I'll give you that.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
002	And you're fast as lightning—but that ain't gonna cut it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
003	Uh-oh!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0020
004	See, this is our turf; we've got the advantage here. Might wanna pick your fights more carefully next time, girlie!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
005	I-I...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
006	Here I come, Ishuna! Put those quick reflexes to good use and dodge this!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0002
007	O-okay!
008	Aaaaaarghh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
009	A job well done, if I do say so myself. And thanks to your most effective distraction, not a single one of these miscreants escaped us!	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
010	Your flighty footwork made you too tempting of a target for any of them to ignore. Excellent work!
011	I-it's not like I was trying to be a diversion!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
012	If that was your plan from the start, I wish you'd let me in on it, but...I guess you did base it around my strengths.
013	I appreciate that. Thanks, Icona.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0033
014	Don't mention it. I just did what made logical sense and was most appropriate for the situation.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
015	I... Huh?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
016	After all, my machines wouldn't have been much help in this confined space.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
017	If I had been alone, I would have been in for a tough fight, but I knew I could count on your speed.
018	You could say that this fight depended on our teamwork, and we each pulled off our allotted roles to perfection.
019	Machines have much more specific capabilities than humans, so in order to make the most appropriate choice when thinking about what work to assign them, you really have to take efficiency into consideration.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
020	Are those kinds of choices really so important?
021	Do you have to ask? I would've thought you'd know the answer to that, having been part of a bandit group yourself. Such choices are especially important when you operate as a group, after all.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
022	I...
023	I don't care what you have to do. No matter how uncouth or beastly you have to be... I want you to live.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0041
024	You can hate me if you want. You can hate your chief if you want. Just promise me you won't rush through your life.
025	If the Unicorn Knights is where you belong, then you have to get back to them.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
026	Yeah... You're right.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0027
027	So then...I guess all that time I spent fighting so that we could stay together actually made sense.
028	The Unicorn Knights might have started with Captain Helza, but it came to mean so much to so many kids.
029	Those kids needed you, and you didn't let them down. You did everything that was expected of you when they were left in your care.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0005
030	And everything you achieved for them was the result of your sound decisions, wouldn't you say?
031	Yeah... I can see that now. Thank you, Icona. Really.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
032	You know, I'll never understand that impulse people seem to have to express gratitude over every little thing. There's really no need to thank me for my habit of analysis.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
033	However, I suppose the polite thing to do would be to say "you're welcome" and be done with it, so... You're welcome.
034	Ahem. Right. As for you lot... You're going to pay for trying to rob people of their Winter Holiday joy!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
035	Yeah, whatever. Can we skip the lecture? I'm really not in the mood. We were just trying to get back some of what was taken from us by those fat cats...not that you'll believe me.
036	Huh? What are you talking about?	VO_icona.icona_sys_0006
037	This was never about the baubles—not really. We were just trying to get back at that noble who's been hogging them!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
038	He's kidnapped the craftspeople who make them and is working them to the bone, all so he can sell off the baubles to his rich friends at a premium!
039	What?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0020
040	This year, only a select group of wealthy patrons will be getting those baubles, and that's plain unfair!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
041	That's why we decided to take matters into our own hands. Get back the baubles, rescue the craftspeople, and set things right!
042	Oh!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
043	Those are the ones, I'm afraid. I was only able to order in a very small amount to begin with.
044	Icona, do you think...?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
045	Yes. I daresay that merchant's reduced stock can be attributed to this noble's plot as well. Things are starting to add up.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0004
046	Well, I won't let him get away with it! He's ruining the Winter Holiday for so many people! I can't imagine anything more selfish!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0043
047	Add to that the kidnapping and imprisonment... How low can you get?!
048	Whoever's buying from him should be ashamed of themselves, too! Emptying their pockets for him instead of paying a fair price at the market... What's wrong with them?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
049	Actually, that's a fairly common economic practice, particularly among the wealthy. It's a bit of a gray area.
050	On the other hand, the kidnapping is very much socially unacceptable.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
051	Listen, we tried to break in already, but security around his mansion has been tightened tenfold! That's why we thought we'd take the peddler's clothes and sneak our way in...before you went and stopped us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
052	Ohh! So that's what you were trying to do.
053	Yeah, that's right. It's our whole deal, if you must know. We never target honest folk. Only the rich and greedy who make their money dirty ever find our hands in their pockets.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
054	If you ask me, there's no point in celebrating the Winter Holiday if it's just the nobles who get to make merry.
055	It's meant to be a day for children, ain't it? Used to be that only kids who were good all year 'round got any presents.
056	I guess I misjudged you. You really were looking out for the common folk, huh?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0045
057	W-well, I mean... I guess you could put it like that, but—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0047
058	Anyway, down to business. I'm going to break into that mansion. That's my area of expertise, after all.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0007
059	Are you sure that's a good idea? While their story does seem to make sense, acting on it would mean placing quite a lot of trust in these...bandits.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0001
060	What if this is all some elaborate ruse?
061	I guess it's possible they could be lying, but at this point we have no other leads. I'd rather go out on a limb and trust them than just give up!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
062	If there's even the slightest chance that this could keep the kids in town from being let down, then it's worth the risk. If I end up getting played for a fool, then so be it.
063	Hmm... I can't say I fully support this decision.	VO_icona.icona_chara_1003
064	I figured. But...this is who I am. This is what drives me. I've always been this way.
065	Children's smiles mean that much to you, do they?
066	Yes.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
067	Very well. I can't deny I'm intrigued. If you truly believe you can resolve this, then I won't try to talk you out of it.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0007
068	Now that I think about it...you've come to my rescue several times now, even when you've disagreed with my opinion.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
069	Would you be willing to help me out again? With you watching my back, I'm even more confident that I can pull this off! Please? This isn't just for me—it's for everyone in town!
070	Hmm...
071	I-I know it's a lot to ask, but...pretty please?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
072	I suppose this, too, is a valid choice in its own way. And here I was hoping to head back to my workshop before nightfall... Ah, well.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0045
073	So then...?
074	I still don't understand why you're willing to go to such lengths for other people, even when they haven't directly asked for your help.	VO_icona.icona_sys_0031
075	However, it's entirely logical for you to request my aid in this...so I won't say no. I'll do it.
076	Besides, on a personal level, I'm curious to see what sort of materials and tools these craftspeople employ.
077	Yes! Okay, if you're on board, then let's get going. There's no time to waste!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0023
