001	I suppose I'll have to start writing my next resignation letter.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
002	It's not over yet!
003	Do yourselves a favor, and give up already.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0004
004	Othima, she's all yours!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
005	Here we go!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0001
006	Hm... I'm afraid freezing me in place isn't going to do you any good.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0019
007	Now!
008	Way ahead of you, buddy! Come on out, my friends! It's playtime!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0037
009	Aaaaaaaah! Wh-what in the world—?!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0026
010	You couldn't lay a hand on my innocent pals here, could you?
011	Tch! No... I suppose I can't, at that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
012	W-wait a minute! Stop that! That's mine—give it back! Not my Antie!
013	Sorry, but you can't beat the power of friendship!
014	You're not playing fair!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
015	Ready, everyone? Attack!
016	Z-Zain! Unhand me at once!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
017	Othima, it's now or never!
018	You know, I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for using cowardly tactics like this. Maybe I should even out the odds a bit?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0010
019	Aaaahh!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0025
020	Gwaaarghh!
021	That's your solution? Hit us both?
022	All's well that ends well, I say.
023	Heh...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
024	That was a pretty good punch, Othima.
025	It's called magic, my dude.
026	Well, your magic packed a punch.
027	Heh. Thanks.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
028	It's not like you to fight so dirty, Zain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
029	Call it what you want, but I'd say my strategy was pretty effective.
030	Othima, you have my gratitude.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0033
031	No need to be so stiff.
032	I'm sorry?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
033	You're one of my friends too, y'know? Relax.
034	I suppose you are tackling some things head-on.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
035	My father always had high expectations for me.
036	Aren't I always?
037	I strove to live up to those expectations every single day, in order to please my mother.
038	It's who you are.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
039	It was all I could provide them. It was the very least I could do.
040	Ngh!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
041	Shh!
042	Northern Pride: Archives (Reminiscence of a Memory)
043	Ouch! Those book corners are more lethal than a dagger!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
044	What are you even complaining about? Oh, woe is me, the boy from a noble family? Are you trying to get a rise out of me?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0012
045	Of course not. I—
046	You're descended from a prestigious lineage. I'm sure both your parents are alive and well, and continue to want the best for you; pouring their wealth into your education and training, all so that you can become a fine knight.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
047	You don't have to worry about a thing—it's all laid out for you, isn't it? That's why you can afford to dream about world peace. Still planning on bathing this entire world in your light?
048	For someone who's supposed to be a model student, you're awfully dim. Fools like you don't deserve to live alongside the hardworking people of this world.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0010
049	I don't have anything to research today.
050	Huh?
051	I'm only here because I wanted to express my gratitude. Here... This is for you.
052	A... bookmark?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0025
053	Surely your hatred of me doesn't trump your love of books?
054	These pressed flowers... They're asters, aren't they?
055	Will you accept it?
056	Do you know what asters mean in flower language?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0001
057	There's a meaning? I just thought they were pretty...	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
058	Ugh... How lazy.
059	People usually tell me I'm a pretty hard-working guy.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
060	You're impossible!
061	You don't like it?
062	Why are you giving me this?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0003
063	I'd hoped it might light up your life a little.
064	Well, tone it down a little. You shine too bright for me.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0020
065	But that's my goal—the brighter, the better.
066	If you don't cut it out, I'm going to bludgeon you to death with this book.
067	I don't doubt it.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
068	Isn't it unfair for you to direct all this kindness my way? What about everyone else in the world? Don't they deserve some of this unwelcome attention, too?
069	What do you mean?
070	All my life, it's other people who have been given everything, while I've been left with nothing but scraps.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
071	Try to cover it up all you want, but this world isn't at peace. Though I suppose that hasn't affected your social status, Sir Knight.
072	I... see your point.
073	You really want to light up the world? Then quit wasting your time with me, and—	VO_shion.shion_sys_0010
074	I refuse.
075	Just leave me be!
076	I'm afraid I can't do that.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
077	And why not?
078	You know, I've sent a lot of letters to my mother. More than I can count.
079	I— Wait, what?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0025
080	Never mind. Perhaps I shouldn't tell you.
081	Oh, no you don't! Out with it! Don't leave me hanging!
082	Well...
083	Incredibly bright, my mother. A preeminent civil servant. She, too, always longed to see the world at peace.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0010
084	Throughout my life, she's always been loving and bright.
085	Even when I got fed up with my father's sense of justice, and fell into dark bouts of melancholy...
086	She would throw her work aside in order to wrap me in a tight embrace.
087	It was during that same, difficult year that she read me a certain book. It was a best-seller; a collection of historic tales about the Knight King. I wasn't particularly thrilled to listen to it at the time...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
088	Though I couldn't help but laugh at how serious she looked as she read it to me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0008
089	I... I see.
090	It was that memory, among others, that prompted me to send her so many letters.
091	I wanted to know why she did it. Why she killed my father.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0018
092	Wh-what?!
093	My father had dedicated his life to rising through the ranks of knighthood. Then, one day, my mother stabbed him, and it all came to an end.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
094	I was the one who found him. On his bed, in a pool of his own blood, a knife sticking out of his chest...
095	The room was completely dark when I entered. The oil lamp I carried was my only source of light. It lit upon him like a spotlight, leaving the rest of the room in shadow.
096	I gazed around the room, swinging my lamp around. It was perfectly tidy. Unbelievably ordinary. Despite the lack of light, my mother was leafing through a history book beside the bed.
097	My light did not fully reach her, and I was glad of it. I was frightened of what I might see if I illuminated her face.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0018
098	I don't blame you.
099	It was some time before I could force any sound out of my throat. In the end, I could only manage a single word: Why?
100	And she told me... It wasn't good enough.
101	I never managed to find out more than that. I still don't know the full story.
102	"It wasn't good enough"?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0025
103	I can't help but wonder if things wouldn't have been different if I'd just shone that light on her, or asked more persistently.
104	If I'd only pushed aside my fears and asked to hear her thoughts... Perhaps that act alone would have helped her to heal, in time.
105	I failed her. I wasn't able to do for her what she did for me.
106	I didn't even give her a hug.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
107	...
108	So you see... Selfish though it may be, this is why I persist. I strive to accomplish now what I could not do back then.
109	Right...
110	My apologies. I got a little carried away.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0018
111	It was a long story.
112	This is the first time I've ever told anyone about... all of that. I don't know why I—	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
113	You did well, getting it off your chest.
114	I... have to become a worthy knight.
115	...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
116	They never leave you, do they?
117	Wh-what do you mean?
118	Those words you wish you'd said.
119	The regret... It stays with you, doesn't it?
120	Yes...	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
121	Yet you cover it up with pretty words.
122	Sometimes that's necessary.
123	Why do you bother telling me these things?
124	If you get sick of listening, just throw a book at me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0031
125	I do enjoy stories, you know.
126	In that case...
127	Next time, I'll tell you a story that'll make you smile.
128	You...!
129	Are you sure it's okay for you to spend so much time with me?	VO_shion.shion_sys_0030
130	I want to get to know all of the people in this world. I'm choosing to start with you.
131	...
132	I want to hear your thoughts. Will you share them with me?
133	I promise I'll create a bright world for you to smile in.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
134	Remember: the promise we made is still unfulfilled.
135	I'll light up every corner of this world, if that's what it takes.
136	Pfft...
137	You brightened my life. All I wanted was to shine some light on yours as well.
138	As if you could make me smile.	VO_shion.shion_sys_0008
