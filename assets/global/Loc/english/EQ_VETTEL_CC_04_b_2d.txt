001	Whoa, what?! This thing's fast!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
002	Huzzah!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0004
003	Phew, made it on time! Are you okay, Victor?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
004	Booyah! You saved my hide, Nina!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
005	Captain Vettel! Leave the rest to us!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
006	Time to rain on this demon's parade a hundred times harder than it tried to do to Captain Vettel!
007	Captain Vettel, it's all yours!
008	Hyaaaaah!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0007
009	We did it! Nice work, everyone! That was awesome!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0032
010	Heh... Not bad. Watching and learning from a role model must be more effective than I thought...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0044
011	Whoo! Captain Vettel, you're the man! All that's left is a couple bandits.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0008
012	It's...over? That's...a...relief...
013	Vettel! Are you okay?! I'll heal your wounds straight away! H-hey... Vettel?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
014	I can finally leave it all to you...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
015	The way you are now... You're...ready...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
016	Vettel?! Oh, you gotta be kidding me! Vettel! Come on, open your eyes!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
017	I can't lose you, too! Come on! S-stay with me! Vettel!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
018	Where...am I...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
019	Hello? Natalie? Chloe?
020	...No one's here.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
021	Hmm... Let me think. Bandits attacked the village, then I fought that demonic soldier, and—
022	...Oh. I see now... Sooner than I expected, but...I guess these things happen.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
023	At least I know I can finally leave the future in capable hands.
024	...This is fine. I'll be able to pass on without reg—
025	Please. Fine? Pathetic.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
026	?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
027	Gerald!
028	It's too early for you to join me!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0014
029	Wh-what?!
030	You can't join me before your time. I won't allow it.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
031	Gerald...
032	You haven't changed... Come on, be reasonable. My time is up. We've laid the path for the Scarlet Flame Guard, now we just have to trust that the others will follow it.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
033	The others have grown strong enough to defeat even demonic soldiers. I've done all I could.
034	Say that again to my face, Vettel. You disgust me. You're the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
035	Are you really ready to die here? What happened to the man who would do a thousand sword swings when we were still just the Scarlet Legion?!
036	C-come on... We haven't met in forever and this is how you greet me?
037	I didn't want to meet you yet. Your duty isn't here.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
038	There's still things you have to do. Things only you can do. I won't let you say you're done yet.
039	Things only I can do?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
040	Ah!
041	Draw your sword, Vettel. I'll knock that cowardly attitude out of you if I must.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
042	Whoa! Incredible! The afterlife hasn't made you lose your touch at all!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
043	It's your swordsmanship that's lacking. Isn't this supposed to be your specialty?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
044	You're squeezing it so hard I can see the tip of the blade shaking. You look like a fool.
045	I'll happily be a fool if that's what it takes to protect the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
046	As long as I get through this, Envylia and the Scarlet Flame Guard will be able to move forwards!
047	I know I can leave it in their hands, that's why...
048	Are you really satisfied with leaving them now?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0001
049	What do you mean?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
050	You vowed to protect the happiness of the people. Did you fulfill that vow?
051	Didn't you vow to preserve the peace without the use of alchemy?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
052	I...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
053	There are still things you must do! You can't selfishly decide you're done already!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
054	You want to protect the Scarlet Flame Guard? Then you've got to protect yourself first!
055	Or are you going to snap that iron will of yours with your own hands?
056	I-I...!
057	...We swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!
058	...Haha! Hahahaha! You got me good.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
059	...Good. I want you to be able to laugh like that.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
060	You must be the sun for those back in the land of the living. The gentle light that reminds them that it's all right to smile.
061	The sun...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
062	...—tel!....Vettel...!
063	...Please, Vettel! We need you!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
064	Natalie...
065	You can hear her, right? They need you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
066	I suppose they do... It was good to see you again, Gerald. It really was. There's just one thing I'd like to say. Before I go.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
067	...You were right. There really are still things I need to do.
068	Come back here anytime you need that reminder. I'll beat it into you as many times as necessary.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
