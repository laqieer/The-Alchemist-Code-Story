001	D-darn it all! You'll pay for this!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0002
002	W-whoa! He ran away so fast! He just kinda rolled off... Snowmen sure are impressive!
003	If that snowman was really the one who's keeping it from snowing, then letting him get away was a big mistake.
004	We've gotta go after them! There's no such thing as a Winter Holiday without snow!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0020
005	Hey there! What're you guys doin'?
006	Oh! Look, it's a tiny little snowman!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0012
007	Ah, you must be one of the Maruda children. We are in a spot of trouble just now, because there is no snow for us to celebrate the Winter Holiday with.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
008	Hence we have come here, to the home of the Maruda Tribe—otherwise known as the snow spirits.
009	That's right! It won't snow! Are you gonna bring the snow back for us?
010	You want it to snow?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
011	Of course we do! Who wants a Winter Holiday without snow, anyway?! Right, mom?
012	Oh, yes. When you think of the Winter Holiday, you think of snow. There's no separating them.
013	I understand what those fellows were saying, but I do think that they are blowing things a little bit out of proportion.
014	Hmmm... Perhaps we should speak with some of the other Maruda people.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
015	We asked around, but it doesn't seem like there are any more of those extreme types left here.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0031
016	How come they have the power to keep it from snowing in the first place?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
017	Well, the Maruda Tribe are all snow spirits. That means we can control snow. Duh!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0001
018	We're even more powerful during the Winter Holiday season, 'cause it's our job to protect it! Those guys are taking it a bit far this time, though.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0002
019	I heard that all of the snowmen who share those same, strong beliefs got together and performed a ritual to stop it from snowing.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
020	They just wanted to right the wrong of the Winter Holiday, but things have really gotten out of hand.
021	How could they use the powers of our tribe to interfere with our beloved holiday like this?	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0020
022	The rest of the tribe also seem to think that they've gone too far.
023	I see. In other words, they are not a united front in this.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0044
024	Dear me! Moderates, extremists, and those who waver in the middle... Who would have thought that there would be such factions even in a place like this?!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0030
025	Who cares about factions?!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
026	Yeah! Interfering with the Winter Holiday is a disgrace to the Maruda Tribe! I won't stand for it! Let's go, Yuki!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0019
027	All right!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0003
028	H-hold on a—! Oops, they're already gone.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
029	Should snowmen really be getting that fired up?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
030	Who knows?
031	Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
032	Ah! Monsters!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0027
033	They look like they're in a bad mood—kinda like they just got woken up.
034	All this ruckus likely disturbed their hibernation.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0022
035	H-help us!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
036	Geez...	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
