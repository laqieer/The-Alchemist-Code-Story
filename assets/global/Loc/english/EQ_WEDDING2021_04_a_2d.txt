001	Chaaarge!	VO_shayna.shayna_battle_0008
002	You're not harmed are you?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0003
003	I'm fine. Thank you for saving me.
004	So these are the bandits. I can't believe they would attack here.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
005	Look, Chihaya! The map they were carrying has some sort of marks all over it.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0001
006	Those marks... Those are the places they've appeared so far.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0031
007	You're right. Is this some sort of attack plan? The spots are all over, but none are near the fair.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0045
008	Oh? What's this cave?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0031
009	Hm... It seems central to all the scattered marks.
010	If we go there, I'm sure we'll learn something useful.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0004
011	But what could be the intent behind attacking all these various places?
012	You think they could be trying to confuse and thin out security? But to what end?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0022
013	They're likely after the special wedding knives.
014	!
015	You think that's what they're after?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0012
016	Yes. The Felici ore wedding knives have been targeted before.
017	Felici ore is rare enough on its own, and the knives I make from it often fetch a high price.
018	Those at the fair are of the highest quality, so it makes sense that's what they'd be after.
019	I can't believe something made to bring happiness to others is the cause of all this chaos.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0022
020	Well, we shouldn't waste time here. I'll go warn the people at the fair to tighten up security.
021	I was intending to make my way there now to watch the cake cutting performance.
022	That'd be very helpful, but...are you sure it's safe to go on your own?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
023	I'll be fine. I'm not carrying any Felici ore with me, so they won't attack me.
024	The bandits hideout is likely in that cave. Please, be careful.
025	Hm... Could that be--?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0006
026	Hey! Chihaya look at this framed picture. Isn't it adorable?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0009
027	It looks like a wedding drawn by a child. Everybody has marvelous smiles!
028	Um, Shayna... This isn't our studio to just be looking at--	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0030
029	Oh...
030	It must be a child's drawing of a wedding they attended. It seems like it really left an impression.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0023
031	Hey! There are a number of letters pinned to this corkboard over here.
032	Someone wrote how the wedding knife made their ceremony any even more wonderful memory.
033	I wonder... Could this picture and these letters all be from people who were at a wedding where one of the knives was used?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0045
034	Seems that way. It's pretty impressive! Imagine all these people feeling compelled to express their gratitude in letters.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
035	All these heartfelt letters of thanks really warm the spirit when you read them.
036	Everyone seems so grateful to have had such exceptional marriage ceremonies.
037	Seems so...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
038	I can understand why the studio owner works so hard to craft those special knives.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0045
039	Huh?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0006
040	I've received a number of fan letters myself, and they never fail to make me happy.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
041	It's because the feelings of those who see and support me are coming directly to me.
042	Receiving letters such as these, you'd naturally be driven to work hard.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0008
043	...
044	Let's go, Chihaya! We must be quick in finding the bandits' hideout!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0001
045	Yes, you're right.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0004
046	Those letters were really lovely though, weren't they? They were so filled with joy!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
047	Yes, the people that wrote them conveyed a deep gratitude and happiness.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
048	In them, I finally understood why everyone is so passionate about the bridal fair.
049	A wedding is a celebration of life as two people who deeply love each other come together.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0047
050	(It's a happy embarkation different from the occasion where I saw the heart of the bride ignored.)
051	That's why everyone wants to congratulate the couple. And why the fair staff and artisans are so dedicated.
052	That crafter was pretty impressive. Already making the finest items, but uncompromising in trying to improve for others.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
053	Well, I won't be outdone! I'll just have to work harder to please my fans!
054	I'll need to be stronger and prettier... I'll have to fight in an even more appealing way! But to do that... Hmm...
055	U-Um... Shayna?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0002
056	I just had a great idea!
057	I need you to do something for me! When our duty is fulfilled, teach me to dance!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0001
058	Y-You want me to teach you?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
059	Yes! I've thought about this a while, and your dancing has a hidden loveliness I lack.	VO_shayna.shayna_chara_1001
060	Whenever you perform, it's so graceful, and I'm captivated all over again.
061	Oh... I-I see.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0006
062	If I add your dance skills to my movements, I'll be even more elegant.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0004
063	Then the fans who watch me fight will be even happier! So please, teach me to dance!
064	Rather, teach me the secret of your hidden cuteness!
065	Well, if it's to make people happier, I suppose I could...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0003
066	Heh, you really do think of your fans' feelings.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
067	But I don't know that there is a secret to it. It all comes from daily practice.
068	*Grumble* So what you're saying is that daily training is what matters just like with combat. Is that right?	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0045
069	Aside from that... Well... Whenever I perform I want those who see me to feel happy.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0031
070	When someone sees me dance, I want to put joy into their heart, even if only a little.
071	That makes perfect sense! You do your best for the fans, which is why your dancing is so cute!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0044
072	Fans?
073	(Oh...)
074	I love watching Chihaya dance. She has such a kind face and is so beautiful when she does.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0008
075	You can really tell she wants everyone to be happy, and when I see that it touches me.
076	(Mizuchi...)
077	I did notice how everyone who watched me wore glad and warm expressions.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
078	It was like they were telling me they knew I wanted them to be happy.
079	So your dancing really did bring those people cheer.	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0007
080	I guess so...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0037
081	(I can't say everything I did was proper for Wadatsumi, but still...)
082	There were those who understood the important emotions I poured into my dance.
