001	Hyaaah!
002	Ugh...
003	Miss Blair, your gadgets are amazing!
004	You two, was this Roxanne's plan all along?
005	W-what are you talking about?
006	There is no cat, is there? It was all a ruse!
007	And these Droids! I don't know who is controlling them, but I'm going to get to the bottom of this!
008	Miss Blair, wait!
009	Our cat actually is missing!
010	...
011	Looks like the cat's out of the bag.
012	Halt! You.. good-doer!
013	?!
014	How dare you destroy my Droids! I'll make you pay for throwing a wrench in my master plan!
015	That voice... Is that you Soren?
016	Those Droids could have easily hurt those kids!
017	No way that would've hap- I mean...
018	Who is this Soren you speak of? I do not know!
019	What are you all even doing? Is this part of Roxanne's plan too?
020	Do not distract me! You will now face off against my strongest Droids!
021	*Whirrrrrrrrrrr!*
022	Oh I'm truly mad now Soren.
023	Attack, my minions!
