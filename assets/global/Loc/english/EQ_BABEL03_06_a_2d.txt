001	Hawk! Wait!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
002	Balt... Why?
003	That's what I want to ask you. I don't understand at all.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
004	What are you thinking, Hawk?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
005	You're a man who doesn't waver when it comes to protecting the things he cares about. Even now, I can see that in you.
006	What does it matter? This has nothing to do with you.
007	Then why did you say all that? Carla, she...cares for you. You can't tell me you don't already know that.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
008	It'd be easier if she hated me. I want her to.
009	So that's it? Don't tell me you intend to handle this situation by yourself!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
010	Hey, Balt. Don't you think the stars are beautiful?
011	Stars?! Hawk, have you completely lost it? Why are you talking about those at a time like this?!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
012	I like this land, you know. I was born here. It's my home.
013	But there are few people who feel the same way. Everyone abandons the desert in favor of moving to other countries. I want to change that.
014	I can't just stand around and watch the desert wither away like this. I want to be able to protect the future for the children who grow up here.
015	So I will protect the desert. If I have to play the bad guy to do it, then so be it.
016	Then let me go with you.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
017	I have reinforcements coming already. There is something else I would like you to do.
018	And what would that be?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
019	I want you to take care of Carla for me. She's...special.
020	I will protect her, even in death. I feel as strongly about protecting her as I do about the desert.
021	So...you do care for her.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
022	It's not just about how I feel personally. There is a reason that she must be protected, no matter what.
023	A reason?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0005
024	She's a descendant of the Sephira.
025	What?! A-are you sure?! If that's true...well, it would explain that power of hers.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0021
026	When Carla used that power, I felt a strange sensation envelop me. That must have been the Sephiran power of purification!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
027	That's right. It was Spiritbonding, a special technique used only by the Sephira.
028	S-Spiritbonding!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
029	A part of you already knew, huh? She must be protected for the future of this desert.
030	If she can learn to control her power, she might be able to purify the land here. Even now, although it may be faint...
031	Her powers of purification and regeneration are already having an effect. See for yourself. The quality of the soil where the seeds are has changed thanks to her power.
032	But if that power of hers grows...!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
033	Then people will begin to covet her Alchemia. People like the ones who are coming for us now.
034	Not only that, but Carla is one of those Sephira who is marked with a sephirah—something that has all but been lost to us today.
035	She has a mark that proves her pure lineage and she will be targeted for her reserves of Alchemia as a result.
036	So that's what this was all about!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
037	That's why they mustn't learn of her existence; for her sake, and for the sake of the desert.
038	There are those among the nobility who would use her for their political means. Someone must protect her.
039	She is the hope of the desert, you know, and that smile of hers... It's really something special.
040	She has a strange charm to her. Have you noticed your aching heart being soothed by her presence?
041	Yes. At some point, I got caught up in her energy, and just naturally started becoming more hopeful again.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
042	It's not just power. Her very heart is capable of purifying things.
043	Is there anyone more suited to restoring the desert?
044	That's why you must protect her in my stead. I pray that you will. I want you to promise me.
045	You should do it yourself. Stop talking like you're going to your death!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
046	Do you swear it?
047	Fine... I swear it!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
048	Thank you, Balt. You mustn't follow me, all right? Keep your promise to protect her.
049	I have faith; faith that the people of the desert are trying to protect it in their own way—faith that you will be able to overcome this crisis!
050	Even if I should fall, I am certain that the seeds of restoration have already taken root in everyone's hearts.
051	Death isn't pointless. This is how I will protect the desert.
052	...!
053	I'm glad I was able to entrust you with this task. Goodbye, Balt... Take care of Carla. I'm counting on you.
054	Hawk!
055	I can't waste time like this... I need to do something!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
056	I'd appreciate it if you stopped right there.
057	What's this? Isn't this the bastard who was eavesdropping on us earlier? I guess there must be a village around here somewhere.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
058	There is nothing for you here. I cannot allow you to proceed, and so...I have come to stop you.
059	By yourself? You're really underestimating us.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0044
060	I am not underestimating you. When I left earlier, it was only so that I could let everyone know about the danger—and arrange for reinforcements.
061	Even if nobody comes...that only means that everyone has time to escape. So standing against you here will not be for naught. I will buy them time!
062	The seeds have been planted. Even if it takes time for them to sprout...
063	Those seeds will grow. Even if I should fall, my life will not end here!
064	My final wish has been taken care of, so I can stand here without regret!
065	Hmph! I don't have time to listen to this nonsense. Get out of my way, worm!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0001
066	Nngh... Arrrgggghhh!
067	It doesn't look like you'll be able to hold us up for very long. Neun, allow me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
068	I told you. I won't...let...you...go!
069	You're so weak, it's pathetic! You really want more? Are you an idiot?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
070	That's right. I am an idiot...and I'm weak. That doesn't mean I can't stop you!
071	Arrrgghhhh!
072	You're incomprehensible. How...unsightly. It's time for you to die!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0030
073	I won't die so easily! Who decided that I couldn't stand up to you?
074	Ahahahahahaha! As if you could! Those words sound ridiculous coming from a worm like you!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0007
075	I always thought that...it would be so wonderful if...I myself could shoulder Carla's burdens...so she didn't have to carry them alone...but I can't.
076	Not if I don't have a mark like she does. At least...I could research anything that would help me be of use to her.
077	So that someday, even if I couldn't take her place...
078	I would be able to help her!
079	Perhaps he's gone mad from fear. We should put him out of his misery at once.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
080	Allow me to educate you. Among the Sephira, there are those who are marked...and those who aren't.
081	What are you blabbering on about all of a sudden? Such things have nothing to do with you...or your imminent death.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
082	Only those who are marked can use Spiritbonding. However, when certain conditions are met, even those who are not marked become capable of using it!
083	By opening themselves up to the Alchemia of all those who have died here... By pouring their own Alchemia into the earth...
084	Causing it to regenerate!
085	What the—?! Why is he glowing?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
086	By bathing in the light of the stars, spilling one's own blood into the earth, and letting it soak into the sands! In this way, even I can...!
087	Through the circle of life, I can temporarily mimic Spiritbonding!
088	...?!
089	Who said I can't stand up to you?!
090	Didn't I tell you?! You'll never know unless you try!
091	Hey! What're you doing?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
092	Stay here. I'll be back soon.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
093	Balt...? Don't tell me, Hawk—!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
094	Hawk has nothing to do with this. I'm going to protect the things I care about. That's all there is to it.	VO_balt.balt_event_1013
095	Hawk went to try and take them on by himself, didn't he?! I knew it! Hawk! You...idiot!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
096	Carla, wait! Dang it! Please be all right!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
097	You surprised me at first, but I'm afraid this still isn't nearly enough to bring us down. Such a shame!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0017
098	I can't...let you go...yet.
099	Tch... You don't know when to give up, do you? You're still weak! You call yourself a descendant of the Sephira?!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
100	That's not what he was saying, you fool. There's no point bringing a pathetic weakling like him back with us. He'd make a dull gift indeed.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
101	Hah! That's right! Let's crush him already, so we can go and find some real descendants of the Sephira!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
102	I told you, I won't let you do that!
103	Do you not value your life?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
104	There are things that I must protect at all costs, even if that means putting my life on the line. Won't you give up?
105	We wouldn't be here if it was something we were willing to simply abandon. Even we have things that we care about. That is why we must gather Alchemia!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0040
106	......
107	If neither of us is willing to give up, then we can only decide this with strength. Neun, finish him!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
108	Huzzzzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
109	I...will...endure! I...swear...!
110	Grrghh! What's with this guy?!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0022
111	Hawk! You idiot! What have you done to yourself?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
112	Carla! No... Why?! Forget...about me. Just...run!
113	I can't do that, Hawk! So...you're the ones who did this to him, huh?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0015
114	Neun, it's time to get serious.	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0019
115	I won't let you get away with this. I'm going to make you pay!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
116	No, Carla, you can't...!
117	Carla! I'm sorry, Hawk. I couldn't stop her.	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
118	You can still save her!
119	Tch... This woman is annoying. Whatever! This just means that I can go all out! I'm going for it, Sieba!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
120	It appears that this one will make a fine gift indeed. Let us make her the cornerstone of our achievements here!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
121	I won't let you do that! I'm sick of not being able to protect the things I care about! This time...	VO_balt.balt_sys_0015
122	This time, I will protect Hawk, and Carla, and the desert itself!
