001	Huff...huff...! Oh...it's hot!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	Of course. We're fighting in the middle of the fire...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
003	Y-you two! Look up!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
004	Up?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
005	...!!!
006	Wh-why are the insects in the sky?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
007	Aren't there other places to escape to?! Why are they going out of their way to escape to the sky?! They're just going to be taken down by the air defense mages!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
008	No way...the destruction has caused them to give up!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0021
009	Salomo?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
010	With the Second Babel now having been burnt, the insects have no food.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0042
011	I think their desire for Alchemia is causing them to search for the Sacred Stone. They're like moths gathering around a lamp.
012	How-how is that possible...?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
013	It appears that the mages have been exterminated somehow. My soldiers can take care of the rest.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
014	You hurry up and do something to manage this country.
015	Do something...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
016	What? I thought you had a way to change the country? Looks like I completely overestimated you...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0032
017	Well...all my ideas have been blocked...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
018	No, not all of them Liz!
019	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
020	There's still a way. Here come the mages! If you have time to talk then help!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0004
