001	They're the game's protagonists! The heroes...or, well, hero and anti-hero? Either way, they're the main characters of the overarching narrative!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0028
002	...And?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0018
003	And, the story would be over if we beat them in the dang tutorial! We had to lose! My strength wasn't even a factor.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0029
004	But, even just one of them?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0019
005	They're both main characters! Take either one out of the equation and the whole story grinds to a halt.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0030
006	Really? They need two main characters? That's awfully greedy of them.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0020
007	Technically, there are seven.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0031
008	Okay, okay. Your point is taken. But still, you were dealing damage in what, the double digits? And you're still willing to show your face in a character portrait?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0030
009	It. Was. The. Tutorial!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0032
010	What was I supposed to do, bust out a 7000-damage super move?! Who's ever heard of a tutorial where the boss deals 7000 damage?!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0033
011	Still, I'm sure there's something more you could've done.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0021
012	Fine. You want to dance this dance? Then let's not forget, you had to Summon me. So don't act like you have nothing to answer for here!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0034
013	Come, now, I was a regular human then, and already fatigued to the brink of collapse. Don't you remember the dialogue leading up to that fight?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0022
014	I had to drink swamp water, things had been so rough! If anyone has an excuse, it's me.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0023
015	But you! You showed up as a Phantom Soldier. That's a whole different ball game. If I'd been at full strength like that, I would've whupped some serious keister, no doubt.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0024
016	Pshaw! Your keister would've been the whupped one, full strength or no. Again I ask, what kind of game has the main characters die in the tutorial?!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0035
017	Well, what kind of Phantom Soldier only deals double-digit damage?!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0025
018	Yeah, if people have gotten all the way up to waiting for the Gate of Pride thinking that's what we're all about, then of course we're going to get brushed under the rug!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0031
019	But I wasn't even Enlightened back then! I was only level ten, if you hadn't noticed! I think my damage output was pretty good, all things considered.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0036
020	Level ten?! What, were you taking your apples in slices like a posh nobleman?!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0032
021	Don't get cheeky with me! Just...forget the opening scenes, okay? That's not why we've been left hanging for so long; trust me on that! Can anyone think of any other reasons?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0037
022	Such as? If you're so convinced you're not at fault, then I say you come up with a plausible alternative yourself!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0033
023	Well, then let's think. Are any of us just completely disliked by the players? Enough to make them not actually want us?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0038
024	Of course not! Don't be ridiculous.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0034
025	Really? Because I've seen a number of comments from players saying that you, Caesar, are a bit of a pain in the neck, since all you ever do is inflict Rage.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0039
026	Hey, come on, now! You know that's how it has to be.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0035
027	Oh, how the tables have turned! How it has to be, you say? Where have I heard that before? Tell me, then, why does it have to be that way?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0040
028	Because! That's our... You know...	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0036
029	Our what?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0041
030	Our thing! Our characterization.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0037
031	What do you mean, characterization?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0042
032	It's not like I want to use Rage constantly! I'd rather fight with ordinary attacks.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0038
033	But our entire character arc is about resurrection through Wrath. You know—in keeping with the whole "seven deadly sins" motif! At least one of us has to inflict Rage.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0039
034	So your combat technique is shaped entirely by blunt metaphor, is what you're saying?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0043
035	Not...in those exact words. But you two certainly weren't going to pick the low-hanging fruit, and we couldn't very well let it rot on the vine!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0040
036	Our characterization is rather one-note to begin with. If you take away our Rage, what do we even have left to offer?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0041
037	Oh, come now! You're selling us quite a bit short, don't you think?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0044
038	Am I? Then tell me: what's my character like? What's your impression of me?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0042
039	Um, well, you're someone who...uses Rage a lot, and...you, uh, do other things as well, I believe! Such as, I don't remember, but nonetheless—	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0045
040	Couldn't have said it better myself. I don't have any character! No special traits of any kind. I'm just the guy with the long hair.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0043
041	So by using Rage to a...frankly irresponsible extent, I could finally create an identity for myself. That's just who I am!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.caesar_2021april_0044
042	I'm...beginning to feel a little pity toward you, I can't deny. What of you, Vlad? Is there any reason the players might dislike you?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0046
043	Me? No, no. I'm in good standing, I dare say.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0026
044	Are you?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0047
045	Well, out of the three of us, I'm the least annoying to fight. I don't spam any attacks or do anything that anyone would particularly dread. I just go in half-heartedly swinging, and see what happens!	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0027
046	Oh, dear.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0048
047	I don't even inflict Rage, and my attacks look like they could be tough, but then turn out to be perfectly manageable.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0028
048	...
049	I dare say, a big guy like me not actually being all that strong probably gives people a nice little chuckle! Might even make me kind of endearing. Hahaha.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0029
050	Why did I even ask?	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0050
051	Oh, I'm not self-deprecating, mind you! I'm just being realistic. No one knows you better than you know yourself, they say! Hahahaha.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0030
052	When the three of us get together, like at Mobius, they usually don't bother bringing me out until last.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0031
053	...
054	And nobody finishes on the loser of the group! So I'd say there's no way the players dislike me. I mean, can you imagine? Hahaha.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.vlad_2021april_0032
055	You have got to be kidding me.	EQ_APRILFOOL2021_02_a_2d.neville_2021april_0052
