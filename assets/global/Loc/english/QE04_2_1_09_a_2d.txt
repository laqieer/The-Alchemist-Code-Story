001	That's about the lot of them.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	Voda, are you all right?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
003	Yes... Tina, you've proven to me your power of the wind...and your resolve.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
004	I have been entrusted with the lost power of the wind. I am sure there is some meaning to this. I promise to save Saga from this crisis!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
005	I accept your resolve...and will respond likewise.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
006	Then...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
007	Yes. I'll accompany you...to the Fuu faction.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
008	We cannot allow the Forest of Rukifojio to become a battlefield.
009	Thank you, Voda!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0034
010	Well then, let's hurry before the Gluttony army gets here.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
011	Wait. Before that, there's one more thing I must do.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0014
012	What's that...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
013	Stay where you are and observe. It'll be problematic if something were to happen in my absence.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
014	Is that...the Water Matter?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
015	I, the Enforcer of Water...summon you, Water Matter.
016	In honor of our covenant, my flesh will serve as your abode!
017	What...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
018	The Water Matter...is entering Voda's body?!
019	The one who controls the Matter has the ability to contain and manage it within their body.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
020	I cannot afford to leave it here.
021	Amazing! It's like magic!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
022	Well then, let's make our way to Fuu. I wonder how long it's been since I've seen him.	VO_voda.voda_chara_1004
023	Here they come again, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
024	Ah!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
025	I'm sorry. I'd truly like to help you, but...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0035
026	When I carry the Matter within me, it requires all my willpower to manage it.
027	It's unfortunate since I'd love to give them a taste of my water Ouija.
028	Don't worry! We'll handle this!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
029	I can only hold the Matter within me for up to twelve hours.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0041
030	I must finish my talk with Fuu before then.
031	Protect me and lead Saga to its former glory, Tina!
