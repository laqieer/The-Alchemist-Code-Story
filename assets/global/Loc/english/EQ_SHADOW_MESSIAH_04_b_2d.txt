001	...
002	Lord Zahar! Are you injured?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
003	Of course not.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
004	Let's get going. We need to get these Obsidian Stars back to the base.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
005	As you command...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
006	These stones—the Obsidian Stars—will be of great use to our cause.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
007	(All will be devoured, leading this world to new horizons.)
008	(Yes… I will destroy the Holy Order of Babel!)	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0003
009	...
010	What's the matter, Spica?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
011	You've been cooking up a storm since we got back to the base!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
012	And you're actually cutting up the meat and fish!
013	You're actually pretty handy with that knife! I'm impressed.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0044
014	Corvus?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
015	Finished, are we?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
016	Yes. Would you taste-test it for me?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
017	Sure.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
018	Hmm... This is no good. You put in too much pepper.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
019	Okay. I'll start over.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
020	...
021	(She's improving. Maybe this means her doubts...)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
022	They're starting to clear.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
023	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
024	Nothing. Never mind.
025	Ila!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
026	What?!
027	It's time for training. Follow me.
028	O-okay!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
029	Wow, Corvus. I don't think I've ever heard you volunteer to train us before!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
030	Lord Zahar left the Shadow Messiah in my care—that includes you three.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
031	I'm not in the habit of letting him down. Come on, Silma. You've got to train too.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
032	Y-yes, sir!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
033	(Hmph... Looks like they've been having an effect on me as well.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
