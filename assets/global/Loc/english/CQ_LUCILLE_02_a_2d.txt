001	I didn't expect you to go so far. I hate to admit it, but...your weapons are pretty good.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0046
002	I have to say the same to you. Your weapons are rather well-made. Wait a minute... Is that...?	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0044
003	Huh?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
004	You're bleeding! Give me your hand! Oh, no! This looks pretty bad...	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0002
005	Huh? Oh, this? Don't worry about it. It always happens whenever I forge something.
006	Oh... I guess I must have been too distracted watching you make your weapons for the first time to notice, but...
007	Seeing your hand injured like this when you're such an incredible blacksmith... It makes me sad.	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0018
008	Sad? What? Why?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
009	I know you want to make better and better weapons. But if you keep going like this, the day will come where you won't be able to keep making weapons anymore. Your hands are your most valuable asset in this business.	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0001
010	It's not that easy to find a good rival like you, you know. It makes me sad to think that I might lose this someday...
011	Your weapons must be sad as well, even more so than I am.
012	My...weapons? Sad? You're always saying such weird stuff, Suiran.
013	Just give me your hand. I'm going to bandage it for you, okay?
014	Oh, okay.	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
015	Hey... What did you mean by my weapons being sad?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0001
016	Blacksmiths and their weapons share the same soul. The heart of the blacksmith is connected to the weapons they forge.
017	I always take good care of this hammer, because it's an important tool that I need to use when I'm smithing.
018	Lucia, you should treat your hands the same way!	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0001
019	Personally, I think that not taking care of one’s tools is a very negligent thing for a professional to do.
020	What’s more, I believe that the weapons themselves can sense it.
021	Mind you, I like being lazy whenever I can get away with it, myself.	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0011
022	Am I...negligent?	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0025
023	No, that can’t be true. I'm always thinking about how to improve my weapons!
024	One day, I'm going to make the perfect weapon!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0004
025	With your hands all torn up like that?	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0030
026	I...!
027	Grrrrrrrrrrrr!
028	Uh, oh! We’re surrounded! Come on, Lucia!	VO_suiran.suiran_sys_0010
029	Got it!	VO_lucille.lucille_sys_0038
