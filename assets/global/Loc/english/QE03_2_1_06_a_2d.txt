001	Are you serious?! Let me get this straight...	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0024
002	You want us to talk with the headmistress? Isn't that almost the same thing as turning yourself in?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0020
003	But nothing is gonna change the way things are now! I'm sure the headmistress will know a way to take care of Asmodeus!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
004	...!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
005	Even the headmistress can't touch the Sacred Stone.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0027
006	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
007	I told you before, didn't I? Asmodeus is still far above in the clouds, beyond any witch's reach.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
008	The only witch who got her hands on Asmodeus was the one who made an agreement with it, which transformed the country into the way it is. I think they call her Mother of Sin.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
009	There was a song about it, so I remember.
010	But that's because she could only use magic, right? This power I have...it's beyond magic.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
011	I think this power should be able to accomplish things a witch wouldn't be able to.
012	That's why I'm gonna ask the headmistress about how I can get Asmodeus using this power!
013	So Alchemy isn't enough for you, and now you're seeking the Sacred Stone...you pest!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0013
014	...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
