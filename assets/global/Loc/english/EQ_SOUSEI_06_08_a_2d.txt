001	Rise up, my brethren.
002	*Gasp*	VO_slba.slba_battle_0019
003	This…must be a memory of the king in his final moments.
004	When the rains of fire and corruption were descending upon our homeland--destroying everything--he said:
005	You all are my greatest pride. I wish only for your prosperity. Therefore--
006	Live, young one. Leave my corpse behind.
007	Now, run!
008	I, King Arias of the Ira Belt, shall clear your path.
009	I ran without looking back. What he did--his sacrifice--was the beginning of the end for our land…yet I had no idea.
010	And then--
011	…I see. So, my brother is dead.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0016
012	If that's the case, then you must carry his sword.	VO_terres.terres_sys_0031
013	…At that time--
014	I couldn't comprehend the weight--the significance--of the sword that was entrusted to me…
015	What's the meaning of this?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0025
016	Our reports indicate that fiery corruption is spewing from the great mountain in the distance.
017	The shield regimen is doing its best, but if we stay any longer we risk being corrupted…
018	Tch…This must be what Andechs meant by "the night of fire rain."	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
019	All soldiers withdraw to the borderlands! If we turn into Fallen here, Nimul's party will be in dire straits.
020	Abandon your tents and personal effects. We have no time to spare!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
021	Yes, sir!
022	To think the Ira Belt would succumb to this level of calamity...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
023	As an Invidian, I can't forgive them for dragging my people into the war…but they deserve better than this.
024	Imnus!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0019
025	Nicaea, you must have heard. We're retreating to the borderlands.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0006
026	I worry we'll be too far from Nimul's party, but knowing Daphne is with them puts my mind at ease.
027	There may be other reasons to worry. Look! Do you see that?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0039
028	What on earth--
029	...I don't believe it!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0026
030	The Ira Belt is sending its knights in full force our way!?
031	…Are we safe from the corruption in here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
032	For now, at least, the power of the Red Blade will protect us.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0030
033	Is that sword altering the magil in the atmosphere…or returning it to normal?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
034	I'm surprised such a thing exists given the sparse technology of this region.
035	…They say the king's family originated from outside the Ira Belt.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
036	They were Red Blade-wielders and were able to cultivate the land, even if just a little.
037	That explains how they became kings. You've gotta be able to feed the people in order to rule them.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
038	…Who knows, but you may be right.
039	At any rate, what now?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
040	What indeed… Outside it's a veritable sea of fire. If we're to pursue Quence to Mt. Shinai, we'll have to rely on--	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
041	My silver shield's protection.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
042	Exactly. But we'll likely have to confront Satna along the way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
043	The only way to defend against flame incarnate is with that shield.
044	But we don't want to exhaust our only defense either.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
045	So, whadda we do? It's not like we have an airship.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
046	Looks like there's only one option--hoof it.
047	I bet we could have the Engineer Soldiers form a protective barrier, or something…
048	See, like this… We can have them make a roof with their arms.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
049	I see...but that would leave us open to attack from the sides… There must be another way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
050	If we stand any chance of reversing this calamity, we've got to hurry.
051	…!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
052	Hark, the death knell tolls. Writhe in the flames of my wrath, humans!!!	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0028_a
053	...The castle gates have been breached.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0042
054	We've got to make it through this--no matter what!
055	Everyone, focus!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
056	First, eliminate the obstacles in front of you! "I am Transcender of the Gate of Envy!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
