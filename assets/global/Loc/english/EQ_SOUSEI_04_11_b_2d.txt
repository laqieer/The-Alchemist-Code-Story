001	Grrrraaaarrrrggggghhhh!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0002
002	Urk...!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
003	It's not over! It can't end here!
004	We're...
005	We're gonna save Emmel! We're gonna save this region!
006	I want to make a bright future for all people! I want everyone to be able to smile!
007	Huh? Energy is welling up suddenly... I guess it's now or never!
008	Huzzahhhhh!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0032
009	Grrrroooooaaarrrrgghhh!!!	VO_belphegor.belphegor_battle_0019
010	Yeah, bullseye! So now—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0009
011	Huh?!
012	...
013	No, it didn't work? Don't tell me...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
014	Wait, Adaleigh! What's happening? Nothing we're doing can beat Asmodeus!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
015	We can damage it, but nothing will finish it off. Can you analyze it from there?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
016	This is the sanctuary.
017	What?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
018	I think that this entire region is already Beelzebub's sanctuary!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
019	So those Cursed Beasts are receiving a supply of magil. They can recover in a flash!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
020	Whaaat? You're saying...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
021	Those two have the forms of Asmodeus and Belphegor, but are puppets of Beelzebub!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
022	It's just like how the Sinners of the Luxuria Belt were made from Asmodeus!
023	We can't defeat them under these conditions... Even if we did, they'd immediately be revived!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
024	We have to defeat Beelzebub and eliminate the sanctuary or it's useless!
025	That means we have to keep fighting Asmodeus until Nimul and the others can beat Beelzebub...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0045
026	No freaking way! There's nothing else we can do?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
027	Let me do the analysis first... Ah, darn! It's being revived again! Sorry, I've got my hands full over here...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
028	Wait, Adaleigh! Adaleeeeigh?!
029	This is impossible! We'll end up expending all of our energy before this is over!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
030	We'll just have to conserve our magil and prepare for the long haul...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
031	Seriously? But the Beast can end us in one attack!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
032	I'm serious, Mira. Look, Asmodeus is moving again!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
033	Eek! Argh, hurry up, Nimul!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
034	It looks like Mira and the others are fighting a hard battle.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
035	I know. But...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
036	The Sinners' attacks on the village have suddenly gotten stronger. At this rate...
037	The corrupted voices of spirits are coming from so many places!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0029
038	I've never picked up on these numbers of corrupted before.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0030
039	Eulalia, you feel it too?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
040	There is something very clearly strange here. Perhaps Beelzebub is different from the Cursed Beasts we've encountered before?
041	Nimul! Another horde of Sinners is approaching from the right! Our lines will crumble like this!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_chara_1006
042	Hmm. Focus our power in that direction. I'll cover them! Charge if you find any opening!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
043	Are you sure? This will delay our procession...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
044	There's no other way. But why has it come to this? Every time Sinners have appeared, the people of Sephira have arrived to purify it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
045	But after the awakening of Beelzebub, so many people have fallen into sin; an absurd number...
046	Where could all these Sinners be coming from?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
