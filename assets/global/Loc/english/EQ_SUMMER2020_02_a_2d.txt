001	Hyah!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0004
002	Oh! You can still move...
003	Albea, watch out!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0022
004	Oh no! My comb!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0021
005	Grrahck!	VO_aj2000.aj2000_sys_0043
006	S-stop! Don't! Give it back!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0024
007	W-wait! Albea! It's pointless to chase after them! We can't even see them anymore...
008	Let go of me!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0025
009	Huh?!
010	I have to follow them! I need to get it back!
011	That comb is... It's—	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
012	Albea, calm down! How are you going to follow them when you can't even see them?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
013	I...
014	Rather than blindly chasing after them, let's take a moment to assess the situation.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
015	Any way you slice it, doing something about those machines is our job!
016	I agree. There's something about the way those machines moved that concerns me.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
017	Albea...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
018	...
019	Yeah...
020	I'm sorry for losing my composure. I wasn't even the only one that had something stolen from them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0036
021	Th-that's totally fine.
022	...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
023	(For the always coolheaded Albea to lose her composure... It must've been something really important to her.)
024	By the way, Suzuka, what was the thing you were concerned about?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
025	Well, I listened to the beachgoers' stories.
026	Apparently until just a few days ago, the humanoid machines weren't attacking people. They just picked up trees and rocks from all over the beach.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
027	Now that you mention it, I only saw them digging through the trash, like they were looking for something.
028	I wonder why. Were they ordered to pick up trash?
029	Then when they ran out of things to pick up, they suddenly became more interested in the people on the beach, stealing the things they dropped.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0030
030	...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
031	Also, there's something about how the Alkaroids moved.
032	So they really are Alkaroids.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0044
033	I heard that Beckram Alkaroids aren't currently being produced, though.
034	It's unclear why they are here, not only in operation but also stealing people's things for some reason... This isn't just random behavior.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
035	There's probably someone giving them commands. And if that's the case, it'd probably be faster to ask that person directly what they...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
036	What? An octopus?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
037	Agh! They're swarming...	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
038	And attacking?!
039	Huh. They aren't.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
040	They're more docile than we heard. It looks like they're focused on something else.
041	...
042	Oh! There might be someone deep in that cave that's causing them to come outside.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
043	That's a possibility. Let's go check it out.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0005
044	Whoa! Is that a boat? It's pretty beat up.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
045	It's been anchored here...which means there's probably someone inside.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0006
046	L-look!
047	That's...an octopus! It's been nothing but octopuses lately!
048	Bertha said that ever since that giant octopus was wiped out, they've taken to living deep in caves.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
049	Deep in the caves? But these are in the mouth of the cave?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
050	Hm? What are they doing? It looks like they're bringing something out.
051	Wait, Mira. If you stick out that far—	VO_albell.albell_sys_0003
052	Ah! They noticed us! And they're coming this way!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
