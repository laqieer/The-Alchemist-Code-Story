001	Whoa!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
002	Ooh, so close.
003	Hey, now! That was a cheap shot!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
004	Isn't that what you do in a fight? You build your defense, and should your opponent drop theirs, you sweep in for the kill. It's called tactics.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
005	Prattle on all you want, but you're all out of backup!
006	Oh, don't you fret! I have an endless supply of Fallen to call upon.
007	...!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
008	Don't you dare!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0001
009	Thanks for the save. We mesh better than I thought we would.
010	Teamwork is the first thing soldiers study in Superbia Belt.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
011	There's only so far teamwork can take us, though. There's simply no way we can deal with this many Fallen.
012	Unfortunately, I think you're right. If they weren't Fallen, I could just take the hits and break through. But the corruption makes taking any hits at all a losing proposition.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
013	I'd heard that Avaritia soldiers have resistance against corruption. Is that not the case with you?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
014	Afraid not. My only lines of defense are my blade and my skill.
015	Let's see to it that that's enough, then!
016	Hmph.	VO_esai.esai_battle_0016
017	Your defeat is assured even at this pace, but sadly, it's taking much too long. The process will need to be sped up.
018	Groaaaaaaaar!
019	What the...?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
020	(His troops are falling back? He's obviously setting some kind of trap, but what is it?)	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
021	(If I were him, what would I do to get the upper hand when dealing with a Knight of Justice like Andechs?)
022	(I think I know. I'd take a hostage. Maybe that Shield Maiden—someone my opponent would want to protect at all costs.)
023	By the way, Ignacio...	VO_esai.esai_sys_0002
024	You wouldn't happen to know this little lady, would you?
025	Ah...ggh...	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
026	H-Helene!
027	Coward!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
028	Ahaha! And there's the opening!	VO_esai.esai_sys_0008
029	Finally...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
030	Is this the place, Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
031	It is. This is the heart of the tower.
032	This is Grand Excelsior, the control center. It's the aggregate of all the Cursed Beasts' cores.
033	Look at all of this corruption, though...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
034	Ouroboros is using the corruption that's accumulated within her to contaminate the tower's core.
035	That's...what cost Bianca her fight.
036	So we've got to take it back, then.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
037	Yes. We can turn things around from here. We can win this.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
038	The sinful magil that fills this place rivals even Beelzebub's corruption, though.
039	Which is why it's so crucial that you two are with me this time. It would be difficult for me to do this alone, but if we all combine our powers of purification, I think we really do stand a chance.
040	All right!
041	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
042	......
043	What's wrong, Waginau?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
044	I believe the three of us won't be enough here.
045	What? Why not?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
046	Humans. You have come.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0003
047	Didn't take her long to notice us.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
048	(So what now? It would be impossible for me to purify all of this corruption on my own. We need at least two Spiritbonders focused on it.)
049	(For now, I guess I'll just have to buy us some time.)
050	Nimul...
051	I'm on it. You and Emmel should get started on purifying the core.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
052	No. I'll take care of Ouroboros.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
053	Huh? Why?!
054	Sorry for keeping this from you for so long...but I can no longer use Spiritbonding.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0035
055	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
056	It's a result of his contract. For a human to gain the power of the dragons, an offering must be made. Compensation, you might say...or sacrifice.
057	The man before you gave up the skill that he'd spent his entire life honing. He lost the very power that makes the Sephira who they are.
058	Waginau...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
059	It is as he says. I won't be able to help purify the core. This is the only way I can be of help in this conflict, Nimul. I'm sorry it had to come to this.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
060	I... I see. All right, then. I guess there's no other choice.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
061	Do your best here, Waginau. We just need a little more time.
062	Of course. I've got you covered.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
063	......
064	Let's hurry it up, Nimul! We've got to make sure not to waste Waginau's efforts!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
065	Yeah... You're right.
066	Hmm.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
067	I do not recognize you, human. Why do you stand before me?
068	This is the place where the fate of the world shall be decided. It is here that our decisions are tested and explored.
069	What right have you to interject yourself upon these sacred proceedings?
070	You don't recognize me, huh? That makes sense, considering everything I've...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
071	—No, scratch that. I will not succumb to regret.
072	I am called Waginau. I am Captain of the renowned Sephira Guard, and attendant to Nimul—the man who is to become this world's salvation!
073	Zafeiris!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0001
074	Acknowledged. Fringe Dimensional Art, Nero. Extraction.
075	Zafeiris... I see. So this is the path you have chosen: to live amongst humans.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
076	Forgive me. My body is but a shell of what it once was, but my desire to save you has never gone away.
077	Please allow me to carry out my duty, and succumb to the rest you so greatly yearn for.
078	What an interesting turn of events. In lieu of your request, I would see you writhe and squirm before me, you wretched shell of a dragon...just as you did the day you first tasted defeat!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
099	Then I shall stake my soul on this day, and bring you to rest through whatever means necessary!
079	"Adhere to the dark commandments!"
080	What—?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0026
081	This is the power of the Shell; it is the very same power that I wield. I know not where you obtained it, and I don't care for you having it!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
082	It's not enough. I can't defeat Ouroboros like this.
083	Of course you can't. Your powers come from the same source, yet you are but a single human being. She has the advantage here in all regards.
084	The question is, will I at least be able to buy he others the time they need?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
085	If that is your aim, let us see if we can't make another miracle happen. Name your price.
086	How about my sense of taste?
087	Insufficient. Be aware that the smaller your offering, the smaller this miracle will be. All things have their price.
088	Then...I'll give up my sense of touch.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
089	That will be acceptable.
090	I shall use my soul as fuel. The power I draw shall cut deeper still!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0029
091	Your transgressions shall not be overlooked.
092	Oh? And just what did you have in mind, exactly?
093	Is it not obvious? I will return in kind all that you are owed!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0016
094	Has she gotten more powerful?!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
095	She's held back all this time, but it looks like she's finally pulling out all the stops. If you're not careful, she may even be able to take you out with one shot.
096	You say that so casually!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
097	(But he's not wrong. Even with my pledge, I'll only be able to hold out for so long...)
098	Nimul... Please, hurry!
