001	We have evacuated the villagers. However, we are severely outnumbered by these monsters.
002	Nngh!
003	Brother Gerald...!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
004	Don't think about the numbers! Just focus on bringing down the monster in front of you while I draw the bulk of the horde away from here!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
005	Taking them on alone is too reckless! Surely there is something else that can be—!
006	No! This is the only way we can...nnnghh!
007	Gerald! No!
008	We must protect the village! Compared to what could be lost if we falter, a wound like this is nothing!
009	If I cannot accomplish this, I'm not... I'm...!
010	Gerald...
011	Ack!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
012	Are you all right?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
013	I'm fine. See to the other members first.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
014	I already have. You're the only one left who needs my attention.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0005
015	I see. Good.
016	Thanks to that reckless move you pulled, treatment's going to take a little while. It'll be dark before I finish.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
017	That's fine. Whatever it takes for me to be ready to fight another day.
018	Mhm. You know, you keep fighting like this, and you won't be around to welcome Vettel back. He'll only have your gravestone to talk to.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
019	...
020	Hmm?
021	What makes you think I am waiting for him to return? He'll return when he returns.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
022	Your head's sparking again.
023	Hmph.
024	Why don't we go eat something sweet?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
025	What? Why?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
026	I was just thinking it might be a nice change of pace. Besides, I could go for some dessert.
028	You know I don't have time for frivolous things like that.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
029	Hey! Where do you think you're going?! I haven't even finished patching you up! Haa... What am I going to do with him?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
