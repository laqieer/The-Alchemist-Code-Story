001	Heh. That's the last of them. They won't be following us anymore!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
002	Ren.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
003	Huh?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
004	What in the name of the gods are you doing?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
005	What do you mean?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
006	This is the mansion of the leader of the Shiba Senko! I'm sure I told you that we should remain hidden and watch their movements first.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0016
007	Instead, you have just strolled into the heart of their mansion like you own the place!
008	Did I? Oh! Ha. So I did.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
009	I have no intention of getting in your way. I just want to know what you're thinking.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
010	Well, defenses are like an apple tree. If you shake the trunk, things start to come loose.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
011	Come loose?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
012	Like, for example, the location of Sumeragi.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
013	Ah!
014	Look at all this fuss. They're freaking out, but there are areas they're not willing to abandon yet. That's a clear sign there's something important that needs extra protection.
015	I mean, it didn't work this time, but the logic is solid. Am I right, or am I right?	VO_ren.ren_chara_2006
016	I...see.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0022
017	I know that whole thing with your sister makes you a little antsy. With the doom and the imminent murder and whatever.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
018	But like I said, I've got your back, man! Leave the thinking to me!
019	You're not exactly—er, I don't mean to criticize, but—the most...ninja...of ninja, if you catch my meaning.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
020	You're not in any position to point fingers.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
021	Well! Anyway, did you feel that energy before?! That must be the Carn...Incarn...Discarn... The Discarnate Power! Yeah! Got it right that time. Whew, that feels good.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
022	Yes. Yomi's power has grown quite a lot. Tch, "Demon Calming Ceremony."	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
023	What they are really doing is increasing her power by pouring Chakra into it. The corruption inside of her is expanding rapidly.
024	When I came across her the other day, it was clear that the corruption was uncontrolled and eating away at her.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
025	There's no mistake... The Shiba Senko and that old codger from the Kagomurasaki are plotting to force her power to manifest!
026	At this rate, Yomi will be—!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
027	You know, you're not what I pictured at all.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
028	What do you mean?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0006
029	When I found out you were a monster who killed his entire family, I kind of expected more—I don't know—psychotic muttering or something. Maybe some gross facial hair...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
030	You've got none of that. You've even resigned yourself to being killed by your little sister. I can't deny that monsters come in all forms, but...
031	None of that matters. All you need to do is lend me your strength.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
032	Well, since I'm lending you my strength, the least you can do is tell me about what happened. I'm guessing there is some kind of backstory behind this whole thing?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
033	It has nothing to do with you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
034	Psh... Monster...? More like conversation killer.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
035	I'll have you know, it's very childish to shut me down just because I wanna know a little more about you.
036	...
037	Can't you move on? Do you have to kill him?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
038	In Wadatsumi, killing one's own family is considered one of the gravest sins. It's a disgrace.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
039	My clan and I were utterly humiliated after the incident.
040	That's why I must kill him, or else neither myself nor the members of my clan can move on. The past must be settled.
041	You have your burdens as head of your clan, and I have mine as Greed Dike's General.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
042	That said... I don't mean to speak out of turn, but it seems to me like you're trying to find a way to move on without killing your brother.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
043	Wha—?! Of course not!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0012
044	I don't know how much my words are worth, coming from the General of a country who once invaded your own, but I'll tell you this:	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
045	You can't move on if you're stuck in the past. Sometimes you just have to push through the humiliation in order to move forward.
046	I don't know anything about the path you're headed down, but...I think it'd be nice if our paths joined at some point.
047	Maybe then we could, um, maybe—ahem—be f-friends?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
048	Friends?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
049	Well, um, I apologize if the notion offends you. It's just that...because I've been in the army since I was young, I haven't really had the chance to make many friends.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
050	Ah, but I'm not young anymore!
051	I know. It's just your face.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
052	We're close in age, and our responsibilities are similar, so I only thought... Never mind. Just forget about it.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
053	When the day comes that I overcome my past, perhaps it is possible that we could become friends. I think...that I'd like that.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
054	I...! I would, too!
055	Well then, I suppose I had better start coming up with a plan to renegotiate with the Shiba Senko.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
056	You know, so that we can join forces one day.
057	What about Sumeragi?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
058	That sword exists to clear your path.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
059	I will search for a way for us to understand each other, one that doesn't involve swords, armies, or clans.
060	Leafah...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
061	That's the first time you've used my name, you know that?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
062	Leafah, you're a very impressive grown-up.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
063	W-well, yeah! It's just my baby face that's misleading!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
064	Heheh, right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0047
065	Let's meet again, Yomi.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
066	See you around, Leafah.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
067	Overcoming my past, huh?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0022
068	In order to do that, I need to meet my brother...
069	Meet my brother and...and...and then...! W-wait, what am I going to do then?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0031
070	That's when I'll...I'll...I-I'll...! I will—aaaaaarrrrrrrrgggggghhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
071	That's right, I'm going to kill him! I'm going to get revenge for my family! Yes, yes, I must kill him!
072	Hate... Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate! Ngh... What's wrong with me? Why do I feel...so much...hate?!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
073	Ngh! Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0024
074	Heheh. It shouldn't be long now. The Discarnate Power will manifest shortly.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
075	The amplifying effect of the Mikaboshi truly is remarkable!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
076	It may not have the power it once possessed, but it remains the equal of even the Sacred Stones. Yes... We will keep her hatred seething!
077	The Discarnate Power will manifest any moment now! When it does, a new Wadatsumi will be born! With its first breath, it will swallow the world!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
078	Okay, how about a guessing game? Sooo, I'm thinking... Maybe the previous head of the Kagomurasaki Clan was disappointed that the next in line was a girl, your little sister.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
079	Just kidding, that's actually a rumor that made it even as far as the Black Star Clan, but if it's true, Jin, then what you did—!
080	Don't say another word.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0014
081	This is super sad. Have you thought about what it's like for Yomi, who has to hate you without even knowing the reason why you did what you did?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
082	Have you ever considered how it must feel for her to inherit the Discarnate Power with the weight of all that on her shoulders?
083	I told you not to say another word!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0013
084	I can't...talk about it.	VO_zin.zin_sys_1019
085	...
086	Please, don't ask me about it anymore!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0018
087	All right. I won't.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
088	Why?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
089	Why what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
090	Why get involved with me? You should stay away. Nothing good will come of this for you.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
091	You'll just get hurt.
092	If you have a duty to carry out, and our goal is the same, I will join forces with you.
093	Just don't try and get close to me. Why are you trying to pry into my past?
094	Dunno. Curiosity?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
095	C-curiosity?!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0025
096	Well, I was always taught that ninjas are bound by things like fate, rules, tradition, and...	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
097	You know, all that righteous twaddle...
098	But here you are, breaking away from all of that.
099	Even though it would be far easier if you were to just follow the code, protect tradition, and explain things away as being part of the rules.
100	I guess you could say that I'm...envious. It's not like I'm here because I want to be.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
101	That's why I'm curious about you. How did you do it?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
102	I've been asked that before.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
103	It's not like I'm doing something impressive.
104	I just keep running away.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
105	It's truly disgraceful. Feel free to ridicule me.
106	...
107	I'm sensing something. This energy...! It's that Discarnate Power! Is it really so strong that we can feel it all the way out here?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
108	Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
109	Seems like it's fading now, but...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
110	There's no time.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
111	So it seems.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
112	Let's head back to the Shiba Senko mansion. There's not much time left. I'm going to get Yomi out of there.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0002
113	I guess I'll focus on finding Sumeragi. For the demon expungement, and all that.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
114	But what are you planning to do after you get Yomi out?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
115	After...?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
116	If you don't tell her the truth, Yomi will continue to blame you.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
117	If it comes to that...	VO_zin.zin_battle_0016
118	I'd rather keep running away.
