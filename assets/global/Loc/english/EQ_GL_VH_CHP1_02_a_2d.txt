001	Hmm... I wonder how they can enjoy staying in such a crowded place.
002	Hmm? He looks strangely similar to the little one...
003	(Godslayer... Such a boastful name.)
004	(I wonder if she is as strong as her name claims.)
005	We are here.
006	Now we stay low and wait.
007	Hiding behind some boxes, they waited.
008	...
009	...
010	...
011	...
012	...I am Emrys, it's an honor to work with you Gods—
013	Do not call me when it's not required.
014	Understood...
015	...
016	...
017	Were you the "Sis" Red spoke of last night?
018	...
019	She spoke of me? Why?
020	She said you were too busy, so she asked me out instead.
021	Oh? Asking a stranger out on her night off? Such a daring one. Kukuku...
022	Anyway, I'm just not very fond of crowds.
023	I see... Are you both related in some way?
024	Nope, I just see her as a cute junior.
025	Ah indeed, she does remind me of my sister at times...
026	...
027	They're here.
028	The thugs carried huge crates along with them.
029	Come on guys, it's just up ahead.
030	It's the Godslayer! Attack!
031	It's hard being famous.
