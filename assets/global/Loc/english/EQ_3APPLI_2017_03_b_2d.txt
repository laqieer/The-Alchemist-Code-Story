001	As if to laugh at the arguing women, one monster after another begin to make their way onto the ship.
002	Ack! It's just one after the other...	VO_revatein.revatein_battle_0019
003	Uggggrraaaah!!!
004	Eeek! They're coming from the back of the ship too?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
005	Oh dear! Amaterasu and <p_name>...!	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0020
006	Uggggrraaaah!
007	N-no...!
008	There's so many of them...! Ack...my power...if only it was at full force!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0020
009	Amaterasu! I'm heading there! Please...hold on a little longer!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
010	O-okay, I'll do my best!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
011	If Lisbeth leaves, Yuri and I are gonna have to fight off the enemy at the ship's bow by ourselves...	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
012	There are a few too many of them. Even I'm not confident that I can defeat them all.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0018
013	Still...if we don't manage this, it'll be the end for us here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
014	Leaving the enemy at the bow to Laevateinn and Yuri whether they like it or not, Lisbeth heads to save Amaterasu and the others.
015	...Amaterasu! Keep your spirit up!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
016	...!!!
017	Even if most of the keys have been stolen...the sun itself has not disappeared! You still have power!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
018	For now you just need to hide from the enemy! As long as your life flame continues to burn...hope will continue to shine!
019	Lisbeth...you're right...I can still fight!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
020	I will protect <p_name>!
021	Yes. We can't afford to lose here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
022	Hyaaahh!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0008
023	Uggggrraaah!!!
024	Lisbeth?! Be careful!
025	Amaterasu, I'm all right! Go help Lisbeth!
026	But...!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
027	This is your captain's orders!
028	...Aye aye, Captain!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
029	Uggggrraaah!
030	Eeek?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
031	Not on my watch...!!!
032	Amaterasu! But then...what about <p_name>?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
033	It's all right! Laevateinn has taken over the bow!
034	When the defenseless <p_name> is going all out, there's no way I should be complaining.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0010
035	But once you regroup over there, quickly come back. No way can we fall apart now.
036	You guys...! All right, let's survive this mess!
037	(...<p_name> really does make a good captain of this ship.)
038	(Even when our hearts were on the verge of being clouded with darkness and negativity...)
039	(<p_name>'s words brought us back.)
040	(<p_name> might be the trump card to defeat the Fallen.)
