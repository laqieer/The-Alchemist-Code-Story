001	What the heck are you all doing--wasting this important opportunity!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
002	This meeting is necessary for the future of both countries…
003	Humph… It was a fantasy to ever think we could share responsibility over the Mikaboshi.
004	Wha--	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
005	It's better we take what we can get and be on our way.
006	What he said.
007	…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
008	…Regardless of what you say, both countries have already decided on joint custody of the Mikaboshi.
009	If you're saying you want to nuke that joint resolution…then your actions are a serious crime against both countries.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
010	Ha...Big talk from the likes of a puppet general.
011	You've ensnared Greed Dike all while buttering up to Wadatsumi…You're nothing but a traitor!
012	Me? A traitor?...I adore Greed Dike.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
013	That's why I look squarely at our past mistakes and try my best to achieve a bright future.
014	It is you who are the traitors--trying to trip up those who wish for a better future for their homeland.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0013
015	Cry all you want. Who's going to follow a puppet child general?
016	Child general? I just have a baby face!	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1003
017	Humph. Whatever. The Mikaboshi will be ours.
018	…As luck would have it, I hear Yomi's not doing so well as the Mikaboshi's guard.
019	…!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
020	…Even if she's not at full health, she isn't so frail to lose to the likes of you!
021	My men are dealing with your splinter cell as we speak. It's only a matter a time before they're captured.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0003
022	Leafah is right.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
023	Basheeny!
024	I was about to arrest them but they disappeared. Where could they have run off to?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
025	Listen, I got some intel.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
026	Intel?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
027	From Yomi.
028	What? Y-Yomi! What did she say? Is she alright? Please tell me she's alright!
029	Just calm down. She's fine.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
030	A short time ago we encountered a group thought to be the extremists. Working in tandem with our mole in the splinter cell, we were able suppress and arrest them. They are currently in transit.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
031	The Mikaboshi has already been transferred to a new location and under heavy protections. Too bad, huh?
032	Oof…
033	I'd like for you to explain your little coup d'état attempt on the Mikaboshi.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
034	The Mikaboshi is safe! Looks like my men did a great job!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0008
035	What a relief… And Yomi's is also safe… Huh?
036	Spies? Reinforcements? Already arrested? What's the meaning of this?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0006
037	I thought my orders were only to follow the extremists…
038	Why don't you hear directly from your subordinates?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
039	Allow me to explain, General.
040	After we heard about the plot to steal the Mikaboshi, we immediately joined forces with Lady Yomi to suppress and capture the enemy unit.
041	Congratulations on your accomplishment! You deserve a great deal of credit!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
042	How did you hear about the thieves?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
043	…We sent in a mole.
044	Wha--	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
045	The other side was willing to do anything to gain power, so they simply exploited that weakness. Incidentally, I was the one who suggested the idea.
046	You acted on your own authority, without reporting to your superiors…normally that would be grounds for punishment.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
047	We're very sorry, ma'am.
048	…Nevertheless, you did a fine job… Thank you.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
049	General…
050	Honestly, my soldiers wouldn't have been able to achieve the same results without your help. I offer my sincerest thanks.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
051	…You guys are really something! The Lord Commander directly praised you!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0023
052	You don't have to call me that.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
053	Well, even though we arrested them, it doesn't mean it's over.
054	That's right. Will you continue to extract information from them for me?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
055	Yes, ma'am! We'll get right on that.
056	Now at least one issue has been resolved.
057	Still…I'm surprised and heartened to think that they went to such lengths for Wadatsumi…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
058	I'm not surprised at all.
059	…I guess this is the part you tell me I need to look around more?
060	Nah… But you should probably appreciate the influence you have on those around you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
061	I-I understand! I understand my lack of power as well.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
062	That's not what I mean…
063	It's the opposite, actually.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
064	You should be aware that the people around you can change because of your actions.
065	My…actions?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
066	Actions are an expression of will. Sometimes they have the power to change people--even in unintended ways.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
067	If you act in accordance with your will, those around you are bound to be affected to some degree.
068	And that if that results in them helping you down the line…
069	Then you'll be able to handle things you were able to handle on your own. And the future will become that much brighter…	VO_basini.basini_sys_0002
070	It would do you good to have more faith in other people's potential.
071	My will can change…others? I never thought--
072	…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
073	Pardon me, but…
074	Oh! I remember you from earlier…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
075	I heard you and your men arrested the Greed Dike extremists.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0004
076	I came to propose we resume our meeting, provided the obstructionists have been removed.
077	R-Really!?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
078	Our wounds are still fresh and it won't be easy to trust the people who devastated our country. But you are very honorable.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0037
079	If someone like you is around, I feel like we can be more open to compromise.
080	…! Thank you...!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0033
081	…Who would've thought a greenhorn like me would be able to sway the minds of others.
082	As long as your actions merit such a change--	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
083	Right! I'll do my best!
084	That's the spirit!
085	(…Greed Dike will be fine from now on. I'm sure.)	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
086	(…Kanon…it seems there's someone as straightforward as you in this world)
087	Now, about the meeting…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
088	If I do my best and if I can influence those around me…then I'm sure we can change for the better!
089	You said it! I feel the same! Let's both do our best!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
090	I know Greed Dike is in good hands, Leafah.
091	That's right! Leave it to me!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
092	As a citizen of Greed Dike and as its general, it is my duty and pride to strive for this nation!
