001	...Lord!
002	...Captain Zeke!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
003	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
004	Well, I thought I'd report to you since you arrived in the village. You look quite tired.
005	No, I'm all right.
006	According to some of the Wratharis rebels that we captured in the plains, this is supposed to be their base of operation.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
007	I see.
008	It's Envylia's Blue Flame Guard! W-we have to get out of here! We're going to get slaughtered!
009	Oh no, is that Zeke the Blood Wolf?! This town is done for!
010	G-get away from here, Blood Wolf! You cruel abomination!
011	...
012	Captain Zeke...
013	Don't worry.<br>I have made mistakes in the past.
014	That must have been the Dawn of Wrath... right?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
015	Pursuing the remnant soldiers after defeating the Ice Snake in the plains, we had advanced further into their territory.
016	It looked like an overwhelming victory, I suppose.
017	Among the remaining Deadly Trio, General Caesar the Demon Flame was protecting the royal castle,
018	while General Vlad the Thunderer had been fighting the Holy Guard's special forces in several locations.
019	So after defeating Neville, the only ones standing against us were normal soldiers who hadn't even received proper training.
020	So...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
021	But I kept on violently advancing, using justice for the sake of world peace as an excuse.
022	I believed that as long as we had the power, we could stop the war. I believed that this power to stop the war was actual justice.
023	And with burning envy for this power, in desire for it, and eventually wielding it, I kept on advancing.
024	This Power had changed me, and I hadn't even noticed how I couldn't see clearly anymore.
025	Is that how the people of Wratharis started calling you...
026	Yes. “Blood Wolf” is the name of my past sins. I should accept it as a punishment.
027	...
028	I must be boring you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0036
029	Not at all...
030	Head to the village chief's house and interrogate him. But avoid violence if at all possible.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
031	It would normally be the proper thing to do this myself, but it would only cause more panic.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0041
032	Yes! I will go immediately!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
033	(Right, I must not forget about my past sins, and the tragedy I caused.)
034	Whoaaaa!
035	Out of the way, Blood Wolf Zeke!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0001
036	I cannot do that. I have come to punish you, under the decree of the Magna Code.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0010
037	We were framed! Framed by the Holy Guard, or rather... by Northern Pride's conspiracy!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0015
038	It's their goal to stop me! It's not actually yours, though you wouldn't understand!
039	Can't you see? Look at the fires set to the towns outside the castle!
040	They intend to slaughter even the innocent people!
041	...What is wrong about that?	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0016
042	Huh?!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0027
043	You were the ones who started this war.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
044	You planted the seeds, kept on fanning the flames, and plunged us into a conflict that cannot be undone!
045	How can you say that after falling off the right path and resorting to forbidden practices?!
046	But it's Northern Pride who cast the curse of those forbidden practices onto us! Why can't you see that?!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0022
047	The Magna Code, you say? The Holy Guard fighting for justice, you say? It's nothing more than a big deception!
048	Even if you were to win this battle, this war will never truly end!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0010
049	?!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0027
050	This world... it sways the power of Alchemia. It longs for this power.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0016
051	It's not that we longed for Alchemia, or for the Forbidden Arts. The world itself longs for it!
052	Seven Sins, seven Sacred Stones. My nation was framed by a conspiracy which plotted to destroy this equilibrium!
053	If it hadn't been my nation, it would have been another! The trigger to violate the taboo...
054	You people will realize it yourselves one day! The true intentions of Nimul!
055	We merely use Alchemy to fight for the reasons of our own justice, from our wish to protect and maintain our lands!
056	The quelling forces are operating for the sake of the Magna Code.
057	Whatever reason you may have had, it doesn't change the fact that you initiated hostilities while utilizing the Forbidden Arts.
058	Then let me ask you what you're planning to do with those powers you've obtained yourself!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0027
059	If I can use this power to end the bloodsheds, then I don't mind making sure to take the blame.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_chara_0021
060	I just have to get rid of the ones who have witnessed it.
061	Ghah! And after Wratharis has disappeared, you'll be left with a fake peace without any freedom, all in service of Northern Pride?!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0043
062	I'll repeat myself once more. It's my mission to end this war, and to create a foundation for peace.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0016
063	It will not end! You cannot put an end to the people's desire for freedom! That's why a new world order is necessary!	VO_caesar.caesar_battle_0016
064	That would be a path of bloodshed. Were you guys planning to contaminate this whole continent with violence?
065	Who are you to say that, while your hands are dripping with blood yourself?	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0013
066	That's still not a real argument!
067	Blossom! You should go to protect His Majesty. I will take care of this!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0001
068	Are you serious? But Caesar, if we fight together, even the Blood Wolf cannot...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0026
069	The Holy Guard has already infiltrated the castle!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0015
070	If His Majesty gets captured here, everything will have been in vain!
071	But...	VO_anastasia.anastasia_battle_0020
072	Just go, Anastasia! Go and protect His Majesty!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0017
073	...All right.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0037
074	Do you really think I'll let her go?
075	I'm pretty sure I'm your opponent here. Weren't you ordered to bring them my head?	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0015
076	But I just happen to be one of Wratharis' Deadly Trio.
077	So don't think you'll be able to get my head that easily!
078	I see, that's reasonable.	VO_zeke_young.zeke_sys_0010
079	I see. I understand now how Neville was defeated, even though he had the Philosopher's Stone.	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0028
080	Let's do this, Demon Flame! I'll have your head, and put an end to this Dawn of Wrath!	VO_zeke_young.zeke_battle_0015
