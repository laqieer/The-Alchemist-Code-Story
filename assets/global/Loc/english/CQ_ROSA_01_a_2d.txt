001	Hmm... I still have a long way to go.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
002	Do you have a minute?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0003
003	What is it?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1009
004	I heard that I could find the "ultimate blacksmith" around here.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
005	From your appearance...would that be you?
006	I'm the "ultimate blacksmith"? Did you believe the rumors? Are you an idiot?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1001
007	I see. I guess I was mistaken.
008	That being said, I'll be able to tell by examining the weapon you're holding. Can you lend it to me for a second?
009	Hmph. Do what you want.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
010	It looks like an ordinary sword...but...there are overlapping layers of iron. On top of that, it's skillfully built.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1002
011	Hmm. Not bad. Are you going to try and get away with just showing me this?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
012	I make no claim to being the "ultimate blacksmith."	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
013	Besides, what you're holding in your hand is far from anything that can be defined as "ultimate."
014	What do you mean? It doesn't seem that badly built.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0025
015	It's true that it cuts well. However, it lacks any semblance of a soul that latches onto its wielder.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0006
016	Do you know what I'm talking about?
017	A soul... Indeed, a soul...heheh. The primary emotion of destruction dwells within a weapon. I guess you could call that a soul.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1020
018	Heheh. I like the way you think.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0008
019	It isn't that this sword lacks a soul. It's still "dead." It hasn't been blessed with a worthy wielder yet.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
020	Oh?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0044
021	I'll awaken the soul of this sword. Watch.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0038
022	...?!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0027
023	(Th-the sword...broke...)	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0022
024	... ...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
025	Well...um...about this...	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_1047
026	Ah. Let's try to stay calm for now, shall we?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
027	...?!
028	He-hey...it's a hassle to dispose of defective weapons, right?	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_1028
029	That's why I broke it for you. In other words, you're allowed to thank me, you know?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
030	...Hey.
031	I-it's the soul. This sword didn't have a soul.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0018
032	Speaking of swords with souls, you're talking about enchanted ones that can kill gods and absorb the blood of demons, right? Try making something like that next...eh?
033	I see. In that case, hurry on home. I've got nothing like that here for you.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
034	Oh! He-hey, wait.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0025
035	What? Is there anything else you want?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1009
036	Although it may be broken, not many humans could forge a sword like this. Who are you?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
037	I am no one. Just a blacksmith.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
038	Stop feigning ignorance. There's no way a run-of-the-mill blacksmith could forge a blade so sharp.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0003
039	What would a little wench like you know about anything? Haven't you done enough damage by breaking my sword?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0012
040	Are you trying to imply that my observation is flawed?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0010
041	Isn't it? It's hard to believe anyone wielding a weapon in such flashy outfit has a good eye for anything.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
042	My appearance has nothing to do with this! Also, don't make fun of my holy garments!	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_1028
043	Holy garments...?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0025
044	This garment has been dyed with the bloody tears of a fallen angel. This is the holy garment promised to me that I alone am allowed to wear.
045	What the...? And who promised them to you?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0029
046	A god.	VO_rosa.rosa_chara_1020
047	I see. You should get checked by a doctor as soon as possible. Good luck.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
048	Wait. Don't you understand the sublimity of these holy garments?	VO_rosa.rosa_battle_0020
049	No, nor do I want to. Both weapons and armor are tools to be used on the battlefield.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
050	Only an idiot or someone with too much time on their hands would lavish so much time on a battle tool.
051	Wh-what did you say?!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0026
052	I-I won't forgive you. You're the one who got all high-and-mighty about a soul!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0018
053	How dare you make fun of me. I'll send you to the underworld where you can mull over what's happened here!
