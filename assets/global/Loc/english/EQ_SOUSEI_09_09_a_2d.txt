001	My friend, Mesarthim of the Silver Shield, we have come to the end of our journey together.
002	So you truly intend to go, then, Melvillei?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
003	Yes. That name has already lost all of its relevance in this world. I am known in this era as the Cursed Beast Leviathan.
004	The is the end of the road for us. We are but dragons who dared to face a god, and have since chosen humans to bear the torch of this world in our stead.
005	And so we are left to scrabble as best as we can in this inhospitable world. I have no right to take any joy in the face of such a solemn, painful decision.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
006	Must you always be so dour? You'll make the rest of your journey uncomfortable if you're so determined to live on in such a manner.
007	...?
008	You seem not to even fully understand your own nature.
009	But it is of no consequence. I shall now be subsumed into the great ocean, wallowing in the farthest depths of the seeping cauldron that bears the sin destined to consume this world whole.
010	I shall accept it all, for the sake of the gentle hearts who stand to suffer under the crushing weight of Envy.
011	I...
012	As one born of the land of Envy, I raised my sword to her—to Ouroboros. I believed, at the time, that I was making the right decision.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
013	That is why I cannot accept what Ophioneus and the others have suggested. I chose who I would serve, and I will not choose now to betray that service.
014	Of course, I'll be long dead by the time their plan comes to fruition, so it matters not how I feel, in the end.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
015	Yes. Do as you feel is right.
016	The age of the dragons has passed. It is time for the age of humans to begin in earnest.
017	Melvillei...
018	That was... I see. The memories of the dragon.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
019	The magil remembers it all: the ebbing sands of the age of dragons, and the flowing tide of human history.
020	It's no wonder you can't forget, Bianca.
021	...
022	You don't have the strength to control me. As I see it, you barely have the strength to hold onto your current form.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
023	We...failed.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
024	That's why I was determined to make sure we did not fail again. This time... This time things were supposed to go differently!
025	I understand where you're coming from. Regret is not an easy thing to shake.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
026	But when working on behalf of others, it's of paramount importance to ensure your goals are aligned with theirs. Otherwise, you're only going to get in the way.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
027	...
028	Next time, try to find some true common ground with the side you've elected to help. I think you might see some different results.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
029	I suppose this is goodbye.
030	But do take some solace in knowing that even if you die here, you won't disappear. You'll simply awake in another part of the world, having lost something you can't quite put your finger on.
031	As long as Ouroboros exists, so too will you.
032	Indeed. Goodbye, Nimul.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
033	I gave up too much of myself this time around. Next time, I suspect I'll awake as a lesser being.
034	Don't worry. I have every intention of changing this world.
035	I won't let it stay the way it is. This world cannot continue to make the weak suffer and the kind weep.
036	Yes. It must change. I pray for your success, Nimul.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0011
037	I failed. I was mistaken in thinking I could defeat Ouroboros with strength alone.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0016
038	In order to defeat Ouroboros before, that woman had to destroy the entire Dragon Realm.
039	The Dragon Realm... A world left behind by the dragons, which one can change to suit their will based upon the rules that govern one's own life.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
040	That is at the heart of who Ouroboros is. Her essence is imitation. All she sees is turned to memory, and once that happens, she is granted the ability to manipulate it however she wishes.
041	That's why there's only one recourse against such an opponent.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0003
042	I know.
043	In order to defeat Ouroboros, I must keep moving forward. However, I cannot do it alone. I need my allies with me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
044	And she's also much too powerful for me as I stand now. I cannot win by taking her on face-to-face.
045	I need a surprise attack—one that undermines the very Truth that defines her.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
046	The power of Ouroboros that Bianca held...is now in my possession.
047	The memories of the dragons are here, too. So it shouldn't be much longer...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
048	...before the Dragon Realm comes to me. That which defines the Truth of the world.
049	I just need to be able to make it reappear with Alchemy.
050	I will make the world anew. I will carve out a world for humans—one only I can make!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0038
051	...Huh?
052	So you're awake, Nimul.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0001
053	Waginau...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
054	Yes.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
055	Ah... So you, too...
056	Wait, no, there's no time for explanations right now. Waginau, I need you to lend me your strength.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
057	Of course.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
058	Nnf...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
059	I'm... Uh... What am I...?
060	Oh, right. The airship went down, and...
061	Aw, man... That's my life's work right there.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
062	Ngh... My body... I can't move...
063	I'm sorry... I want to fix the airship so much, but...I'm so...tired...
064	Adaleigh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
065	Nng... Em...mel?
066	You're hurt, badly! Eulalia, if you'd please!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
067	Right away.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
068	Huh? This is strange. Someone has already performed basic healing on him. I believe it's...Alchemy? Nimul?!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
069	Grkkk, owwwwwwwww!
070	I'm sorry. You'll just need to grit your teeth. It'll only be a moment yet.
071	Emmel, what are you doing here?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
072	Um, it's a long story. I've been following Nimul's trail, trying to get to that tower.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
073	Right. The one that just popped up out of nowhere.
074	And on my way there, I saw the airship go down right next to it.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
075	Ah! That's right! Nimul and the others, they were—!
076	Hold still, Adaleigh! Stop squirming!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0012
077	What was that about Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
078	We saw him fall from the sky, so we went and picked him up with the airship.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
079	But right as we did, something attacked us from above.
080	...
081	Right now, getting you healed is the top priority. Nimul will be fine. There's no way something like that would kill him.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
082	Quence is taking a look at the airship right now. So you just relax for the moment, all right?
083	Oka—Wait, Quence?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
084	I told you to stop squirming!
085	Hey. You alive?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
086	Regrettably, yes.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
087	Don't get up. You're no good to anyone like that anyway, so you might as well just keep on lying there. Can't even fight if you wanted to.
088	If you're here, then I assume Emmel is safe?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
089	You're assuming a lot. Last time we met, I was your enemy, remember?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
090	Ha. Of all those in the Infinite Serpent, you're the easiest to figure out. Or maybe it'd be more accurate to say, you've got the least to hide.
091	Hmph. Whatever you say.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
092	So what happened to Nimul? And what's with this magil I'm sensing? Don't recognize it at all.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
093	That must be Waginau. He—they—went on ahead.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
094	What?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0025
095	Interesting. It may have taken a group of you to keep up with me, but the fact is, you are keeping up with me. I'm quite impressed.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
096	...
097	Okay! We're pushing hard now! If we can hold this, I feel like it'll all work out!
098	Yes, if we can just level the playing field, then... Hmm? Andechs?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
099	Why are you even fighting us?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
100	Huh?
101	We've crossed swords several times now. I recognize the press of conviction behind your blade. You're fighting to protect something.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
102	And it's not the god of this world.
103	So what is it? What guides your blade?
104	Do you know the very essence of the humans that live in this world? It's sin.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0002
105	Whether they accept or reject it, that is the reality. It's at the root of everything we do.
106	We of the land of Envy believe in our righteousness because we are determined to deny the Envy that burns in our hearts.
107	What does that really mean, though?
108	The world as it is now is the culmination of all the sin that has been accumulated throughout history. So if you truly wish to change this world...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
109	Is it not best to take down she who cannot let go of the past?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
110	Do you mean to say that you're just...testing our conviction?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
111	Sure sounds that way to me.
112	Truthfully, you've already proven yourselves to be more capable than I'd expected. I had low hopes for the warriors of this age, and you've quite handily surpassed those.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
113	In fact, it's almost to the point that perhaps I might need a little help, myself.
114	I think I might just call upon an old friend.
115	Watch out! She's up to something!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
116	Nnf...
117	"My shield shall be my fangs, and my fortress a hammer to crush my foes. Friend, I call upon you to protect my being!"	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0001
118	Leviathan?!
119	Worry not. This is not the Cursed Dragon in the flesh, but a simulacrum made of magil. Nothing more than a mere phantom.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
120	That said...
121	Grrrrrroooooaaar!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0002
122	Gnngh... "Silver Shield!"	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0004
123	It's not as powerful as the real Leviathan, but...!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
124	(I've used too much magil. If this continues, I won't be able to hold the line for much longer!)
125	That shield...
126	You inherited what was once mine, but have surpassed me in the art of actually protecting others with it.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
127	How delightful it is to see my kin continuing to defy Envy, even after all this time!
128	Nnf... Gnngh...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
129	Daphne!
130	I can't...keep the shield up... Forget about me! Just—	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0036
131	I could never!
132	You open yourself up to attack when you attempt to save those who no longer have the right to stand on the battlefield.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
133	You may resent me for this to your heart's content, of course. I don't mind one bit. That is the right of the defeated.
134	Grr...!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
135	Nngh... Melvillei!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0042
136	Grooooooarrrgghhh!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
137	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
138	Th-that technique...!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
139	Nimul!
140	...
141	So. The challenger of gods shows his face.
142	Andechs. Daphne.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
143	We're ready.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
144	Nimul, you're all right!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
145	Mira. Nyx.
146	On it!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
147	Welcome back, Nimul.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
148	Thanks. I'll explain everything later.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
149	Right now, our priority is to win this fight. Lend me your strength, everyone.
150	Let's do this!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
