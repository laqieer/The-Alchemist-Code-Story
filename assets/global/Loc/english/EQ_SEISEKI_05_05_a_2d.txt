001	Tsk! From the way he appeared...I can't believe that Zain really... Why, Zain?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
002	!!!
003	Captain Kudan...what are you doing during an inefficient time like this...there's a limit to how inefficient you can be.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0016
004	Seida!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
005	I don't understand it. At a time like this... Do you understand what is going on?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
006	I'd ask you the same. Why do you swallow everything that Zain says?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
007	Don't you want to confirm the truth for yourself?!
008	Teacher, this guy really doesn't have an ear to listen.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0029
009	Was Waginau the one who fed you these ideas?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
010	...!
011	I knew it! Why...?! You promised me that day!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
012	You said that you would open your eyes...that you wouldn't let their sweet words sway you!
013	Then let me ask you this...can you believe Zain's words?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
014	Zain's words? Of course, I can.
015	Why are you so sure?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
016	He has no doubt in his words...do you know how dangerous that is?
017	Teacher, no...you can't get through to this guy.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0020
018	What exactly happened to you, Captain Kudan?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
019	Agh! I don't have time for this! Kagura is in danger even now.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
020	No...I won't let you go.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
021	Seida...enough!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0015
022	...!
023	This is an emergency situation, where the world's existence hangs in the balance. Captain Kudan...I've come to stop you.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0030
024	I've come to stop you too, of course!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0007
025	Ack! I won't be held responsible if something were to happen to you!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
026	Mistress! Please wake up, mistress!
027	No...nooo...
028	Mistress! What a relief!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
029	Suzuka? Huh...where are we?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
030	That's right, I...! Where's Captain Yauras?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
031	No sign of her, by the time I came around I...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
032	That's right...!
033	Mistress, what are you doing?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
034	What do you mean? Somebody knocked me out. They hit me on the back of my head.
035	No...mistress, you were sleeping on your own...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
036	Seriously! Don't act like I was just taking a nap or something!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0011
037	Somebody hit me from behind. I wonder who it was?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
038	I don't know! In any case, we need to stop Captain Kudan! Let's hurry!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
039	Whatever you say, mistress.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0038
040	Seriously! Didn't I tell you to call me Kanon?!
041	Kanon... The Paladin that went to rescue Chihaya with Kudanstein...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
042	I don't know what someone that insignificant can accomplish, but I'll need to make sure.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
