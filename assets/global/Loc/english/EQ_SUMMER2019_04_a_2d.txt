001	An...octopus?
002	Yeah! Apparently, there's a giant octopus living in some ruins in this area.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
003	I also heard that the ruins are full of treasure! That's what I was talking about, not that Demon or whatever.
004	I see.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
005	This ancient site is where the archaic doctrine summoned and later sealed a Demon. That much I'm certain.
006	This is the first time I am hearing about an octopus, however.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
007	What are you doing here, Kaya?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
008	I heard about the giant monster attacking beachgoers and immediately recalled the legend pertaining to these forgotten ruins.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
009	Naturally, that was all the more reason for me to come here and see what I could do about it.
010	I am well-versed in the lore of this site, so I was confident that I could deal with whatever I might encounter here.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
011	Not to mention that I personally find these ruins fascinating.
012	All right! Sounds to me like we came here with the same idea, Kaya!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
013	Hm? What exactly do you mean?
014	Well, you were thinking of taking down that monster yourself, right?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
015	Not exactly.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0011
016	Huh?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
017	The only reason I was confident in acting alone was because I knew that I could entrust the beach patrol to my two colleagues in my absence.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
018	Do you possess a different perspective?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
019	Well, I...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
020	I'm the captain! I've gotta be the one to protect my crew!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
021	Especially Su Yi... She has a real hard time expressing herself, you know? Leave her alone for too long and all those suppressed words end up building up.
022	That's why I thought I'd go on ahead and take care of things. I have to make sure they're safe!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
023	Interesting. You are most kind. I wonder, though, if your course of action was entirely necessary...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0045
024	Huh? What're you talking about?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
025	If you will allow me a metaphor... A child who falls and scrapes their knee will not cry if there is an adult present to help them to their feet.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
026	However, should they have no hand to grasp, they will likely begin to form some measure of independence.
027	Well...
028	I...
029	Oh, my apologies. That was rather forward of me. I really shouldn't have said anything, given how little I know of your situation.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0036
030	I am not really qualified to be giving advice on such matters.
031	No, no! What you said made total sense.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0027
032	I'm just...scared. She's a real fighter, you know?
033	She ends up overthinking and pushing herself too far. I don't want something like that to happen again.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0020
034	Su Yi! Are you okay?!
035	She has a fever... She has pushed herself too far. Her illness may be cured, but her stamina is still quite low.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
036	We have no choice but to stop over at the next port.
037	No... We're so close... After all that research...finding the best possible route...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0022
038	So what?! None of that matters now!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0012
039	Ah!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0027
040	I'm s-so sorry...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
041	This isn't the end, okay? Don't worry. We can set sail again. In fact, our voyage has only just begun!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
042	We're just taking a little break. Okay?
043	...
044	...
045	What've you got there, Su Yi? Are these maps? Nautical charts? There are so many of them!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
046	These show the area around this island, right? Why do you have so many?
047	U-um...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
048	I-I'm collecting them. I like looking at maps and nautical charts. Seeing how they, um, change over time.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
049	When I found out that we were coming here, I...sort of thought I should do some research beforehand.
050	Really? That's so cool! You're a real navigator!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0045
051	N-no! It's not cool at all!
052	Huh? What's wrong?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
053	I-I'm...sorry.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
054	It's fine. It's nothing...
055	It doesn't look like nothing to me! You can't fool me. I was an instructor once, you know.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
056	I-instructor?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
057	I mean, okay, I wasn't all that good at it. But Sharon did say she was glad that I was the one who trained her!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
058	Hearing that, I decided to be more confident in myself.
059	...
060	You should be more confident in yourself, Su Yi! You're the navigator for the Xiao Shenmei—that's pretty darn amazing if you ask me!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0003
061	It...really isn't.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
062	(Shenmei doesn't see me as a real crew member. She still thinks I'm just a kid.)
063	(That's why I want to do this alone.)
064	...
065	Shenmei?
066	...
067	Hey! What's this X mark on the map for?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
068	U-um, well...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
069	I heard that there were ancient ruins in this area and found out what I could about them.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
070	By comparing various sources of information, I pinpointed this spot as their possible location.
071	Ruins? I haven't heard anything about any ruins.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
072	The ruins of an ancient cult... They're currently occupied by a giant octopus.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
073	I didn't find anything resembling an entrance in that area, though.
074	What are the two of you doing out here?
075	Sharon! How'd it go? Did you find any clues?
076	Not a single one. Perhaps they've wandered into the octopuses' lair?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
077	...
078	Hmm...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
079	Hey, Su Yi? Think you could show us whereabouts you got separated from Shenmei?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
080	H-huh? Umm...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
081	It was around...here. B-Bertha...?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
082	I knew it. X marks the spot... In I go!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0044
083	W-wait! What are you doing, Bertha?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
084	Look! You can get in through this gap in the rock!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
085	Huh? R-really?!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
086	It's pretty hard to notice...but I'm sure Shenmei must have got in through here!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
087	Difficult to notice indeed... How did you find this little opening, Bertha?
088	Hee hee hee... I'm not a gunner of the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment for nothing!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0023
089	It takes a sharp pair of eyes to be able to scan the battlefield and fire on the optimal spot!
090	True enough.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0045
091	I'm not sure why she would have gone in alone, but...maybe she saw the hole and thought it seemed like a fun place to explore?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
092	Bertha... Don't you think you ought to be a bit more respectful? That's her captain you're talking about.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
093	I didn't mean anything by it! I'm sure she had her reasons!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
094	I bet she went on ahead...to keep me from worrying.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
095	But now you're worried, right?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
096	Yes.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
097	Then you've gotta tell them! Tell those two worrywarts how you feel.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
098	I suppose I am one of those worrywarts?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0001
099	Liu Shen...
100	I understand. Thank you for filling me in.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
101	If these are the only ruins in this area, then it stands to reason that Xiao-Xiao must have wandered in here.
102	Knowing Xiao-Xiao, she must have caught sight of something suspicious and thoughtlessly followed them here.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
103	Our captain has a tendency to attempt to take on everything by herself, you see.
104	Shenmei...
105	However, this location is also known to be the lair of some ferocious octopuses. Su Yi, you wait here.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
106	No.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0017
107	What?
108	I'm going to go and look for Shenmei with you! I-I'm worried as well.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
109	Besides...I'm the one who found this entrance!
110	I'm a pirate too! I can take on a horde of ferocious octopuses any day of the week!
111	Cause I'm... I'm the navigator for the Xiao Shenmei!
112	...
113	Well...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0030
114	U-um...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
115	Take us through the shortest possible route. It doesn't matter how dangerous it is. I will take care of anything that stands in our path.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0041
116	We need to find Xiao-Xiao before nightfall. Searching for her in the dark would be much more difficult and dangerous.
117	U-um... R-really?!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
118	What? You are a superb navigator, Xiao-Xiao. I trust you.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
119	Okay! Leave it to me.
120	Whoo! So proud of you, Su Yi! Let's do this!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
121	Is this really all right? You were so worried about her...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
122	I still am. So worried I feel like my heart might give out.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
123	Please don't die.
124	However...I realize now that our worries have been burdening her.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
125	She does seem quite happy to be leading us.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
126	She does... You know, I never thought I'd see the day that Xiao-Xiao would speak her mind to me without hesitation.
127	It just goes to show that there is still room for growth, even after becoming a Phantom Soldier.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0008
128	Whoa! Look at them all!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
129	You know what? I'm feeling rather generous. I'm only going to marinade you for thirty seconds before I put you on the grill!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
