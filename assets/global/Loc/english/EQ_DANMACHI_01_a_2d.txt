001	Wha—?!
002	Wh-where am I?	VO_bell.bell_battle_0019
003	Bell Cranel. This is the Door of Truth. And I am Ouroboros, the observer of destiny.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
004	You're the what, now? Wait... How do you know my name?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
005	That is of no consequence. All that matters is what you are to do here.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0016
006	Is that not how a hero's tale unfolds?
007	A hero's...? Wait, hold on. Where even is this? I was in the middle of the dungeon until just a moment ago!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
008	And now you are not. Something has caused your world to become entangled with this one.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0039
009	So you're saying this is a completely different world?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
010	That is correct.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0038
011	I guess I've been transported to the realm of the gods, then...
012	I know not the circumstances of your world; only that two worlds which are supposed to be separate have become intertwined.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0002
013	And when this occurred, a threat from your world drifted into ours.
014	A...threat?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
015	What you call monsters. One of them is here absorbing Alchemia, steadily growing in strength to become an even more powerful being.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0031
016	Its presence here damages the barrier between our two worlds, which could have a grave impact on both.
017	Thus have I summoned you here to extinguish this threat.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0001
018	So let me get this straight: a monster from the dungeon jumped into your world, and it's causing big trouble for the people here...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0030
019	And that trouble could spread back to our world as well?
020	Got it. If you think I'm up to the task, then I'll gladly lend a hand.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0037
021	Excellent.
022	So, what are we waiting for? Let's go take down that threat together!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
023	I am but an observer; I do not intervene.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0039
024	Wait. You're not going to help me fight? Come to think of it, this place does have a pretty ominous air to it...
025	Just what are you, exactly?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
026	That, too, is of no consequence.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0016
027	But though I cannot join you, I have prepared guides who can—ones who are familiar with Wratharis, where the threat has appeared.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0003
028	In addition, I've summoned further help from your world as well.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0004
029	What?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
030	Now, go forth, Bell Cranel! I look forward to what you will accomplish on your quest.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
031	Hold on! What do mean by further help from my world?
032	Who else did you bring here?!
033	Is this really a whole other world? This...Wratharis, was it? What kind of land is it?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
034	Aaagh!
035	Whoa! Careful, there!	VO_kevin.kevin_battle_0001
036	Good; looks like you're unharmed.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
037	Hmph. Underwhelming, is more like it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
038	Who are you two?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
039	We'll talk later. Right now, there are beasts to slay!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
