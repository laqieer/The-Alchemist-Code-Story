001	Those Alkaroids also headed for the beach, it seems. The other Alkaroids probably have the same goal.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
002	Someone is commanding them to do this. But why?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
003	...
004	There's no point in scratching our heads and thinking about this here! We must act first!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
005	Yeah...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
006	Noah? What are you doing?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
007	Darn. These Alkaroids don't have Albea's comb either...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
008	You were concerned about it for me?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0001
009	That comb is special to you, right? Then we have to get it back.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
010	That's not true. It's a regular comb you could buy anywhere.
011	That may be true, but what's important about it is how you feel about it.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
012	Like the silver spoon I always have.
013	Your silver spoon? What is that?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
014	Oh, I don't have it now. Emma is carrying it for me.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
015	Polishing a silver spoon calms me down. So whenever I get annoyed, Emma always casually hands it to me.
016	Then Pamela made it cuter by putting some decorations on it.
017	It was just a regular item you can buy at any store, but now it's a special item filled with our memories together.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
018	...
019	That's why even if it's nothing special to someone else, it's something precious to you.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
020	I see. You all really are close! The two of them should've been on this team with you.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
021	Yeah, but... I've been feeling a bit spoiled by them.
022	In the back of my head I would always think that even if I get mad, Emma will be there. That's not good!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
023	That's why this time I wanted to be on another team where I can't lean on the two of them. I want to become a more pulled together me for them!
024	Wonderful... That's wonderful of you, Noah!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0044
025	N-no, it's not. I mean, it's not going well, after all.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
026	I still get mad quickly and then you come in and help me. It's not going as I hoped.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
027	That's why I'm not wonderful or anything at all.
028	No, you are wonderful. Taking that first step is important.
029	Besides, there was a time when I too trained hard to become strong enough to protect another.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
030	You too, Suzuka?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
031	If you keep that person's face in mind as you train, you'll put more into your training than you would have by just training by yourself.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0007
032	I believe that when you intentionally try to become stronger for someone, that is when you will grow.
033	So if you strongly wish to grow for your friends, I'm sure that you will.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
034	Suzuka!
035	For someone else, huh?
036	(I became a mechanic because I like machines.)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
037	(I took up my father's mantle and became repair shop Magbea's proprietor.)
038	(I decided that I had to keep a place for my brother to return to.)
039	(I've done nothing but chase after my brother. It's all for my brother...)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
069	Albea, something came for you too.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0008
070	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
040	Oh...
041	Wow! A single rose and a beautiful comb! That's so cool! Well done!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
042	(A comb... How...did...? Only my mother should've known that I used...a white buffalo comb...)	VO_albell.albell_sys_0021
043	Could it have been...my brother?
044	...
045	Hey, Albea. It's just like Noah said, isn't it? That comb is very important to you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
046	It really is. It's a comb that you can buy anywhere, but my brother gave it to me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
047	...
048	What's the matter?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
049	So it is super important! Why didn't you say so earlier?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
050	I had no idea it was that precious! I would have looked harder if I knew that!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0036
051	Right?! We have to find something that important! Does it have any special characteristics?!
052	Umm... In dark places like this cave...if it gets hit with light, it'll give off a white glow.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
053	I see... In that case, it'll be easier to find if it's in here.
054	Yes, but the octopuses are carrying things out of the cave right now.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
055	Albea's comb might be mixed in with all the garbage outside. Let's search there later.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
056	Yeah... Let's deal with the Alkaroid problem and then take our time searching for it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
057	It glows white, huh? ...Hm?
058	The octopuses are gathering... That looks gross...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0029
059	There! Look!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
060	Are those...pirates? Why are they here? And why are the Alkaroids...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
061	Weird... They're not collecting materials at all. I thought that if I left it to Slothstein's machines, they'd gather it quickly.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
062	When we picked them from the wreck, I was sure we'd scored something great. But the things they're picking up are terrible.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
063	It actually feels like we're losing more than we gain.
064	Well, we'll have them search the beach a little longer.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
065	So they're the ones sending the Alkaroids to the beach!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
066	Grrahck!	VO_aj2000.aj2000_battle_0021
067	Hm? They're acting a little weird... Hey, oi! What are you doing?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
068	Heads up!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
