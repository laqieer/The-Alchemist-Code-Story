001	Leak more information?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0026
002	Yeah. We'll make more security breaches and prepare an escape route.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0004
003	In other words, we'll bait them by using more tantalizing material, and, once they bite, we'll have them all in the net.
004	After acting so boldly, even the spy scum won't think they can stay in Slothstein any longer.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
005	They'll try to escape. In order to do so, they'll want more souvenirs...that's usually the way these things go.
006	In that case, we'll use vulnerable information as bait to fish out the traitor. If we can take down the people who are backing them as well...
007	Don't you think that's really risky?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0029
008	It's one hundred times better than letting them run off with top secret information.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
009	Well then, what's your choice? If you want to back down, now is your chance.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
010	It's good that your plan worked out and all, but...aren't there a little more of them than there's supposed to be?!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
011	Stop complaining! My ammunition is limited as well!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_1019
012	Hah. I'll give them credit for their surprise attack, but there are only two of them!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
013	Ack...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0019
014	We'll crush them out by sheer numbers!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
015	Tsk! Now I'm thinking we should've—	VO_megistus.megistus_battle_0019
016	Yep. You should've just asked for my help from the start.	VO_amis.amis_event_1014
017	Huh?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0005
018	Aghhhh?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0028
019	Amis, you...	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0025
020	Save the detailed explanation for later. Right now, focus on assisting the ally troops.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0040
021	What? Ally troops?	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
022	Agh, what's this?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
023	Huh? Why...?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0025
024	Didn't I tell you that it's dangerous to travel abroad alone?!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0012
025	The Scarlet Flame Guard?! Impossible. Their alliance with Slothstein aside, they know what will happen if they cross borderlines unauthorized!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
026	While undergoing joint military training with Slothstein, we, from the Scarlet Flame Guard, learned of the danger that our fellow knight was in and merely responded to the circumstances!
027	Our actions are in no way unauthorized!
028	I see, so that's what Amis did...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0045
029	Vice-Captain, your orders.
030	Before us are enemies of Slothstein whom are our allies. Thus, they are enemies of Envylia.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1018
031	Therefore, there is only one action we can take!
032	Knights, after me!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_battle_0015
033	Huzzzaaahhh!
034	I see. The 'fastest knight in history'...huh? With how little she turns back, it's no wonder she's so fast.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
035	Amis, I'm sorry but help us out. We'll need a little more ammo to cover her.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0003
036	All right. I'll prepare it right away.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0038
037	Onward, D'Artagnan! My baby girls and I will cover your path ahead!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
038	No...no... How could this happen?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
039	Nooooo!!!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0019
040	Grrrrrhhh!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
