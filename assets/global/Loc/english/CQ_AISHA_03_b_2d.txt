001	Haahhh!
002	Aghhh!
003	Whoa! Nice!
004	Ngh! What the hell?! She's no ordinary card dealer!
005	You guys didn't do your homework. That's some shoddy thief-work you're doing.
006	What did you say?!
007	You're lecturing them? So you think you can do better?
008	Well, first of all, I wouldn't rob this place while you were still here.
009	Just who do you think you—
010	W-wait... You're Chat Noir!
011	Did you just figure this out? You're not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?
012	Shut up! Why are you getting in our way?! What, did you have your eyes on this place first or something?
013	Not really imaginative either, I see. No wonder you're so bad at being a thief.
014	Just what are you trying to say?!
015	I'm saying don't even think about sorting me in with you lot.
016	You think you're artistic?
017	I guess I could let Justin take care of this one.
018	He's probably feeling down about letting me slip away again. This should cheer him up a bit.
019	He could use a little bump of self-esteem.
020	I would think he'd be even more upset with you.
021	Can I ask you a question? Earlier you mentioned being artistic. What did you mean by that?
022	Hmm, well... I don't go around stealing any old thing.
023	What I'm hunting is the truth. I only steal antiques and works of art closely related to the history of Babel.
024	I'm not interested in stealing things for the sake of monetary value. That's the art of my thievery.
025	The history of Babel? What is it about the past that you're so interested in?
026	There's no way to change the result of a cast die. What's the point?
027	The present is spawned from the past, yet the truth about the past is locked securely away.
028	For example, undiscovered ruins may contain unexplained powers. Powers much like your own.
029	What?
030	Doesn't that make you curious? That's why I want to know.
031	W-well...
032	You think it's a stupid dream, don't you?
033	A little. It's a very extraordinary, preposterous dream.
034	(But I suppose it's this dream that makes Chat Noir shine so brightly.)
035	(He's having the time of his life, honestly going after what he wants...much like a child would.)
036	(I wonder if I'll ever have a dream of my own.)
037	(Even if I don't, maybe if I stick with him...)
038	Aisha, would you like to be my accomplice?
039	What? Why?
040	You didn't laugh at my dream. In fact, you seemed to enjoy hearing about it.
041	Huh?!
042	Your eyes were like that of a wishful damsel. I think we have a lot in common. You'd make a great partner for me.
043	Wh-what?! D-d-damsel?!
044	I guess your special sight doesn't work on yourself? Your eyes were glittering the same way they did when you were talking about that die.
045	Besides, when I uncover the truth of the ancients, we might find out more about that power of yours.
046	I...
047	Well, I won't force you to do anything you don't want to do.
048	Hold on a second! Let me do just this one thing...
049	(Ten pips total... "Now is the time." Hehe! That's a good omen if I ever saw one.)
050	Chat Noir, I'd be happy to see that dream through with you.
051	Wonderful! I think we're going to get along just fine!
052	So, now that we are partners... Will you do me one favor?
053	A favor?
054	I want you to steal the oldest set of dice in the world for me.
055	What? No. That sounds stupid.
056	Stupid?! Why?!
057	That has nothing to do with the ancient history of Babel! It goes against my modus operandi.
058	Are you serious?! Cheapskate!
