001	Gaaahh!
002	And fire!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0014
003	Hyaaaaaah!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0032
004	(It’s so easy to swing... It does exactly what I want it to. It’s like the weapon is an extension of my body!)
005	(It really was too heavy... The expectations turned into pressure...just like she said.)
006	(Oh, I see...)
007	(I was saved by her words. By her sounds... All I could think about was moving forward, but she taught me something all the same.)
008	(I’m not fighting alone. There’s someone by my side! This is probably the path Nina walked...)
009	(I’ve accepted my own weakness... I’m going to begin fighting for myself. So I can become the best me I can!)
010	I...will walk down my own path! This sword is proof of that decision!	VO_sharon.sharon_battle_0007
011	...Phew.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
012	...That signal cannon shot and my resolve really motivated me...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
013	“Sounds” are incredible... You were right.
014	Sharon!
015	Whoa! P-please don’t jump out at me like that!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0026
016	Ahahahaha! Your face is so red! Cute!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
017	Please stop! ...I’ve completed my mission.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0015
018	Thank you. I was able to find my resolve because of you.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0034
019	...I should be the one saying that. Thank you so much.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0034
020	Yeah. You’re definitely at your cutest when you’re being honest!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0004
021	C-cute?! I’m not...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
022	I’m glad you’re safe, Little Sharon.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0007
023	Sorry about earlier... I said horrible things to you...but you still worried about me anyway?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
024	Because there was once someone who worked towards a future where humans and therians could help one another and laugh together...	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0004
025	We should be able to understand each other one day, too!
026	...That was Nina!	VO_sharon.sharon_chara_1011
027	I guess I’m not the only one who respects Nina and aspires to be like her.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
028	That’s right! We both look up to Nina. So let’s be friends!	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0004
029	...Thank you.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0034
030	All right, let’s head back! Time to fire the “we’re home” shot!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
031	Thank you for your guidance...Instructor Bertha.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
032	Huh? Sorry, I couldn’t hear you over the sound of the signal gun.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
033	...It was nothing.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
034	What? Sorry, sorry. Say it again! Please?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
035	...It’s a nice sound, isn’t it? The signal shot of victory. It doesn’t hurt my ears at all.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
036	What?! Sharon couldn’t join the Scarlet Flame Guard?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
037	Is it because she attacked the Wratharis army on her own?! Ahhh, I should’ve stopped her!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0018
038	Calm down. It’s not that she “couldn’t join,” she just “didn’t join.”
039	Huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
040	...Of course, the decision she made wasn’t exactly praiseworthy. However, she got the drop on the Wratharis army and created an opportunity for us to defeat them.
041	...You could say that her value increased even more after this incident.
042	You gave her that sword, right?
043	That’s right. That other one was still too heavy for her.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
044	She’s just like you. Heh, you’re a pretty good instructor now. You were able to overcome it.
045	Yes, probably... So where did Sharon end up?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0037
046	Both the Scarlet Flame Guard and Blue Flame Guard wanted her to enlist with them... However, because of Sharon’s strong wishes, she was assigned to...
047	The Royal Knighthood.
048	What?! She’s going to join us...instead of going to the Scarlet Flame or Blue Flame?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
049	I have to go ask her about this! Please excuse me!
050	Sharon! ...Good, there you are.
051	What’s wrong, Instructor Bertha?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0005
052	I’m not your instructor anymore... I’m not sure I was able to teach you anything, either...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
053	Teaching others is not really my thing...
054	What are you saying?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
055	Huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
056	I learned many things from you. So...
057	...I’m glad you were my instructor.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
058	Sharon!
059	Oh, but...I came to ask about your assignment. Are you really okay with that?	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
060	Oh, that. Regardless of which knighthood I join, they all share the same goal of protecting Envylia.
061	So since that’s the case, I...wanted to fight by your side.
062	B-by my side?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
063	Yes, I believe I still have many things to learn from you.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
064	...I’m greatly indebted to you. I want to pay you back little by little.
065	Also, I thought I’d have more opportunities to interact with the Envylia Orchestral Band if I was a member of the Royal Knighthood.
066	But...what about your aspirations?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
067	They haven’t changed. But, I learned that going my own way doesn’t mean I’m going against my aspirations.
068	I want to walk my own path. Your signal shot gave me a shove in the right direction.
069	...I’m happy to hear you say that, but... Hmm.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
070	...No, I’m happy! I can fire an “we’re home” shot for you again!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
071	I’m happy too, of course.
072	Oh, your sound... Heheh, what good timing.	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
073	This “sound” is the sound that supported you, right? It’s a nice sound.
074	...Yes.
075	The parade has started.
076	Ahhhh! Oh no! I forgot they’re debuting the new song! Patty will be so angry!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
077	The new song... Can I come hear it later?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0046
078	Yes! Of course you can! All right, see you later!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0009
079	Part of protecting the country is protecting “sounds” as well as people... That’s the duty of Envylia’s knights.
080	That’s why I want to keep swinging this sword. I will surpass the person I admire while walking down my own path.
081	I look forward to working with you...Instructor Bertha.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
