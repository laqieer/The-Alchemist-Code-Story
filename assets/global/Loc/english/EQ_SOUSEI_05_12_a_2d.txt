001	Alert! They've breached the castle! We don't know where these corrupted Ira Knights are coming from, but—!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
002	Your Highness, that's...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
003	I was waiting for them to show up.
004	What should we do, Your Highness?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0002
005	Imnus, you gather the troops and take control of the chaos.
006	Yes, Your Highness! At once!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0001
007	And I?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
008	You can come with me.
009	I will take this chance to show our precious Shield Maiden the true might of the Invidia Belt knights.
010	...What?
011	The strength of our knights comes not from their might in battle...
012	Instead, true power reveals itself when it's wielded to protect something.
013	Nimul! I think the explosion came from over here!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
014	Fire! We have to extinguish it before the whole castle lights up!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0021
015	Got it. "I am Transcender of the Gate of Lust!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
016	Emmel, are you okay?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
017	Nimul!	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1011
018	Are you hurt? What was that sound—
019	Ngh! Nimul? Good, you're here—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
020	Yna, what's happening—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
021	Your swordsmanship is worthy of praise.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
022	But even a master cannot win when he's outnumbered.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0001
023	That shield...	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
024	I fixed up your national treasure.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
025	As long as you wield this thing, any middle-of-the-road attack isn't going to leave a scratch.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
026	We're all out of the Sephirium we snuck out now though... Well, it was worth it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
027	The Silver Shield! But it matters little if you don't have the right person wielding it!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0001
028	Ngh! I knew it, we don't stand a chance against a Fallen that's already absorbed this much corruption.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
029	Yna! Damn, he's calling forth those fallen shadows again!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
030	Space-Time Manipulation isn't working! Emmel, Eulalia! Can't you fight the corruption with Spiritbonding?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
031	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0004
032	Groooooooaaah!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0007
033	It's not working!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
034	Back in the Gula belt we didn't have trouble purifying this kind of corruption!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0031
035	Haha, fools! You don't even understand that much? Your techniques rely too much on concentrating the magil into a single blow.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0008
036	But my magil is the type that burns down everything it touches! It will not bend to such a weak will!
037	Your power is nothing in the face of my wrathful corruption!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0010
038	So this is the Ira Belt...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
039	They must have developed a close-combat style that combines the sword and the body because those scorched lands were not suitable for other techniques...
040	Then I ought to face him with a sword in hand.
041	King of the Ira Belt, I am your opponent.
042	What?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0006
043	That sword... I see that there is still a genuine knight in the Invidia Belt.	VO_arius.arius_sys_0031
044	You are mistaken. This is not the sword of one of our knights.
045	This blade was made to carve out a future for our citizens, to protect our people.
046	For a brighter tomorrow...
047	You're all talk!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0019
048	What?!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0006
049	The blade of wrath... I'm sure it is supposed to bring calamity and ruin, a fearsome thing...
050	But we cannot give into fear. There are people that believe in us, that await our victory.
051	Urk!
052	Your Highness, please stand back! It's the Shield Maiden's duty to protect—	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
053	No. I cannot do that.
054	What?
055	All knights of the Invidia Belt are sworn to protect and rescue.
056	You! Why are you still fighting me when you know you cannot win?!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0013
057	What is this power...?	VO_arius.arius_sys_0026
058	A chivalrous knight puts everything on the line and stakes their mind, body and soul on the shield that guards! That is giving it all!
059	That is the vow that the Mesarthim, the very first Shield Maiden left us...
060	As protectors, we must build and protect a place where people can live.
061	That is what the Silver Shield you inherited symbolizes.
062	A place where people can live...
063	Daphne, you are not alone. We are always with you, even if...
064	Even if this old man were to perish.
065	As long as you have something to protect, you'll find a way to keep moving against all odds.
066	You will never be alone.
067	Your Highness...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0018
068	Arghhh!!!	VO_arius.arius_battle_0004
069	Nrck—
070	Enough of this chatter! A king stands alone! He steals and rules over all from his solitary throne! I will show you what a true king looks like!
071	Ngh!
072	...Thank you, Your Highness.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0033
073	I think I finally understand. I might be the Shield Maiden, but...
074	This duty and this shield, these are not burdens that I carry alone.
075	That's right... You're not alone.
076	Wield your shield and focus on what's in front of you. There is no need to worry about the rest.
077	Keep moving without fear of failure... All you need to do is the things you believe are right.
078	Understood!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
079	How long are you going to keep up this charade—!	VO_arius.arius_sys_0021
