001	The wolf is coming. The wolf is coming. The wolf is coming.
002	No...! The house is on fire! This is a joke, isn't it? This has to be a dream!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0028
003	Everyone, wake up! Take the women and children to the village mayor's house!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
004	... ...
005	Mr. Soldier, please help! My mom has a fever and she can't move...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0019
006	...Huh?	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0025
007	Burn everything! Leave no traces behind!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0002
008	We are a wolf pack. Our shapeless terror will demonstrate our value!
009	The wolf came, he saw, he killed.
010	Oh... When will I be free of this dream?
011	Freed! It's been a while.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
012	Well well, General Neville the Ice Snake. What would you like with your humble librarian?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0009
013	Come now. That's no way to speak to an old classmate.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0030
014	My apologies for the irony. So what did you want with me? I'm surprised you stopped by.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0035
015	Well, I'd love to reminisce about old times, however...	VO_neville.neville_sys_0007
016	Has something troublesome occurred? It's always these things when it comes to you.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0044
017	Don't say that. Neither Caesar nor Vlad cared to inquire about these occurrences.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0030
018	Furthermore, my subordinates lack any influence when it comes to the nobility.
019	So you want me to wield my father's authority? I'm worried this will eventually be the death of me.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0010
020	Resources from the border village of Envylia that were meant for the Stones has been halted.
021	For how long?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
022	These past few months.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0004
023	Of course, it's just one of many facilities. The halt of supplies in and of itself won't cause too many problems. However...
024	Something sounds fishy. Are there any signs of one of the houses having made a move?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0045
025	There are no noticeable movements from within the Capital. At least nothing has occurred on the surface.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0031
026	That's troublesome. Wasn't that an orphanage?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
027	They were receiving sufficient aid, and our demands were within a humanitarian range. If there is a problem, it must be some form of fraud...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
028	Or perhaps the Holy Guard have caught wind of our research. Either way, we must hurry to confirm this.
029	No need to rush things. Shouldn't we take a more measured approach?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
030	Many of my subordinates were originally orphans. I want to avoid any problems spreading from there.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0018
031	Do you think it will result in war?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
032	At this rate, it may be inevitable.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0004
033	Very well. It might be worth being useful to our country from time to time. I'll prepare for an inspection.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0030
034	Much appreciated. Oh, also...	VO_neville.neville_sys_0041
035	I'll pass this on to you.
036	This...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
037	It's a prototype for a Stone. After one use it will crumble, but it should help make your Alchemy stronger.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0005
038	Are you sure you want to hand such a precious thing to me?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
039	I've determined that you'll need it. Let it be a reminder of how important this mission is.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0004
040	Of course. If you can avoid using it, there's no harm in that.
041	Why does war always make people rush through life?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0030
042	Both time and history will eventually pass, we silently allow ourselves to drown in oceans of books.
043	Oh, this world truly is a stifling place.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
044	Ah, welcome! You must be tired from your long journey. I've prepared a room!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
045	No, I am stationed outside the village. Thank you for your concern.
046	Is that so? I thought you were here for the Stone's ingredients...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
047	Director.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0049
048	A-ah, apologies! However, if not for that then why on earth...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
049	Like I said, I am here just to inspect. There is no need for you to cater to my requests.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
050	Oh, that being said, how are the children?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
051	All of them are fine, although a majority of them have suffered from the loss of their parents or siblings in the war.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
052	However, thanks to His Majesty's generous support, they have been able to spend their days with smiles on their faces.
053	Any effect from the blood collecting?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0006
054	As per our instructions, we have been securing a small bottle's worth every month only from the children with high levels of Alchemia.
055	Oh...last month, one of the elder children came down with a cold, so the amount we sent was less than usual.
056	I see. Last month, huh?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0045
057	(According to Neville though, there's been a halt over the past few months. Well, well...)
058	I'll request for His Majesty's continued support, so please rest assured.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0033
059	Indeed! Thank you!
060	Well then, I'll return to my station.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
061	Ah. I'll take you to the gate.
062	...Ah.
063	Oops. Are you okay?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
064	Yes, Mr. Soldier.
065	Hey, Blanchett, you're not with the others?
066	The other children said they saw a rabbit in the forest, and they went running off.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
067	They left the hospital without permission...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
068	I'll stay in my room.
069	Very well. I'm sorry to have left the children in your care. Please rest.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
070	Who was that child?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
071	Her? She recently came to this orphanage. A few months ago her village was burned down.
072	Burned down?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
073	Apparently, they were attacked by bandits. The landlord looked into the matter, but could not make clear of what had occurred.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
074	...
075	This applies to all the children of this orphanage...but it is tragic that they've all lost something at such a young age.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
076	A halt of supplies over the past few months.
077	A decline in supplies for last month.
078	A few months ago, someone burned down a village.
079	The landlord, huh?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0044
080	Well hello, handsome. Is this seat taken?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
081	Neville told me about you. Apparently, you're a resourceful informant.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0003
082	Can you at least try to play along a little more?	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0016
083	I've taken care of this place myself, so there's no need for unnecessary measures.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0010
084	You don't really seem to understand how adults socialize.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0030
085	So what did you want to ask?
086	I'm still in the preliminary stage of my investigation. I'd like to know everything I can about this village, but...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
087	To begin with, what kind of person is the landlord?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
088	Oh, well you're a clever one. The administrator of the National Library appointed without having accomplished much...
089	I thought you'd just be leeching onto your father's name, but it seems like you might actually make for stimulating conversation.
090	So do you have any information?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0007
091	I have quite the story, actually. It's just a rumor but a highly credible one.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0038
092	...So?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0006
093	The landlord here...
094	Oh, good! There you are!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
095	Director?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0025
096	The villagers said they saw a wolf in the woods. Apparently, someone has been attacked as well!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
097	The children have gone into the forest and haven't returned yet! Please!
098	First, calm down. Do you know where the children are?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0027
099	Most likely, they went to pick wild vegetables...there's a spot that the village hunter often teaches them.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
100	First, let's go there and look. I'm sorry Vanekis, but we'll have to continue this conversation later...
101	Yes. When you return.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0006
102	Well then, Director. Can you please lead the way?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
103	Y-yes!
104	Oh, found a mushroom!
105	Hey! That's a poison mushroom, you know? The color is weird.
106	True. But maybe it's okay?
107	No, it's not! Look, let's eat the wild vegetables we were taught about.
108	Really? But they're so bitter!
109	...Hey.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
110	Oh! Blanc! Were you here too?
111	The sun is setting. The director is worried so how about we go home?
112	Hey, Blanchett! You're new here! Don't act so bossy just because you're older than us!
113	No, I'm not trying to...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
114	Just a little bit longer! Remember what the teacher said?
115	This year, the taxes are really high, so we've hardly been able to store any wheat.
116	But we can come again tomorrow...huh!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
117	Blanc? What's the matter?
118	...It's coming.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1006
119	Huh? What's coming...?
120	Ahhhh?! A wolf!
121	Eeek?! N-no, don't come!
122	Ah...aaaah! Ha...aahahah!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0008
123	Honestly! How annoying!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0011
124	Blanchett...?
125	Oh, but I might as well extend my hospitality! Right?!
126	I'll chop you into small pieces!!! Come on! Who's inside your stomach?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0014
127	Wh-what are you doing?! Hurry, we need to run...!
128	What's that?! You're in the way so back off! I'm completely annoyed by the stink of these beasts!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0012
129	Groooowwl!!!
130	Ahahaha! There's more! And more! I'll tear you all to pieces!!!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0008
131	Blanchett!	VO_freed.freed_sys_0027
132	(The Philosopher's Stone is responding to her Alchemia?)	VO_freed.freed_sys_0026
133	No, now isn't the time to think. Please stand back, Director. We'll take care of this.	VO_freed.freed_battle_0023
