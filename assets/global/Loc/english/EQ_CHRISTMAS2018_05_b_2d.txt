001	D-darn it! Why?! We're the ones who are right! How could we lose?!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0028_b
002	You leave me no choice! I'm gonna bring down a giant snowstorm and bury you all!
003	Wh-what?!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0002
004	Hahahaha! Here I go!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0002
005	Huh?	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0002
006	Nothing's happening.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0031
007	Wh-what's going on?! We're snow spirits! The snow is ours to control!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0019
008	You have been so focused on your tiny view of what is right that it has blinded you.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0010
009	Wh-what did you say?!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0020
010	The purpose of your powers is to allow you to protect the Winter Holiday, correct?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0003
011	Yet you are no longer fighting for the Winter Holiday, because you have forgotten its true meaning. Have a look around you.
012	Th-the Maruda children and...humans?	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0001
013	Whoa! Your snowman is kinda different lookin'.
014	Huh? Is it really that strange?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
015	No, it's not strange! I've just never seen one like it before. It's new—but I think it's cute!
016	Hey! Let's decorate the trees together after this!
017	...
018	Is the Winter Holiday not meant to be a time when children can have fun?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
019	I-I...
020	It's so nice when it snows and the green trees get all pretty!
021	Awww... I really hope it snows soon. A Winter Holiday with no snow is boring!
022	...
023	Do you understand what is important now?
024	Y-you're right. The Winter Holiday is meant to be for the children.
025	We were wrong!	VO_MarludaSmall.MarludaSmall_battle_0019
026	You get it now?!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
027	Just don't go making the same mistake twice, okay?	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0028_c
028	What have you two got to be all high-and-mighty about?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0030
029	Now, then. All that is left is to make it snow. Klima?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
030	Right!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0037
031	Can you really do it, Klima? Even the snowmen couldn't do it just now!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
032	Have no fear! Klima's power, coupled with all of the hopes and dreams of this holiday, should make light work of it!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
033	Not to mention that this is the village of the guardians of the Winter Holiday.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
034	Go on, Klima. Pitch your love for the Winter Holiday to the sky! Don't worry—I shall support you with my prayers.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0041
035	I'll do my best.	VO_clima.clima_battle_0015
036	Nnngh...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0029
037	Are you okay?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
038	Maybe she's too tired?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
039	I-I'm fine, don't worry. Nnngghhh...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0020
040	Klima. Think back on when you were young.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
041	Those warm, kind memories of the Winter Holiday... You had so much fun, didn't you?
042	I did. It was so much fun.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
043	Everyone was smiling, and the air was full of excitement. The snow was really beautiful, too.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
044	That does sound lovely. Will you show me? I want to see that wonderfully festive landscape with my own eyes.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0008
045	O-okay.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0038
046	I want to show it to you. The snow was so pretty.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0032
047	It's snowing!
048	Hey! Good job, guys!	VO_shayna.shayna_sys_0044
049	We're finished with all the preparations. This party is ready to roll!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
050	Wow! Thank you both so much!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0009
051	What's with all the snowmen?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
052	The Maruda Tribe wanted to see what our Winter Holiday was all about, and since we kinda made friends with them, we decided to bring them along. I-is that okay?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
053	It's not a problem, but—	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
054	Wow! Cool!
055	What a weird snowman! It's so funny!
056	Awww... The children are gonna get all caught up in the wrong Winter Holiday.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0028_c
057	Don't be like that! All that matters is that they're having fun!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0007
058	Wow! The snowmen are moving! This is so cool! The Winter Holiday is the best!
059	Come on, snowmen! Let's play together!
060	The Winter Holiday is about giving children the most wonderful day possible. As adults, it is our responsibility to ensure that that happens.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
061	...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
062	Klima, you should go join in with them.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0007
063	C-can I? Aren't there still things left to do?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
064	Oh, you needn't worry about that. The preparations are all but done.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0023
065	That's right! You've been really good, Klima!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0004
066	I-I have? So then, maybe... Santa might come!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0047
067	Hmm... It would be nice if he did. Yes, I am confident that he will visit.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
068	We wish all the children of the world a happy Winter Holiday!
