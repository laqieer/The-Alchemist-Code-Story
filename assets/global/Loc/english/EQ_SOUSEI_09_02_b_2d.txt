001	Stop... Please...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0015
002	Our deliverance is nigh! Our faith has been rewarded!
003	Finally, we shall be absolved of our sins, and the sins of our dragon forebears!
004	Grant your mercy unto us! Deliver us to the promised land!
005	N-no!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
006	Aaaaaaaaaargghhhhh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
007	No... It...can't be!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
008	How could this...? How could they...?
009	Their lives...
010	I tried...to save them... I wanted...to...
011	But in hardly a blink of an eye, they...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
012	Then again, what need have I for humanity?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
013	The moment I touched this stone, I understood. Life is worthless to whosoever shall be sacrificed in the Ceremony of Creation.
014	All is magil. Nothing more, nothing less. It is true equality, where none stand higher or lower than another.
015	But... Why, then?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
016	What need was there for them to give their lives so willingly?
017	(I just can't come to grips with that. I won't! It doesn't make any sense!)
018	What meaning is there to their sacrifice?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
019	Their lives till now have been lived with purpose. Though sad, there was reason behind their losses. They lived upon faith. They lived with Pride!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
020	But now?
021	The people of Pride... They're dying now for no reason. Their deaths serve no purpose. They hold no value.
022	And if this is to be their end, I can only wonder: What was the point of their lives? Was it just for them to die meaningless deaths?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
023	If so, then what was the point in any of it?!
024	What were you thinking, creating such lives for yourselves?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
025	I can't allow any more loss like this. I must seal myself away. I must seal this power.
026	What...happened?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
027	This entire sector has been decimated...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
028	I don't know what I was expecting to find at the source of that bright light, but this!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
029	What does it mean?
030	...
031	The magil in the air is still fluctuating, a lot. Someone used a very powerful technique here, or...maybe...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
032	Oh, this is strange. We seem to be in a dead spot for those powerful winds from before.
033	Even the magil seems different here, like it's been blanked out.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
034	Yes. Right now, that man's physical form requires a frankly obscene amount of magil, after all.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
035	You're—!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
036	Hark, travelers. I come in peace. I have a proposition for you all—if you're willing to hear me out.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
037	...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
038	Mira! Nyx! Get behind us!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
039	No? How disappointing. In that case—
040	I suppose I can buy a little time by entertaining you, instead.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
