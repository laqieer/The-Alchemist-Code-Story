001	We did it! Now this place should be safe for you to nap and explore to your heart's content, little one.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0008
002	Well, that takes care of that!
003	Thank you.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0033
004	Don't mention it. A friend in need is a friend indeed—and this little cutie chose me to be her friend when she sat on my lap!
005	Hehe. Then let me thank you again, on her behalf. And... was there something you wanted to ask me?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
006	Well... I got a little worried when I saw you this morning. All alone, talking to a cat... And we transfer students have to stick together, you know? I was actually hoping we could be friends.
007	Although, to be honest, I think there was something else I wanted to talk to you about at the time... But whatever it is, it's gone now!
008	Don't let it go!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0014
009	Zwei? Where did all that intensity come from?
010	You shouldn't give up just because you forgot something or can't remember it!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
011	Because if you do... you'll never remember. You'll lose those memories forever.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0021
012	There are things that I can't remember either, but... they're still part of what make me, me. I would cease to be myself anymore if I forget them entirely.
013	So you should at least try to remember what you've forgotten—and never give up on your memories! That's what Sol taught me.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
014	You don't want to lose sight of who you are, do you?
015	Don't give up on the things you've forgotten...
016	They're important. Of course they're important. I've got to remember!
017	Because I don't want to lose sight of who I am—I want to be myself. It's not like me to keep forgetting things like this.
018	"It's not like me..." Who used to say that?
019	Whoops! I was totally spacing out, wasn't I? Sorry Zwei! And thanks for the help!
020	Just don't forget that someone out there might be waiting for you like this kitty does for me. Okay?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
021	I feel like I'm forgetting about something really important...
022	I have to try and remember. I've gotta think back...
