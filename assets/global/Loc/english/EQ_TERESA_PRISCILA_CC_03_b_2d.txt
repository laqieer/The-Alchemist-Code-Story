001	Huzzah!	VO_lamia.lamia_battle_0009
002	Good! That's the way to do it. There's really not much else I can teach you, quite honestly.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
003	That's not true! I still have so much to learn from you! I'm nowhere near what I could be.
004	I'm still...just...
005	What's the matter? Is something troubling you? You know you can speak to me about anything, Lamia.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0005
006	Well... There is one thing.
007	I feel terrible. I stepped on a flower the other day.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0030
008	I knew it was there, but I was careless, and I just couldn't maneuver around it in time!
009	Flowers can't choose where they bloom, but we choose to fight where they do, and then...they get trampled.
010	It is very like you to fret over such a thing, Lamia. Like you, and no one else.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0002
011	And I'm afraid I have no skills to impart upon you that would provide any aid in this matter. Even I cannot run through a battlefield without treading upon the flora therein.
012	I suppose there isn't much to be done about it, is there?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0006
013	I think it is important, however, to remember the pain you feel from this. Remember it, carry it with you, and do your best to fight on despite it.
014	Yes. Yes, of course! Thank you!
015	It's just one more reason to stop the fighting: so the flowers blooming in the fields need not be trampled any more.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
016	Precisely. So long as we share this goal, we will always be together.
017	What do you mean?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0002
018	Exactly what I said. Even if we should fight on different fronts far removed, so long as we're working toward the same goal, we will always be fighting by one another's side in spirit.
019	I...see.
020	I'm sorry, Lamia.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0035
021	No. No, there's no need to apologize.
022	You're doing what you have to do. Something so important, it's worth leaving the knighthood for, no?	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
023	It's thanks to you that I can. You keep me grounded. When I gaze upon a flower out in the field, then and only then does every trace of conflict and animosity simply vanish from my mind.
024	The thought of peace never even crossed my mind until you brought flowers into my life.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0003
025	Master?
026	Tell me. Do you hate war?	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0001
027	Even if I do...
028	Exactly.	VO_teresa.teresa_sys_0006
029	I see. Indeed, such research may be just the thing I need.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0045
030	However, you say the Ruinmaker of Wratharis is going around burning it all up? If so, then we must gather whatever archives remain before she gets to them.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
031	The issue is, the whereabouts of the extant data have not yet been confirmed. We are searching far and wide, but at this rate, she'll surely reach most of the stores before we do.
032	We must execute our search in secret, you see. Should we not keep to the shadows, we'll attract unwanted attention.
033	Hmph. How droll.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
034	Then we'll just have to capture this Ruinmaker and...interrogate her.
035	If necessary, we can even send troops into Wratharis to get the job done.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0031
036	Is such a thing...feasible?
037	Of course! His Majesty's attention is elsewhere, at the moment. Now is the time to do as we please.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
038	Just remember, whenever you're searching for something, it's always best to clear away the refuse in the room first, so it doesn't get in the way...
