001	Whoa, look at this! I've never seen anything like it before! Hey, Mister, what is this?	VO_aswad.aswad_chara_1004
002	Oh, that? It's fruit imported from Envylia. Fancy a sample to taste?
003	Could I? Why, thank you! Let's see, now... Mmm, it's so sweet!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0046
004	Hahaha! Delicious, ain't it?
005	It certainly is! Though perhaps it's the air that's even sweeter. I'd swear the market's much livelier than usual. Did something happen to boost its fortunes?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0003
006	Sure did. Desert Wings opened up a trade route to Envylia, and business is boomin'!
007	Far fewer children goin' hungry, too, as a result. Good time to be a merchant.
008	Children...going hungry?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
009	Oh, yeah. Not too long ago, this place was rife with orphans beggin' for scraps.
010	Parents runnin' into hard times and abandonin' their kids, you know? Lots of 'em got into trouble, and you sometimes even saw 'em pass away in the streets. Real sad sight.
011	That's terrible!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
012	Fortunately, we don't see that so much no more. More children are doin' just fine these days. Like those kids playin' over there, for example.
013	C'mon, c'mon! Over here!
014	Heeeey! Wait up!
015	They certainly do look happy. Everyone around here does, really.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0024
016	And we owe it all to them Desert Wings. Their guild captain's really somethin' else! Word is, he was an orphan raised on the streets himself.
017	...
018	Well, thanks for filling me in, my good man. I'll stop by again, to be sure!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0034
019	Just as I expected of you, Lady Naj—I mean, Aswald! You play the sweet young villager-next-door so well, I almost believed it myself!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
020	Are you teasing me? I just did what I had to in order to gather the intelligence we need.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
021	In any case, our target should be arriving very soon.
022	Mrrraaaah... I'm pooped!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0029
023	Please, Master Ryle! Try to maintain composure! You're the one who insisted on coming here for observation, after all.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0014
024	Yeah, yeah.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0005
025	That you, Ryle? You barely ever come all the way out here. Where's the fire?
026	I just thought I'd pop my head in and see how things have been going. How are sales these days?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
027	Ehh, sure can't complain!
028	Desert products are a hot commodity in Envylia. Job's really starting to pay off.
029	Good to hear, good to hear.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
030	There's been some talk, however, of bandits on the trade route. Heard anything about that?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0001
031	Yeah, there've been a lot of them lately. But the guild defense has been dialing up the heat, so most people seem to think they're nothing to worry about.
032	And we have you to thank for that, of course!
033	As long as everything's okay. I'm glad you all seem to be getting along well enough.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
034	The merchants really do trust the Desert Wings, don't they?
035	They trust them because they've brought real change to the market. Which they definitely have, make no mistake. Nonetheless...	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
036	Hmm? What are you looking at? Oh!
037	...
038	Gentrification. Build up an area for one group, and you'll surely be pushing another out.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
039	There's no quick fix for the world's problems.
040	Those born in darkness can only live in darkness. That's the way it's always been, and the way it'll always be.
041	And that's why Zalam Gaim exists.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
042	...
043	You lot seem to be real busy lately, huh? Anything I should know about?
044	We've got a fairly important deal in the works. A number of our own are en route now to take care of it. Preparing the logistics of it all has been quite the chore.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_1038
045	You aren't going yourselves?
046	We've got some other guild work to take care of...unfortunately.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
047	Sounds like they're short on guild members at the moment. This might be our chance, Lady Najam!
048	Don't be so sure. That man is a slippery one. He's likely got some kind of trick up his sleeve.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
049	Suppose he already knows there's a hit out on him, for example. He may be baiting us.
050	Oh. I hadn't thought of that.
051	Still, if he's at least telling the truth about staying put for the time being, it is a good opportunity to get this job done sooner rather than later.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
052	(Even if he knows we're poised to strike, we can account for that. As long as he dies in the end, that's all that matters.)
053	Let's monitor the situation just a bit longer.
054	Eeek! Bandits! Bandits!
055	So, the rumors are true.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
056	You guys stow away in the carts, and leave the fighting to us. Let's go, Carla!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0001
057	Right! Don't worry, everyone; we'll keep you and all your goods safe!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
