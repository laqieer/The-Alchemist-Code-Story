001	I cannot believe you all would jump to fight me without even a single moment's hesitation! Do you all hate me so much?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0011
002	Says the one who attacked first!
003	I suppose you've got me there. But things just got a little out of hand! It was an honest mistake. I just had a lot on my shoulders, that's all!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0008
004	But are you sure you should be wasting your time with me, knight of the Ire Belt?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
005	What, now?
006	I outright admitted I'm here to buy some time, no? Aren't you the least bit concerned about your fearless leader?
007	...!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
008	Silence! We will capture you here, and we will pry the answers we seek from you by force if we have to!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0010
009	Hold on. I don't think we need to—	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0014
010	What was that?! This is no ordinary flow of magil!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
011	Holy—?!
012	A tower...?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
013	Ah, the keystone of the Ceremony of Creation—the final trial for you humans to overcome.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0002
014	The stage is set for the ultimate battlefield, whereupon we can fight unimpeded by the Light of Judgment from the Shell of the World.
015	Battlefield?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
016	The crystallization of all that the dragons once sought to achieve, built up using the seven pillars as its core...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
017	Under its protection, a human could even stand against a god without being crushed.
018	That, travelers, is the only thing that will allow humans such as yourselves to face Ouroboros.
019	That said, it can't last particularly long, as you might imagine. There's not enough magil to sustain it.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0039
020	Did you decide to show mercy, Bianca? Ha! Perhaps she has allowed her heart a bit too much leeway with humanity.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
021	So that battlefield is your goal, then?!
022	It is. Perhaps you should all sheathe your swords and take a proper look up at it.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
023	Can you not see the light of battle gleaming at the top? The dragon warriors, the serpents, that would consume this world are engaged in mortal combat with one another.
024	What?!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
025	Curses!
026	So fast!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
027	That was a bad move, I'm afraid.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0001
028	Aghh!!!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0043
029	I can't...keep up!
030	Hmph. You're clearly not meant to fly solo on the battlefield, are you?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
031	It's a bit of a shame, as you have considerable power at your fingertips, but won't have much opportunity to use it without allies watching your back.
032	How unfortunate for you.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
033	(Is this the end?!)
034	That...light...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
035	Time to rest. I'll make this as painless as possible for you.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0014
036	Huzzzaaahhh!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0028_b
037	What?!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0022
038	Oh?
039	A Cursed Dragon?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
040	Well, now!	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
041	Lucifer?! Why—?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
042	...
043	Retreat, human child. I will remain to fight in your stead.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0001
044	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
045	(Lucifer, the Cursed Beast... It spoke to me?!)
046	I am only fulfilling my end of the contract I made with that girl. I will protect you, as promised.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0003
047	That girl? You mean, Emmel?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
048	There is no prospect of victory for you on this battlefield. Flee, human child.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0019
049	So, you yet live, last of the Cursed Dragons. The humans did not destroy you after all.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
050	Used the cores absorbed by the tower to create your own Shell, did you?
051	Stained by human sin, consumed by their corruption, and yet now you fight on their behalf, Lucifer?
052	I do.	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0003
053	...
054	Cursed Dragon, Ophioneus. It seems at least your ego has survived.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0044
055	Only that. I am Lucifer now. The age of the dragons is over. Now all that remains is a beast, and that beast has chosen to side with the humans!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0002
056	Grrrroooooaaaar!!!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0028_a
