001	...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
002	A smile on every face, was it?
003	(But how can I enjoy myself, knowing that same joy is denied to Lady Emmel?)	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
004	(And all because I failed in my duty...)
005	No, that's enough brooding. I have a job to do.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
006	(It's that teddy bear again.)
007	(It really does look a little like Lord Nimul...)	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
008	Roll up, roll up! Fancy your hand at the ring toss, miss?
009	Hey, I remember you! You're that guard who was staring a hole in my teddy bear!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0006
010	I... I did not realize I was so fascinated.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
011	You sure were! Your friends almost bust a gut trying to win it for you, you know.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0004
012	They... Blanchett and Ramses have been very kind to me.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
013	...
014	Hey, did you hear about that wonder potion? They say it works super fast!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0003
015	Yeah, I did! Do you think it's safe? I've seen a lot of people with it here!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
016	Hm?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
017	Can either of you explain how this fight came about?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
018	It's this maniac's fault! First he comes at me with an axe, then he's got the nerve to tell me it was "just a prank"! I practically had a heart attack!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
019	C'mon, man, I was just trynna spook you! The best trick of the night gets a prize, right?
020	Wait. Who told you that?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
021	Ramses! Blanchett! We have a problem. Somehow, the townsfolk have found out about this contest of yours.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
022	I beg your pardon?
023	Some of them have become a little...overenthusiastic, shall we say. We have kept them under control so far, but we can't hold out forever.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0030
024	I don't get it. How did this happen?
025	Well, um... About that.
026	We think Rosa's children mistook the contest for an official event... So they've been spreading the news to everybody they can.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0030
027	Yes, fine! It's all my fault, again! Why do you think I'm trying so hard to clean up this mess?!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0029
028	If anyone bears responsibility for this, it is me. This contest was my idea, after all.	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
029	I thought it would be the perfect fit for the theme of "Pleasant Surprises."
030	Yet it has become anything but pleasant! Truly, a blunder for the ages...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
031	Oh, Ramses...
032	Let's not give up yet. We can sit around feeling sorry for ourselves, or we can try to fix this.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0016
033	...Indeed. Truer words were never spoken.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
034	Eeek!!! What's happening?!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0026
035	Whoa! The hell are you playing at?!
036	I hear screams from over there!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
037	Let's go!
038	Yet another pleasant surprise taken too far, this time by you.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
039	Let me be very clear: a surprise is only 'pleasant' when everybody is sharing in the fun.
040	This was NOT a pleasant surprise. This was self-centered meanness for your own gain, and I don't want to see it repeated. Am I understood?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
041	Yes, ma'am.
042	We're sorry, ma'am.
043	I think that's the last mischief we'll be seeing from them. After that lecture, I'm sure they're feeling quite contrite.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
044	Imagine getting chewed out like that in public. I'd rather die...
045	...Self-centeredness...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
046	Ramses, is something wrong?
047	Not as such. Only... I am starting to question my own motivations.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0030
048	At first I thought myself driven by a desire to make Julia smile.
049	But now I wonder whether I simply disliked having to witness her sadness. Perhaps all this was not for her benefit, but for mine.
050	Are you certain you aren't overthinking this? Surely you just wanted to do a good deed.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
051	My gesture failed to resonate with Julia, and that in itself is the proof. Had I truly been sincere, she surely would have listened.	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
052	Don't say that. When we heard you say you wanted to make her smile, we all knew you meant it.
053	Why do you think I'm here, helping you? It's because I can tell you're the real deal.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
054	...
055	So stop moping and pick yourself up. The sun's got no business looking so glum.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
056	Try to shine a bit of light into someone's life. Isn't that what being the Successor of the Sun is all about?
057	Or that's what I think, anyway.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0022
058	Blanchett...
059	What's that you have there? Some kind of...red and black bottle?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
060	What, this? It's just a potion I got. Figured I could use it in a prank.
061	A red and black potion?
062	How odd. I prepared those, but I haven't started handing those out... I meant to do that once the carnival was in full swing.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0025
063	I hope this isn't a repeat of last year's mischief.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0003
064	Of course not! They're simple glamour potions to help everyone get into the Halloween spirit.
065	Glamour potions? What kind?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0005
066	They merely give the drinker Ratty ears for a little while. Rather endearing, don't you think?	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0007
067	Far better than that first batch I made, anyway. Drinking one of those would turn you into a Ratty from tip to toe.
068	A complete transformation?! I knew you couldn't be trusted with potions!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
069	I disposed of them safely, I promise! And I made sure everyone affected was given an antidote that turned them back into a human!
070	There's an emergency! Someone's prank potions have ended up circulating around the town!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
071	It seems they transform people into monsters!
072	You can't be serious...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1003
073	Numaaa!
074	Numumu? Numu?! Numyuaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
