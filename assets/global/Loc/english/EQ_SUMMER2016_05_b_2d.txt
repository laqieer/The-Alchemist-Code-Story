001	What...strength!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0026
002	You're not going anywhere! I will crack down on those who disturb the peace! Muscle Bringer!!!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0032
003	Aghh...ack...you brute.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0024
004	It's not brute force. It's the results that come from following the code of chivalry. It's something a guy like you who sits in the leader seat with his legs crossed in lethargy wouldn't understand!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0047
005	I've never missed a day of using a metal ratty instead of dumbbells to do 1 set of 999 times!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0008
006	If you're going to call yourself a man of the sea, then you'd best make sure you can live up to that title!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_battle_0009
007	Agh...ghh...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0023
008	M-my pirate way is...nothing like this...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0025
009	Dilga, thank you. You seem to have powered up immensely. Is it...because of that swimsuit?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0034
010	Yes. It's not so much the swimsuit, as what we at Wadatsumi call the heart of the warrior's way becoming aligned with my code of chivalry.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0037
011	I see.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
012	I remember there being a warrior tribe in Saga that dressed in a similar way!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0024
013	The warrior's way, huh? Perhaps I should try wearing a loincloth.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
014	Indeed. I highly recommend it.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0008
015	... ...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
016	Dilga is like super strong! Loincloths are totally amazing! I was in Wadatsumi, but I had no idea!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0009
017	Rin, don't look!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0015
018	... ...	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
019	A-ah, my next mission awaits me. I cannot waste time here. Farewell, Captain Vettel and the rest of you!	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0004
020	Mi-mission...Dilga?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
021	Idiot, don't stop him!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0049
022	With his dazzling loincloth fluttering in the wind, Dilga gallantly walks away.
023	Having defeated Gormalas, the pirate ship vanishes...and the monsters cease to appear.
024	Thanks to the true man of the sea, Dilga, a peaceful summer vacation befalls the beach resort.
