001	Wh-Who are you?! What are you doing?!
002	Hmm... What shall we do?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
003	N-No... Now, the magic...
004	Will fail.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0004
005	Gaaah!
006	No! The ritual cannot be completed now. We should get out of here.
007	Hey, Sol? The magic those guys were using...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
008	Yes, it did look familiar.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
009	That's a Wadatsumi ritual.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
010	It looked like they were performing it wrong, so it wouldn't work. Still, all those rituals were lost when the priestess was killed.
011	But perhaps... Maybe when Wadatsumi was invaded, something was taken from the priestess's house.
012	During the fighting, there was no one to enforce the law and prevent looting.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
013	...
014	The magic they were using earlier is a kind of illusion used to manipulate people.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
015	But that ritual should only be able to affect the living. It's not meant to be used on the dead.
016	Perhaps, he mistakenly got it into his head he could control an immaculate immortal soldier.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
017	An immortal?
018	They were an experiment used during The Lion Monarch's Charge at Greed Dike...and mobilized to invade Envylia.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
019	I never thought I'd see the likes of them again, let alone here. And so well preserved.
020	Indeed. But exhuming them doesn't sit right with me. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0006
021	...Though I suppose I've no place to say such things.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0011
022	I've no interest in what they meant to do, but it is a grim thing for sure.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
023	The magic they intended to use was certainly not meant for whatever they were up to.
024	We should try and put a stop to them.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0038
025	Even if it won't affect immortal soldiers, who knows what trouble they might cause.
026	...
027	Yes, but isn't it a problem if we're the only ones who care about that child?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0039
028	I don't think so. And I'm coming with you. It's the least I can do.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
029	(Even after I'm gone, there are those who will think of you and treat you as precious.)
030	(...I'm so glad.)
