001	A Road in Lustburg
002	The snow is already piling up.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
003	(Deneb...)
004	(This fortuneteller is known for being incredibly precise. She divined my brother's whereabouts for me once.)
005	(She might be able to tell me more; this time in more detail...)
006	(But...)
007	(I can't seem to bring myself to even knock on her door.)
008	The snow is piling up, you know?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
009	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
010	Goodness! What pretty hair you have!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
011	Ah, um, I'm s-sorry...	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
012	Are you here to see Deneb?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
013	...
014	I am sorry, but Deneb is going to be on holiday for a while.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0036
015	Her store is closed, in fact, although I am tending it today in her absence.
016	...
017	Would you like some tea?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
018	Deneb is all right, isn't she?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
019	She is. I am afraid that I can't tell you where she is, however.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
020	Th-that's...fine.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
021	Oh? What is this? A telescope?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
022	Could you...give this to Deneb for me?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
023	Tell her I said thank you, and that...
024	I'm finally getting close to an answer, and will do my best to find it.
025	You...	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0001
026	I'd better get going.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
027	Wait! Hold on a moment!	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1017
028	Wh-what is it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
029	Is your name...Albea?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
030	Ah...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
031	Achoo!
032	You've been out in the cold for a while, haven't you? Here. Have some nice, warm tea.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0016
033	Th-thank you.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
034	I haven't introduced myself yet, have I? My name is Sophia.	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1001
035	...
036	Is something the matter? Is something on my...?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0004
037	It's just... You keep playing with your hair, as if you're...trying to cover your ears, or something.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
038	Oh, that! It's just a silly habit of mine.	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_1017
039	...
040	P-please excuse me.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0036
041	N-no, I'm sorry! I worry about my hair, too. I shouldn't have—!
042	I've heard about you from Deneb. She said that someday, a pink light would come to look anew upon the stars.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
043	So she was expecting me.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
044	You're exactly as she described. Look at that large contraption on your back! You really like machines, don't you?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
045	Oh, this? This is something my father left me. We made it together, actually. I prefer miniature ones myself, though.	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
046	It must be awfully important to you. Do you carry it with you everywhere?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
047	It requires a huge amount of Alchemia to function, so I can't power it on my own.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
048	There's just someone who I...really want to show it to, whether it's working or not.
049	Is that where you're headed?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0045
050	I'm looking for my older brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
051	Ah, yes. Deneb told me that you asked her to divine his location.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
052	What brought you back here, then?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
053	Well, it's just... I'm not sure anymore. I feel like I'm getting closer to my brother, but apparently that's dangerous.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
054	I've come this far, and if it was just me, I wouldn't mind getting involved in something risky.
055	It's when I think about dragging someone else into harm's way that I get scared. I didn't know I could feel so...afraid.
056	Hmm...
057	Thank you for the tea.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
058	Are you leaving already?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
059	I don't want to trouble you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
060	...
061	Albea. Look at me.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
062	H-huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
063	Th-those are...!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
064	Elf ears!
065	You needn't worry about putting me in harm's way.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
066	Wh-what do you mean?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
067	Elves have very good hearing, you see. Not only that, but we are a people who have been on the verge of being oppressed and used for selfish gain many times over. If nothing else, I am used to danger.
068	O-oppressed...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0027
069	I can help you.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
070	B-but...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
071	You remind me of someone, you know.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
072	I have a friend who is waiting for the return of their younger sister.
073	They always smile fondly when they speak of her.
074	Yet I am convinced that they are not truly happy in her absence.
075	I...!
076	Please. Allow me to lend you my strength.	VO_sophia.sophia_chara_0015
077	Wh-why is there ice in here—and it's...floating?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
078	Where is the star whose shadow falls upon the ice? Where is the soul which drifts beneath the floe? With an eye above and an eye below, I will divine their radiant glow!
079	Albea, do you have anything of your brother's? Something that resonates with him?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
080	Something...that resonates with my brother?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
081	Ah! I do! H-here!	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
082	Is this...a military uniform from the army of Wratharis?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
083	My mother gave it to me a long time ago.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
084	She made it for me when I was little, for me to grow into. It's based on my brother's uniform.
085	It's the only real memory I have of my brother.
086	May I borrow it?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
087	P-please take good care of it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
088	But of course.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
089	What are you going to do with it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
090	Project the star steeped in memories upon the ice to reveal the trail.
091	Also...
092	Y-yes?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
093	We will be needing a spell to make sure that everything goes well!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
094	J-just make sure you give it back!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
095	Ohohoh! Do you have so little faith in me?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0008
096	If I didn't have faith in you, I wouldn't have handed it to you in the first place!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
097	Oh, dear.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0050
098	...
099	Please!
100	Hm...
101	Your brother's star has sunk to the depths of the river of rage, leaving its light scrambled upon the surface.
102	The river of rage? Does that mean...Wratharis?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
103	Upriver lies the source of the star stream itself. It lies still, with open maw.
104	The source of the...star stream?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
105	The ancient capital, tied to the forbidden art.
106	The forbidden art? Alchemy? The ancient...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
107	Wait! Does this mean that there are ruins in Wratharis like the ones in Slothstein?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0021
108	Eventually, your brother's star will be drawn spiraling into the center and engulfed...
109	Taken to the place of the sealed.
110	Ah!
111	I knew it!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
112	Who are these—?!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0025
113	They're annoying, that's what they are!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
114	I see! They're a danger, then, I take it.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0029
115	You've got that right!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
