001	Can you believe it? We've been ordered to be guides for the Blue Flame Guard right after our first campaign! There's no higher honor, Dias!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0009
002	Just don't overdo it, okay? Ever since we were young, Logi, you always get overenthusiastic and end up losing your bearings.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0007
003	Yeah, yeah, you don't have to remind me. Hey, wait? A-Agatha?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
004	What are you doing here?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
005	I'm going along with you two because I can't trust you on your own.	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0016
006	Don't worry. I'll protect you both like I did when we were children! Heheh. I can't wait to get started!	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0003
007	Id-idiot! What are you playing at?!
008	Go back, now! A battlefield is no playground—
009	Seriously, you two can't even take a joke. Wouldn't you agree, father?	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0005
010	We've been ordered to take Agatha with us.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0007
011	Ordered?
012	Agatha is a novice of the Holy Order of Babel. Furthermore, she is extremely well versed in the history of Alchemy.
013	The king has lent us her talent as he thought it would be useful for our expedition.
014	If there are Alchemists in Wratharis, war may occur again. We must do everything we can to prevent that.	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0002
015	If my knowledge can help prevent conflict, nothing will make me happier.
016	But...
017	Besides, the timing's perfect. I was getting tired of being cooped up in a monastery and having to pray all the time.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0007
018	A nun who is tired of prayers. Is that even allowed?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0031
019	Are you sure you'll be okay?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
020	I'd ask the same of you two.
021	Logi, you're indecisive and unstable. Dias, you seem ready to rush recklessly into battle. Both of you are a long way away from being full-fledged knights.
022	Agh.
023	In some ways, this could be called my first campaign. Try not to get in my way. Understood, halflings?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0023
024	Tsk. That attitude.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
025	Yeah. That attitude.	VO_logi.logi_sys_0011
026	No more talk. Logi, Dias, take battle positions.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
027	There are Wratharis rebels up ahead. We'll capture them for information!
028	Yes, Sir!
