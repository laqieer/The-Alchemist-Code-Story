001	Ngh! It has the advantage here on the sea!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
002	But this should be enough...
003	Ready! Valley of Siddim activated!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
004	Grrrr...
005	Grrroooooaaaaah!!!
006	It's...gathering magil?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
007	Nimul, this thing is planning something bad!
008	I know, I know. But what—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
009	This devastating amount of magil... Could it be?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
010	Everyone hold on tight! We've got a big wave coming!
011	Sorry, little miss. Gotta be a bit rough here!
012	Huh? Eeek!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0025
013	Don't move! We've got to stay down and ride this out!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
014	"I am Transcender of the Gate of Gluttony!" Wind, grant us protection!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
015	Raaaaaaaaaaargghh!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
016	Ngh! This is just like that time it protected itself against Sagittarius!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
017	Is everybody okay? Everyone still alive?!
018	Adaleigh, what do things look like from up there—
019	Eyes in front! The thing's headed right for the fleet!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
020	Nnrk!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
021	(I expended too much alchemy defending us just now... I barely have enough strength to cast anything else...)
022	Grrooooooooooooarrrrrrrrrgghh!!!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0001
023	Bwirruru!
024	Was that...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	Oh, thank goodness, I made it right on time.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0007
026	You're...
027	Nicaea?! What are you doing on the front line?!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0025
028	I had a feeling Leviathan was coming, so I rushed on over.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0006
029	How's Daphne? Oh no, she's been wounded...
030	Very well, I suppose I'll have to take matters into my own hands then.
031	What? You're kidding me! You stop that right now, Nicaea!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0022
032	A lady shouldn't be out here! This a job for the Purple Flame Knights!
033	My apologies, Imnus, but I fear this is very much my duty.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0039
034	Wait, Nicaea—!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0040
035	Princess, are you...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
036	The Invidia Belt possesses two great treasures.
037	The first is the Silver Shield, which repels evil and keeps us safe.
038	And then there's our last resort, which is supposed to protect us at a time when the shield cannot.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0002
039	The people of my ancient bloodline have ruled the Invidia Belt for generations. All of them did whatever they could for their people, passing it down from generation to generation... All for this moment.
040	Oh Selsieg, sacred beast of burgeoning time, the time has come for you to lend me your strength.
041	Bwrii bwriii!
042	This will be a little difficult, but...we'll do our best, right?	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0037
043	Bwripz!!
044	"In an age long past, on the day that this corrupted ocean gave birth to calamity, the sacred beast led us to safe havens..."
045	"We ask you once more to grant us peace..."	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0041
046	Bwripz!!
047	Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0003
112	Brriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip!
113	That thing has the same magil signature as the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg? Such a thing was right under our nose this whole time?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
048	Selsieg carries the blood of a dragon that once lived in this area.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_sys_0042
049	That's why it has the power to manipulate the sea, just like the Leviathan...
050	But it's lost the form and knowledge it once possessed. That's why it can't wield its power without someone of the royal family to aid it.
051	Regardless, it has enough power to hold back the Cursed Beast.	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0016
052	A dragon...
053	Imnus, now's your chance!
054	Right, my apologies. Everyone, continue to retreat! We don't have the time to dawdle!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0028
055	Our princess is putting her life on the line to save us! Don't sully the name of the knights by putting that to waste!
056	Yes, sir! Everyone get a move on! We need to get home alive and well!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
057	Ngh!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0022
058	Bz...rep!
059	We got to hold on just...a little longer!	VO_nicaia.nicaia_battle_0011
060	Brrii!
061	...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
062	We made it out of there somehow...
063	...
064	Imnus, is Nicaea all right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
065	She just fainted. Synchronizing with the sacred beast comes at a cost, even for someone like her.
066	...What was she thinking? Using it to scare away the Cursed Beast... Completely reckless...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0018
067	Imnus...
068	My apologies. This is not the time for sentimentality.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0036
069	We've got to rally the troops and think of what to do with the Ira Belt knights we rescued.
070	Besides...
071	The Cursed Beast appeared much too close to our shores and now there is now a significant amount of damage to deal with in town.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0030
072	...And I fear that this isn't the last we've seen from the Ira Belt.
073	I'm afraid I gotta agree with you there.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
074	We got our backs up against the wall over in the Ira Belt, they've got no other way out.
075	Beat 'em once or twice, they're not going to give up anytime soon.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
076	...Where...am I?
077	Oh, hello. Welcome back, little lady.
078	Is this capital? Ah, the battle! What happened?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
079	Well...
080	Lady Nicaea did what?! Why would she—!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0020
081	Leviathan showed up in the middle of the battle, so she came to stop it...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
082	Wh-why... I-I am the one responsible for keeping everyone safe from the Cursed Beast...
083	Ah...
084	That's right... I... I shattered the shield...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0018
085	So that means...that I'm useless now...? After all the encouragement everybody gave me, too...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0019
086	Do not lose heart, my knights.
087	Your Highness!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_battle_0019
088	Ah!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
089	Nicaea carried out her royal duty. As king, I must do the same.
090	The Leviathan has continued to inflict more and more damage ever since the day our borders clashed.
091	It's clear to me that we will only face greater calamity if I continue to look on from the sidelines.
092	That's why I am ordering you to kill Leviathan!
093	You want us to kill a Cursed Beast?!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0025
094	I understand your shock. Cursed Beasts are a force of nature after all.
095	But if we wish to survive, we have no choice but to oppose nature's laws! Prepare yourself, my dearest knights.
096	From here on out, we shall carve our own future with our own hands!
097	Yes, Your Highness!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
098	Your Highness, that's...
099	I know what you're thinking, but time is not on our side.
100	What difference does it make to face destruction at our own hands or the fangs of a Cursed Beast?
101	I will choose the path that will allow my citizens to know peace for as long as possible.
102	...Even if that will call down greater calamity on us further down the line.
103	...
104	I'm asking you to understand.
105	...I may be young, but I also inherited a responsibility to lead my people. I understand your feelings all too well. Painfully well even.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
106	(The people here in the region are just doing their best to survive, same as us.)
107	(If we want to protect them from sorrow, then there's only one thing to do.)
108	I understand. We will do everything in our power to help you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
109	You have our utmost gratitude.
110	...The die have been cast. The gods are no longer the ones that control our fate.
111	We have to stand up, for our own beliefs, our own pride.
