001	Until just before the wedding ceremony, Ethan was imprisoned at the Beckram's mansion. That's what you said, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
002	Why did Alvarez imprison him?
003	It happened about three months ago. Alvarez stormed into my family's house, bringing Alkaroids with him.
004	He said, 'You've committed national treason by continuing to hide the presence of the Sacred Stone Belphegor, even though you knew the danger it placed our country in.'
005	I see. Three months ago means about a year after he took over as mayor after Edward's death.
006	Might you say he was waiting for the suitable moment to take down the old Elester family?
007	That may have been the case. Alvarez threatened me...
008	...not only with the destruction of the Elester family, but with the execution of everyone down to the servants.
009	That's a pretty aggressive way to go about it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
010	But, wait. Alvarez's visit was to blame you for hiding the Sacred Stone, right?
011	If you reverse engineer the situation, it means he knew the location of the Sacred Stone.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
012	Do you think the Beckrams had already gotten their hands on it at that point?
013	I don't know.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
014	But, that's when Alvarez began to present me with conditions to save the Elester family.
015	He said to me, 'As I am the current mayor, if you become my wife, you can avoid the worst outcome.'
016	He told me that I had no choice.
017	Did you have a previous relationship with Alvarez?
018	Me? No, I wasn't acquainted with him at all. I believe that was our first meeting.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
019	Then we should assume he approached you to use you in some way. Perhaps to find out the location of the Sacred Stone?
020	No, I have no such powers. I didn't even know about the existence of the Sacred Stone.
021	In any case, Ethan was imprisoned because he tried to save me from the marriage.
022	So, seeing this situation, you made the decision to marry Alvarez to protect the people of the Elester family.
023	That explains the sorrowful expression on your face at the wedding.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
024	I had...no other choice.
025	Listen to me carefully. Women are born in this world to be happy.
026	That's the only thing that should matter to you.
027	You're not here to sacrifice yourself, all right?
028	Edgar...!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0017
029	That's some moving stuff, aye!
030	Anyway, I doubt I'll be able to see eye to eye with this Alvarez guy regarding anything.
031	Here they come now—his servant droids!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
