001	...
002	What are you thinking about? You've got this look on your face... Anything I can do to help?	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
003	Hm? No, no... I was just thinking about the Scarlet Flame Guard. We've really come far since the three of us made that vow.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
004	Ah. We've got a lot more recruits since we became a properly recognized knight order, and we've been in a lot more different kinds of battles.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
005	Wratharis hasn't made any big moves since that time... Even though Zahar isn't around anymore, there's no telling when they'll try something.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
006	Your eye... Does it still hurt?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
007	Sometimes, but it's a good reminder to myself about what it is to be weak.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
008	Why don't I make some medicine for your eye, Vettel?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0003
009	Haha! No, it's fine. It's better for you to focus on taking care of Gerald and the rest of the knights.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
010	Well...if you say so... I'm getting a lot of practice recently in healing. I can tell that it's having an effect; that I'm improving.
011	Yeah, you've been great. We really couldn't have gone from three people to an entIra Knight order without you.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
012	I wonder what we will become next? Can the three of us stick together and continue to move forward like this?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
013	What are you saying? You trying to jinx us? Of course we can! After all, we have quite the leader.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
014	Haha, alright. I suppose this is the time for action, not self-reflection.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
015	Huh? Gerald? What's this?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
016	I put together some rules. We've gotten a number of new recruits, so I figured we need something like this to make sure everyone is on the same page.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
017	"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved. There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. Respect none who wield the sword without heart."
018	"Dedicate your sword to the pursuit of justice. All knights of the Scarlet Flame Guard will abide by these rules. Any who do not follow this decree will be cast out."
019	Strict, as befitting Ironheart Gerald.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
020	What are you saying?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
021	It's the nickname you've earned yourself for being so hard on everyone, especially yourself. The joke going around is that pure iron flows through your veins. Hence, "Ironheart".	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
022	Plus, you've always been hard-headed and tunnel-visioned. The nickname fits you, don't you think?
023	On the other hand, here we've got "Sunbright Vettel" who is popular with everyone, especially the ladies.
024	You ought to take some cues from him.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
025	Hmph. I have no complaints about "Ironheart".	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
026	Come on. Isn't it too harsh to just kick them out if they mess up?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0031
027	I agree with Natalie. Seems a little much.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
028	Right now, the Scarlet Flame Guard is just a ragtag team of all sorts. The least we can do is make sure that we have a precise code of honor for all of our members to follow.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
029	This is exactly the amount of rigor we need to protect the Scarlet Flame. We must prioritize that code of honor at all costs. Anyone unwilling to pay the price will simply have to give up on being a knight.
030	Hm, you have a point. Since Wratharis haven't shown their faces for a while and we don't know yet when they'll pop up...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
031	Plus, since Lord Commander Zain, Hero of Envylia, passed...
032	It's better to be prepared for anything rather than to react. The rest of the Scarlet Flame Guard will be informed of these provisions at once.
033	Really, Vettel? You're going along with this?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0029
034	You can quit if it is too much for you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
035	Excuse me?! As if I would! You can't get rid of me that easily! Besides, what would you even do without my medicines?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0040
036	Excuse me!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0001
037	Ah, Victor. What is it?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
038	...
039	Yes...?
040	Ah! Um, I'm so sorry! I was just overwhelmed for a moment! I never thought that a lowly knight like me would ever be able to... It is an honor to speak to you directly, Captain Vettel!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
041	Woah. What's going on with you, Victor? You wanna try some of this medicine?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
042	U-um, I think I'm okay? What is that medicine?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
043	Medicine for improving mental capacities.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0010
044	What?! Wait, yeah! I wanna try it! Wait... Does that kind of medicine really exist?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
045	Obviously not! These are just supplements! Well... I mean, they might still help someone like you. I mean, what is with you? This is a weird time to start getting flustered speaking to Vettel.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
046	Flustered...? Oh... I mean, I was just thinking that it's really only the Scarlet Flame Guard where someone like me could speak directly to the Captain.	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
047	Ah... Well, I see you more as comrades than underlings. After all, only those who share our principles are able to join us.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
048	Furthermore, everyone here is treated the same way. Even I would probably be expelled from the Scarlet Flame Guard if Gerald caught me breaking our code of honor.
049	The most important thing in the Scarlet Flame Guard is not pedigree, but honor and justice.
050	Wow, wow, wow! That was such a cool thing to say! I do not regret joining the Scarlet Flame Guard at all!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
051	Haha. Now, Victor... What was it you came to talk to me for?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
052	Oh, yeah! Um, ahem, so... I was thinking that Commander Chloe is taking a little bit too much time coming back from that volcano, so maybe I should, um...check on her?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0037
053	You're getting ahead of yourself worrying about Chloe. Give it another shot when you've actually mastered all we've been trying to teach you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0030
054	Hold up. He's got a point. It's about time to send someone to just check in and make sure that everything is fine.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
055	I thought you trusted Chloe to take care of herself.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
056	Of course I do. It just wouldn't be strange for something to go down, so we might as well send someone ahead of time to be safe...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
057	Our duties include planning for any possible scenario, don't you think, Gerald?
058	Hmph. I suppose I have no counter-argument to that. Victor!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0037
059	Y-yessir!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0037
060	Here is your first mission: Find Chloe, back her up as necessary, and make sure that the both of you return intact. Hmph. A fitting first mission for you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
061	Understood! Leave it to me! This is great! I'm super pumped! I'll definitely get the both of us back safe and sound!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0004
062	Just get out of here.	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
063	Will he be all right on his own?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
064	If he couldn't complete a mission like this, he wouldn't even be in the Guard. Trust your people a little more.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
065	I suppose you have a point. Go on, Victor. Complete this mission successfully.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
066	Captain Vettel, I have bad news! Rioters are destroying Envylia's castle town!
067	The castle town?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0021
068	There has been strong opposition to the policies intended to integrate the therians into society. It has been causing issues with public order in Envylia.
069	Tensions have been building for a while, and they boiled over into today's riot! We have received an urgent request to deploy our men to restore order!
070	We still have a long way to go until we can have true peace, huh... Scarlet Flame Guard, ready yourselves for deployment!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
071	Almost there... I'm coming to help you, Commander Chloe!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
072	Hm? What're you doing here? This area is off-limits, you know?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
073	A knight? I need your help! My companion went off to that mountain over there and hasn't returned!
074	What?! What were the two of you even doing here?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
075	We got real lost and I said, "Nah, I'm not going any further, this place ain't right," but they just kept on going!
076	Please, mister knight! Go find my friend and bring them back here! They went that way!
077	But...I'm kind of in the middle of something here... Er... Wait!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
078	I am Victor of the Scarlet Flame Guard! I must help all those in need, just like Captain Vettel and Sir Gerald are always saying!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
079	Wait here, friend! I will go find your companion and bring them back immediately!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
080	Commander Chloe, I'm sorry, kind of...but I think you would do the same thing if you were me!
081	I'm gonna go find this person and then make my way straight to your side!
082	Eek...! Stop it... Stop it! Don't come any closer!
083	Hyaaaaahhhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
084	Wh-who are you?!
085	I am Victor of the Scarlet Flame Guard! Hurry back to your village! Your friend is waiting for you there! Go!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
086	B-but there's so many goblins and just one of you!
087	Numbers mean nothing in my code of honor! Not saving you is not an option! Go!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0012
088	That is the creed of the Scarlet Flame Guard!
089	Forget about me! Run back to your friend!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
090	Th-Thank you... Please don't die!
091	Heh heh. Yeah... I mean... That'd be great, but...there really are quite a few of these jerks, huh?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
092	Well, there's nothing for it. Brother, sister... Watch me! I'm gonna kick a bunch of goblin butt and then complete my first mission ever!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
093	I'll prove that I, Victor, am worthy of being a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0015
