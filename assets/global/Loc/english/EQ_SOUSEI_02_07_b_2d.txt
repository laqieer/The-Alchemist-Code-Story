001	What was that? It...hurt. It actually hurt.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0042
002	I've never seen anything like this before. We weren't built to withstand this kind of power, whatever it is. Ugh... We're going to have to report this to Asmodeus.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0029
003	Hold it! Where do you think you're going?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0043
004	You think we're just going to let you go after all this?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0016
005	Huh...?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0027
006	My body won't...move?	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0025
007	We know you. You are us. However...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
008	...this timeline is ours! So...
009	...return to the future from whence you came! The us who belong to this time and place have not yet Fallen!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0032
010	Hah...haha...hahahahahahaha!	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0008
011	This is futile! The future doesn't change!	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0008
012	Just shut up and get out of here already!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0032
013	Hahh...hahh...
014	Is...is Ambrosia...? Is she still alive?	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
015	Tsk! How dare you assume I'm dead! I'm still full of life! Urgh...grngh...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0029
016	Please, don't move! If you push yourself too much, your wounds will reopen.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
017	Hmph! How dare you underestimate a witch such as I! I would have survived even if all that was left of me was my head.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
018	Besides, I still have far too much to do.
019	Do...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
020	I call upon you, Libra⁠!
021	All that you yet carry⁠—release!
022	Grooooooooooaagh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_b
023	I-it worked?!
024	No...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
025	How can it still be standing after taking a blow like that?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0028
026	Ahh... I knew it. It wasn't enough power to defeat it, but...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
027	Grrraoooooooooooohh...	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0028_c
028	The Cursed Beast is...withdrawing?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
029	I suspect that it is heading back to recuperate and lick its wounds, having witnessed the power of Libra. Back to the Temple of Lust.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
030	The...Temple of Lust?
031	Yes. Cursed Beasts possess a temple that is the manifestation of their sin.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
032	It is the foundation of the beast's hold on this world, and the cornerstone of the truth imposed upon us all.
033	In order to truly defeat the Cursed Beast, we must also destroy its temple.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
034	To do so, we will need the Gears of Judgment, which represent the seven virtues.
035	I take it the magic rod Libra is one of them?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
036	It's just a prototype. It couldn't even pierce through the creature's shell.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
037	How unbelievably vexing... I so wanted to be able to put an end to the Cursed Beast here and now on my own, but I couldn't.
038	Still...
039	Well, my foolish friends... Now you have seen for yourselves the true strength of the Cursed Beasts.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
040	Do you still plan to face them, regardless of how insurmountable your task?
041	Yes. Of course. Please, will you help us? We have need of your wisdom.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
042	Hah! Good answer. In that case...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
043	First, take me to my bed! I need rest. I have no magil, no energy, no anything left in me.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
044	Ngh!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
045	Y-you... You need to be more careful!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
046	You can't just throw yourself into situations like that, putting everything on the line! I was so worried, I nearly had a stroke!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0019
047	Ahh...my silly apprentices. I always forget that you are still only children.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
048	...
049	(The Gears of Judgment...)
050	(If they are necessary to defeat the Cursed Beasts...)
051	(I must learn all I can of them, so that I will finally be able to protect all that I hold dear. And not only that...)
052	(At last, I can reshape the world!)
