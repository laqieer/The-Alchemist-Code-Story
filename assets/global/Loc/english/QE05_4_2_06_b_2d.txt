001	Urgh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
002	Hah!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0007
003	...
004	He's...strong.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
005	I have trained myself all these years so that I will never lose, so that I may cut down all who oppose me...
006	And yet—	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
007	...
008	His strikes are so...severe. How is this possible?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0022
009	How is it that every single one of father's strikes reminds me of Logi's?!
010	Is this the truth?! That day, at that moment, did father simply give me the victory?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
011	That's right... Father used to scold me. He always said that my sword sought victory and nothing more.
012	I wanted to be stronger, so that I might protect Logi and Agatha, the family that I had finally found.
013	Logi was learning father's ways, and getting stronger day by day.
014	I kept searching for a way to win, a way to make it so that he would never catch up to me.
015	He saw through me, and told me that a Crowley's sword must always be true, that it must be the paradigm for knighthood.
016	Gradually, I came to see father as the greatest obstacle for me to overcome.
017	There were things that even father couldn't protect. I had to be stronger than him, or I would surely lose those I was most afraid of losing.
018	Oh, how I feared losing those who were important to me... Like Yuffie.
019	Are you telling me my sword was not true?! Are you saying that I was wrong, father?!
020	...
021	Tch! I just can't...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
022	I just can't defeat father!
023	...
024	Urgh!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0043
025	I...can't lift my arms! I know that I...can still fight! So why...?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
026	I... I see. So I doubted myself. No wonder I couldn't defeat Logi.
027	My purpose is...
028	To become the Lord Commander, in order to change this world and thereby protect my family.
029	What a childish dream. How could I have called Logi naive?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
030	The world is so coldly indifferent. The weak are trampled, and childish ideals are abused.
031	I knew this. I knew this, and yet...
032	At what point did I begin telling myself such naive nonsense?
033	...
034	But...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
035	But still I must do this! I must change the world!
036	I will create a peaceful world in which Logi can mouth off naive idealisms to Agatha as she listens with a gentle smile.
037	To achieve such a world, I would pay any price. It matters not how much blood is shed, nor how much chaos I leave in my wake!
038	That is what I desire! That's right! I desire it!
039	The power to destroy! Worthless conventions... Heartless order... I desire the power to destroy it all!
040	I demand the power to change this sad world!
041	Is that truly your will, Dias?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
042	F-father!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
043	So you will allow others to bleed for the sake of those you protect, much like I did when I was young.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
044	That's right! I will no longer hesitate! The more I waver, the more distant my goals will become!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
045	Then show me! Prove to me that you have the conviction to walk such a path!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0045
046	Ah!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
047	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0008
048	Wh-what the...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0027
049	You've really grown, Dias.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
050	Fa...ther?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
051	I made you shoulder an unnecessary burden. No, not only you... I always do this.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0036
052	You've become very skilled, Dias. I felt your unyielding conviction in that last strike.
053	N-no, I... I—!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
054	Never forget that fear. It is only natural for people to fear losing those they love.
055	However, you must not let fear consume you.
056	I'm proud to see how you, Logi, and Agatha have grown.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
057	Logi has become so honest, though much like his mother, he may be a little too kind. Although I suppose that is why he is able to protect those he loves.
058	Agatha has grown so strong, but I've given her far too much to shoulder.
059	Even after I took her in, I couldn't cast aside being a knight of Envylia.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0022
060	Had I been truly considerate of her safety, I would have thrown away my position and lived a humble life.
061	I did not, however, and that inevitably forced the you of two into making some difficult choices.
062	Dias.
063	Though we are not related by blood, you are so much like my younger self.
064	You know despair, yet you hold on to your ideals. You know how noble the light is, and yet you reach into the darkness.
065	I never stopped making mistakes. I tried to hold on to everything, but so much fell through my fingers.
066	You're still young. You have time to find the right path for yourself.
067	Father, I...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
068	Agatha saved my soul.
069	A sheath is necessary for sharp and dangerous blades. A sheath to keep those blades from making grave mistakes.
070	Dias, try not to shoulder the burdens of the world all alone. You need Logi. You need Agatha.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0001
071	I entrust them to you. Unlike me, they grew to be too good-natured.
072	They'll be needing someone who can see the world for what it is.
073	It's never too late to correct your own mistakes, Dias.
074	Even I was able to do so. You can, too, my child.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
075	Have you said what needs to be said?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
076	I have. This was an unexpected opportunity. You gave me a chance to tell him things that I would not have been able to otherwise.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0005
077	I thank you, Protector. Not only for myself, but for Setsuna.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0033
078	Goodbye, bearer of Envylia's justice.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
079	Though it may not have been justice for all, it was your truth.
080	I believe that your blade was truly one of honor.
081	Please, take care of my children.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0041
082	I will.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
083	Father! Father! Unngghhh! Nngh...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
084	The succession is now complete. Wolf of blue flames, your will now lives again.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
