001	We made it higher than the sky.
002	But, I still can't see the blue of the sky.
003	Mystic Tower Veda
004	Grrraaaaaaaahhrrrr!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
005	Tch! I've already lost count!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0029
006	We're on the hundredth floor, Dead Nine!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
007	It all looks the same to me.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
008	You gotta at least keep count, you know?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0014
009	I hate math.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
010	You must be glad I came along.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
011	Quit braggin'.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
012	Hehehehe!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0050
013	Holy crap. I can't believe we made it this far.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
014	I didn't think there would be anybody besides Nihil who could fight like this.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
015	What, you guys didn't believe in me?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0006
016	Heh. You're like the second coming of Othima, the hero of Lost Blue. It'll be a miracle if we make it to the top.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
017	I have no intention of being a hero.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
018	Dead Nine...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
019	Ugh... Looks like there's still a ways to go above the 100th floor.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
020	But, look!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
021	I can't get through. There's some kind of wall in the way. The stairs stop part of the way up.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0018
022	Are the floors ahead not materialized?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
023	Remember what Nihil said? We need vast alchemical energy to get the floors to materialize.
024	He said the floors below us were formed by people that came before us spending years channeling energy into the tower.
025	Vast alchemical energy?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
026	We'll need something like a Philosopher's Stone or one of the Sacred Stones the seven kingdoms of Babel own. Maybe even what little Alchemia that flows within people would help.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
027	Oh, come on. National treasures like the Sacred Stones or some Philosopher's stone aren't just gonna fall from the sky.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0027
028	...
029	Kuro, help me.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0041
030	Hey...	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0025
031	Nnngh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0042
032	Hey. What the hell are you doing?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
033	I have some Alchemia to spare. I should be able to...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
034	Haa...haa...haa...!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0015
035	Stop!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0015
036	But we have to...!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0019
037	A couple of steps materializing isn't gonna matter. Besides...	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
038	Urk...! Blegck!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
039	How many times have you transformed today?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
040	But...but...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
041	We can make it this far. Isn't it enough we figured that much out for now? We don't have to rush this.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
042	Still, I... I don't want to give up.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
043	So this is it, Dead Nine?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
044	We're tired. Let's go back.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
045	Tired? Did he say he's tired? Hahahahaha!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
046	I bet he is. They've been fighting for us this whole time! Heh, heh, heh.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0044
047	No one will get in our way here.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
048	Not this again.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0030
049	Don't you think this tower is a perfect grave stone for ya, King of Lost Blue?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
050	A worn out Dead Nine and a brat that can't use her Beast Form anymore. We won't get another chance like this!
051	...
052	Aw, crap. Reinforcements?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
053	Heh. This ain't good.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
054	Let's just kill Dead Nine and get out of here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
055	You're not gonna leave me?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
056	Who else is going to wipe up my puke?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0011
057	Is that all I'm good for to you?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
058	If I puke up nine beers worth of blood, you'll take care of me, won't you?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
059	I'm more surprised that you haven't left me yet, to be honest.
060	I just don't want to be some punk that can't follow his own rules.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
061	Besides, I love the way you fight.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_chara_1011
062	R-really?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
063	That's why I can trust you.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_chara_2011
064	Let's go see the real sky together someday.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
065	Kuro...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
066	Looks like my ninth escape attempt is not at all at a standstill.
