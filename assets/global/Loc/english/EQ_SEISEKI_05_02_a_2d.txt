001	Wadatsumi Expedition - Day of Departure<br>Holy Guard - Headquarters
002	Well then, let's go. We cannot be late. Let's head to the shortest route.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
003	We must, by no means, be traced...right? Leave it to me.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
004	Are you talking about me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
005	Kudan...! What are you doing here?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
006	I'm being left here on my own, so isn't it normal to want to know the content of the conflict?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
007	I'm sorry, but we can't reveal the details of the plan.	VO_zain.zain_battle_0018
008	Don't get me wrong, Kudan. We're not excluding you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
009	The reason why we're leaving headquarters under your care is that we trust in your ability.
010	What should we do?
011	What do you mean?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
012	... ...
013	Understood.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0037
014	I cannot reveal the details, but in a certain land, an artifact was discovered—one that could potentially threaten this world.
015	From now, we go to destroy it...that is our mission.
016	Lord Commander, that...!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
017	It's fine. The power contained in this artifact is so unknown that we, the entire Holy Guard, must take it on together.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
018	In that case, my power...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
019	No...there's something more important than our battle strategy...and that's the safety of the world.
020	Do you understand, Kudan? There are those of us who implement local missions...and those who uphold the safety of this world.
021	When these two wings are both well established, that's when this strategy works for the first time.
022	... ...
023	Because you are the most reliable, I am ordering you to remain behind. Please understand this.
024	I understand.
025	Right now, I don't have time...but, once I get back, I'll discuss this with him until he's convinced. I'm counting on you, Kudan.
026	Lord Commander, let's go.
027	... ...
028	Hm. Let me say something more plausible.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
029	You...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
030	Did you hear that? All of it was just your attempt to sow distrust.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
031	The Lord Commander trusts me in that way. He leaves me here because he acknowledges my strength.
032	If that's true, why did he secretly take the 4th Regiment with him?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
033	What...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
034	The one who carries the Wadatsumi royal bloodline... what was her name again, Kagura?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
035	Did you know that Zain is taking her with him to Wadatsumi?
036	Kagura?! Wait for a second, what are you talking about?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
037	Most likely, he'll use her bloodline in order to obtain the Mikaboshi.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
038	Keeping you behind wasn't an act of acknowledgment.
039	He is taking advantage of her power, and, knowing that you're close to Kagura, he wanted to avoid any hinderance.
040	That's nonsense! You're being absurd...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
041	In that case, how about you ask that knight called Kagura.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
042	That is if she hasn't already left this land. Heheh...
043	Ack...! No way...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
044	Captain! Those from headquarters ask that you hurry! Command over headquarters has already been transferred to you.
045	Hey! Did you see Kagura?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
046	Huh? Kagura?
047	Oh, now that mentioned it, I haven't seen her since last night.
048	She didn't show up for breakfast this morning either. Is something wrong?
049	Tsk!
050	Search for Kagura! I'm going to be gone for awhile! Tell the Vice-Captain to head towards headquarters. Understood?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
051	Huh...?! Ye-yes, Captain!
052	It can't be... Could Waginau's nonsense actually be the truth? Kagura, you too...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0022
053	?! Ack...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
054	Oh...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
055	Who are you?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
056	Reimei...I am the last person you will see in this world.
057	A smoke bomb?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
058	It's over.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0014
059	Whoooo!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
060	Apparently, it's not coincidence that he was avoided yet again. The captain of the 4th Regiment holds his own quite well.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
061	Are you an assassin?! Who hired you?! Was it Greed Dike?!
062	Who knows?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
063	You're not here under the Lord Commander's orders, are you?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
064	Hmph. There seems to be quiet a lot of opponents. The one who hired me, well...you can say that he's in the next life.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
065	The next life?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
066	Can't you remember? Search the corners of your memory...as you die!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0022
