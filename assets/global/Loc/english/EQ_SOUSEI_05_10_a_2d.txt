001	I've finished analyzing the composition of this shield, but...
002	There's no mistaking it. It's Sephirium.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
003	I never thought we'd find this material in the Invidia Belt.
004	And it's very similar in form to that which Ambrosia showed us in the Luxuria Belt.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
005	What is going on here?
006	...
007	King Patricius said this shield was once part of an "ark" that saved their people.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
008	So the question is, what was this ark? Who was able to build such a thing back when the Cursed Beasts first awakened?
009	We'll have to go without an answer for the time being. As of now, there are more pressing matters to focus on.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
010	Right. We've got to focus on what we can do in the time we have left.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
011	Let's get started on the Silver Shield. It's time to fix up this ancient treasure!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0037
012	Don't forget that even if it does resemble some things we encountered in the past, it's not something we know very well.
013	We'll have to work quickly and carefully.
014	Yes, I know. Leave this to me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
015	There you are. Did you get us a ship?
016	I'm sorry... It seems that the tidal wave from before has rendered most of our vessels unable to take to sea.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0036
017	Yikes, that's no good. What do we do now? Start swimming?
018	While wearing armor? We'd sink like a pair of bricks.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
019	I've come up with another idea. Wait here!
020	Got it, I won't move an inch.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
021	Huh? What are you doing here?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
022	You're, uh... Adaleigh, right? I should be asking you that question.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
023	I'm getting ready to observe the Leviathan. It's out at sea, you know? But it's just a quick hop and a skip away for my airship!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
024	...
025	That's it!
026	Wh-whoa! What's gotten into you?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
027	I'm back! Good news, I arranged a fishing boat we can borrow and...huh?
028	Sorry for getting you wrapped up in something so dangerous, Adaleigh.
029	It's fine, it's fine. Nothing wrong with lending a helping hand!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0037
030	It's not like I disagree with that, but shouldn't you have checked in with Nimul first?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
031	Eh, but it'd be a pain to explain everything. In an emergency situation like this it's better to do first, explain later!
032	Besides, this is a great chance to observe the Leviathan too! Two birds, one stone!
033	That's what I'm planning to say when Nimul yells at me later, at least!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
034	Yeah, yeah... I got it, it's fine.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
035	This is just like that time in the Acedia Belt Region. Engineers, always just doing whatever they think is right without thinking twice...
036	They say blood is thicker than water, but it doesn't seem like it made a real difference in your case...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
037	Did you just compare me to Icona?! That's insensitive! And I'm nothing like her!
038	Anyway, how much longer do you think it'll take us?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
039	Over to the eastern reefs, right? Take a look, you can see it already—
040	Restore power to the engines! The wind is against us! Leviathan will catch up at this rate!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
041	The fact it hasn't noticed us yet is the one small mercy we have going for us... We're like mere pebbles on a rocky road to that thing.
042	But just our proximity to it is making the waters extremely turbulent! This is not good!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0043
043	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_leviathan.leviathan_battle_0001
044	Will it be unable to follow us if we get closer to land?!
045	Oh dear, this won't do. You're going to strand yourselves on the reefs if you keep going this way.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0014
046	Andechs?! Damn it, he's come to take our heads!
047	Now, now, you think your heads are valuable enough to risk getting mauled by a Cursed Beast to get them?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0017
048	Then what are you up to?! Don't tell me you actually came to save us?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
049	Ouch. Is that really so hard to believe? This is a reconnaissance ship, right? Not too many people in the crew?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
050	We'll drop a ladder from the airship, so I suggest that everybody who wants to live hold on tight.
051	Huh? You're serious?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
052	First you betray us and kill your brethren, and now you're coming to save us?! Make up your mind!
053	We're kinda in a hurry here, you know... But if you must know, I'll tell you.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
054	I just do what I think is right. Nothing too complicated.
055	I won't act against my own sense of justice, even if that means dunking my reputation right down into the mud.
056	...Justice? That's why you came to rescue us—?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
057	Are you going take this chance to survive or not?
058	Ngh, fine! I might regret this, but...everybody gather here! We're escaping to the skies!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
059	There's a good boy. Adaleigh, get us out of here!
060	Hm, I'm trying to lower the ladder, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
061	Is there a problem?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
062	A whole swarm of monsters managed to peel away from the Leviathan, and they're headed straight for the ship!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
063	We're going to be overrun before we evacuate everyone!
064	I see... In that case, someone is going to need to guard the rear.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
065	What are you planning?
066	You all, climb up! I'll take care of this!
067	Gyuuuuaaa!
