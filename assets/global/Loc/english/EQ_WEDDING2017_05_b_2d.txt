001	Phew! It seems like that was the last of the renegade Alkaroids.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
002	Apparently, the Peacekeepers have caught the perpetrator who unleashed the Alkaroids.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
003	So? Can you continue, Vanekis?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0002
004	All right... The happiness that I'm talking about...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0017
005	I was thinking that this feeling of happiness when we put on the wedding dress like this... It's something we need to be able to feel on our own.
006	I realized once again that this is the reason why we, as Phantoms, are here.
007	... ...
008	By becoming Phantoms, I have had the opportunity to fight by your side, to put on lovely wedding dresses like this, but...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0002
009	The happiness I feel by wearing this wedding dress...or the peace that allows for weddings...it belongs to the people living now on this continent.
010	It's for the wishes of those died without becoming Phantoms...
011	We've gone far ahead of all of that... That's why we should put the happiness of others first.
012	First, we should start from there.
013	I see.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0020
014	You're...right.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0018
015	Ohh...!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
016	I'm sorry...if I messed up the fun atmosphere...	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0036
017	No...I got it now! Let's make peace and protect!
018	But...after everything is finished, it's fine, right?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
019	There's no reason why we can't get married because we're Phantoms, right?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
020	Ehehe... You're right.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0007
021	We'll celebrate it properly then when the time comes.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0008
022	Yes! Kon will celebrate it too!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0037
023	Oh, the bell! It's started!	VO_eve.eve_chara_1012
024	Wow! So lovely!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0046
025	Mission accomplished. Let's go home.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0007
026	Yes, let's go back.	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0005
027	Really? You're not gonna watch the event?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
028	Everyone, look towards the back of the venue! Today...these lovely brides have watched over this event.
029	Huh?!

032	Ahaha! Wow!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0008
033	He-hey! Let's go home quickly! I don't think I can take all this attention!	VO_vanekis.vanekis_sys_0018
034	Y-yes, let's go!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0050
035	Come on! Let's enjoy it! We're brides! Let's have everyone see it as well!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0025
036	Ahahah! So, this is how a bride is celebrated by everyone!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
037	It's the best!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
038	Wishing you a future filled with happiness.
