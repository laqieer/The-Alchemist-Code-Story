001	Numaaa!
002	We've managed to chase them all outside. That being said, what was driving them into such a frenzy?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
003	My guess is that this was the cause.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
004	Huh? This candy?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
005	What?! But I haven't put anything strange inside it!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
006	True...unlike last time... there aren't any particularly strange ingredients in this candy.	VO_alexis.alexis_sys_0031
007	Hey. There wasn't anything necessarily strange in the candy we had previously either!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0012
008	... ...
009	It's true that the ingredients themselves are relatively normal. However, since Neica was the one who made them, her powerful mana must have affected the finished product.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
010	There's enough powerful mana in this candy to make all these Rattys get excited?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0012
011	St-stop, please! I don't possess any powerful mana!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0013
012	Hey, would it be all right to distribute that candy? You're gonna give these to the townsfolk, right? Are you sure it won't poison them?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0003
013	The ingredients are of the regular sort. Besides, I can only sense a small amount of mana from this candy. It's unlikely to have an effect on them.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
014	However, for some reason, those Rattys alone seem to be responding strongly to the mana within the candy.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0022
015	Hey, Magnus. What happened to the Rattys who stole the candy and ran away?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
016	...This isn't looking good. If the smell alone causes them to react like that, imagine what might happen if they actually eat the candy. They could go on a rampage all across town.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0029
017	We've got no time to waste! Everyone, let's go!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1001
018	Numaaa! Numaaa!
019	Hey, Rattys! Stop going crazy all over the town!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1024
020	Numa, numu, numaaa! Numa, numu, numaaa! Numa, numu, numaaa!
021	It's not working. They've worked themselves into a frenzy. I can't get through to them. I've no choice but to calm them a little forcefully.	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0021
022	Numaaa!
