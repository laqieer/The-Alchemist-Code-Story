001	Hazel! You completely destroyed it...	VO_carol.carol_sys_0050
002	Well, better safe than sorry.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0031
003	Hey! What do you mean "better safe than sorry"?! That's my service Guard Droid! You've broken it beyond repair!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
004	I apologize for having placed your possession out of commission. However...this Guard Droid is not made for service work, is it?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0003
005	Huh? What are you talking about?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
006	This is the same type of machine that is used in battle to hurt people.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0012
007	Within Slothstein, you need a permit in order to use a battle android. I don't seem to see one.
008	Is this really a service Guard Droid?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
009	Tsk. You think you're so darn smart, don't you? A real pain...argh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
010	...Sigh.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0030
011	Are you all right? Everything is okay now; let's go home. I'm sorry. You must've been scared.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
012	It took me by surprise, but why are you the one that's apologizing to me, Hazel? ...Also, those are my bags.	VO_carol.carol_chara_1002
013	It's fine. I'll carry them.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
014	Seriously. Not only are you overprotective, Hazel, but you're also stubborn.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0016
015	Hmm. Really?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
016	All right. Here are your bags, Carol. Good luck with the spring cleaning.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
017	Thank you for helping me all the way home... Huh? Now that I look closely, your arms and legs are covered in cuts, Hazel!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0033
018	You carried my bags so at least let me tend to your wounds.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
019	Oh, this is nothing.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
020	Please! You're just like Vincent. It's really not good for you to brush off these kinds of things.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0015
021	Heheh. Someone's mad... All right then, would you mind if I asked for your help?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0008
022	Huh? This wound over here... It looks too old to have been inflicted just now. Anyway, I'll tend to it as well.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0031
023	Thank you, Carol. I'm so proud of you for being able to handle various tasks.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
024	There you go again!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0016
025	Hazel, you—
026	I thought I'd find you here! Who would've thought you two were the acquaintance and the maid of the Wizard of the Land of Machines?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
027	Thanks to you, I'm out of business!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
028	An apology won't suffice. You'd better take responsibility and have the Wizard of the Land of Machines create a higher quality Guard Droid for me!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
029	Wha...what are you talking about?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0025
030	I will not let you lay a finger on this place or on Carol!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0012
031	Hey, Hazel, I haven't finished tending to your wounds at all! You can't move!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0029
032	No...that's enough. Carol, it's not safe; stand back. There's no need for you to face anymore scary situations.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
033	Hazel...! Why are you always trying to do everything on your own?!	VO_carol.carol_battle_0019
034	You're putting yourself just as much in harm's way, Hazel!	VO_carol.carol_chara_1011
035	...?!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0025
036	All uninvited guests will not be allowed to take one step into this manor! This place is currently under my care during Vincent's absence!	VO_carol.carol_battle_0012
