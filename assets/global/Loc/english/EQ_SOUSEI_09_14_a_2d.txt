001	Hyaaahh!!!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
002	Your attacks are stronger and quicker than last time! Before, they were so small and tentative. But there's more to it than even that.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0044
003	Adjusting for interference via Space-Time Manipulation... Accelerating the right arm. Freezing time for the left leg. Materialized a foothold to your rear! Keep it up; you're doing great!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0001
004	Got it! Thanks!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
005	Hmm. Using such techniques to augment your physical attacks is a good way to bolster your strength against single opponents, indeed.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0042
006	And you've got numbers on your side, to boot! How fun! It seems I won't have to hold back at all.
007	...!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
008	So, how long do you think you can last? Your body can't handle being enhanced in such a manner forever!
009	I can keep going...for as long as I need to!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
010	I am the Shield Maiden of the Invidia Belt! This is my sworn duty!
011	I cannot abandon those I am meant to protect!
012	You've got spirit, to be sure! But spirit can only take you so far.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0024
013	Nggh. This is...little more than a war of attrition at this point.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0019
014	...!
015	(She's weakened! Now's my chance!)
016	Wait, Daphne! We didn't plan for this! I don't have enough time to boost—	VO_mela.mela_battle_0019
017	Don't get cocky!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0001
018	Curses! She blo—
019	Gaaah!	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0022
020	I acknowledge your strength, little lady. Haha.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0016
021	I'll admit, I was not prepared to expend so much energy on but a single battle.
022	Presumably Matia is dealing with a similarly difficult situation on her end.
023	But the one thing I can't stand... The one thing I can never abide...is giving up before the struggle has truly ended. That will be your downfall!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
024	Wh-why...?
025	Why are you...doing this?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
026	Need you even ask?
027	Yes. Because you, too, had the title of Shield Maiden...and yet...
028	Now you're trying to...end mankind's future?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0006
029	I...
030	There is someone I'm fighting for. No matter what may become of her, and no matter what horrible acts she may do...	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0031
031	I must be there for her.
032	So... You've got your own motives.	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
033	Well, it's the same for me!
034	......
035	I have my own obligations to fulfill. There are people I've sworn to protect...no matter what.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
036	So I must bring an end to this battle, here and now!
037	Your king... He said that true power reveals itself when it's wielded to protect something. And he spoke those words of the knights of Envy.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
038	There are people who believed in me from the very start.
039	As a knight of Invidia, I will lay my life on the line for peace!
040	I am Daphne, Shield Maiden of Sodom!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
041	......
042	Yes, that...applies to me as well, of course.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
043	Haha. But the future I fought for can no longer come to pass. So my shield no longer has a destiny to protect.
044	"We are the ones who embrace Envy..."	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0007
045	Then I'll protect everyone with this shield. For both of us!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0032
