001	No! Have they already infiltrated the castle?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0016
002	Zeke is planning on executing his long-hidden, secret plan!
003	His long-hidden...? I thought my father had a change of heart after his encounter with the Lizard Brigade?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
004	That's how he wants it to appear. Zeke's plan can be traced back to 20 years ago.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
005	It was set in motion during the Dawn of Wrath when Wratharis was destroyed.
006	Twenty years ago? That's impossible. Stop spewing nonsense!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
007	I told you that I had undeniable evidence. That evidence is Agatha, the girl you call your sister.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
008	Her existence stands as proof of his plan.
009	Agatha...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
010	Are you talking about how he found her on the battlefield? I already know that—	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
011	To be accurate, he found her inside the royal castle of Wratharis.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
012	The royal castle? What do you mean?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
013	It appears he hasn't told you the truth.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
014	That girl is the legitimate heir to the royal family of Wratharis. She is none other than the princess.
015	Wh-what?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
016	Agatha is the Princess of Wratharis?! How is that possible?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0020
017	Moreover, the girl has an even larger, hidden secret.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
018	Wh-what is it?! Tell me!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
019	Agatha works part time at a fancy cafe.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0030
020	What?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
021	There's more.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
022	She goes barbecuing with friends on weekends, hangs out at nighttime pool parties, and even attends foam parties.
023	Wha— Agatha is becoming a party girl?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0028
024	She is also secretly performing as an idol.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
025	No! This is exactly what father wanted!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0021
026	It all started when Zeke sent an application form in to an agency.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
027	He had raised her specifically for this purpose.
028	He loves idols so much...that he raised one himself.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
029	Zeke... I must end your rampage with my sword of justice!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
030	I asked what have you done, Dias. Answer...me.	148_a_2d.logi_story0105_0095
031	...	148_a_2d.dios_story0105_0071
032	I said answer me, Dias! Answer!	148_a_2d.logi_story0105_0096
033	I killed him... I killed the man I once admired as...my father.	148_a_2d.dios_story0105_0072
034	You!	148_a_2d.logi_story0105_0097
035	It was all to protect Agatha! If you share his beliefs, then I'll have no mercy on you as well!	148_a_2d.dios_story0105_0073
036	I don't need your mercy! I'm going to shatter that notion out of your mind!	148_a_2d.logi_story0105_0098
037	No! Stop!	148_a_2d.agasa_story0105_0057
038	How did it come to this? Why must I be called Headstrong Dias?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
039	What would Yuffie think? I'm sure she would worry... Tch! Where did I go wrong?!
040	I...! I...!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
041	April Fools... Never did I expect that I would meet you on this day.
050	Don't you know what this day is about, Dias?
042	You again?! Just who the hell are you?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
043	Oh, how this game never changes. Did you forget who I am?
044	I'm the TAC Producer!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0008
045	Wha—?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
046	All of your recent actions are the result of having consumed that Alchemy Mushroom.
051	They draw out the innermost desires of people in the most twisted and excessive manner.	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0010
047	You're telling me everything is your doing?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
048	That's right! You have a problem with that?!	VO_imaizumip.imaizumip_sys_0037
049	I cannot let this sin go unpunished.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
