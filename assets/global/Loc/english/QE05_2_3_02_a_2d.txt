001	Spiritbonding, huh?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
002	It is said to be a mystical power the Sephira were able to use.
003	I've been told it was even able to heal the earth and cultivate life.
004	Who told you this?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
005	Well, uh...
006	I'm sorry, I've already said too much. For some reason, I felt safe opening up to you...
007	Let me warn you: Looking for the Sephira is a waste of your time.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
008	What? Why is that?
009	The blessings of the great Tree of Life have been lost. The other Sephira have lost their ability to use Spiritbonding, just as your mother has.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
010	How did you...?! You must be...!
011	Go back to your home, Hawk. Those who live here are little more than refugees who have lost their powers and seek a peaceful life.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
012	W-wait, but...
013	Ugh, ow... That guy was really tough!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
014	Why is it always like this?! No matter what, fortune favors the nobles over us!
015	The Sephira! Don't they know that's just a myth?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
016	Would you mind elaborating on that?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
017	Wha—?
018	How long do you intend on following me?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
019	Until you accept my request! Please, lend me your—
020	—No, wait. Teach me how to use Spiritbonding!
021	Has your mother taught you nothing?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
022	My mother did not tell me much.
023	Only that if I do not have the mark, I should forget about my heritage... She said that right before she died.
024	Your mother was wise. Listen, Hawk... Spiritbonding has already been lost.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
025	Even if those of our bloodline have a natural aptitude for it, our sephirah, which was how we wielded our Spiritbonding, have all been lost.
026	S-sephirah...?
027	What you called a "mark" is the catalyst which enabled us to sense and control nature's Alchemia.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
028	As a result, as I've been trying to tell you, we are now merely a nameless community that does not have the power to bring green life back to this desert.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
029	But...
030	But still you have your uses.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
031	Wh-what?! Where did you come from?!
032	...
033	Finally, I've found a surviving member of the Sephira!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
034	If your people have forgotten how to use your inherited powers, then we shall make better use of them for you!
035	Mister Kamui! Leave this to me! Run—!
036	Well, that took a lot longer than I thought. I was beginning to worry that none of you had noticed the bait.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
037	Huh?
038	Wha—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
039	Now, I have a few questions I need to ask you. Are you willing to surrender without making trouble?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
