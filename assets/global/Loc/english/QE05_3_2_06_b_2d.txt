001	Just as Kamui said, this place really is a nest for monsters!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
002	Yeah, it sure looks like it!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
003	Will this place really lead us to Agatha?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
004	It will. If you want proof of that fact, then...look.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
005	What?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
006	How is this possible?! Beelzebub is...glowing! But it's power should have been lost!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
007	Leviathan!
008	The Sacred Stones are reacting to the residual energy of the Door.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
009	The two stones should resonate with each other upon the altar and show us the way to Satna.
010	Let's go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
011	So, they are heading to the arboreal altar.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
012	Protector, lead us to the key that will unlock Sephiron's rebirth as foretold by the stars.
