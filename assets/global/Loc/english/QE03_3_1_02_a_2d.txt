001	Agh! My body is at its limit!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
002	Enough! Stop! I'll heal you right now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0015
003	Heal me? Heheh. You're truly an evil girl!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0025
004	Why?! I just—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
005	Why would I want to be cared for by the enemy, healed, and live a long life? I will not endure such a shameful life!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
006	A shameful life?! Why would you say that?!
007	I'm sure you came into this world being loved by someone...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
008	My life is my own. If I cannot live the life I have envisioned for myself, then there is no value to it.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0039
009	No...that's nonsense!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
010	That's the path of a mage. Remember that, girl.
011	I will receive your soul! I will complete my own path! Protect the queen!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0027
012	Y-you idiots...! H-how can you value your lives so little?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0006
