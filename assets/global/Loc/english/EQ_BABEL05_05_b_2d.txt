001	...
002	What's the point of this?
003	Wratharis - Ruins of an Ancient Babel Civilization
004	Hm? You're the one who was with Will earlier.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0005
005	Why are you doing this?
006	I don't owe you an explanation, do I?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
007	I want to know!
008	If you knew you would be dead by the end of the day...	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
009	...
010	If—knowing that—you came across a bet that could win you a fortune...
011	You'd take it, right?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
012	You'd throw in every last coin you have on you.
013	That's how I feel right now.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
014	I don't...get what...you're saying.
015	It's called a crapshoot.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
016	How can you keep going, even though you know there's no future laid out before you?
017	I've been standing still for long enough.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
018	Even geniuses need exercise.
019	Huh?
020	I'm gonna show them what my mind is capable of.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0023
021	I started this game.
022	I'm the only one with anything to win or lose.
023	Besides, it's not like I have time to think this over anymore.
024	...
025	You're late.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0002
026	How...gallant of you to wait for us.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
027	Well, I just figured that you were tired of chasing after me.	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1010
028	You know too much.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
029	Don't worry. I haven't told anybody.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
030	I'm holding all the cards.
031	Wha—?! You...! How do you have that stone?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
032	It came from the ruins of an ancient civilization in Slothstein.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0031
033	I stole it from an old friend of mine.
034	This is pretty inconvenient for you, isn't it?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0012
035	Hand it over!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
036	No way.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0039
037	The odds of winning at any game come down to how masterfully you can place your opponent at a disadvantage.
038	What are you—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
039	You should have planned for this.
040	No! The stone...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
041	Looks like my calculations were correct. I thought that I could make it shatter if I imbued it with just the right level of Alchemia from this angle.
042	Why you...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
043	Now Slothstein's stone is out of play.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
044	Deal with it.
045	Surround him! We must kill him at all costs.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
046	We cannot afford to let him live.
047	Come on, then. Try me.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
048	I'm the root of all your problems.
