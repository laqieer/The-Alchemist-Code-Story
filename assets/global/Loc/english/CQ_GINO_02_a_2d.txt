001	Hyaaah!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
002	Ugh…! Ow…	VO_gino.gino_battle_0022
003	Oh, yikes… I got carried away. Are you alright?	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
004	Hmph! Just a scratch.
005	Wait, that was a little deep. If you're injured…	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
006	Huh? If I'm taken down by a little injury like this, how could I become a real knight?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0016
007	Don't apologize for hurting me. It's better to get hurt and endure the pain for battle…
008	Heh… I thought you were just a spoiled brat, but you have confidence in yourself.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0044
009	I'm not apologizing for being a brat.
010	Idiot, I'm complimenting you. And your skills with the sword are fairly good. That made me go at you stronger than I should have.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
011	…!
012	Well, just a bit.
013	W-wait… Once more! I'll promise to give it my all this time.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
014	Hey, Victor! That looked a bit too strong there. Hold yourself back! They're still just cadets, remember?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
015	Uh oh… the commander.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
016	You're quite impressive, young man. To be able to move like that…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
017	He is the shining star of the boarding school. He happens to be Fraise's younger brother…
018	F-Fraise's younger brother?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
019	…
020	I see now. Excellence in brotherhood, as it stands. I'm looking forward to things.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0044
021	For real…? You're his brother…
022	…
023	There was a rumor that his younger brother was at the boarding school. I should've known it was you by the way you moved.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
024	(Jeez… Even this guy won't shut up about him…)
025	Well, let's forget about him. Shall we do another round?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
026	…
027	Hm? Hey Gino. What's wrong?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
028	Enough. I'm not in the mood anymore.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
029	Huh? Why?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
030	It frustrates me. Everyone always talks about him to me…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0030
031	Even if I do my best, they say "Because you're Fraise's brother." If I do something bad they say "But you're Fraise's brother." I'm sick of it.
032	Gino…
033	So what if I'm his brother? If I'm strong it has nothing to do with him.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0010
034	You're really bothered by it. But it seems you're the one that's the most concerned by it.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
035	Wha…?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
036	I don't recall ever saying or thinking "Because he's the younger brother…"
037	In addition, if you really wanted to become a knight, you shouldn't care about that and think of more important things, don't you think?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
038	…
039	Alright! That's it for today's training session. Gather round!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
040	Oh, already finished for today. Let's go then.
041	Think of more important things...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
042	Hmph! Hyah!
043	Fraise, you're still training?
044	Yeah. If I train hard, I can become a proud knight.
045	Once I become a strong and powerful knight, we can live peacefully.
046	We don't have to rely on others and live life freely together.
047	Plus, as a knight I can protect many people as well.
048	If I do that, we'll never lose anyone else, right?
049	Brother…
050	Hyah! Hyaaah!	VO_gino.gino_battle_0001
051	Tsk… Still not satisfied at all…	VO_gino.gino_battle_0019
052	"Excellence in brotherhood?" What is that supposed to mean? Does not make things easier at all!
053	Hm? What was that sound?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
054	P-please! Please let me go!
055	…?! Someone's voice…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
056	P-please! Spare my life! I have a young child…
057	Shut up! Like we care!
058	Those are…the bandits that the instructor was talking about.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0022
059	…
060	Perfect. I can take those guys on.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0045
061	A knight must protect the people. I must protect that man…and use my skills to help him.
062	I'm destined to become a knight. And to be a stronger one than him…	VO_gino.gino_sys_0037
