001	…
002	(…Tamba has put a lot of pressure on himself because of me.)	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
003	It's too dangerous…there's no way we can allow this.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0014
004	That's not for you to decide… What is your objective?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
005	I realized my lack of power during the last battle. I'd like to train myself.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
006	That doesn't mean you should attack a human settlement by yourself…!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
007	I don't see any harm in it.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
008	What if something were to happen to her when she's by herself? Kaede is a valuable asset. Why put her in unnecessary danger?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
009	We were outmatched in the last battle. If you come across the leader of humans, retreat. That should be enough.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
010	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
011	As her older brother, it is your duty to see to your sister's development… Kaede, you have my blessing.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
012	Thank you very much.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0033
013	…
014	What do they call that emotion that demon's lack--familial love? You two share that strength.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
015	If Kaede does not grow, the humans may well overtake us.
016	We must avoid that at all costs. Agreed?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
017	…Yes.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
018	Now, really apply yourself--to the best of your ability.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
019	…Kaede.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
020	I'm sorry, Tamba. It's just that--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0035
021	I can't have you protecting me all the time.
022	What are you talking about? You did an amazing job last time.
023	I still can't devour humans… That's not "normal," is it?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
024	…
025	You somehow managed to do it, but me…
026	That's--	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
027	That's why I need to get stronger.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
028	…
029	…Fine. Just promise me this.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0037
030	Promise you'll come back here alive.
031	…I promise.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
032	(...It's my fault I can't eat humans.)	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
033	(It was my powerlessness that caused me pain.)
034	(I can't keep having my brother carry a burden that's meant for me...)	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0030
035	(…That's why I have to overcome this myself--for his sake.)
036	...I have to take the first step.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
037	(…Made it.)
038	…
039	Well, I'll be! You came back!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0044
040	You gotta try my latest dish! We can talk after! Don't just stand there, come on in!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
041	...Not today.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
042	Huh?
043	…Today's the day...I'm going to devour you.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
044	Must be hungry. You haven't forgotten what I told you, right? Alright, alright! This is a good sign.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
045	…What are you so cheerful about? I said I’m going to devour you!?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
046	Although I'm sure you'll try to kill me or call your human friends!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0012
047	…Um, probably not.
048	What is it with you!? Other humans see me and they want to kill me…because I'm a demon… But you…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0001
049	Why are you so different!?
050	…Why?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
051	…Hm, good question. You know what I always say, though--	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
052	"Eat first, talk later!"
053	…!!!
054	To tell you the truth, you stopped by kinda suddenly, so I'm a little low on ingredients… Would you mind waiting a few minutes. I'd really appreciate it!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
055	…Once I devour you, I'll have no more business here.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
056	But, I thought you can't eat people?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0002
057	I'm going to try.
058	You shouldn't force yourself to eat people, y'know.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0030
059	…There's no use trying to argue!	VO_kaede.kaede_battle_0001
060	Wait-Wait-Wait-Wait!! I can't have you go rampaging again.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0026
061	I don't care as long as I devour you!!
062	…Sheesh…Tough customer, aren't you? Why don't we make a bet?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0016
063	A bet?
064	If I can make you sit at the table, you've got to try my dish.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
065	If I can't, go ahead and devour me. Deal?
066	Have it your way…and no going back on your word.
067	Course not! I wouldn't dream of it.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
068	I'm gonna make you eat your words! Let's do this!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0010
