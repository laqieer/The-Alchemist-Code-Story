001	Prepare yourself!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0040
002	"Sorry"?! Your meaningless apology insults me!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0016
003	Huzzaahhh!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0032
004	As if you would be forgiven for such impudence!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
005	Ngh!
006	If simply apologizing was enough to solve problems, I wouldn't need Imperial Security to begin with!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0013
007	Tch! You—!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0042
008	And I certainly would have had no need for you!
009	Aaarghh!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0025
010	Know your place, traitorous scum!
011	You think I didn't know how this would play out?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
012	What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
013	I know I can't best you.
014	What's this?! Your wounds have...healed?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0022
015	Hrk!
016	Who...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
017	Goodness...
018	The shrine maiden?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0019
019	Here you are again, covered in wounds. I thought the idea was to avoid getting hit?
020	You traitorous bastard!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0013
021	Senken...
022	Damn it! I'm within reach of his blade! I can't—!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0020
023	Akashi!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0004
024	Aaaaarrghhh!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0020
025	Sheathe your sword, Lion Monarch!
026	Fool! If you have time to make ridiculous demands...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
027	Nrgh!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0022
028	Then you'd better keep swinging your sword! Huzzaaah!
029	You would heal him again, wench?! You can barely stand!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0042
030	Mitsu...! Thank you.
031	Just finish him.
032	Huzzaaaaaahhh!	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0032
033	Hrgh! Aaaaaarghh! Nrgh...	VO_orione.orione_battle_0026
034	...
035	Y-you bastard! You planned this...didn't you?! You planned to use that wench...from...the very...start!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
036	Goodbye.
037	Lily! You are naught...but a flea on my hide! I will not forget this! This isn't...the end!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0017
038	You will regret this, daylily!
039	After him! The head of Imperial Security has turned traitor!
040	D. Lily! Have you gone mad?!
041	Let's get out of here.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
042	He's right, you know. You will regret this.
043	It's a little too late for that now.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0010
044	Are you sure it's wise to take me with you? There's no telling what a beast like that will do without its dinner. I was supposed to be the sacrifice.
045	You are not a sacrifice, Mitsu.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0017
046	Oh?
047	No one's going to eat you. I won't let them. That's cannibalism.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
048	Pfft... Ahahaha!
049	D-don't laugh.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0019
050	Have you gotten me that bouncy ball yet, coward?
051	Mm-mmm! I've outdone myself this time. I really am one talented individual!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
052	This should make up for our little fight the other day. After all, I'm sure the boss was just looking out for me.
053	Besides, I'm glad I can give him something to look forward to at the end of a long, hard day. This is what family is all about!
054	Ahh, I can't wait! Tonight's dinner is going to be a good one, I can feel it!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0009
