001	Hmm? What's this huge disturbance in the magil? Don't tell me—	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
002	Hah! You're wide open!	VO_mela.mela_battle_0001
003	Ugh! You snotty brats. You've gotten a lot stronger since the last time I saw you! A little too strong, if you ask me!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0027
004	Where did you even learn to fight using Space-Time Manipulation?!
005	We watched somebody we know do it, and took notes!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
006	You cheeky little...!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0022
007	(Did something happen to Emmel? This magil response is not normal. I swear, if it's not one thing today, it's another!)
008	Stay still and let us tie you up already!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
009	Sorry, I have other plans right now. I don't have the space or the time to keep playing with you children.
010	Ooh, that sounds like loser talk to me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0010
011	Sure, we'll call it that. Later, you precocious little brats!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
012	Hey, wait!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
013	That's a shame. Guess we'll have to continue schooling him another time.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
014	Yeah, that's too bad. But we have bigger concerns right now ourselves!
015	Hey! We just wrapped up on our side, too. Let's catch up with Nimul and the others, fast! I have a feeling something's going down.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
016	Right. Let's go!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
017	Emmel! Hang in there!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0018
018	How is she, Eulalia?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
019	Thankfully, none of her vitals were hit, but she's bleeding out quite a lot. I don't know how much I can do with the tools I have on hand, even with my healing techniques.
020	Use my magil as well.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
021	Okay! Thanks!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0006
022	You can't die yet, Emmel. You said you were going to save everyone, remember? If you die now, you won't be able to save anyone!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0018
023	I'll stabilize her if it's the last thing I do! Nimul, don't let that guy get any more shots in!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
024	Got it. I'll leave her to you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
025	Is this how the Infinite Serpent does things?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
026	It is. How does it feel to experience the impermanence of this world firsthand?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
027	What are you even getting at?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
028	Ignacio!
029	What do you want?
030	How... How could you?! Why would you?!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
031	How? Why? Well...Nimul, let me just ask you a simple question. Maybe that'll make things a bit clearer.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0001
032	When you say you're going to save "everything and everyone"...	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
033	Am I included in that list?
034	...Huh?
035	Nimul... Don't—	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0022
036	Nimul, what are you doing?!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0025
037	Did you...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
038	Did you shoot Emmel just so you could ask me that question?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
039	I see. So this is what you consider to be righteousness, is it?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
040	As you wish, then. Go ahead and kill me with that power. Kill me with Alchemy.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
041	Ignacio!!!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
