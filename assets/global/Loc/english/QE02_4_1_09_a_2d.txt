001	Wh-what's with this trembling?! Is it an earthquake?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
002	I-it's intense! Eeek!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0043
003	Heh! This is our chance, Tara baby!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
004	I said stop calling me that!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
005	Hyaahhhhh!!!
006	Wh-whoa... You took out all those Alkaroids in a single moment?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
007	Even if they could predict our movements, it seems like they lacked information regarding natural disasters.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
008	Seriously, you people...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0030
009	Could Ronnie have been right? Was this a miracle from the gods in order to protect the young lady?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
010	Huh? Ah!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
011	No. If my estimate is correct, this earthquake is no miracle.
012	It's a terrifying omen that has to do with the Sacred Stone Belphegor.
013	Belphegor? What do you mean by that?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
014	I'm still hoping that it's just my imagination. I'll explain it to you once I'm more certain.
015	I'm still skeptical myself, so I doubt you would believe me if I told you.
016	Hmph. Stop with the air of pomp already.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
017	Squeak! Squ-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0007
018	Edgar! It's Allie!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0016
019	Are Alkaroids closing in?! But, I can't see any...	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0042
020	Ssshhh... Hohhh...
021	What the...?! Don!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0025
022	Calm yourself! Hmph. I didn't know there was such massive droid scum. I thought it was a moving church or something.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
023	I feel you. Let's just hope it's all show and no bite. Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
