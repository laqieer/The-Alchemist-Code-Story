001	It's so blue...!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0009
002	Sharon, look! It's the sea!
003	Nngh... There's no need to shout! I can hear you just fine!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
004	Oops! Sorry, Sharon! I've never really been to the sea before, so I'm a little excited.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
005	We are here to patrol the beach, correct?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
006	Of course!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
007	Apparently some unidentified monsters have been sighted around here at night.
008	That's a very vague report. How am I supposed to prepare without any concrete information?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
009	That's not my fault! You see...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
010	I was having a balmy time on this beach with my babycakes, and those giant monsters just totally came out of nowhere.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0020
011	Huh? What'd they look like? I dunno. I was too busy running for my life to, like, memorize random little details like that! Duh.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
012	I was screaming bloody murder, running like a steam train in the opposite direction... My swimming trunks fell right off. Slid right down to my ankles, and then just...poof! Never saw them again...
013	It was so terrifying! But my cuddlebug protected me, so it ended up being the best summer ever! Even without his swimming trunks.	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0018
014	Oh, babycakes...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0010
015	Cuddlebug...	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0010
016	...
017	That's not so much vague as...lovey-dovey...mush.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
018	Yeah, it was a bit much... But you can't blame them! The beach in summer is a magical place!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0011
019	Right... Whatever.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
020	Anyway, I hope we can resolve this situation as quietly as possible, before any real harm is done.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
021	I don't want anyone else's summer fun to be ruined by those monsters!
022	Indeed. Let's put our best feet forward and patrol this beach to the best of our ability!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
023	Come to think of it...weren't there meant to be three of us on patrol today?
024	Oh, yeah. That'd be Kaya, but she's going to be doing her own thing. She said there was something she wanted to check out.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
025	Huh? Check what out, exactly?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0005
026	I, um, kinda forgot to ask her that.
027	It'll be fine! I'm sure Kaya knows what she's doing.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0023
028	Even so, she really ought to be following her superior's commands—that means you, Bertha!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
029	(That's surprising, coming from Sharon. She's really come a long way. Ahh, they grow up so fast...)
030	What is it? Why are you smiling at me like that?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0012
031	Heheh. No reason!
032	Anyway, never mind her! The beach looks peaceful enough. At this rate, we might have nothing to do.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
033	I suppose...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
034	Besides, it sounds like these monsters only start coming out at night. So for right now, all we can really do is...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
035	Brrr! H-hey! Wh-what was that for?! Is that...a water cannon? Where did you...?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0026
036	I brought it with me! We're at the beach, aren't we?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
037	Once this job is over and done with, let's get to splashing in the sea!
038	N-no! No, thank you.
039	Huh? Why not? Oh! Unless...you can't swim?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
040	Wh-what?! O-of course I can swim! I just hate getting my ears wet, that's all!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
041	Really? Really, really?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
042	Really, really, really!
043	Ahoy there. Have either of you two ladies seen my captain?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
044	Captain...? Oh! Are you talking about Shenmei? Haven't seen her.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
045	I...see.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0022
046	Xiao-Xiao... Where could that girl have gotten off to? Don't tell me she's gotten herself lost again. She knows this beach is infested with...
047	Infested with...?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
048	...
049	Oh, um...?
050	U-um... I...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
051	What's the matter?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
052	U-um... Well... I...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
053	It's all right, Xiao-Xiao. No need to strain yourself. Leave the talking to me.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
054	...
055	Huh?
056	It was decided that we would be joining your beach patrols. After all, no one knows the sea like pirates.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
057	We'd planned to meet up with you landlubbers here, but somehow we managed to lose Xiao-Xiao along the way.
058	Huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
059	Um... When you say you lost Xiao-Xiao, are you talking about Shenmei?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
060	Yes. Why?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
061	W-well, then what about this girl?
062	Oh, Xiao-Xiao? She's a navigator aboard the Xiao Shenmei and—	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
063	Wait, what?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
064	Is something the matter?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
065	Shenmei is Xiao-Xiao—but so are you?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
066	U-um... I-I...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
067	Ahh, it is all becoming clear to me now. You see, xiao-xiao means small. Little one.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
068	I've been calling them both xiao-xiao for years now, so it has become something of an unshakeable habit.
069	Even now, they're both rather small.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
070	That is going to be a little confusing. What should we call you, Miss...?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
071	S-Su...!
072	Su?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
073	M-my name is...Su Yi!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
074	Got it! Nice to meet you, Su Yi!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
075	My apologies. Xiao-Xiao here...ahem. That is to say, Su Yi is rather shy. Please address your concerns to me, if you will.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0035
076	Okay... Very well. Earlier you mentioned—	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0002
077	Oh!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
078	Huh? Aaaah! O-octopuses?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
079	Hmph. Finally. You're just in time for dinner. All I need is five seconds to chop you up!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
080	Everyone in position—now!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_battle_0030
