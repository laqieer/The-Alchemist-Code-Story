001	(The war took everything from me—my home...Dad...Mom...)	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
002	Ack!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
003	You've gone and done it now, ya brat!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0013
004	Shuddap! I'm just takin' my share of the food!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
005	What's that light?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0020
006	Who cares! We let our guard down 'cause you were a girl, but we ain't gonna go easy on ya now!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
007	You're scum! Laying hands on a kid!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
008	What the hell is that light?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
009	Who gives a dang what it is! Get her!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
010	(Whenever blood rushes to my head, a weird light appears around me.)
011	Take this! Raaaaargh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
012	I said die, you piece of filth!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
013	Haaaargh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
014	Urgh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
015	Guh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
016	I ain't gonna lose to the likes of you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
017	Stop right there!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
018	Ack, it's the Holy Guard!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
019	We gotta scram!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
020	Urgh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
021	You're an orphan from the war...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
022	Oi, look. She's—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
023	An alchemist, eh? We've been looking for you, girl. Be grateful, you're under our protection now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
024	You'll be getting it all: a warm place to sleep, food, bedding—we'll give you everything you've lost!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
025	Sounds good, doesn't it? Just come with us.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
026	Shuddap.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
027	Hm? What did you say just now?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
028	I said, SHUDDAP! You're the ones who took everything from me in the first place!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
029	Yaaaaaarrgh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
030	Oompf!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0004
031	Ack!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0025
032	Stupid whelp, you dare attack the Holy Guard?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
033	Crap!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
034	Still looking to defy us, eh? We'll shut you up and take you by force then.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
035	Haaargh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
036	Guh! Ngh! Urgh...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0043
037	(I'm gettin' the crap beaten outta me! I gotta power up, so I can mop the ground with their ugly mugs!)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
038	Well? You ready to come nice and quietly?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
039	Hell no!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0013
040	Still some fight left in you, huh? Let's break one of her ankles. That oughta take the fight right out of her.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
041	Great idea. That should set her straight.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0006
042	No!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
043	Here we go!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0007
044	Aaargh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
045	Who the hell are you?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
046	The audacity! To lay hands on a child... I would expect nothing less from dogs of the Holy Order.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0021
047	Guh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
048	(He appeared outta nowhere. I couldn't see a thing, seeing as he was draped in shadows. It was like he was wearing a cloak of pitch-black darkness.)
049	Girl, what say you? Do you seek power?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
050	(Every fiber in my body told me I had no choice but to answer him.)
051	Yes... I want power.	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
052	Then come with me. I will give you what you desire—the power to decimate your enemies.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
053	Wh-who are you?	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
054	I am Zahar.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
055	(The moonlight had cast him in a silhouette.)
056	The savior of the shadows... The Shadow Messiah!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
057	The...Shadow Messiah...? I've heard of you. Weren't you fighting Envylia and the Holy Order to restore order upon Wratharis?	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
058	No, that has never been our objective.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
059	Oh...?
060	Our true objective lies not in Wratharis...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
061	But in restoring true peace to the world by eradicating the false light that shrouds it.
062	I will usher in a new world order! Where none will be shackled by poverty or wealth! True freedom will finally be upon us!
063	True...peace... True...freedom.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
064	A revolution given birth by darkness! We, the Shadow Army, shall be the ones to deliver the world unto salvation!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
065	Girl, join us, and exterminate those who have wronged you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
066	?!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
067	Lord Zahar, are you seriously considering letting her join us?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
068	I am.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
069	She's like a wild mutt! She'll brawl with anyone who locks eyes with her. At least some are lucky enough to escape with only minor bite wounds.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
070	Hm. A wild mutt, you say.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
071	Look! It's Ila! C'mon! C'mon, is that all you got?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
072	Shaddap and get back here! I'm gonna pulverize you!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
073	Ila...! Over here!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0008
074	Raaargh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
075	Haha!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0005
076	Grrrrr! Raaaawr!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
077	Ack! Stop biting me!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0043
078	...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
079	Heh heh. She's adorable.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
080	Are we seeing the same thing here?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
081	I'm referring to the alchemy within her.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
082	Corvus, you are to train her.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
083	Me?! Train her?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
084	I know of none more suited to the task.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
085	As you command...but you must see other worth besides her alchemy if you're asking me to instruct her.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
086	She is to be the ark that will carry forth our ambition.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
087	The ark that will spread our will to the rest of the world, once our new order has been established.
088	All right, then. I'll get started immediately.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
089	Ila!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
090	...
091	You're going to learn our dark arts. Get ready.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
092	What the hell are you ramblin' on about?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
093	I'm saying I'm going to teach you the real art of fighting.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
094	You're gonna teach me? I would've preferred Lord Zahar...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0022
095	You think I'm no good, don't you? For starters, you'd better learn your place. Lord Zahar doesn't have time to deal with peons like you.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
096	P-peon...?! Shaddap! I'm gonna make ya eat those words!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
097	Ha! You let your rage control you, and your alchemy suffers for it. Learning some humility will serve you well, peon!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
098	I ain't no peon!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0013
099	(He beat me to the moon...and then some.)
100	Urgh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0025
101	(I didn't even get a punch in, or a kick. I couldn't lay a finger on him! Who the hell is this guy?!)	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
102	Dangit!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
103	Have you finally realized how weak you really are?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
104	Grr...	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
105	We'll stop here for today.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
106	You've got to crawl before you learn how to walk. Fighting's no different.
107	I'll be waiting in the same spot tomorrow.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
108	Dangt! I'm gonna show you tomorrow!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
109	Hah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
110	(We sparred every single day.)
111	(And I got beat every single day, too.)
112	(But then, one day...)
113	Raaaarrrgh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
114	(I've got you now!)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0011
115	...
116	(He blocked it?!)	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
117	Lemme go!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0022
118	All right.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0005
119	Ack!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0026
120	Don't drop me like that!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
121	You told me to let you go, didn't you?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
122	Shuddap! I'm gonna make you pay for that!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
123	The shadows whisper to me...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0046
124	Ugh, he's rambling like a madman again!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
125	Ila!... You're beginning to grow on me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0008
126	Uh... You got a fever or somethin'?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
127	We'll call it a day. The real training starts tomorrow. Get some rest!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0045
128	H-Hey! I ain't done yet!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
129	Corvus, how goes her training?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
130	She's not bad. Her movements are getting sharper. We can use her.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
131	Honestly, she's better than I expected. She shows much promise.
132	Heh. I look forward to seeing the fruits of your training.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
133	Of course, my lord.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
134	Lord Zahar, the Holy Guard are making their move.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
135	!
136	They have dispatched the Holy Guard knights stationed in Northern Pride to escort a cleric to Wratharis. It appears he will be replacing the current one.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
137	A cleric would have a Philosopher's Stone on him, wouldn't he? I bet it would have a good serving of alchemy stored in it, too.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0009
138	Heh heh heh. Corvus, Letitia, get ready to move out.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
139	As you command.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
140	Corvus, bring Ila with you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
141	But she's not—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
142	What better place than the battlefield to let her off leash?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
143	Very well.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
144	They're here.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_battle_0019
145	Good.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
146	It's the Holy Guard!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
147	Ila!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
148	Lord...Zahar?
149	You have my permission to go on a rampage.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
150	All right! Lemme at 'em!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
151	Lord Zahar! It's an ambush!!!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
152	...
153	Time to die, Zahar!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
154	Lord Zahar!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
155	Are you hurt, my lord?	VO_spica.spica_battle_0003
156	What...?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
157	I'm sorry I'm late.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
158	So, this is the great and mighty Zahar, huh?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0044
159	Spica, we can talk after. First, we make a meal of these holy curs.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
160	Yessir!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
161	I'll lend a hand, too!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
