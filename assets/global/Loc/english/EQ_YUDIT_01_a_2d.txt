001	It was after the Lion Monarch's Charge that the Giant Taurus suddenly appeared.
002	This beast's destructive fury was such that it devastated the world, tearing open the still-smoldering wounds of war.
003	To combat this new threat, the Lord Commander used a device known as a Mecha Weapon. This granted him sufficient power to go head-to-head with the Giant Taurus and eventually defeat it.
004	Following this success, Judith, the Mecha Weapon's custodian, traveled around Babel on a campaign to wipe out any remaining members of the ruinous Taurus species.
005	What's more, the Holy Guard formed a special Taurus combat force, tasked with eliminating the creatures.
006	The combined efforts of these agents saw the majority of the species wiped from the face of Babel.
007	Yet some survived, and went on to evolve.
008	And now the Taurus threaten the continent of Babel once more.
009	Just gotta connect these two here, and... Voila!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0023
010	We're looking at a super speedy, extra-powerful weapon that shall hence be known as...mech gear! Yeah... Yeah! I think I'm gonna roll with that name.
011	I'm pretty proud of this one! It turned out just as awesome as I thought it would.
072	This'll take care of any pesky Taurus...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0044
012	And it can stand up to an enemy even greater than the Giant Taurus, like Basheeny was worried about!
013	I can't even imagine what that would look like... Maybe something like the creature dad mentioned in his journals?
014	Together with the Mecha Weapon, those journals are the only things I brought with me from Lost Blue.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
015	"I can hardly believe it. To think that such a terrifyingly powerful creature once roamed these lands..."
016	"If this being were to be revived, humankind would face an unprecedented disaster. I must do what I can to create a device capable of combating these creatures."
017	I wonder what dad was so afraid of? Guess I'll never know now...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
018	But one thing's for sure. My dad invented the Mecha Weapon to protect this world and everyone in it.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0006
019	I want to prove that somehow. I want to show the world that my dad's invention is useful.
020	If only there was a way I could make everyone see that the Mecha Weapon was meant to make this world a better place.
021	Haa...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
022	Nrgh! Where are the reinforcements?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
023	Grooooooaaarr!
024	Uwaaaaahhh!
025	Huzzah!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
026	Leave this big lug to me! I'll bring it down with a bang and a whoosh!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
027	Here I go! Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0007
028	Grrrrrrrrroooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrr!
029	Thank you for your assistance. We did not expect to run into a Taurus here, of all places.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0002
030	Wait a moment. That weapon you're holding—don't tell me...
031	Um, this is a Mecha Weapon. Problem?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
032	I should say so! The Mecha Weapon is a cursed weapon powered by Philosopher's Stones!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
033	Huh?!
034	Hold on—let's not be hasty. The current Mecha Weapon model doesn't run on Philosopher's Stones anymore. And don't forget that the device played a huge role in the previous campaign against the Taurus.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
035	Lord Commander Basheeny himself has stated that the Mecha Weapon is extremely effective at combating the creatures.
036	Basheeny...
037	Exactly! The Mecha Weapon isn't dangerous—it's meant to help people!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0008
038	This Mecha Weapon alone has helped me save countless lives!
039	It's not a cursed weapon at all!
040	Even if that model no longer requires Philosopher's Stones as a power source...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0044
041	It is still a weapon powerful enough to bring down a Giant Taurus.
042	If it were to be used for military purposes in conjunction with Alchemy... We would face a crisis like no other.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
043	But...!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
044	You deny that it could be misused?
045	That's...
046	I...	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
047	I would hate that! I won't allow people to misuse the Mecha Weapon, for any reason! It's meant to help people, not hurt them!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0013
048	Even Basheeny said that the Mecha Weapon is something that can protect the peace in this world!
049	But...I know they're not the only ones who think like that. There are still heaps of people out there who think that the Mecha Weapon is some kind of cursed weapon.
050	And what can I do about that? It's not easy to change people's minds about something once it's got a bad rep.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
051	Hmm...
052	Well, I can't leave things like this, that's for sure. I need to educate people about the Mecha Weapon's true purpose!
053	Maybe if I work with the Holy Guard to improve the Mecha Weapon, like Basheeny suggested...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
054	I'll be able to build a rapport with my fellow researchers, and help them see the Mecha Weapon in a whole new light!
055	But...I dunno. How can I work with the organization that killed my father? It just seems...wrong.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
056	Ugh! What's the right choice here?! Wish I knew...
057	Hey, Judith! You got a minute? I've got a mecha that needs repairin'.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
058	Sure thing! I'll fix it up for you in a jiffy! First thing's first, though—I've gotta take it apart!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0037
059	I don't think that's necessary, but... Eh, whatever.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
060	Anyway, you heard? Apparently, there's another Taurus outbreak happenin' in Saga. More of them giant ones, except they're even bigger this time.
061	Even worse, there're rumors that the Holy Guard's special Taurus combat unit or what have you has been wiped out. Scary stuff. Hope they don't make it here...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0031
062	Wait... There's a new kind of Giant Taurus?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
063	Huzzah!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
064	You need to leap higher, little frog. You won't reach the core like that.
065	Easier said than done!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
066	Outta the way!
067	Hey! Bud! Don't go rushing in on your own!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
068	Somebody has to do it, and it doesn't look like you're about to!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0012
069	(Right. I have to push on!)
070	Bud, wait! Give me a second to—	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
071	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0032
