001	I... I thought you couldn’t shoot people?!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0020
002	I found my resolve because I wanted to protect you...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
003	Of course, there are ways to protect others without fighting...but that isn’t enough.
004	I can’t let you take a detour the way I did!
005	I’m sorry it took me so long! I’ll fight to protect the people I care about too!
006	But I told you to run away! You could’ve just abandoned me!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
007	Why did you do this for me?!
008	...I told you! You aren’t alone! We’re friends!
009	...!
010	This is...?!
011	The sound of the orchestral band! Our reinforcements!
012	How strange... My ears don’t hurt.
013	So this is what it means to not fight alone...
014	See? Aren’t “sounds” amazing?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
015	Even though we were just feeling like we couldn’t go on...now we feel relief. Listen... Do you feel the power to fight surging through your body?
016	...Yes.
017	(...Yes... She’s right about everything.)
018	(My aspirations were a crutch to help me escape from the pressure... Nina wouldn’t try to fight on her own.)
019	(She wouldn’t be irritated by supportive or hopeful voices... I wasn’t seeing clearly.)
020	(...I’m an idiot. What was I rushing for?)
021	(That’s what “sounds” helped me realize!)
022	Bertie, are you okay?!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0027
023	Patty, Alaia! Yeah, I’m okay! Thank you for coming!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0009
024	Don’t underestimate the ears of the band! It’s easy for us to guess the position and distance of a sound from its echoes!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0023
025	Sorry to keep you waiting! The Envylia Orchestral Band is here!	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0010
026	Everyone...
027	We’ve spotted the enemy reinforcements! All right, let’s begin!	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0004
028	Yeah! Something spirited, please!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
029	What in the world...?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
030	All right, the parade has begun! Get ready for the finest sounds! Here we go, Mendelssohn!	VO_patty.patty_chara_0004
031	It’s like... the sounds are seeping into my body...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0009
032	It’s giving me power?! And my ears...don’t hurt!
033	Music can help on the battlefield too. Even if it’s not a weapon...	VO_patty.patty_sys_0007
034	We also want to stand on the battlefield to protect the things we care about... We’re ready to hurt the enemy, too!
035	...!
036	That’s...	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
037	There you are, Bertha! I can’t believe you acted on your own!
038	Ah! I’m sorry! I’m ready to be thoroughly scolded later!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
039	...Anyway, I commend you for sensing danger quickly! And thanks to the orchestral band, morale is high. Let’s annihilate our enemies while we can!
040	Trainees, listen closely to your instructor’s orders and follow us! Let’s work together to crush our enemies!
041	Yes! ...Look, our own reinforcements have safely arrived! Aren’t “sounds” amazing?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0037
042	...
043	...All right, let’s go. I’ll give you instructions.	VO_berta.berta_battle_0004
044	Let’s win this so that I can fire a “welcome home” shot for you.
045	...Yes! I’ll borrow this weapon...	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0004
046	...Thank you. I think it’ll be easy to swing.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0034
047	Once, I accidentally hurt a superior of mine while using a gun I couldn’t handle. Even though she was also trying to stop me...
048	...But you’re not like me. You listened to what I had to say.
049	Please let me hear the whole story some day. ...I’ll be waiting for your signal.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
050	Got it! All right! How dare you hurt my trainee?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0038
051	I won’t waver anymore. I’ll shoot as many bullets as I need to in order to protect everyone!
052	This is my...signal shot of resolve!	VO_berta.berta_battle_0010
