001	Grooooooooooooooooooooooooouughhhhhhhh!
002	I'm sorry it took me so long.
003	Do you think you can...forgive me?
004	Skwee...
005	Thank you.
006	And thank you, for flying with me.
007	Goooooooooooooong!
008	Ungh... Kasumi...
009	K-Kasumi...!
010	We'll meet again someday. I'm sure of it.
011	After all...we're friends, aren't we?
012	Kasumi! Kasumi!
013	I'm so glad...
014	I got the chance to meet all of you.
015	The next time we see each other...
016	I'll show you the real me.
017	She's gone...
018	Do you think we'll see her again?
019	Of course we will! In the meantime, however...
020	We're going to have to work hard to continue preserving the will of the people who live in this world of ours.
021	Right. Kasumi risked her life to protect us. Now it's our turn.
022	Well. I think our part is done.
023	Call us, anytime you need us.
024	Should a battle be mandated for the sake of this world...
025	For the sake of those for whom this world exists, we will lend you our strength.
026	So you're willing to fight with us again sometime?
027	Naturally.
028	All right! I'm going to dry all the teary eyes in this world, whether they belong to a man, or a woman, or whoever!
029	Just watch me, Kasumi!
030	...
031	(Ohh... Am I...? Am I really...dead?)
032	Kasumi! Kasumi...! Unghh... Nnghh!
033	(Mom... There's so much...I want to...tell you...but...)
034	(I guess I...can't, now. I'm sorry.)
035	Light and darkness. Life...and death. The great wheel has turned full circle, and balance has been restored.
036	I suspect that we will meet again someday. Until that time, tend to your budding will.
037	K-Kasumi...?
038	Nngh... M-mom...?
039	Kasumi! K-Kasumi! I-I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry!
040	M-mom... I...
041	I have something that I...really want to do!
042	Huh?!
043	What is it, Liz?
044	Oh, it's nothing!
045	Here I go!
046	Kasumi... I heard your voice just now.
047	We'll see each other again, won't we?
048	Kasumi... What are you doing right now? You're fighting, aren't you? Of course... Tears don't suit you, after all.
049	The next time we meet...I expect nothing but smiles. Okay?
050	All right, let's start from the beginning of the scene. Ready, Kasumi? Okay, and... Action!
051	Come! Now it is time for us to reclaim our hope! I will imperil my very life for the sake of those who live in this world... For my companions!
052	Nay...
053	For whom this world exists!
