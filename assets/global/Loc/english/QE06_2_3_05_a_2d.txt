001	The food is not enough?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
002	That is what I'm saying. It was silly to think we could survive without eating humans.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
003	Wait…Let's first discuss this with Koga. We don't have to solve this alone.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
004	…
005	What?
006	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
007	There's no way my weakened body can be rejuvenated with that slop. Things have gotten difficult for me.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
008	This is just what happens to us when we stop devouring humans…Do you understand what I mean?
009	We don't know what harmful effects this diet has had on Kaede either.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
010	…!
011	Maybe it was a mistake joining forces with the humans, after all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
012	…Regardless, we should discuss this with Koga. If anybody can come up with a solution, it's him.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
013	You once said it isn't wise to continue fighting humans if we care about the demon race.
014	Koga will think of something… I'm sure of it.
015	…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
016	Is something wrong?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
017	Nothing… It's just you seem to put a lot of faith in him, that's all.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
018	Of course I do… Thanks to him, Kaede is able to live a normal life, something I was never able to give her.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
019	Besides, I saw with my own eyes--he is an honorable man, worthy of my trust.
020	So, you're trusting a human?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
021	I can't say I trust humans completely… But Koga is different. That's all I'm saying.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
022	What should I have expected…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
023	You are still much too shortsighted.
024	What did you say?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0006
025	Ignorance is not a crime, but it is certainly foolish.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
026	Our duty is to eradicate all humans, is it not?
027	You've been seduced by the comfort of peace, forgetting this crucial detail… Your behavior does not befit that of the king's vessel.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
028	So…what are you suggesting!? You were the one who said we should join the humans in the first place.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0003
029	Yes, that's true. I did think so at the time…until I realized something.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
030	What do you mean?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
031	But I don't think you're ready to hear the truth. I'd better not say…
032	Quit beating around the bush…Tell me.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
033	Do you think you can handle the truth?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
034	Of course I can! Just spit it out already!
035	…Very well.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
036	The only way to recount the tragedy of you and your sister, is to start from your childhood--when you were captured by humans.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
037	That experience had a lasting effect on your psyche, didn't it--making you hate and want to destroy all humans?
038	That's true…but what's your point?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
039	The person responsible for capturing you when you were children… That person is--
040	None other than the man you call Koga.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
041	…!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
042	Koga…!? It can't be… There's no way…!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0020
043	He was a member of an unofficial Wadatsumi organization called the Demon Hunters.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
044	Does this fact not change your opinion of him?
045	The Demon Hunters…!? He never said a word of this…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0022
046	Or course he didn’t. Why would he divulge information that could threaten to disrupt the peace? He was quite meticulous in crafting his story.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
047	Outwardly, he advocates for peace, but deep down who knows what he's thinking. Humans cannot change their nature so easily.
048	Do you presume to understand the true nature of mankind?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
049	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
050	This is merely speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if Koga was using Kaede for some kind of experiment.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
051	…Experiment?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
052	Suppose at the time you both escaped, their experiment hadn't born fruit…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
053	It stands to reason that Koga, or someone, would try to finish the job at some point.
054	…Enough.
055	Alas, what bitter irony. The only human you could trust was the very person who put you through hell!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
056	And to think, he plans to make you suffer more…Your tragic tale is quickly becoming a comedy! The fates can be so cruel!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
057	I said enough!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
058	…
059	…
060	Going somewhere?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
061	…I need to find out whether it's true or not.
062	What difference does it make?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
063	…I want to hear it with my own ears.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
064	And if what I’m saying is true?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
065	…
066	…Most impressive. It seems he trusts that man a great deal. The wait was worthwhile, after all.
067	I am grateful for your information.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
068	…Does this Tamba really have the power you claim?
069	He is the one fit to become the king's vessel.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
070	That explains this elaborate ruse… Rather uncharacteristic a demon, isn't it?
071	You must be joking… This was your suggestion in the first place.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
072	Your wounds have fully healed, and still--
073	It should be no trouble if I devour a few people.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
074	The table has been set… If everything goes according to plan, the birth of the "king" is nigh.
075	We'll have to wait and see if this "experiment" pans out. I'm just here to observe. All--
076	Is for Wadatsumi.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
077	Precisely.
078	You're useful to me so long as we share a common interest. I will realize my ambition, mark my words.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
079	Demons are the only race worthy of ruling Wadatsumi. That is why we need a vessel worthy of being king.
080	Yes, I'll use you to the fullest.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
081	Welcome home! You're early--Oh!
082	…Kaede.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
083	Tamba…what's wrong?	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
084	…Where is Koga?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
085	…Wha--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
086	Tell me where his is!
087	…What's wrong with you?
088	Did you know!? The truth about him--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0003
089	Let go! I said let go of me!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
090	ANSWER ME!!!
091	…Lower your voice.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0029
092	…
093	What in the world has gotten into you?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
094	…Did you know…that Koga was once a member of the Demon Hunters…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
095	…That he was the one who made us suffer…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
096	…Tamba.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
097	Did you know…? If so, how could you still be with him…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0020
098	Tamba, please…
099	Why didn't you tell me? Don't tell me you've forgiven them! After everything they've done to us!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
100	Stop.
101	Don't tell me you've forgotten how much we suffered because of those damn Demon Hunters!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
102	Just stop it already, Tamba!
103	So, the Discarnate Power was telling the truth after all…	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
104	…A bitter irony. The only human I've ever trusted--my sister's husband--is…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
105	...The person we should despise most of all!!
106	…You're right. It is a bitter irony. At first, I wanted to hate him too.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
107	…Then tell me why!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
108	It's true that many things were taken from us…but…we weren't the only ones.
109	Koga had his childhood stolen from him.
110	…What does that have to do with us?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
111	Nothing. But...I listened to his story anyway…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
112	…
113	It's not like I could let go of the hatred all at once…but everyday we spent together, I felt my heart start to change.
114	…Because of his passion for cooking and the time we spent together, I learned about the man he is now.
115	That's why…I chose to stay.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
116	It's all a facade. Man cannot change his nature so easily. The chasm between demons and humans is too vast.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
117	Are you saying…you won't accept my decision?
118	This has nothing to do with choice.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
119	Tamba.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
120	I'm going back--to the place where you belong. There's no use staying here any longer.
121	…I belong here. I want to protect the life I've built.
122	…Kaede!!	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
123	…Why can't you understand? I'm…Ah...*pant*	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
124	Kaede!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
125	…It's nothing…I'm fine.
126	It sure doesn't seem that way to me! Don't tell me--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0020
127	You've exhausted your life force?
128	…
129	…Kaede!!
130	…I'm eating plenty. But without my horns…and after giving birth to my children--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
131	…Kaede!!
132	This is just what happens to us when we stop devouring humans.
133	This is merely speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if Koga was using Kaede for some kind of experiment.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
134	..!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0019
135	…Tamba?
136	…Ah--AHHHHHHHH!
138	…Tamba.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
145	The only way to restore your weakened state is to devour humans…If you stay with Koga any longer--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
146	…You'll die. There's no escaping it.
147	…I'm sure Koga will think of something.
148	How can you put so much faith in that man? For him, you're just--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
149	If you do anything to hurt Kaede, I'll kill you… Do you hear me?
150	…Loud and clear! I promise I'll take care of her.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
151	Is he still making the same old meals, even seeing you in this state? Does he not understand?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
152	The most important thing right now is for humans and demons to remain united. You know that, don't you?
153	Is that a good enough reason for you--for you to be in this condition…?
154	He--Koga is depriving you of what you need…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
155	I…trusted him.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
156	...He gave me his word!
157	…Tamba?
158	…I can't forgive him.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0040
159	…I'll never forgive him!
160	…!?
139	…
140	…
141	!!!
142	…Tam...ba?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
143	…
144	…!?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
