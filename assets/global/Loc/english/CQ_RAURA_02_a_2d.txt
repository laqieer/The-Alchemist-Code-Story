001	HaaaAAA!	VO_laura.laura_sys_0032
002	Ha, now there's the feeling I've been missing. It's been some time since my last battle, but I'm still not one to fall to enemies such as those.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0007
003	That said, there are quite a number of them. That girl said they always show up around this time. Does that mean she does this often?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0029
004	Can she really fight off so many alone?
005	Hiyaaaa! Get wrecked, bugs!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0010
006	!!
007	What incredible magic! Such power, such beauty! The insects are fleeing in terror!
008	Tch, I hate bugs.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0016
009	That magic just now... Was that you?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0001
010	Yep. They always come in big groups like that, so I use it to drive them away. Who would have thought raising flowers could be so dangerous, right?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
011	That's incredible. You could do anything with that much magical power.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0024
012	People say that a lot, but really just as long as I can keep these flowers safe, that's good enough for me.
013	You mean to say...all you use that magic for is protecting these flowers?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0022
014	Yeah, so?
015	But think of everything you could accomplish!	VO_laura.laura_sys_0020
016	I'm sure if you went to the School of Magic, for example, you could do even more incredible things. Have you really never thought of doing something like that?
017	...You sound just like my sis, you know that?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0030
018	Your sister...?
019	...
020	Ah... Please accept my apologies. I didn't mean to cause you any distress. I was simply curious.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0039
021	...Actually, my sis and my father are both Court Mages. It's because of that that I almost never get to see her anymore.	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0031
022	And when I do, she always says stuff like that and tries to get me to come to the city.
023	It's understandable, given your clear talent, but...I gather you don't appreciate that, do you?
024	No! Because, if I go to the city, then who's gonna protect these flowers!?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0004
025	...I see. Not living up to expectations, then?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0004
026	Laila, no! You can't leave the colosseum! Seeing you fight is all that keeps me going!
027	If you leave, there'll be no fights worth watching anymore! Please don't go!
028	(I can certainly relate. It's hard to say why, but it seems that this girl has been shining far longer and far brighter than I have.)
047	(It's like she has something that I'm missing...)
029	The...flowers?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0031
030	Did you say something?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0025
031	These flowers, they're truly incredible. So fragrant and beautiful. I've never seen any quite like them. What are they called?	VO_laura.laura_sys_0001
032	O-oh, these are Sol Terrae! Their name means "sun upon the earth."
033	Their blooms certainly do rival the majesty of the sun.
034	I know, right? They're super rare!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0008
035	But all kinds of bugs and monsters eat them because they smell so good. Plus, people keep picking them because they're so pretty.
036	But guess what! I finally found some seeds a while back and have been taking good care of them here ever since!	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0002
037	Is that so? Well I can certainly see how much love you put into them from the flower bed.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0008
038	Eheheh...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_sys_0050
039	But they really do attract a lot of bugs.
040	Hey brat, I'm gonna get those damn flowers this time for sure!
041	You again! Don't you ever learn!? Or do I need to teach you again?	VO_mielikki.mielikki_chara_1010
042	Heh, these flowers are worth a fortune, and I'm not one to leave money on the table! But this time, I've brought along a few friends.
043	Whoa, he isn't kidding...	VO_mielikki.mielikki_battle_0019
044	Ganging up on a little girl, are you? How unsightly.	VO_laura.laura_sys_0030
045	Huh? And who the hell're you?
046	Just a traveler with more strength and beauty than she knows what to do with. And I'm going to make sure you don't lay one filthy finger on these beautiful blossoms!
