001	Now...it's time for me to take this curse.	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0001
002	Hah...hahaha! I was waiting for this!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0023
003	Wha—?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
004	Shadow Excelsior! Consume what is left of the curse in the altar!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0008
005	What?! Ceclidis?! You're...alive?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
006	Hahahaha! This body has survived for a hundred years! Do you really think such petty measures could kill me?	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0010
007	Oh, yes. This curse... My old friend, instigator of Cryphone's corruption...
008	Tch! Neville, Vlad, Anastasia!	VO_caesar.caesar_battle_0023
009	I am ready.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0004
010	Ready, and waiting!	VO_neville.neville_sys_0037
011	We're all on the same page!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0006
012	Now... Cryphone! The day has come for you to shine again, just as you once did!	VO_seclidis-b.seclidis-b_sys_0011
013	Nnrgh... What is this power?!	VO_caesar.caesar_sys_0042
014	Hah! At long last! At long, long last! Yes, yes, yes!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0009
015	At long last, this power is mine again!
016	Ceclidis!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
017	What are you...?! That form! Have you returned to the form your wore back when...?
018	And you! How have you not disappeared off of the face of this world yet, hm?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
019	Ah... This feeling... Yes. This strength, welling up within me...	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0024
020	Ceclidis, you...!
021	It seems you will not die, but your time is already over. You're a relic.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_battle_0010
022	Nrghhhhh! You... You planned this from the beginning?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0026
023	Why do you sound so surprised? The both of us have been betraying each other, even as we worked together, from the very start.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
024	But now I have no need of you pitiful Sephira...
025	So die, you relics of an age long past! It is time for a new era, created by a new generation!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_battle_0004
026	Grrrraaaarrrrggggghhhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0028_a
027	A new generation, you say? Fine words for a ghost who should have died a hundred years ago!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
028	It doesn't matter how many of the Jam you create. All of us here are prepared to commit everything we have to stopping you!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
029	Ah!
030	Well, well, well. This is very good. I needed to test my strength a little, anyway.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
031	Let's see what you've got, Alchemists!
