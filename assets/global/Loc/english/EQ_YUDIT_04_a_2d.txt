001	You're trying to do everything by yourself, aren't you?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
002	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
003	Watching you just now... I was reminded of something the king once said to me.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
004	This was back when I was a fresh face on the Crown's Guard. I wanted to become the strongest knight of them all, and that thought consumed me, driving me to train night and day.
005	Seeing me like that, the king told me...
062	No monarch rules their nation alone.
063	The thoughts and hopes of the people, their prayers and aspirations, are what truly shape a nation.
064	It is commendable of you to wish to be the protector of all. Your noble spirit will doubtless lead the other knights in an honorable direction.
065	As king, it is my duty to connect your wish—and those of all my people—to a plan for the future.
006	Now, listen well, Bud.
007	If you seek protect the lives of the people, you, too, will become a guardian of their hopes and aspirations, and serve to bring them into the future.
008	As a knight of the people, you will surely face many troubles; but throughout them all, you must remember what I have told you.
009	The king taught me a lot about the kind of spirit it takes to protect people. Kind of ironic when you think about it, since I was meant to be the one protecting him.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0016
010	Spirit?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
011	Yep. There's a lot you can't do alone, but sometimes the impossible becomes doable when everyone comes together!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
012	Look, I'm only telling you all this because it seems like you're trying to take down the Giant Taurus with your Mecha Weapon alone.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0031
013	I know it's strong and all, but so are we! So don't go rushing into the battle on your own. It wouldn't hurt to rely on us a little.
066	After all, we're all here to do the same thing, aren't we? Bring down the Giant Taurus, protect the people they're threatening, and keep the world from falling to pieces! Right?
014	I...
015	Hold up! You don't have the right to lecture her!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
016	Huh?!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0004
017	Up until Judith got here, you were the one trying to rush ahead and fight the Giant Taurus all on your own!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
018	I'm sorry, okay?!
019	I just...had a lot on my mind, you know?
020	I felt like a fraud for leaving the Guard behind at a time when we should be banding together...	VO_budd.budd_sys_0030
021	And I felt guilty for making Kagura pick up the slack.
022	I knew it!
023	But at the same time... I know Envylia is going to be okay. I know that I can trust the Guard to keep the peace while I'm gone.	VO_budd.budd_sys_0047
024	Because I know that each and every member of the Blue Flame Guard cares about Envylia just as much as I do.
025	Besides, what we're doing here isn't just for Saga. This problem affects the entire world—Envylia included.
026	So we need to put a stop to it. For Envylia's future, and the world's.
027	Kagura was the one who helped me see that my place is here. I won't let her down.
028	Ohh... So you were feeling sorry to Kagura, huh?
029	Well, this explains a lot. I'm impressed that you were able to resolve that conflict within yourself all on your own. About time you grew up a little.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
030	Make fun of me if you want, I don't care! I know what I've got to do now! Step one: defeat the Giant Taurus. Step two: get back to Envylia, stat!
043	Well, good! If we're all set, how about we get going already? No time like the present!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
067	Yeah! Let's do this!
044	Well... At least they're enthusiastic.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
045	...
046	You're trying to do everything by yourself, aren't you?	VO_budd.budd_sys_0001
047	(I know we need to work together on this, but...)	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
048	(At the end of the day, I've gotta be the one to show the world that the Mecha Weapon is a useful invention!)
050	...
051	Judith? Are you all right?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
052	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
053	Oh! Um... Yeah. I'm fine. Time to roll out!	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
054	Hmm...
055	According to Kazahaya's report, this is the area in which the combat force was decimated.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
056	Hey... Do you hear something? And is it just me or is the ground shaking?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0002
057	Look! Over there!	VO_budd.budd_chara_2011
058	I-is that a Giant Taurus?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
059	It's even bigger than I imagined... This thing makes regular Taurus look like cute little bunnies!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
060	Grrrooooooogh!
061	Here it comes!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
