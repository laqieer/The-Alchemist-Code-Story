002	Nimul, what was that just now?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
003	That...was likely one of the dragon's souls; one of its four cores.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
004	So there are three more of them, then.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
005	Should be; assuming that the knowledge that was passed down to me as chief of the Sephira is accurate.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
036	Nimul! Something's coming!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
037	I guess the damage we dealt to the dragon's core must have kick-started its defense mechanisms.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
038	Careful, Waginau. The beast will prioritize its survival above all else.
039	Then you're saying that the Fallen aren't the only enemy we will have to contend with?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
040	Yes... In a sense.
006	From here on out, the corruption is going to be worse than anything you've ever seen. We will have to purify it as we go.
007	Is there no other way? Our powers will be utterly drained...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
008	Tch! Where are all these Fallen coming from, anyway?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
009	I...can only assume that they were once devoured by the dragon.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
010	Don't be stupid! I've never heard any tales of the Great Nidhogg eating people!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
011	History doesn't tell all tales, Waginau.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
012	Besides... Do you even know where the Guardian Dragon came from?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
013	Of course I do! The Great Nidhogg was born unto Sephiron, just as we of the Sephira—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
014	True, that is the legend that has been passed down in the village.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
015	But the truth that has been whispered to the chiefs of our people, generation after generation... Now, that is a different story entirely.
016	Our ancestors discovered Sephiron, and learned from her a technique with which they could seal the Cursed Beast. From there, our civilization began to develop.
017	It was at this time, upon the dawn of the Sephira people, that a visitor flew in from outside of the Cosmic Egg.
018	Nidhogg the Damned...who would later become known as the Guardian Dragon.
019	What?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
020	Nidhogg descended upon the Sephira and burned the tower they had built to the ground. For years and years, war raged between the dragon and our people.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
021	Eventually, when it became clear that there would be no end to the fighting if it was left to run its natural course, there came something of a truce. The dragon acknowledged our wisdom, as we acknowledged its might, and we forged a path of coexistence.
022	And so... The corpses of those the dragon killed over the course of countless battles are likely the Fallen we see before us.
023	I don't understand... Why was this kept secret?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
024	The dragon has always been a powerful being. Anyone would find themselves awestruck at a single glance.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
025	And, as you now know, the dragon has not always been our ally.
026	What if there were those among our people who feared it? This creature was once our enemy. How could we be certain that it would not turn on us again? Such doubts would not be unreasonable.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
027	W-well...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0018
028	Doubt breeds dissent, and risks the resurgence of war. Even more frightening, perhaps the commotion would cause the Cursed Beast to stir from its slumber beneath the earth.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
029	So it was decided that the truth would be kept secret. I believe that the chief who made this decision was very wise in his judgment.
030	I...cannot say I disagree.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
031	However...it was still a mistake. Concealing the truth leads only to its distortion.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
032	What was that, Nimul? Did you say something?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
033	No... Nothing. Anyway, we've wasted enough time here.
034	Emmel might have been able to use the Matter to restrain the dragon, but she cannot hold it forever. Let's move on, quickly!
035	Right...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
