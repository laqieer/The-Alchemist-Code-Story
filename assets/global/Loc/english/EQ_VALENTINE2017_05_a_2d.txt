001	Wow, we really got our effort's worth... That being said, what's up with those monsters!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0022
002	Is its effect really that powerful? I wonder what is attracting the monsters?	VO_porin.porin_sys_0031
003	Didn't that one go rushing towards the purple cacao? What was purple again?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
004	Um, purple was captivation...? Do you think they're being captivated?!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0031
005	Oh! You know how they have the arrows for monsters that charm them? I was wondering how that works, but maybe they paint some of this on them!
006	That makes sense...these monsters can be pretty smart...	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0045
007	So, they use them not as a love potion but in combat...	VO_porin.porin_sys_0030
008	Well, in this world, when it comes to 'charm effects,' it's not so much a, 'Oh my god, I love that guy!' kind of effect. It's a little more scary and unusable than that, isn't it?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0029
009	Totally.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0020
010	Anyway, let's manage the purple cacao a little more carefully at the plantation...or in each country as well.	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0031
011	Hm? Even as we speak...here comes more of them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
012	Let's just get rid of them first, so we can enjoy Valentine’s Day!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
