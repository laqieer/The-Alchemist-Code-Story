001	You're a descendant of the Sephira? Then do you have that power, too? The power of purification?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
002	I merely share their lineage. I possess only meager healing powers, nothing at all like the miracles I have heard that they are capable of.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0036
003	Ah...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
004	Um, Miss Tina? Did I say something wrong?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
005	Oh, don't worry about her. To tell you the truth, we're looking for the Sephira in this desert as well.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
006	So we just got a little excited for a moment there.
007	I see. So we share the same objective.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0022
008	Would you mind if we came along with you?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
009	To tell you the truth, we don't know much about the Sephira. We don't even know where to find them.
010	Not to mention, there seems to be someone after you. You might be attacked again. It'd be wise to have us around.
011	What do you say? I don't think it's a bad idea.
012	I would be very grateful, but...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0031
013	Is there something on my face?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
014	Well, no, but... Wouldn't you have some qualms about traveling with a noble from Gluttony Foss?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0018
015	Not really, no.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
016	I just feel like you tend to have a scowl when looking my way.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
017	That's just how I look!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
018	O-oh!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0025
019	Hah!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
020	D-don't laugh, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
021	Hahahahaha. Ahem. Sorry, sorry.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0008
022	Well, we did have some conflict with the Gluttony army a little while ago. So I guess we do still have some emotions to work out.
023	But we're not so narrow minded as to judge a person by their birth.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
024	That's true. We might've had our grudges and quarrels with Gluttony Foss, but I feel like we got to understand each other in the end.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
025	If we're going to be traveling together, though, we need to know.
026	What is this mission that you have to accomplish?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
027	Of course. It would be extremely rude of me to keep it a secret from you.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0031
028	I must tell you of the horrifying monster that dwells in the shadows of Gluttony Foss.
029	So... You lost the Sephira girl.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
030	We had a little problem. Some shamans from Saga interfered.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
031	That skill of theirs... They must be retainers of the Great Sprites that rule the Saga tribes.
032	You know who the desert belongs to. Any half-hearted attempts would only be a waste of time.
033	She is going to be our druidic priestess. If you truly wish for the rebirth of Sephiron, we must have her.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0031
034	I know. I plan to use the piece that I have kept hidden in the desert.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
035	Hmm. I had thought that you were keeping that to pass judgment upon the traitors who fled to the desert.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
036	I was, but needs must be when the devil drives.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0005
037	We have waited a hundred years for this. We will not accept any delays for the resurrection ceremony.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
038	Let Sephiron guide us.
039	Yes! I have waited a hundred years for this!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
040	Ah, Cryphone! The time has come! I will make you mine!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
