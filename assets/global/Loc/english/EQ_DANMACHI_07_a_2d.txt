001	Rrrrrraaaaaarrrggghhh!!!	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0001
002	Hey, minotaur! Over here!	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
003	Ais...!
004	I'm heading your way n—Ila?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0004
005	...In the flesh.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
006	Ila?
007	I can't thank you properly until this is all finished, now, can I?
008	Win this one for me, Bell!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
009	I will!
010	We will!	VO_eyes.eyes_battle_0001
011	Gggrrrrrr!	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0020
012	When the minotaur staggers, the demons' defenses momentarily break as well. Just as we surmised earlier, taking out the minotaur needs to be our first priority!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
013	Kevin, I'll have Ais support me here while you hold back the demons! Got it?
014	Got it. Even if that's...kind of a tall order!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
015	But don't worry about it. As long as someone's got my back, I'll make it happen, one way or another!
016	You've got this, Bell.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
017	Yeah. Yeah, no problem!
018	I'll flank Kevin, leaving the minotaur to you, okay?
019	Right. Ais and I will take it out!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
020	Cue the final battle. Stay on your toes, everyone! This is gonna be a wild ride...	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0032
021	Too bad I can't stake my life on this, since I already lost it—so instead, I'm just gonna say what's at stake here is proof of the kind of life I lived!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
022	Yeah. I'm gonna give this everything I've got, too!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
023	Here it comes!
024	Rrraaagggh!!!	VO_minotaurus.minotaurus_battle_0003
025	Everyone, we're almost there! Keep it together! Victory is at hand!
