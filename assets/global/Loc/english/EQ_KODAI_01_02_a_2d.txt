001	Hahaha! Zafeiris! Over here!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0008
002	Calm down, now! You're liable to trip and fall.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0002
003	But I can fly! So even if I do, I won't get hurt.
004	R-right... Still, you should be more careful! Especially with your powers.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
005	Your powers are closely tied to the Shell of the World. Enough recklessness and you easily could get hurt!
006	I...don't understand.
007	Ugh. How do I explain it in simpler terms?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
008	A dragon would have been born with a fully developed mind...
009	This is as though I'm speaking with one of those human younglings my brother Nidhogg described to me once.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0022
010	So, how's fatherhood going?
011	Tell me, why did you leave her intellectual maturity underdeveloped as you were creating her?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
012	Were you not the one who said she needs an adequately functioning intellect for us to converse with her?
013	That's true. I did say that.
014	What I need you to understand, Zafeiris, is that I don't exactly hold our intelligence as dragons to be quite so sacred or righteous, as you do.
015	We've made mistakes. We've done many, many things we shouldn't have, and lost much as a result of it.
016	I want her to take a different path than the one we took. I want her to learn things properly.
017	I want her to learn on her own about this world, about us dragons, and about the humans who will replace us.
018	Such optimistic idealism...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
019	I thought you'd approve.
020	...
021	There you go again, giving the silent treatment when things don't quite go your way. You really do need to work on that nasty habit of yours!
022	We wouldn't want Lil to pick up such tendencies, now, would we?
023	Did somebody call me?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_chara_0009
024	Why, yes, we did! Zafeiris and I were just talking about how beautiful you are, Lil. You're just far too cute!
025	Heheh! Lil is Schmeier's masterpiece, right? Of course I'm cute!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0007
026	Oh, you little scamp. C'mere!
027	Ahahaha! That tickles!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0008
028	(How long is this pathetic farce supposed to continue?)
029	(This was supposed to be a means for us to contact and converse with our environmental maintenance system, the Shell of the World, to help address the issues it's been experiencing.)
030	(So then why is Schmeier even—?)
031	Zafeiris!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
032	Yes?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
033	Nng! Up!
034	What is it? If you want something from me, use your words.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0035
035	Are you daft?! Pick her up, Zafeiris!
036	Me? Why don't you do it?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0025
037	Schmeier did already! Now it's Zafeiris' turn!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0016
038	...
039	Oh, don't be such a sourpuss. You should appreciate her affection while you still can!
040	Up! Up!
041	All right, fine!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
042	Heehee!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_voice_0017
043	A considerable time passed in this manner, with our research remaining stagnant throughout. How could any progress be made under such absurd circumstances, after all?
044	So, this is your past?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
045	It seems far more...tranquil...than I expected.
046	I am curious about several details, though—particularly how that little girl factors into everything.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
047	That should be apparent. But if it's not, it will be soon.
048	What do you mean?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
049	We dragons are fated to perish. That fact hasn't changed, even through all this.
050	Curse you, Schmeier, for leaving all the material collection duties to me!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
051	Though she is the central constituent in charge of research. I suppose I've done all that I can do.
052	I don't think I'm ready...
053	Lil's development is progressing well. It won't be long before we are granted full access to the Shell of—	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
054	Do I want this to end? Peace, a supportive confidant, and a child who shows me affection...
055	Perhaps this homely lifestyle has affected me more than I realize. The more I think about it—
056	Who are you?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0001
057	Forgive our transgressions, Lord Zafeiris—incarnation of the seven miracles; our greatest, our savior!
058	Do spare me the disingenuous sniveling and tell me why you've come.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0014
059	This is for the world. Our chief, Lord Ophioneus, has declared it to be necessary.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0004
060	In his words, the Shell of the World must be eliminated, and it is time that we dragons overcome this trial as one.
061	Ophioneus said that?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
062	As such, those who would protect the Shell of the World are to be regarded as impediments toward that noble goal.
063	And none are more guilty of acting in defense of the Shell than you and Schmeier.
064	It's almost astonishing to see so many of our kin, so near extinction, gathered in one place.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
065	Please understand that the circumstances call for such measures.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0001
066	Melvillei of Compassion has seen the end of this world. We haven't a moment to spare!
067	Do you think mentioning such an honored name alone can convince me to just step back and allow you to usher in our demise?!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0010
068	Clearly not. You are among the most stalwart of us dragons. We will do what we must.	VO_dragonman-o.dragonman-o_sys_0006
069	So be it. Come, then!	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0038
