001	I began to overflow with power.
002	Instinctively, I felt that this power had been sleeping inside me--
003	Power to oppose senseless cruelty, to protect my sister, to enact my hatred…
004	To defend the sanctity of life.
005	I hated, therefore I sought to protect. I sought to protect from that which I hated.
006	From those conflicting emotions, power seemed to spring forth.
007	First, I'll start with the humans who captured us and locked us in this place--
008	I'll kill them all. I'll never forgive them for putting us through hell.
009	…
010	Eventually, I gleaned some information about the people responsible for our capture from the researchers. It was a group called the Demon Hunters…
011	They were an organization of unknown size and scope.
012	If that's the case--
013	I decided the only way to be sure they pay for their crime is to kill all humans-- That way no one goes unpunished.
014	It's the only thing I can do for Kaede. And--
015	My one and only desire.
016	Kaede…?
017	…Tch!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
063	…Tamba.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
064	What?
018	I…don't want to die here…I don't want them to take any...more--	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
019	Kaede!? What's wrong? Hang in there!
020	...from me…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
021	…
022	Hey! Kaede! Kaede!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
023	…*Growl*
024	…!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
025	*ROAR*
026	Kaede had completely transformed before my eyes.
027	To liken her power to pure carnage would be an understatement.
028	*ROAR*
029	She annihilated all the humans present, and then flung herself toward me.
030	!!!
031	She spoke with an otherworldly voice, her body drenched in blood. But--
032	…
033	Tears were in her eyes.
034	Kaede…Kaede!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
035	I called her name again and again--the girl who just wanted a normal life.
036	This…isn't "normal!" I'll show you what normal is. Please!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
037	Let's live! You and me, Kaede!
038	I yelled with all my might to somehow get through to her. The next thing I knew, all her strength seemed to evaporate.
039	I caught her tiny body in my arms, giving her support. Surely, the life she dreamed of--
040	Wasn't this.
041	I hoped--No, I swore--I'd never let anyone make her feel this way again.
042	That's why I had to be strong. To wipe out all humans.
043	So, with Kaede in my arms, I started running as fast as I could.
044	To escape the insular world we had come to know.
045	I don't remember how or where I ran to. I just desperately wanted to get outside.
046	And then--
047	The vast earth stretched before us.
048	…Tam..ba?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0027
049	…Yeah, Kaede.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
050	…This is what the "normal" world looks like.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
051	…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0018
052	…I won't let them ever hurt us again.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
053	Someday…I swear I'll eradicate those filthy humans.
054	Tamba…	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
055	Starting with those called Demon Hunters. They're the bastards who put us in there and did that to…mom and dad.
056	If I kill them all, I'm sure you'll be able to devour humans again…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0007
057	What makes you so sure…
058	We just need to move past this… I'll be here to help you. I'll do whatever I can.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
059	And I'll help you live a "normal" life.
060	…
061	What's wrong?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
062	…It's nothing. Thank you, Tamba.
