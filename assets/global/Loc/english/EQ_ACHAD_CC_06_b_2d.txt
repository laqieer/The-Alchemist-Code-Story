001	I'm here to play the role of the villain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
002	Lost Blue is a place where people are discarded and forgotten. By their homelands. By the continent. By the world at large.
003	Those raised in Lost Blue are never given the chance to live a normal life in this world.
004	That's what happens when you're born in a cesspit. They don't have anyone to protect them. They don't even have the right to work. Stealing is the only way they can survive.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
005	Even if they venture out under the big, blue sky, they just end up being ridiculed for being illiterate and unskilled, ignorant of the ways of the world above.
006	Meanwhile, the so-called allies of justice seek only to hide the dark corners of the world and keep rogue elements from interfering with their monopoly on power.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
007	That's why, in order to save Lost Blue, I have to take on the entire world.
008	This is our last stand.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
009	We will fight until our dying breaths!
010	We will fight for our right to a sky in Lost Blue, the place untouched by sunlight!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
011	We will not be forgotten!
012	We will never stop!
013	I don't know what...y-you all were counting on...
014	But there is no limit to my power!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
015	(This time, I will pay the price.)
016	(I don't care what becomes of me!)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
017	(I don't care if I become inhuman, or destroy myself in the process!)
018	(They were the only ones who made me human to begin with!)
019	(Besides, our plan always was to turn everything on its head!)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
020	N-no... D-don't...
021	Huh?
022	You...c-can't use that...power.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
023	Acht!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
024	Don't...cross that line. You'll n-never...be the...same. Y-your soul...will be lost...f-forever.
025	I don't care!
026	But if...your soul is lost...I-I won't be able to...f-follow.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
027	Acht...!
028	P-please...don't...leave me.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
029	...
030	P-please, Sol.
031	I-I don't want...to be...alone.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
032	I want to try lining up somewhere.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
033	Lining up?
034	It's silly, but it is a dream of mine. So don't laugh, okay?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
035	I won't.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
036	Okay, well... Here. This is a list of the "Top 100 Restaurants Worth Lining Up For!", published by The Babel Continental Times.
037	Ohh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0009
038	Imagine this: We'd spend about thirty minutes—maybe an hour—lining up for our food with other customers, but they'd give us a menu to look through while we waited.
039	I bet it'd take you at least that long to come to a decision anyway. I'd probably struggle a bit, too, so I'd just go with the chef's recommendation.
040	Hee hee. I'd probably end up ordering the same thing you did.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
041	Anyway, after another hour or so of waiting, we'd finally get inside. We'd be served our food, wolf it down, and be out within fifteen minutes. After all, there'd still be a long line of people waiting to take their seats.
042	If you couldn't finish your portion, I'd eat it for you.
043	Then we'd walk around in silence for a bit—until, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, we'd both say...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
044	"I've had better."
045	I can imagine it clear as day.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
046	We'd both agree that it was a waste of time, but, somehow, on our next day off, we'd end up lining up again, even if it's boiling hot or pouring rain.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
047	I'd be happy to do that with you, Sol. Even if it was snowing.
048	Good. Sounds like we're on, no matter the weather.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
049	Let's take a trip all around the world! I bet there are tons of dishes out there we've never even heard of!
050	I like the way you think! We'll go to all kinds of different restaurants and stalls and eateries, and bring back snacks for the other Templars—as well as stories of our travels, of course.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
051	I know! Let's get a map, and circle all the places we want to visit.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
052	That's a great idea! Then we can put a cross through all the places we've been to.
053	Before long, it'll be covered in circles and crosses. Countries, regions, roads...
054	We'll dominate the world with our stomachs!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0024
055	If anyone can do that, it's us.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
056	Yeah! It'll be a piece of cake!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
057	...
058	...
059	"The goddess frowns on those who cannot eat the scraps that a dog will not."	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
060	Is that a saying from one of your philosophy books?
061	It means that we should value food.
062	Hehe. I see.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0008
063	I'll never throw anything away. You can count on that.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
064	Never ever?
065	Never ever.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
066	You lack the conviction to see your ambitions through.
067	There is but a single reason for that.
068	You still cling to your bonds with others.
069	Your comrades, and your home. All the things you feel the need to protect.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
070	I, on the other hand, have cut all such ties.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
071	So conviction...means cutting ties?
072	S-Sol...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
073	A-Acht...
074	I...I am the...s-sun...born in the sunken...city without light. Y-you have...n-nothing to worry...about.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
075	Huh...?
076	I...w-will never...fall. I will always...l-light...your way.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
077	Sol!
078	M-my light...will always...be with you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
079	S-Sol is... He's finally...!
179	The Templars...are...
080	We beat them! Huzzaaaahh!
081	At long last, we XXX XX XXXXX XXX XXX!
082	(Sol... Sol... Sol...!)	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
083	XXXX XXX XXXX. XX X XXXXX?
084	(I can no longer hear your voice! I can no longer see your face!)	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
085	(But what about that silly little dream we shared?)
086	(We're meant to line up together. To travel the world together!)
087	(We still haven't covered that map in circles and crosses!)
088	(Sol!)	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
089	(Acht!)
090	XXXX XXX XXXX XXX XXXXX.
091	(Acht... Acht... Acht...!)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
092	XXXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXX XXXX.
093	Everything feels so...hollow.
094	I can't let it end like this. Their names... The lives they built... The futures they believed in...
095	I won't let them be forgotten!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
096	(Efilinde... Ainanna... Botan... Ikasa...)
097	(Iris... Lily... Mitsu... Na Zhu... Dead Nine... Rat-Killer...)
098	(Amu...)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
099	(Van...!)
100	I have to bring a smile to their faces!
101	(Whoops. I didn't mean for that to come out so...cringy.)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
102	(Yeah, that's right.)
103	(I'm scared out of my wits!)
104	(Being alone is terrifying!)
105	Everyone else is...gone.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
106	"Sol, you are our sun."
107	...!
108	"You shine so brightly when you stand alone. Yet your light is dimmed by the shadows of others."
109	"Plucking you from the shade would do nothing for me."
110	(And if I were alone?)	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
111	"Well, I would hope that you would be waiting for me in anticipation."
112	Lighten up, will you?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
113	D-Dr..ei...
114	You put on a very good show. I could not have asked for better.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
115	Wh-who goes there?!
116	Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am a big fan of standing on the sidelines.	VO_drei.drei_battle_0018
117	Guidecca...
118	That's my name. Don't wear it out.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
119	As for the final two Templars...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
120	An abnormally large Alchemia explosion occurred on the battlefield at the time of their death.
121	As a result, we have been unable to confirm for ourselves the identity or gender of the bodies recovered from the site, which were burned beyond recognition.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
122	Instead, we have had to rely on testimony from the captains who were present at the scene. However, through their statements we have been able to determine that the recovered bodies...
123	Surrender! You have nothing to gain by dragging out this fight any longer! You have already lost!
124	You say such...amusing things.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0013
125	Hmph!
126	Do you even know what you're fighting for anymore?! What is your aim here?!
127	My aim? What a fascinating question. Not that it's any of your concern, but it's time for me to harvest the fruits of my labors.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
128	Huzzaaahhh!
129	Ngh!	VO_drei.drei_battle_0025
130	I-I got him! Finish him! Now!
131	I do appreciate the way you've neatly gathered yourselves in one place.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0011
132	Aaaaaaaaarghh!
133	Hrrgh! Surround him! Kill him!
134	There are none left who have witnessed them, are there? So what does it matter who I am?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
135	"Them"? Are you talking about your Templar friends?
136	Friends? Heheh... Ahahahaha! Friends, you say?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
137	Are you planning to die for the sake of those friends of yours?!
138	Me? Oh, no. I don't think so. I'm really not that sort of person.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0030
139	Then what are you doing here?! Who even are you?!
140	Who am I, you ask?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0039
141	Why don't we say that I'm Sol?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
142	What?!
143	My precious flower blooms amidst the cacophonous silence.
144	What is the meaning of this?!
145	In the end, even I shall become its fertilizer.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
146	Th-this is bad! Kill him! Quickly! We have to stop him!
147	I...will complete the sun!
148	Now, here's a delightfully creepy tidbit for you!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
149	Right at the moment when my beliefs came to fruition, and my long-held dream blossomed into bloom...
150	I realized that it was all because of me.
151	I was the one who poisoned your will. Without me, you would never have achieved anything of note.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0003
152	I've never felt so guilty, so terrible, and so reluctantly grateful all at once.
153	I will take root inside of you, Sol.
154	I'm happy to die for that privilege.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
155	However, through their statements we have been able to determine that the recovered bodies...
156	And I'm not alone in feeling that way. Iris is the same. Aren't you, dear?
157	Belong to Sol, the leader of the Templars, and his associate and fellow Templar, Acht.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
158	While we are still uncertain as to the origin of the twin blades that were retrieved from the vicinity of the incident...
159	It has nonetheless been determined...
160	That the issue is not one of due import, and thus unworthy of further investigation.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
161	I am Guidecca.
162	Those who yearned for the sun burnt their wings when they flew too close to it, leaving behind a brilliant red rose in its center. It is such a beautiful sight...
163	As are we, my dear Iris.	VO_drei.drei_battle_0010
164	Are you watching, Iris? Can you see how my beliefs and your life have intertwined and blossomed into bloom at last?
165	Though you cannot see the individual colors, surely even you can tell that this glorious incursion is absolutely dazzling?
166	Like a rainbow arcing across a spray of blood...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
167	...
168	Why now?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
169	I feel fragments of my lost memories, of my truth, flitting through my mind.
170	I cannot help but recall the sacrifices I had them pay, the losses that shook me as much as them.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
171	But...why? Why is it all coming back to me now?!
172	I was abandoned in the age during which Babel was first formed. Deemed an unnecessary element of creation, I became the darkness that was purposefully forgotten.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
173	Yet even in my latent unconsciousness, I still sought that age of creation. I found myself reaching for the Alchemy Source at the zenith of all.
174	And, as a result, I created the Mystic Tower Veda.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
175	I...
176	I need to find myself...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
177	Or else the majority of my lost memories...and, indeed, much of my very self...
178	All of it...will be lost.
