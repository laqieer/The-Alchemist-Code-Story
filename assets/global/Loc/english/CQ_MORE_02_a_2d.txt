001	Phew, feels good to sweat! Nothing beats being outside on a sunny day!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0008
002	*Pant* *Wheeze* I-I need…to catch my breath.	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
003	Oh, come on, Moa. It's too early to be worn out!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0016
004	I beg…to differ. Normal people can't keep up with this grueling course!
005	I rarely get outdoor activity as it is.
006	Oh…My bad! I thought this beginner's course would be perfect for you…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0036
007	E-Eve! If this is easy, then just how difficult is your normal routine?
008	It's not too bad! Anyway, wasn't it fun to get your blood flowing?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
009	Yeah. It was. I feel refreshed.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0004
010	I never had the chance to exercise like this before…It's all brand new to me.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
011	…I'm glad! You finally smiled, too!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
012	Huh?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
013	To be honest, you've been looking glum lately.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
014	I was starting to worry. I thought if I could get you to smile, you'd cheer up.
015	Oh…	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
016	So, that's why you invited me to train with you…	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
017	Well, that was part of it…	VO_eve.eve_chara_1023
018	But mainly, I just thought we'd have fun together!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0008
019	Eve…
020	From this day onward, I began training with my cousin every day.
021	The girl who always stayed inside, trying not to anger her mother, finally learned the joy of outdoor physical activity.
022	And I grew to like it more and more.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
023	By the way, I meant to ask this earlier, but why do you train so hard, Eve?
024	I thought you might want to become a knight, but you've rejected every offer that's come your way…	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
025	That's right. I don't push myself this hard because I want to be a knight.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
026	I do it because it's my bridal training!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
027	B-Bridal training? All this?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
028	Hi girls! Taking a break? I caught you at a good time, then.
029	Eve, a letter arrived from your future husband.
030	Your future husband?	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
031	Eeek! Mom! You're so embarrassing!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0025
032	*Chuckle* Make sure to come home before dark once you finish training!
033	*Sigh* It's been a while since his last letter... *Swoon* Fraise's handwriting…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
034	He said he was busy, so I didn't expect to receive a letter this soon… I'm so happy!
035	*Swoon* Reading this fires me up! Maybe I'll do a bit more bridal training, after all!
036	Bridal training…	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
037	…Eve, is Fraise the person you're doing all this training for!
038	Uh-huh!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
039	B-But why do you need to train at all?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
040	Huh? To be a happy bride, I've got to be strong.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
041	Oh, um…I see… But…
042	…
043	(…It doesn't matter how strong you become. Nothing will change.)	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
044	(There's no such thing as a happy bride.)
045	(After all, if you fall in love in this country and get married, what follows is…)
046	If I could just see him before he became an insect, I'd never get married…or have a child.
047	I'd never have you.
048	But...nobody in this country who falls in love...and gets married can be happy.	VO_mor.mor_sys_1043
049	Wha--	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
050	…Uh…	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
051	(…What am I saying?)
052	(Eve was so excited. She was beaming.)
053	(And I ruined it.)	VO_mor.mor_sys_1019
054	Um…It's alright, Moa. Did something trigger a bad memory?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0036
055	…No, that's not it--I'm sorry. I'm just…so sorry!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0035
056	Hang on a sec, Moa!
057	I'm such an idiot. Why didn't I keep my big mouth shut?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0019
058	There was no need to say that. Eve has been nothing but nice to me.
059	...And I had to go and hurt her feelings. I feel terrible…
060	All I ever do is cause pain to those I care about… First mom…and now Eve…	VO_mor.mor_sys_1043
061	…Maybe mom was right. I'm a--
062	! An insect…!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0019
063	How did I end up here with all these insects! I've got to escape!
064	…
065	…But…even if I run away, I'll just end up hurting someone eventually.
066	…If that's the case, I might as well let these things kill me.	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
067	(At least that way I won't hurt anyone ever again.)
068	Someone like me…is better off not existing.	VO_mor.mor_sys_1043
069	…
070	Eek!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0027
071	Why… That isn't me… It's just a bug.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0020
072	It's your fault he became an insect.
073	I lost the man I love because of you.
074	Everything--it's all your fault! I wish I'd never had you.
075	You should have become an insect instead of him!
076	Ah…	VO_mor.mor_chara_1011
077	…Because it's all my fault?
078	…
079	The fact that dad became an insect and mom became depressed…I'm to blame.
080	…That's why mom shouldn't have had me…I know that.	VO_mor.mor_sys_1019
081	…
082	I knew that…from the moment I was born!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
083	*Pant*...*Pant*
084	(The insects, me, mom, dad, all the lovers in this country--we're all cursed.)
085	(The men become hideous creatures no one could love, and the women lose their lovers.)
086	(…Then the children are resented for causing their beloved parents such misery.)	VO_mor.mor_sys_1043
087	…!	VO_mor.mor_sys_1047
088	Hiyaaa!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0032
089	Eve!?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
090	Moa! Are you alright? I'm glad you're safe!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
091	First things first! Let's drive back these insects--then we'll talk!
