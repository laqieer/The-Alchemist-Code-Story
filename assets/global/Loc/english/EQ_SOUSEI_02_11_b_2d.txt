001	The more I look at it, the less I understand it.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
002	How can this box can fly? It is made of metal!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
003	Heheh, just watch and be amazed. Let's see here... The emergency hatch lever is...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
004	Ah! Here it is!
005	Oh, look! It opened!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0009
006	Ambrosia's so excited...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
007	Well, she does love all things new and unique.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
008	Mira, Nyx! You too, old dog! We're gonna get started on doing the repairs and attaching the magic rod! Come help!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
009	Okay! Let's go, Nyx!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
010	I'm with you, Mira.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
011	I don't know how many times I have to remind him that I am no dog, let alone an old one...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
012	Whatever! Get over here! Nimul, can you keep watch over the airship?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
013	No problem.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
014	Looks like it's all going smoothly.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
015	That's why we must stay vigilant. It was when we thought all was well and let down our guard in the Gula Belt Region that...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
016	Altimeter, check! Rudder, check! And let's see... Aw, dang it! The magil-meter is busted up... It was so expensive...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
017	Can you make anything of it?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
018	Hold on, hold on...
019	All right! The reactor's fine! We can't fly with it like this, but we can fuel the—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
020	Eeek?! Wh-what was that?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
021	Look out the window. Straight ahead.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
022	That's...!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
023	Aah... There they are. How determined of them to come all this way.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0029
024	Right? Well, I don't know what they plan to do, but this is Asmodeus's territory.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0004
025	Letting them do as they please won't end well for us, I expect.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0030
026	If only they would give it up.	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0006
027	The fact that they can't do that is what makes them human.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0007
028	Humans are so annoying...	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0030
029	I'm with you on that.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0004
030	So just begone!
