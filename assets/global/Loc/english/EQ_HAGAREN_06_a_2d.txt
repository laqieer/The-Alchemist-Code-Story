001	Amazing, Edgar! You rounded up so many people in such a short time!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0046
002	I'm just lucky that Wratharis is home to so many good folk. Vivi, you're the real hero here. If it weren't for you getting us on our feet, none of this would be possible.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0004
003	Charging at the Holy Order and all of their followers head on would only be stupid and further hurt Toritoh.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
004	As a person who doesn't feel anger, do you really think I'd feel hurt by this?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
005	A general who would go so far to save her men must, on some level, understand pain and sadness. That's why I won't let anyone hurt you again.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
006	Thank you, Edgar. I...I hope...to one day have the kind of empathy you have for others.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0034
007	By the way, apparently only a small faction of the Holy Order is working on each of these towers.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0003
008	Even if we destroy one, we should go unnoticed by the Order as a whole. At least, my inside sources have assured me that they would look the other way.
009	This massive contraption is under the charge of only a small number of people?! How could a small faction construct something like this...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0026
010	It's simple...if you have the power of a homunculus.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0007
011	...!
012	Wh-who the heck—?! Strong enough to blast me back?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
013	Edgar!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0019
014	Hmm. You don't seem to be from around here. Perfect. In that case, all I need do is get rid of you.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0031
015	Unfortunately, I'm responsible for dealing with all intruders to Wratharis.
016	This...power! I thought it was the tower, but it was all you! What in the world are you?!	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0027
017	Oh no! We have to get out of here! Everyone, run! It's the Führer... It's Wrath!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0015
