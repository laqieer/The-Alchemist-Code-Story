001	Can I ask you something?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
002	Because they're making me train the newbies.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0037
003	Why, Vier...?
004	Why do you go about with your skin so...bare?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
005	Oh? Does it interest you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
006	I've only just joined the Veda Templars. I don't know anything about such circumstances.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0044
007	It tends to make a certain someone very happy.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
008	I-it does?!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
009	I'm kidding.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
010	I don't mind! You can do what you want! It's none of my business who does what with whom, or how, or... Ah! Uh... Kidding...?
011	My look, you see...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
012	It reminds me that I'm not cold anymore. My heart no longer belongs to a snowy climate.
013	Vier...
014	Besides, if I dress this way, I can see through my opponents.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
015	Where they are looking, what they are thinking, how easily I can manipulate them...
016	After all, the commandment regarding honesty calls upon us all to not deceive others unduly.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
017	Wh-what about me?!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
018	I'm teasing.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
019	That's what all manipulators say!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0029
020	It's important to speak plainly to those who are easily manipulated.
021	After all, that is the best way to make sure the people around you, whoever they are and whatever their background is, are comfortable speaking to you. Don't you want that?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
022	I don't understand you yet. It's as though you're mired in fog. You seem innocent, and yet not...
023	I think you and I are alike.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
024	How?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
025	I'm tired of traveling.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
026	You are...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
027	What's that?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0004
028	Nothing.
029	Ah. I forgot myself for a moment. Please, forget I said anything.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0011
030	I won't.
031	After all, we're family now.
032	Heheh... And coworkers.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
033	Should we shake on it?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
034	Agreed.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0037
035	Please, teach me what you can.
036	I'm not the best role model...
037	But I...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0031
038	I am a sinner who killed one of her own people and became a dark elf. My existence is steeped in death.
039	I'm just waiting for the day I die, like smoke drifting from an incense burner. It's not so bad.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
040	Aren't you lonely?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0003
041	I've stopped being lonely.
042	I just go on manipulating those around me.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
043	Aren't you tired yet?
044	Just a trivial little story... A dull story that might not have its own place here and now.
045	I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.
046	(Ugh... I don't like this.)	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
047	(This isn't where I want to sleep.)
048	(If there's anything that could have made me think that way...)
049	(Anything new... Anything old...)
050	(The bonds remain.)
051	(I was holding my breath, waiting for you to say you were tired, too... That you wanted to rest.)	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
052	Monzein may have gone easy on you because you're a woman, but I won't.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0010
053	I will not let you interfere with these knights who are putting their lives on the line.
054	Yauras...
055	Monzein! Don't worry... Leave the rest to me!
056	You...!
057	I will witness the end of your walk down the path of chivalry!
058	(I wanted to bear witness myself as those youths lived out their lives—)
059	(Finally, after so long, I want to stay awake, and yet!)
060	And...taking on your resolve...I will become even stronger!
061	Ugh! Arrghhh!!!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0022
062	Grk... Gah!!!
063	(I'll be going ahead to the land of sleep, then...)	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
064	(All I was able to impart was how to lose sight of one's dreams.)
065	Gah, haa... Haa... Ahhhgh... Haa...!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
066	The incredible thing about predictions is that they stick in your head, no matter how it pans out.
067	Nngg...haa... Ah...
068	These black ear cuffs I've continued to wear...
069	Each with three triangles reminiscent of an elf ear: the largest closest to my real ear, the next largest angled up like a horn and the smallest placed between each.
070	I've worn them for so long... For me, for you, and for us... These elf ears worn for three.
071	I... I'm...	VO_vier.vier_sys_0018
072	I am...
073	Bahaha...
074	You feign astonishment well. Not to mention the air of sympathy. And how wonderful you are at affecting delight! Very good!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
075	I'm glad I asked you first.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
076	And a master of flattery!
077	You are the very first teacher I've ever had.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
078	I...am?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0025
079	The first, Eins, was my first enemy. The second, Zwei, did her best but now she is gone. The third, Drei, taught Sieba but turned out to be a traitor.
080	And now the fourth... I suppose for me, fourth time is the charm.
081	Well... I am rather charming. This isn't the first time I've been compared rather favorably to previous partners that were, shall we say, less than satisfactory.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
082	Innuendos again? Your mind is always in the gutter...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
083	It's only an innuendo if you make it an innuendo.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
084	I-I'm not making it into anything! Wh-why are you getting so close to me!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
085	Eheheh. I do apologize. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. That would be sexual harassment.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
086	No, it's not that you're harassing me... You're warm, so... It's not so bad in moderation, but...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
087	Oh, all right. I'll moderate myself.	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
088	Hey... Can I call you Vier?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
089	I...honestly don't really care.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
090	If I didn't look like this, you'd call me by another name, wouldn't you?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
091	Did you dream well?
092	Ephylinde... Will you compliment me? Ephylinde?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
093	You see, I'm...
094	I'm a teacher now.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
095	I fooled everyone...
096	Only the Veda Templars saw me for who I really am.
097	They pretended to be fooled and passed the endless night by my side.
098	They're all utter...
099	I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Please, I'm sorry, I...!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0035
100	I... I can't...sleep, not yet.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
101	I was a fool! I'll follow after you, right away!
102	Ahahah...hahah...hahahahah... I can barely stand...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0011
103	Just a little longer. Just stay awake a little longer!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
104	Naturally. There's much yet to be taught...
105	That's enough! It's...!
106	There's no way to undo the Beds of Ice!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_battle_0019
107	So I'll join you right away! I'll join you in dreams until the bugs devour us!
108	There was so, so much I wanted to teach you. So much I wanted to talk about... So much I wanted you to know... So many fun things, new things, exciting things...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
109	It's too sad to only know this world...
205	I would have listened to your concerns... I would have taught you all the wonderful things, and all the amazing parts of this world...
110	Forget this world! I'm selfish! All I can think about is my own circumstances... The fact that you...and I...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0027
111	Even once the village is gone, you, the lovely princess...queen of the high elves...will sleep on here.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_battle_0019
112	I...will?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0005
113	If it got out that the queen herself fell and became a dark elf... All the high elves would be shaken to the core.
114	That's why the queen must sleep here...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
115	Here, as the queen who fought to protect the high elves, to protect their purity... Here, you must lay that queen to rest of your own volition.
116	What...do you mean? I don't want that! If I can't be with you, I...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0025
117	You need not stay trapped by this village.
118	I will disguise myself as you.
119	No! You mean to transform yourself?!
120	Using the vast stock of herbs grown down here and the stores of alchemy built up in the air...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0004
121	I can create a magical barrier around your best. Eventually my Alchemia will run out, but...
122	I make it so the queen rests here among the Beds of Ice, undisturbed by anyone...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
123	And, in turn, I will bestow my visage upon you, with the last of my lingering incense...
124	What?!
125	This is the last thing I will teach you.
126	Becoming an adult isn't awful. You can make a place for yourself, earn money to get you by... It can be tough, but...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
127	You'll learn so much from it.
128	B-but people will come to hate the person they think is you!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0020
129	Because I'll be a dark elf... Even Phantom Arts won't be able to conceal it...
130	You'll give me your form and it will transform into that of a dark elf!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0027
131	You wanted someone to dream with, didn't you?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
132	You, who has watched over the dreams of others for so very long...
133	I...!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0005
134	What you really wanted was to fulfil your dreams, be praised, and live out your life before going to sleep, wasn't it?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
135	You hated the high elves, didn't you? That's why you left, isn't it?! Then why would you do all this for us?!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
203	I left the village and immersed my body in battle... I never taught anyone anything. I spent an eternity tricking others...
136	My dreams were probably stolen away long ago.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
137	I wanted to connect joyfully with someone out there beyond the walls we have built around our race... I wanted to live a dream of being glad to have lived...
204	That's your...?	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
138	That's why only you...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
139	After this, my form will be your form...and your form will be my form...
140	Until my life comes to its end...I will follow the remnants of your magic, bestowing upon you my form and scent...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
141	Until your life comes to its end, I will lay here forever in sleep and keep up the illusion of your form.
142	Your...scent...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
143	Your scent...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0008
144	Now, open your eyes and rise from your bed.
145	Rise?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
146	This is the end of the lesson. Are you just going to sit there forever?!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0018
147	But...I...!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
148	Get up!
149	I...!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
150	(At last, we...)	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
151	No... No... Ephylinde! Ephylinde!!!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0019
152	(...will no longer hate ourselves.)
153	Nnngh....guuurghh....Nnnngggghhhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
154	You're so unfair! I want to sleep, too! I want it to end, too! It's just a shame!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0020
155	I'm...!
156	I'm not lonely!
157	I'm not! I'll give you your dreams! As if we were dreaming them together!
158	I'll send visions of your form living on to you in your sleep!
159	I'll make sure our mingling scents never part! I'll tie our magic together!
160	Even if you're sleeping, you'll never be bored of your dreams! I will use your appearance to make your dreams come true!
161	I don't know if I can pull it off... You're not with me, I have no family, I have no one...
162	I'll probably want to give up, grow listless, and try and throw it all away in my despair...
163	After all, I... Heheh... I've never had the chance to really live.
164	Even so, I...!
165	I'm not lonely! As long as I see you in the mirror, and have the scent of your long hair...!
166	I'll borrow your ears!
167	Keep your eyes on our dream until the very end!
168	Good night.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
169	I pretended not to know the truth, played to the preferences of the person I like...
170	I refrained from the things I thought you'd dislike, fussed over my hair, put on make up, did my nails, practiced smiles in front of the mirror...
171	Acted naive, but dangled my true intelligence strategically to intrigue you...
172	Met your gaze in the mirror and then averted my eyes, covered my mouth shyly, touched you gently... All of this...
173	Fooling myself... Living greedily on in this form...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
174	It's like a dream, like an illusion.
175	So beautiful...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
176	Eheheh.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0023
177	Did you learn enough?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
178	I learned just how difficult it is to impart one's knowledge to another.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
179	And?
180	And...
181	Even if everything and everything falls apart... It doesn't matter as long as I remain myself, or so I was told.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0006
182	Indeed.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
183	Even knowing I'd tricked them, they stayed by my side. Teaching me, being taught...
184	I began to think I wanted to watch over their lives...and I felt like I had become like you.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0039
185	For the first time, I felt glad to be alive.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
186	Was it hard for you, being forced to live on?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0001
187	Yes. Yes, it was.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0004
188	I see...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
189	But you never feel it until later.
190	Hm?
191	You never feel glad that you studied hard until after the fact.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
192	That's...true.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0004
193	Good night, Ephylinde.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0001
194	Good night, Your Highness. What time shall we wake tomorrow?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0005
195	A good question...	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0031
196	If I lie on the bed facing upward, I can see the sky. If I lie on my side, I can see your sleeping face.
197	Here in this sweet-smelling, frozen bedroom...
198	Let us sleep until we tire of it.
199	Together, we'll pass the endless night... Together, we'll dream tirelessly...intersecting at the phantom crossroads...
200	Will that do...?
201	It will.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
202	For the rest of time.	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0007
