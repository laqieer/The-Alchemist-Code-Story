001	Will that be a sufficient solution to your "problem", my lord?
002	Hahaha! You sure messed them up! Those fools won't be troubling me anytime soon.
003	Give Lord Zheng Yi my thanks, eh? I'll come around to talk business with him next week.
004	Of course, my lord. My deepest thanks on Lord Zheng Yi's behalf.
005	I shall take my leave, then. Good evening to you.
006	Everything went well, it seems.
007	Apologies, but I had you observed at a distance. Most impressive work.
008	I was groomed and schooled in such "talents". It wasn't much.
009	I do what I can to ensure the best possible outcome in every negotiation.
010	A most pleasing work ethic.
011	After all, it suits you very well, does it not? Due to your... unique circumstances.
012	It is a duty I was born into.
013	Do you not seek to fight against such a destiny so unfairly foisted upon you?
014	Down that path lies only selfishness and ruin.
015	I gladly pledge my life to Asuka. I will do whatever I can to ensure her happiness and safety.
016	Of course. That is what I wish for both our houses as well.
017	To our new partnership, then. I look forward to working with you.
018	I sincerely hope so.
