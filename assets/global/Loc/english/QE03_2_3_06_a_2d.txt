001	Agh! He's stronger...much stronger than before!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	How did he become strong so fast?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0022
003	It doesn't seem like it was magic or incantations. It looks like he accomplished it on his own!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0021
004	I'm used to losing. My life has been a succession of defeats from the day I was born.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
005	From the day you were born?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
006	I told you, didn't I? We men are rejected from the moment we are born, thus beginning our lives as losers.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0004
007	We have lost to women from the time we are born.
008	No...it's just the terrible way that your mother...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
009	Don't get me wrong. I'm thankful for my parents for just two reasons.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
010	Huh?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	For the fact that they brought me into this world and that they taught me the value of a loser.
012	From my inferiority complex towards women, I trained myself, creating higher performing incantation gear with unusual properties.
013	As a result of my effort, for a time I was able to produce results that surpassed even witches, but...
014	But...?
015	Heh. Still my mother wouldn't accept me. For someone who's existence is not even acknowledged, even success does not merit value.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
016	...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
017	But these succession of defeats have value for me! I will climb them and, there on the top, I will experience victory!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0007
018	Salomo...how far are you gonna go?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
