001	Haaaaaah!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0032
002	Hmph. You're not as weak as you look. Unfortunately for you...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
003	Ngh! There's more of them?! This is bad...	VO_yura.yura_battle_0019
004	Hraahh!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0032
005	D-D'Artagnan?!
006	Are you okay? You're not injured, are you? You have nothing to fear now. The Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain D'Artagnan is here now.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
007	Yura?! It's you! It's been forever! How are you?
008	H-hey! We're still in the middle of a fight!	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025

010	Reinforcements? No matter. We've completed our goal already.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
011	W-wait!
012	No... They got away...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0042
013	They're fast. I've asked some of my people to pursue them, but it's hard to say whether or not they'll be able to catch up...	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0030
014	More importantly, I'm glad you're safe. It's great to see you after so long, Yura!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
015	I was sad we weren't able to see much of each other after we were assigned two different orders. You seem good, though!
016	Y-yeah... You too...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0011
017	...
