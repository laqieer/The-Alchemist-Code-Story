001	Oh dear children of the world...is there no greater happiness for this old man than to see your smiling faces?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
002	That's so cool, Michael!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0009
003	You sure do cherish the Winter Holiday spirit. Is Lofia also helping?
004	Oh yes! I'm indebted to her highness.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
005	I see...
006	Well, count me in then! I want to help out with the winter holiday too!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
007	Please, Michael! Let me help you raise the holiday spirit with you and Lofia!
008	Being with you two is bound to be fun!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0008
009	...
010	Looks like everyone's having a good time.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
011	...
012	What's wrong? Why the long face?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0006
013	Birgitta...Klima... Why are you two here?
014	Just on the lookout. It didn't snow last time, so I'm hoping it'll be different this year...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
015	I understand. It should be okay this year.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
016	Even the Maruda tribe are insisting it will be a snowy holiday this year.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
017	That's why we are giving Carol and Hazel a helping hand with preparing for the party.
018	Hey, wanna give us a hand? Looks like you finished decorating the streets, right?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0003
019	Yes, I have, but...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
020	What's wrong, Ravina? You seem down.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
021	...I'm fine.
022	Well, if you say so...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
023	...
024	Don't just say, "If you say so..." You should try to express yourself, Klima.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0030
025	But...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0031
026	"It's the happiest time of the year, turn that frown upside down," is what you wanted to say, right?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
027	...really?
028	It's the Winter Holiday season. It's filled with parties and fun...
029	And Klima loves Winter Holiday.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0005
030	Sorry to say, I'm not so big on Winter Holiday.
031	W-why?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
032	Well, it's because I can't be with Michael and Lofia.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
033	Ah, that's right. Those two are always busy at this time. They're doing security this year, right?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
034	It's just... I want to work security. To be with them...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
035	...
036	But, won't they be joining us once they're done?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
037	...yes.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
038	Right? So don't worry! ...look who's here.
039	Hi! Is Ravina here?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0001
040	Hey, Lotiyah! What's up?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0006
041	Um... I bring word from Lofia.
042	Oh, Lofia! What did she say?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
043	She said that she and Michael are still busy with security details, so they won't be able to come back just yet.
044	She also said, "I assume Birgitta and Klima will be at the party, so please wait with them until we return."
045	...!
046	Jeez...talk about terrible timing.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
047	Are Lofia and Michael busy?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
048	Seems so. Since there's a lot to take care of for Winter Holiday, it's no wonder they're busy.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
049	I thought so too. They're probably the busiest people on Winter Holiday.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
050	...!
051	...I'm not surprised. Security is tough, after all. I wanna help them out.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
052	Huh?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
053	Ah, well, they seem to have enough people though. So, I don't think they need any help...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
054	But, they're busier than everyone else, aren't they?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
055	I mean, that's true, but...
056	...?
057	Come on now, Ravina. Lofia and Michael have been entrusted with this job.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0014
058	They have their way of doing things. If you show up all of a sudden, it might be distracting.
059	If those two ask for help, then you should go help them.
060	That's right! Since you've finished your work, you should kick back and relax!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
061	I'm sure Santa has something nice for everyone who's worked so hard.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
062	...I'm not so sure...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
063	What?! So...maybe no presents?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0025
064	I'm sure Santa has something nice for you, Klima, you've certainly been good.
065	...but me...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
066	Why? You're sure to get something. You've been good too you know.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0031
067	...
068	Exactly. Hard working boys and girls are all good!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0006
069	And Santa always brings presents to good boys and girls!
070	...
071	That's why Santa will bring something for Ravina...and Lofia too.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
072	...and Michael?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
073	Hm?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
074	Michael works hard, but is he also a good boy?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
075	Well, to say Michael is a "boy" is...	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0031
076	...I see. By that reasoning, Michael must also be a good boy!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0005
077	Umm... Yes!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
078	Wait, Lotiyah! You're agreeing with her, Ravina? That geezer isn't young enough to be a good kid!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0025
079	With animals, they can be good even if they are old, right?
080	So, yes! Michael is certainly a good boy!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
081	...
082	You're such a good person, Lotiyah.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
083	Oh! You mean it?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
084	Heh, well, you must be naive to call that Archmage a "good boy."
085	Is that what you mean?!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0025
086	Well, that old man would be happy to hear it.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
087	...this party...
088	Hm?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0006
089	Ravina, for the sake of those two, this party can't just be some regular old party.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
090	Huh?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
091	Should be more bigger. Let's have the most amazing Winter Holiday party ever.
092	Let's show how much we appreciate Lofia and Michael by throwing a huge party for them.
093	Something that will wow them.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
094	That would please the two of them, and in turn, that would please you too, Ravina, right?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
095	That way, you would also have a great Winter Holiday, right?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
096	Klima...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
097	Now that we're outside... What do you think would make the greatest party ever?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0002
098	No clue.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0031
099	No plan, huh?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0030
100	Well, in that case... Let's first take a look around the Winter Holiday market!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
101	Slothstein has a large market. We might find some inspiration there.
102	Look! There are Winter Holiday trees everywhere. Big ones, small ones, white ones, green ones, brown ones...	VO_clima.clima_sys_0024
103	Wowww, so many sizes! What kind of tree do you two like?	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0044
104	What kind? Ummm, I have no idea.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
105	Thoughts, Klima?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
106	Errrm, I think a big one will do!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0002
107	We have to get the biggest tree in town. Then Ravina will decorate it and make it look very merry.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0007
108	Yeah. Having a huge tree would be great as it is, but then we'll make it all shiny with decorations. They'll surely love it.
109	What do you think, Ravina?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0001
110	...the biggest tree...
111	Yeah, sounds good. Like, maybe this tree?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
112	Nah...we need something that really says "big."	VO_clima.clima_sys_0031
113	I'm sorry young lady. This is the biggest tree we have in the shop.
114	Aww.	VO_clima.clima_sys_0022
115	...! Klima! Watch out!
116	Uh!	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0019
117	Are you okay, Ravina?!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0026
118	I'm okay… What just happened?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
119	Stop! Thief!
120	Really?! How could something like this happen on a festive day like today?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0017
121	Alright, then. I think we better give security a helping hand.
