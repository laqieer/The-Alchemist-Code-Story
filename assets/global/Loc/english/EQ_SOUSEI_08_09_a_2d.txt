001	Phew!
002	Those winds certainly aren't to be trifled with. This region's weather is harsh!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
003	It's enough to seriously affect combat, even. If this is the norm for Superbia Belt, I feel bad for the people here. It can't be easy getting constantly battered like this.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
004	My arrows sure can't do much in this, I'll tell you that!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
005	If you fight within Mesarthim's Area of Effect, my shield can block the winds for you.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
006	I don't have the magil to keep it up forever, though...
007	There. That's the last of the monsters.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
008	I am in your debt, travelers.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
009	So, are you truly the leader of these lands?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
010	Yes, and of the Infinite Serpent. Does this surprise you?
011	In a word? Very, very much!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0011
012	What kind of leader begs his enemies for help?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
013	Hahaha. That is a loaded question, and one I'm afraid I cannot adequately answer.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0011
014	However, this was a very fortuitous situation for you, don't you think?
015	That depends. Would you care to explain yourself?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
016	Of course, of course. But let's not stand and talk out here whilst the winds whip us. Come, I'll show you to a more comfortable location.
017	Why don't we just talk inside the airship? There's plenty of shelter from the winds below deck.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
018	My, you are all so guarded! It would behoove you to follow me, though.
019	Don't you wish to see the altar upon which the Ceremony of Creation will take place?
020	...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
021	So it's all true, then!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
022	Such a scary face! I trust that you are already aware of what the Ceremony entails.
023	But you are still curious about it, are you not?
024	As thanks for saving me, I'd be happy to give you a tour. You'll be able to see the true heart of our organization.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
025	What...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
026	Bianca, if you'd please?
027	Sure thing. Just a second.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
028	This...is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
029	The foundation of the Ceremony of Creation. It is the true center of Superbia Belt...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
030	And proof of our sin, as the descendants of dragons.
031	This is the Genesis Altar.
032	The Genesis Altar...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0016
033	It looks an awful lot like the arboreal altar in Sephiron.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
034	...
035	The magil here is just as pure, too. This is indisputably the beating heart of this Belt Region.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0045
036	So Gula Belt also has such an altar?
037	It seems Nidhogg doesn't know when to quit either...
038	What do you mean by that?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
039	Simply that your precious Guardian Dragon, Nidhogg, was also unwilling to give up on the Ceremony of Creation.
040	...!	VO_eularea.eularea_battle_0019
041	Lies and slander! How could our Guardian Dragon seek the same end as the Infinite Serpent?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
042	Wait.
043	Nimul?
044	This man's words...may be true.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
045	What?!
046	...
047	In order to seal Beelzebub, Nidhogg allegedly required a Vessel of Purification—Emmel. But did he really?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
048	We've already seen countless attempts to control the Cursed Beasts without any such Vessel...
049	Such as Icona's Valley of Siddim Protocol...
050	And Quence's Space-Time Manipulation.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
051	And Zafeiris' dragon technique as well, perhaps?	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
052	I believe so. In each of those cases, the technique alone was ultimately not successful...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
053	But each was still able to control the Beast to some degree, without a Vessel. And two of the wielders were human, no less!
054	It's inconceivable to think that Nidhogg, before falling to corruption, wouldn't have enough power to do the same.
055	In a way, he was the ruler of Gula Belt.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
056	We had always lived under his protection. You see what I mean, Waginau, don't you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
057	Well, I...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
058	I see it. Nidhogg most certainly had the power to control the Beast. Or, to expound upon that a bit further...
059	He was the only dragonkin to have possessed such power.
060	Which is why I had to destroy it.
061	It was necessary in order to claim Gula Belt for my own.
062	I don't hear any signs of remorse in your voice, Zafeiris...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
063	Because I bear none. I do not believe my actions were in the wrong. I merely chose the method most likely to produce the results I desired.
064	...
065	You two get along surprisingly well.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
066	Putting all of that aside, if Nidhogg didn't require a Vessel of Purification to control the Cursed Beast, then he must've needed it for another reason altogether.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
067	One which we don't presently know.
068	The Ceremony of Creation is a secret art we developed for the express purpose of reviving the world.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
069	It only stands to reason that the last living dragon, Nidhogg, would've done his best to dig his talons into that Ceremony and not let go.
070	That doesn't change the fact that he failed, though.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
071	That's the only reason Gula Belt still stands.
072	Yes, that's true.
073	So there must be some issue with the Ceremony, then.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
074	And I don't think it has anything to do with the number of sacrifices. It's something more...fundamental than that.
075	Outstanding! Your deductive reasoning is exemplary.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0046
076	Though it's nothing new, I'm sure. You must have come to this conclusion long, long ago...Nimul.
077	But you are correct. There is one single, glaring flaw that plagues the Ceremony of Creation.
078	The dragons never reached any sort of consensus on what kind of world they should create.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
079	No matter what spectacular tools they used or the breadth of materials they gathered, they had no future for which they yearned, and thus no plan upon which to move forward.
080	That's why they entrusted humans with the Ceremony—the one species that never gave up on the idea of a better tomorrow.
081	Bianca...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
082	Long time no see, Nimul. You seem well.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
083	A girl! Nimul's getting close to another girl!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
084	I'll have to tell Emmel about this!
085	Mira, we're kind of in the middle of a really serious conversation right now...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
086	For the Creation to work, whosoever carries it out must bear the will of a Creator. They need enough resolve to destroy everything that is, so as to realize their vision of what might be.
087	Nidhogg...was too kind. He could not ignore that decision. He could not overlook the sacrifice that would be required.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
088	Moreover, the Shell of the World was under the protection of Ouroboros—the God who keeps destiny affixed.
089	Ouroboros...
090	But the yoke has been broken, and God is asleep. This world is now adrift, under the watchful eye...of no one. It is, in a very real sense, up for grabs.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
091	And Nimul, because of this, it is possible to grant your wish...now, and only now. If the Ceremony of Creation is held at this very moment, its success is guaranteed.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0014
092	Absolutely not.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
093	...That is the response I anticipated.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_battle_0016
094	I can't imagine anyone would be surprised by it. We've journeyed far and fought long and hard in order to save the people of every land.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
095	We've rejected from the start, and will continue to reject, the idea that anything or anyone must be sacrificed in order to save the world.
096	I don't intend to remake anything. I intend to save it. All of it!
097	Very well, then. You leave us no choice.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0021
098	I'm sorry that this must become a spectacle of force, Nimul.
099	Nimul, this is not a good place for—	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
100	Everyone, stand down. This is my battle, and mine alone.
101	But—!
102	Let's do as he asks, Waginau.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0014
103	Andechs?
104	Things are all progressing a little too predictably—a little too easily. I smell a trap.
105	...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
106	Eulalia can clear away the corruption in the area if push comes to shove, but if she's interfered with, things could get rough. Can I count on you to watch her back?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
107	Of course.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
108	Brace yourself, Bianca!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
109	I will unlock this world!
