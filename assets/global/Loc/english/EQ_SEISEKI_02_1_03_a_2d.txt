001	Phew... They're really persistent. How many of them are there?	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
002	Come on, who's next?
003	Kagura, you handle our opposition over here. I'll take care of the ones on the opposite side.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
004	Eheh! Leave it to me♪ Well, here we go♪	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0023
005	Um, Captain Kudan, Kagura is pretty amazing, isn't she?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
006	...What do you mean?
007	She's younger than me with a smaller build, but her attacks are precise and, more than anything, she's incredibly agile. How is it possible to move like that?
008	Airhead! What are you muttering about? Are you gonna spend the rest of your life resting?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
009	Fi-fine!
010	Hey, Kagura!
011	What?
012	Where did you train before you joined the Holy Guard?
013	Does it matter? Anyway, what are you going to do with that information?
014	Nothing!
015	All right, next!
016	If you aren't gonna do anything with it, can you keep quiet? I can't concentrate on fighting!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
017	What's with the attitude?!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
018	If you've got time to move your lips, then move your sword instead! You better take this seriously, or you're gonna get hurt!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0047
019	Yikes! They blocked it!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
020	Be careful!
