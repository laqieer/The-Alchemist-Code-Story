001	Your Highness! Please, evacuate! The Greed Dike soldiers will be here any minute now...agh!!!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
002	Excuse me. You must be Queen Venus Lustburg, correct?
003	I will not exchange words with such ill-mannered people as you. What are you doing...hurry up and eliminate them.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
004	Understood!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0032
005	I would've preferred to carry out matters peacefully...but it seems like you would prefer otherwise.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
006	Our magic doesn't work on them...!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0020
007	Take them out!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
008	Aghh!!!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0027
009	...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
010	Our sole aim is that of obtaining Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus. It's not to take your life.
011	If you hand it over obediently, we've been ordered by Emperor Orion to spare your life.
012	Orion...that scum with his cheeky words! Die! You ingrates!!!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0012
013	You uncouth fools! I must teach you the price of your undiscerning words...
014	Honestly, you still don't get it, do you?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
015	?!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
016	Restrain her. Do not kill her until she's given up the location of Asmodeus.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
017	My magic doesn't work...?! Is this some kind of special magic defense?! In that case...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
018	What are all these insects...?! What are you doing?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0028
019	Hmph. These is plenty of Alchemia within these creatures.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
020	With them, you stand no chance against me, you Greed Dike scum...
021	Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
022	Aghh!!!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0028_c
023	They froze...?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
024	So you're willing to sacrifice your men in order to obtain power?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
025	Who's there?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
026	That's not a good move, Your Highness. You're supposed to be protecting your people.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
027	More importantly...since a state of emergency has been declared...it's our job to intercept Greed Dike on your behalf.
028	You're that Paladin from the Holy Guard...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
029	Whoa! H-h-hey, hold on! Please, don't strip me naked again! Just for today, can we remove the ban on men?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
030	Your name was Othima, wasn't it? Why do only your abilities work on them?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0001
031	Oh, no...actually, to be honest, it's not working.
032	I just froze their magic defenses along with them.
033	But...that's odd...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
034	Odd...?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
035	Yes. I've never seen such complete protection before.
036	I mean, no matter what kind of defense method is used, it should inflict at least some level of damage.
037	It's true. I've never encountered someone who my magic didn't work on.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0031
038	Plus, these aren't even prototypes. They're just regular soldiers.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
039	Does it mean that someone armed them with magic defenses?
040	Your calm judgment...and your outstanding magic abilities...
041	?!
042	I am deeply impressed, Captain Othima.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0044
043	Behind...?! Agh!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
044	Who are you...?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
045	I am one of the Veda Templars...Acht, the 7 Tactics Master.. Thus, my allegiances lie with Greed Dike.	VO_acht.acht_chara_1001
046	The Veda Templars...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
047	You are the one who equipped those scum with magic defenses?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0012
048	If magic won't work on you...then I'll hack you to death instead!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0004
049	...Gauntlet.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
050	An artificial arm...?! Not good!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
051	Ack...! What kind of attack is this...?	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
052	No! Please stand back and leave this to me!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
053	Don't get in my way! I must use them as fuel!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
054	Right. You are attempting to use their Alchemia to your advantage.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
055	What...?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
056	Radiator.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0004
057	...! She's going to burn them all! Run!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
058	My men...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
059	Ack! Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
060	...!
061	You froze all the bugs?! You...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
062	I'm sorry, that's the best I could do. Please heal them properly later.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
063	Oh dear. Since she switches her artificial arm, her attack style keeps changing as well. I can't grasp a pattern.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
064	That being said, you said something that drew my interest just now.
065	Veda...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
066	Like you've observed...I am from Lost Blue...just like you are.
067	...!
