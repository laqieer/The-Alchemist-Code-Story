001	Zain...you were a rare Lord Commander who lived under the name of absolute justice.
002	You were filled with compassion and loved by everyone...as if you were the sun.
003	The kindness you directed towards your comrades never faltered or changed.
004	Yes...even towards me. I felt something towards you that resembled admiration.
005	But...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
006	Sorry... I'm going to borrow Kagura for the greater good.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
007	As if to laugh off the feelings I had towards you...you changed all at once.
008	No...perhaps you were hiding your true nature all this time.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
009	This coat of arms of the Holy Guard was left behind when Chihaya was assassinated.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0041
010	For someone after the Mikaboshi, her existence was nothing more than an obstacle.
011	You helped Chihaya...in order to make her lower her guard...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
012	If the Mikaboshi were to fall into someone's hands...there would be no greater threat.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
013	That eye...can you turn it against your own?
014	My own?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
015	The reason why he left you here must have been because he wanted to take advantage of Kagura's bloodline in order to obtain the Mikaboshi.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
016	Since you were close to her, he must have wanted to stop you from getting in the way.
017	Is that the reason why you brought Kagura with you and had her stay by your side after Wadatsumi was destroyed?
018	The matter of the Mikaboshi is top secret and must never be leaked to the outside world.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
019	I must also inquire where you heard that story from.
020	You created a façade of justice and made those around you trust you.
021	Kudan...did you come up with that yourself?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
022	Who was the one who fed you that idea?
023	I did everything I did in order to obtain invincible power.
024	I'm...sorry...	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
025	For me, Kagura is a symbol of Wadatsumi that was destroyed before my eyes.
026	For me, protecting her...was the one way for me to make up for not being able to protect Wadatsumi in the past.
027	And you're telling me that you're going to use her for your own ambitions...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
028	!!!
029	N-no...stop...Kudan...	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_1028
030	Zain...the great knight who I long respected...
031	Kagura! Tsk...! Can you make it?!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
032	I will not be misled by your false mask of justice any longer!
033	Don't worry, Kudan! She's still breathing...she might be okay!
034	I...! I...!!!
035	Kudan...?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
036	I will take you out...in order to protect this world!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
037	Ugff!!! Aghh...! Ku-Kudan...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
038	...!
039	Listen carefully... You danced to the tune of some distorted truth...and you killed me.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
040	?! No...nooooooo!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
041	...Are you okay? You were moaning in your sleep.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
042	Huff...huff... No...it's nothing.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
043	Sleep a little longer. You suffered a terrible wound. Don't push yourself.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
044	Are they still pursuing us?
045	Are you talking about the lot from Greed Dike? We've driven them back for today. They seem to have quite the interest in you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
046	... ...
047	Seeing that they can't take you by force, they're probably eyeing to see what you'll do. Heheh... I guess you're the center of attention.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
048	Who are you...? Why do you help me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
049	I'm just the same as they are. I'm also curious to know what you're after. That's all.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
050	... ...
051	I'm gonna go and procure some food. Come now, don't get impatient.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
052	With the wounds that you were dealt, you were on the brink of going to the other side.
053	You should feel grateful just to have regained consciousness.
054	...Greed Dike.
055	In order to truly change the world, such things as love, friendship, or half-hearted justice are not enough. What is necessary is absolute power.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
056	I can rid of you those unnecessary things and allow you to pursue true power...the power to surpass any in this world.	VO_orione.orione_chara_1008
057	... ...
058	Ughh...I think I'm at the end of my rope. My eyesight is beginning to grow hazy.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
059	I didn't hear it was gonna be this hot. Besides...what are these monsters?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0020
060	They're absurdly strong...agh...I can't allow myself to get taken down here.	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
061	Is this it? Am I gonna die at the hands of these monsters?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0021
062	Is my chivalrous knighthood going to end here?! You gotta be kidding me!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0011
063	Huzzaaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
064	Huff...huff...! You gotta be kidding me! No way am I gonna let myself die here!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
065	I am Victor. My knighthood begins from here!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0014
066	Oh? You're surprisingly energetic.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
067	Huh...?
068	I thought you were gonna croak like a frog and drop dead or something...but you're pretty persistent.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
069	Wh-who are you calling a frog?! Who are you?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
070	Before you ask others to name themselves, isn't it polite to do so first, little frog?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
071	I told you I'm not a frog!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
072	Tsk. My name is Victor! I belong Envylia's Scarlet Flame Guard...I'm a knight of justice!
073	Huh...? What is a member of the Scarlet Flame Guard doing all croaked up here?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
074	Hey! I'm still a novice! Stop degrading me!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0022
075	Well, that wasn't really my intention...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
076	This volcano is under the jurisdiction of the Holy Guard. I'm asking you what someone from the Scarlet Flame Guard is doing here.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0029
077	You're...a Paladin?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
078	I'll answer you after you answer me. Isn't that how it works, little frog?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
079	Tsk! I'm heading on my way to save Commander Chloe!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
080	Commander Chloe...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
081	I'm gonna take care of you. Then, I'll be able to claim glorious victory for my first campaign!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
082	You should've just said so from the start. Our goal is the same then.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
083	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
084	My name is Basheeny. I'm also in pursuit of the Lord Commander.
085	You're also looking for Commander Kanon?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
086	Are you really a Paladin? Where's your coat of arms?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
087	Wait...you're not an assassin who is after Commander Kanon, are you?
088	Hmph... I thought you were just a little frog, but you're surprisingly sharp.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0044
089	Huh?
090	I guess you could say you're half right...? Well, anyway, it doesn't concern you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
091	...! What?! You...!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
092	An enemy of Commander Kanon is an enemy of Commander Chloe! Prepare yourself!
093	Huh? How did you reach that conclusion? Weren't we gonna go look for them together?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
094	Shut up! Yeah, this is what I'm talking about! I'm gonna take out an assassin who's after the Lord Commander...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
095	This is a first step worthy of kicking off my knighthood!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
096	I'm gonna take care of you. Then, I'll be able to claim glorious victory for my first campaign!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0015
097	Wow...you've got quite a lot of enthusiasm. I almost forgot how you were croaking over there a moment ago...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0044
098	?!
099	...Anyway, I don't have time to waste here. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to put you to sleep for a while.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
100	Tsk! Huzzzaaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
101	...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
102	I told you not to underestimate me, didn't I? You better prepare yourself!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
103	...Hmm...
104	...Fine. I guess I'll put in some effort.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
105	...!
106	...Wake up, Kudanstein...hey.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
107	Heh...you're a sly one aren't you?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
108	The words he spoke to me...I can still hear them clinging to my ear.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
109	I must discover the true intention of his words.
110	Having resurrected the Holy Sword Excalibur and succeeded in rescuing Kagura...
111	Kanon and her fellow Paladins now advance forward with the aim of restoring glory to the Holy Guard.
112	...Huzzzaaahh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
113	...Sorry, but I don't have time to waste on you. I'm gonna end this quickly.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
114	As these two young knights aim to find Kanon and the others, what could their purpose be?
115	Meanwhile...
116	I'll ascertain this truth that you speak of! Speak to me...Emperor Orion of Greed Dike!
117	Having killed Lord Commander Zain, Kudanstein now finds himself a rebel.
118	What path will he now take?
119	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
120	Sacred Stone Memories -Laws of a Fluctuating World-
121	Huh? Kudan killed Lord Commander Zain...? Are you serious?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
122	It's hard to believe...but that's the truth.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
123	So you're now the Lord Commander?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
124	You gotta be kidding me...although there's nothing humorous about that. Really?
125	... ...
126	Seida, are you gonna go along with this joke? Come on! Say something!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1017
127	Hey, Captain Monzein!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
128	Kagura...you too are now in a position to wield the future of the Holy Guard. You must accept this calmly.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
129	Wh-what are you saying?! That's impossible! What's wrong with all of you?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
130	Unfortunately, it's all true.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
131	Zain was killed by the man called Kudanstein. That being said, the official announcement will be that he died in battle.
132	You're gonna play along with this too, Miuna? Come on!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
133	Kudan...killed Commander Zain? How can such an absurd story be true?!
134	I...I...will absolutely not believe it!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0020
135	Kagura!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
136	It's understandable. For Kagura...Lord Commander Kudan was like an older brother.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
137	Regardless of how painful it may be, she must accept it.	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
138	If you guys go to her, she'll get emotional again. I'll go check on her.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
139	Miuna...thank you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
140	Don't worry, Kanon. Kagura is a proper knight now...I'm sure she'll accept it.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
141	...Okay.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
142	More importantly, what do you plan to do from now?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
143	First of all, I want to contact Captain Yauras and Captain Othima.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
144	...You said they were headed to Greed Dike, correct?
145	They're heading there under the assumption that they may be harboring Captain Kudan.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
146	It is possible that Kudan encountered the Lion Monarch Orion at the Wind Ruins. It's not an unlikely story.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
147	I just hope they don't do anything rash. If anyone discovered that a Captain of the Holy Guard is making inquiries, they may accuse us of meddling in internal affairs.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
148	Don't worry. Neither of them are careless.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
149	In any case, our main priority is to transport the two that are injured.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
150	Understood!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
151	...! Wait!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
152	Huh...?
153	Right now...I sensed an evil presence for a moment. It could be someone in possession of a dark power...	VO_caida.caida_chara_1004
154	Could it be...Captain Kudan?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
155	If it is Kudan...we can't afford to have Kagura run into him.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0016
156	I'll go bring Chloe and Spica. You guys go on ahead.
157	...Understood!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
158	Ughh...! Wh-what's with that power you just wielded?!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0022
159	A novice little frog like you wouldn't understand.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
160	All right, are you ready for this? Try not to croak too early.
161	E-enough! Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
162	Huh? I don't get you. How can you fight me when you know you don't stand a chance?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
163	The battle isn't over yet!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0012
164	Regardless of my inexperience or whatever bizarre power you wield, I will not lose!!!
165	I will be victorious in the end!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
166	Are you saying you have a secret weapon?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
167	Who needs a secret weapon?! The difference between you and me is our commitment!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
168	Commitment...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
169	I was supposed to support my family...but they let me go, telling me to not give up on my dream of becoming a knight.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
170	In order to not waste the sacrifice my family made...I can't afford to die here!
171	I won't let a thug like you take me out!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0004
172	...So you're saying that your family's sacrifice is what supports you? Hahah! That's amazing!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
173	You scum...what's so funny about that?!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
174	No, I really think it's amazing. It's an emotion that I can't grasp since I was born an orphan.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
175	You...don't have a family?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
176	Hahah. No need to give me that look. For me, it was just business as usual.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
177	But...you seem to have made a big misunderstanding.
178	Misunderstanding...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
179	When it comes to who wins or loses, mental will has nothing to with it.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
180	It all comes down to power. The one with more power is the one who wins. That's all it comes down to.
181	It all comes down to...power?
182	Yes. It's not just battle. That's the basis that this world is built on.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
183	You don't get it, do you?	VO_victor.victor_chara_1006
184	Huh?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
185	When people are fueled with a strong and passionate emotion, that's the first time they can stand on their own two feet as a person.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
186	That emotion is what gives birth to power. How can you not know something so basic?
187	It gives birth to power...? Like an egg?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
188	You don't understand it? I guess no one taught you. I feel bad for you.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
189	I don't really get it, but I'm starting to feel irritated.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
190	When it comes to absolute power, mental strength has nothing to do with it. I'll teach you that now.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
191	Sounds good! Come on then; attack!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
