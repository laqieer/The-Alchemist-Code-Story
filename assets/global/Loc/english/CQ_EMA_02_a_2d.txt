001	Haa... That was exhausting.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
002	Thank you. Here's your payment for this month.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0004
003	Awesome! Thank y-... What the hell?! Really?! This is all I get?!<br><br>	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
004	Feel free to quit anytime. There are plenty of others who want this job.
005	I hired you because of a recommendation from the Magic School. You should thank me for even letting you keep this job while you’re still a student.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0030
006	Urgh...	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
007	Besides, if you really need money, why not have your parents give you an allowance? Isn't that what all the other students do?	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0022
008	I...can't.
009	Shut your trap, you spoiled brat! You think we have that kind of money?!
010	It's all your fault! You turned him into that monster! It's all your fault he’s a filthy insect!
011	I'm sorry. I'll be good. I'll be better.
012	I'll try to be better, so please...don't be mad at me.
013	(Tch... Why did I have to remember that?)
014	Aaagh! Stop it! That's not who I am anymore! I’m not going to act all pitiful like that ever again!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
015	I'm never going back to that pathetic, disgusting lifestyle!
016	Being poor sucks! I just wanna be rich!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0030
017	Heh. You wanna make some money, girlie? I got a job for yah.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
018	What the...? What do you want? Ew! You stink of booze!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
019	Hey! Get away from me! Do you want me to burn off what little hair you have left?!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
020	You what?! You better watch your attitude, little girl!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
021	Emma! You shouldn't be wandering around these streets.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0001
022	And why do you look so glum?	VO_celine.celine_sys_0012
023	Ms. Celine!
024	Aw, crud! A teacher from the Magic School!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
025	...
026	W-we haven't done anything yet!
027	...
028	Y-yeah! P-please don't turn us into anything...unnatural.
029	...
030	Uhm... Hello?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
031	I haven't heard a single thing you've said.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0029
032	Huh?
033	I'm sorry. It’s just that I don't want to soil my ears with your filthy voices.
034	So, could you please be quiet now? That would be best for both of us.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0016
035	Wh-what...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
036	Whoa. Talk about attitude.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0011
037	Come along, Emma. Let's go somewhere where the air is cleaner.	VO_celine.celine_sys_0007
038	Sorry, guys. Gotta do what my teacher tells me.
039	Screw you! You ain't going nowhere!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
040	Really? Are we really going to do this?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0029
041	Women in this country need to be taught a lesson! Starting with you two!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0013
