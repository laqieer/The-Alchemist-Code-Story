001	Huff...huff... I won't let you lay a finger on him!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
002	I assume you are acting out of naive loyalty.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
003	Do you see your master for who he really is, boy?
004	Don't you realize you're being fed a twisted version of the truth?
005	Shut up!
006	Ack! At this rate...	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0028
007	It's all right! Dad and Dias should be here any moment now!
008	So, you're buying time. Very well. In deference to your overbearing chivalry, we'll take our leave.
009	Y-you're gonna run?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0025
010	I told you; this is just the beginning.
011	The king may witness this drama of revenge unfold, and when he is at the edge of despair, he will be thrust into hell.
012	As for you... I wonder just how well you can protect the one you desire to protect.
013	Stop, no! I'm going after him!
014	Wait, Logi! You were wielding Alchemy just now, weren't you?!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0029
015	W-well...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
016	Now that the return of Alchemy is a reality, this is no longer just our problem.
017	Your Majesty, we must request for the Holy Guard to be dispatched.
018	... ...	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0031
019	No! There's no time to wait for the Holy Guard.
020	Matters of Alchemy are all handled at the discretion of the Holy Guard.
021	That is the law of Babel defined in the Magna Code.
022	This could very well develop into a continent-wide crisis. Your use of Alchemy is undoubtedly forbidden.
023	Pl-please, wait!
024	We've received word that within the castle, the Holy Convent has been occupied by the Lizard Brigade!
025	The Convent?! Sabareta... He wouldn't! Excuse me!
026	Wait!
027	Agatha, please be safe!
