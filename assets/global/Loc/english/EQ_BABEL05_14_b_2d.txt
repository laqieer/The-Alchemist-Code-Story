001	How admirable of you, little miss observer of history!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
002	Urgh! Argh... Nngh.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0043
003	Don't you think...it's a little warm in here?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
004	Oh, yes. Unpleasantly so.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
005	The Holy Guard, of which you were once a part, no longer exists. The justice of the continent, or whatever drivel it was that you intended to contribute, is a thing of the past.
006	Th-that's...true. The probability of me...returning to my time...is very...slight.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
007	Yet... The Inquisitor and the witch were both passionate enough to melt that snow.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
008	So you're wrong. I think...you're wrong.
009	We are the Holy Guard!
010	Upon hearing reports of the activation of the ancient, alchemic relics known as the Demonic Soldiers, we have hastened here in accordance with the Magna Code!
011	Citizens, please follow all instructions quickly and precisely, and allow our knights to evacuate you to safety!
012	Paladins! We will now begin relief efforts for the people of this city, as well as commence our effort to secure the ruins!
013	Order and justice are on our side! Let your every action embody the justice of the continent!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0029
014	You move fast, don't you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
015	Ahahahah... I think you'll find that there are lots of young people among your ranks after the restructure. They're all very passionate, aren't they?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
016	Don't you think that you ought to retreat? Seeing as you are the dark side of the Holy Guard?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
017	It will take mere seconds to wipe you from existence.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
018	Ngh!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0042
019	You let down your guard.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
020	Kaya! Are you all right?!
021	A sniper?! Who are you?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0021
022	No one you would know.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0023
023	...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
024	I'll ask you to stand down.
025	I may retreat for now, but we both know that it is only a matter of time before I return.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
026	Nonetheless, I am not going to kill you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
027	I will observe, investigate, and uncover the truth.
028	For that is the promise I made to that blockhead.
029	I swore that what light I gleaned from my path would shine upon that of the Holy Guard, that it may guide them.
030	I know. It doesn't sound like something I would say at all.
031	...
032	I'm not normally this active.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1008
033	Kaya! Who was that?!
034	You don't need to know the answer to that, Courage.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0015
035	Cheryl and the others have disappeared again!
036	Don't worry yourself over it.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
037	They'll be back.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
038	Chance Encounter will be over soon.
039	Chance Encounter, bringing different times together, only lasts but a fraction of a second. Albea, Wilhelm, and... Milis, was it? They've gone back to their respective times and places.
040	Now, there's just Lofia and...
041	...
042	I know.
043	If you go back now, the retrogressive flow of time will revert back to its normal state, and you will all die.
044	...
045	N-no...! Michael and Lofia will—!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0020
046	This is most unfortunate.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0035
047	I know! Don't get your mustache all in a twist! Have no fear, for the amazing Mira has a wonderful idea!
048	Just so you all know, I'm against it, but—
049	We can't just let them die!
050	Considering the parallel worlds and the borders between them, I'm not even sure that Lofia's magic can actually sustain your plan, Mira.
158	Anyway, why don't we just regulate Lofia's existence to a parallel? That'd get us what we want, wouldn't it?
051	If we go around making parallels willy-nilly, we'll end up with annihilation, and singularity generation, and a whole bunch of other problems that'll put the future at risk!
052	Time is infinite, remember?!
053	What...?
054	You don't need to understand.
055	Time is always in motion. Specifically, it moves forward along a singular axis.
056	That's why, for example, even if you set your destination to specific coordinates, the chance of you actually ending up there is very slim.
057	If you're not a practiced space-time manipulator, then even retaining your memories after the time leap is incredibly difficult.
159	That's what Nyx and I are here for. If you can lend us your magic...!
160	Then we've got a chance, however small it may be!
161	It'll take everything we've got to activate the technique. It's just as difficult as initiating Chance Encounter.
162	Once the manipulation is under your control, you'll have to go against the flow of time, all the while maintaining power so that the channel stays open.
058	Even if you should succeed, there is a strong chance that same tragedy will play out, all over again.
163	If you fail, you might end up lost forever in some distant nook of time...or you might cease to exist altogether.
164	...
059	Still...
060	Despite all that, you want to meet them, don't you?
061	...
062	I want to live. I want to go home.
063	Let's give it a try.
064	I'm going home.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
165	(These vestments, with their residual wisdom that comes of having been passed down for generations, will surely lend me strength.)
065	This has been an excellent opportunity.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
066	You've done well to return so swiftly.
067	A Few Days Later...<br>Northern Pride - Inquisition Headquarters
068	My mission consisted of two parts. First was the investigation of the Paladins in Lustburg, and second was the exposure of their true purpose.
069	I apprehended the Paladins who plotted the murder of Court Mage Lofia and sent them here. I leave their questioning and all of the other formalities in your capable hands.
070	However, I must confess that I have returned ignorant of their aim.
071	The falsified notice of dismissal has been retrieved and renounced without question. Its origin is currently under investigation.
072	Many voices have been raised in relation to this matter—not only from within Lustburg, but also from within the Court Mage Order—questioning the responsibility of the Holy Guard.
073	The Holy Order of Babel will likely initiate a systematic investigation.
074	Furthermore, now that the existence of the Demonic Soldiers in Slothstein has become public knowledge, the Holy Guard has seemingly entered into negotiations with the country.
075	As a measure to ease the populace's fear of Alchemy and Demons, it seems that there is a strong possibility that...
076	The Holy Guard will allow, under strict supervision, the employment of a limited number of Demons within the city.
077	It appears, however, that the Demonic Soldiers, which caused such damage to the city only a few days ago, have been utterly destroyed.
078	Very strange.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0005
079	If the Holy Guard was responsible for their demise, we may yet be able to entrust them with the supervision of Slothstein.
080	(According to Kaya, the information I now possess makes me a target for elimination by Corpse.)
081	(However, those of Corpse who knew that fact were killed during Chance Encounter, together with the Demonic Soldiers, while I returned unharmed to the present.)
082	(Now, as far as the Corpse here are concerned, I am merely deserving of a warning, for having gotten involved with Lofia.)
083	(With the truth locked away in my heart for none to see, I will become a deterrent.)
084	(I will not only judge heretics of Alchemy, but also work in secret to suppress the spread of the dark side of the Holy Guard.)
085	(For the sake of the justice of this continent that remains rooted in the Holy Guard, and for our future, I am prepared to risk everything.)
086	However, there is one small blessing in all of this.
087	With the murder of Court Mage Lofia having been prevented, the number of casualties in Lustburg remains, mercifully, at zero.
088	It is truly a miracle that the damage sustained was so negligible.
089	...
090	It appears that there was a witch who knew what the future of our world held.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0031
091	It is a country of witches. Such things are possible.
092	Now, Cheryl... With this feat, you have purged yourself of your family's dishonor.
093	No, Sir, I'm afraid I have not. The purge has only just begun...
094	For I loathe Alchemy.
095	The well-worn name of justice...
096	The future of this world...
097	I am well aware of the fact that time is finite.
098	Time etches all that transpires into the fabric of this world, transforming the future into the present before our very eyes.
099	So we fight eternally, perpetually, endlessly; within the finite bounds of time itself.
100	It'll be okay, though. I'm sure.
101	There will be those who fight to protect their comrades...
102	Those who fight to live so that they can meet the ones they care for.
103	We have to take the sweet past and the bitter past together in order to build the future.
104	It's just like magic.
105	Which means that we can—
106	Nyx!
107	Hey, Mira...
108	All set?
109	You know it!
110	Instant blastoff! Immediate action!
111	Time is finite, you know!
112	We're gonna take out the Cursed Beasts...
113	For the future of this world!
114	Ugh. I'm so hungry.
115	I never imagined that the city would be so large! Plus, it's all brick and cobblestone. I don't see a single animal.	VO_milis.milis_battle_0028
116	I'm sorry, Grandma. I might not be able to keep my promise.
117	Ohh...it's snowing.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0018
118	...
119	Huh?
120	Oh, you moved.
121	Um?
122	Hey, what are doing there? Is this a new game? I'm pretty sure you'll freeze to death.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
123	Oh, um, no. I'm, well...
124	Heheh. I-I guess you can say I sort of collapsed here.
125	Collapsere?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
126	Umm...
127	It means that you're dying on the side of the road, from cold and hunger.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
128	Oh, wow! That's probably exactly what happened!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0046
129	Would you like some?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
130	What's that?
131	Don't you know what cake is?
132	Huh? W-well, I... Y-yeah.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0004
133	That's no good. You're missing out on life. Try eating some.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0015
134	Are you giving it to me?
135	Past or future... It doesn't matter. Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives.
136	Th-thank you? Wow. It's so fluffy!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0034
137	Now is as good a time as any.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
138	Umgf...
139	This is so delicious! I've never eaten anything like it before!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0046
140	Heheh...
141	Let me know if you're ever in need, okay?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
142	Huh?	VO_milis.milis_chara_1018
143	I'll always be your friend.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0038
144	Huh?! What're you—?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0025
145	My name is Lofia. I'm a Court Mage from Lustburg.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1001
146	Whoa!
147	U-um! I'm Milis, from the plains of Saga!
148	What's the matter? You've gone all formal on me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0005
149	My grandma used to tell me that, since I was born as a girl, I should aim to become a lovely gentlewoman!
150	I didn't know what that meant until now, but...
151	I bet you're one of them! A gentlewoman!
152	You know so much, and you're all, like, modern...and sweet!
153	You smell really sweet, too! You're exactly the kinda lady I wanna be!
154	Heheh. It's lovely to meet you, Milis.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
155	I'm never saying goodbye to you again.
156	H-huh?
157	I have come to make things right.
