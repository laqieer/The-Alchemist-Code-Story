001	Ngh!
002	Huzzaaaaaaaaahh!
003	Wh—?!
004	Chihaya...?
005	Chihaya! Chihaya...why?!
006	I am nothing more than a mirage. The manifestation of the error of your ways.
007	Still...why did you have to...?!
008	You understood the weight of all you had done, yet you could not withdraw...so you became alone. Was what I entrusted to you too great a burden?
009	We shared the same ideals.
010	But we cannot be forgiven...so let me at least pray for you.
011	Kuza, proud warrior of Wadatsumi... Please... Save...Wadatsumi.
012	No! You can't go, Chihaya!
013	I pray you will reach the heights you...have always aspired for.
014	Chihaya...
015	Chihaya!
016	What...is happening?
017	Kudan... Kuza had been... Well...
018	You have also been pursuing power to fill the void in your soul?
019	...
020	I trust you'll let us through now.
021	Go on.
022	Kuza...?
023	I know you'll never stray from your path again.
032	Urgh!
033	You are no longer of any use to me.
034	Kuza!
035	Waginau! You...!
036	Go.
037	L-let me get you some aid!
038	Can't you let me choose when I die?
039	This is how it's meant to be for a loser like me, who was tempted by the false light of absolute power. A light as bright and blinding as the sun's...
040	Ironic, isn't it? I was enthralled by the very being who took Wadatsumi away from us.
041	Kuza!
042	I stood too close to the sun, not realizing that it was burning my own flesh.
043	The sun is a lonely being, and yet...I so wanted to be like it.
044	But I wasn't strong enough to sever the bonds that linked me to you and Chihaya. I lacked that determination.
045	I should have known. Truth is, I always had sunlight shining over me. I have been such a fool...
046	That's enough!
047	I doubt I'll be going where Chihaya is, but she reminded me that my love for Wadatsumi can live on without me.
048	Kudan... Protect Wadatsumi. Protect our princess...and our home.
049	Kuza!
050	I know you can do it. And...take this.
051	Your pipe...?
052	I'll see you again, Brother.
053	No!
054	Aren't you going to go after him?
055	A minor detail. I could ask you the same.
056	I've entrusted him with everything that needs to be.
