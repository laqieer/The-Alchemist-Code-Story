001	Swimming time ♪ I'm first to the swimming pool!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0023
002	It's the first swimming lesson of the year at Venus School of Magic.
003	Alma and Rebecca are both late. They should hurry up and change!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
004	Huh? What's that on the ground?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
005	Wow, it's a beautiful golden key! I wonder if someone dropped it.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
006	Somehow... It's shining so bright...eeek?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
007	Someone...help. At this rate...the sun...the light will disappear!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
008	Please, before that happens...all the Sun Keys...please...!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
009	...Are you okay?
010	...Huh? Who are you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	Hearing the voice, Lisbeth realizes that she is somewhere unknown to her.
012	I'm <p_name>. I felt like someone called me. By the time I realized it, I was here.
013	Oh, me too! I found a key near the school's poolside. Then, the key suddenly began shining...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
014	I was engulfed by that light...and then began to hear someone's voice. Um, something about Sun Keys...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
015	So you came here from "somewhere that is not here" too. It looks like there's only the four of us here.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0027
016	Judging from everyone's appearance, it seems like we've all come here during summer vacation.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0044
017	Vacation? Um, I'm Lisbeth. I'm a witch from the Venus School of Magic.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
018	I was going to attend swimming class. What about you guys?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
019	I'm Killer Princess Laevateinn. I guess summer vacation hasn't started for students yet.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0045
020	Oh. Nice to meet you. I-I'm Yuri. I'm a kunoichi.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_1047
021	I'm <p_name>. I don't have any official title. Just a regular person.
022	I was swimming in the sea when I found a golden key. Then there was something about Sun Keys, and...
023	Huh? Now that I think about it, where did the key go?
024	Huh?! I can't find it anywhere...	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0025
025	We were transported here, but maybe the keys were left where we found them.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0031
026	Huh? I found mine! I still have my key!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
027	This must be the Sun Key that the mysterious voice was talking about, right?
028	Can you show me? Yeah, I think it's the same key as the one I found.
029	It shone really brightly like the sun so I guess we can call them Sun Keys.
030	Oh yeah. It was something like that. I guess everyone else heard that voice too, didn't they?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
031	Yeah.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
032	It said something about the sunlight disappearing... It was scary. If that really happened, that would be terrible.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0030
033	But, now that I think about it, before finding the key, the sunlight seemed to be weaker than usual. It didn't really feel like summer...
034	My country doesn't have summer, but...there were more cold days than usual...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
035	The warmth of the sun was weaker where I came from too. It was covered by black clouds, and it was a little cold even though it was summer...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
036	It seems like something serious is happening.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0022
037	But...what are we supposed to do with this information...?
038	While saying this, Lisbeth gazes at her Sun Key as if to search for clues.
039	If we asked this key, do you think we'd hear the voice again?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
040	Well...I'm not sure.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
041	I doubt the answer's that simple.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0040
042	Hey, voice person! If you can hear me, please answer!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
043	Oh! You can hear my voice properly. What a relief...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0024
044	!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
045	Oh?! There's light flowing out of the key! A-and a girl appeared!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0009
046	Are you the one who was calling out to us?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0001
047	Yes! It was me. I wanted your help.
048	Oh, I'm sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Amaterasu.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
049	I'm sometimes called The One Who Governs the Sun...
050	Save that talk for later. You want us to help you, right? What are we supposed to do?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0016
051	Oh! Th-that's right! I want you to help me get back the Sun Keys!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0025
052	Because, at this rate, the light of the sun will disappear.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
053	Now that I think about it, recently the sunlight seems to be weaker than usual.	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
054	Was that because the Sun Keys were taken?! What should we do?! This is serious!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
055	What exactly are these Sun Keys?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0001
056	Oh...right. I should start with an explanation.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_chara_1001
057	The Sun Keys are tools that are necessary to control day and night.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
058	Each world has their own key, but they were all stolen.
059	Who would steal something that important?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0027
060	If your story is true then it sounds like they're not something that can be easily stolen.	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
061	I also never expected this to ever happen!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
062	The Twilight Zone, which is where the keys were kept, is strongly protected by the sun. No one except for me should have been able to enter...
063	But the Twilight Zone was engulfed in negative energy, causing it to lose the sun's protection.
064	It was unexpected...I never expected someone to be able to do that.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
065	Mmm. I don't really understand, but in other words, you were careless?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
066	Ohh! B-but that's not all!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0019
067	I have to focus on my work during the witching hour, the time when the day changes to night. That's why if someone tries to steal them then, there isn't anything I can do about it...
068	So that means you were careless, right?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0016
069	Well...that wasn't my intention, but...	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0018
070	Whether or not you were careless...I get that somehow your opponent got one over on you.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
071	Do you know what the motive of the person who stole the Sun Keys is?
072	It's the same as what I said earlier: to eliminate the light of the sun.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0022
073	To thrust each world into darkness...where the sun cannot reach...
074	What kind of problems are there specifically when a world is thrust into darkness?	VO_revatein.revatein_event1013
075	Complete darkness is a pretty big problem itself!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
076	Well, of course...but it's not just that.	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_sys_0010
077	In a world where light does not shine, the hearts of the people grow darker and darker.
078	They begin to lose hope, become pessimistic, and constantly mourn over their misfortunes...
079	...What a terrible world...
080	We need to stop the person who could plot something so terrible!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
081	Also...that means these keys have power stored in them, right?
082	Lisbeth points her Sun Key towards the four of them when...
083	Eeek?! They're coming after me!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0016
084	!!!
085	Hearing the sudden change in her voice, everyone understands that Amaterasu is in trouble.
086	We'll come save you right away...oh, hey, where are you, Amaterasu?! We can't save you without that information!
087	U-use the keys!	VO_amaterasu.amaterasu_battle_0019
088	The power of the sun coming from the Sun Key will certainly guide you to where I govern the sun...
089	Then we gotta go right away!
090	Sun Key...Please take us to Amaterasu!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
091	In response to Lisbeth's prayer, light shines from the Sun Key.
092	The light emitted traces the sky, creating the outline of a golden door.
093	What is that?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0025
094	Where could that be?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
095	Oh! I saw the same thing in a picture during class! It's Babel...it's my world!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
096	The world you live in?	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0044
097	Yes! Does that mean Amaterasu is somewhere on the continent of Babel?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
098	Let's go beyond the door...and into this land called Babel!
099	But are you okay with going to a world you're completely unfamiliar with?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
100	I originally came here with the purpose of helping out so it doesn't matter where I go.	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0004
101	I see. I feel more relieved going to your world, Lisbeth, than someplace unknown to all of us.
102	Yes, I'll be the guide! All right, everyone, let's go! Into the door!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
103	In order to help Amaterasu, the four of them leap swiftly into the world beyond the door.
104	What fate awaits the four of them?!
105	Well, let's observe which way the chips fall.
106	Huh...where are we? Is this the sea?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1008
107	It appears so. You said that your country doesn't have summer...so maybe this isn't your country?	VO_yuri.yuri_sys_0031
108	Oh, yes...I think it's a nearby country. Maybe.
109	So where is Amaterasu? We need to help her immediately...
110	She's on that ship docked over there.	VO_revatein.revatein_battle_0001
111	But it doesn't look like we can save her anytime soon...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0022
112	Uggraaahhh!!!
113	Ah, seriously...you scared me! Don't get in the way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
114	It doesn't look like we can ignore it! We'll have to push through...let's go!	VO_yuri.yuri_battle_1014
115	We're here on a rescue mission...so maybe I'll use a little more of my strength...	VO_revatein.revatein_sys_0007
116	Hyaahhh!
117	Hold on, both of you! Oh, I'll protect you, <p_name>!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
118	Using their individual weapons, the three girls rush forward.
