001	Roxanne and Soren make the effort to sneak away from the duelling pair.
002	All bark and no bite?... *muttering*
003	That cunning minx...! *muttering*
004	I see what you're up to... *muttering*
005	*muttering* I'll show you... I'll show you!
006	First, I'm gonna smash that Core of yours into tiny pieces!
007	UGHHH!!!
008	Ro... Roxanne. Please, calm down...
009	I. AM. CALM!!!
010	O... Okay. Let's focus on the Core as Sieg told us to... we cannot allow it to repair itself.
011	I'm sorry Soren... That was childish of me. I should not have shouted at you like that.
012	And you're right, we have to prevent Zheng Yi from using the Core again. Sieg's counting on us!
013	Ready, Soren?
014	I'll do my best!
015	On the count of three! One... Two...
016	THREE!
017	Our attacks just bounced off?!
018	[Impact detected. Barrier integrity intact. Deploying additional counter-measures.]
019	Ugh...!
020	The air's heavy again...
021	Teacher said this was... Alchemia particles flooding the air...
022	Soren, are you alright?
023	Ugh... I don't feel so good...
024	Grrrr!
025	Where'd they come from?!
026	Soren, be on your guard! We've got company!
