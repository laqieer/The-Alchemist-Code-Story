001	Huff...huff... We're finally...here! This is...	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0019
002	The Trial Ruins!
003	Phew... That said, we've been fighting non-stop to reach here, and I'm—	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
004	Exhausted?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0003
005	!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
006	Ca-Captain Vettel!
007	N-n-not me! She's the only one who's exhausted!
008	I'm Chloe from the 1st Rank, and I remained filled with vigor and energy!
009	Hey! That's not fair! I'm Kanon, and I'm filled with energy as well!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0014
010	Seriously? You've been out of breath all this—
011	What's going on here?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_chara_0009
012	Eeeek!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
013	Ohhh...it's the Flame Dragon King!
014	If you're here to play, then go back now. It's not going to be easy from here.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0016
015	I-I'm...sorry.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
016	Knights, fall in line!
017	This is the Trial Ruins, where you will undergo your final trial.
018	Your actions from now will determine whether you will become a Paladin or not. Understood?!
019	Yes, Captain!
020	I-it's finally begun! Our final trial! All right, let's go, Chloe!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0015
021	Ye-yes!
022	Cadanova...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
023	Let's wait and see for now.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
024	...Right.
025	That said...
026	Hm? What is it?
027	Who would've thought a wimp like you would end up becoming the captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
028	Hey, come on now. I'd say the same about you. We used to call you Mininova. Now, you're the captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0023
029	Come to think of it, we met at a joint training similar to this one 20 years ago.
030	Ah. I remember those days we were both aiming to become Paladins.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0006
031	Now, here we are, following separate paths. How strange.
032	I still believe that, with your amount of talent...
033	Cadanova. Don't you remember what I told you that day?
034	I'm aiming for a world without Alchemy. I believe that power alone will not lead to true peace. My thinking hasn't changed.
035	...I see.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
