001	Hey, what do you mean "Voda is in danger"?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
002	Georgios is going to find Voda! We need to hurry to the Water Temple!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
003	Calm down, Tina. Take your time to explain what's going on.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
004	...Um, Tina, do you mean that you can see the future?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
005	It's not like I can see it whenever I want, but I saw it once in front of Asena... This is the second time.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
006	So, you have the power of foresight.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
007	Now you understand, right? We've got to hurry to Voda...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
008	Wait, Tina. In our current state, we won't be able to beat Georgios. We must find a way to win first!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0015
009	There's no time for that! Even while we waste time here, the threat to Voda continues to grow!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0040
010	If we challenged him now, we'd only repeat what happened before! Even the three of us couldn't beat him!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0014
011	It doesn't matter! What's important now...is that we hurry to Voda!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0039
012	Voda's existence is crucial to us of the Voda faction.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
013	If something were to happen to her, who knows how that'd affect my hometown...?
014	There's no time to waste!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
015	Challenging him now will only result in our meaningless deaths! Do you think that's what Chief Adone would've wanted? Think calmly, Tina!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
016	Fine...then what are we supposed to do...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
017	Tina, Chief Adone entrusted you with his hopes for Saga's future. If you were to die, his dream dies with you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
018	I'm well aware of that! Who are you to lecture me about my father's hopes?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
019	Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
020	My father won't be able to rest in peace unless I can fulfill his wishes! That's why...that's why I...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
021	Tina! Please, calm down!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
022	... ...
023	Tina...
024	...I'm sorry. It's just so frustrating to have foresight into the future...yet lack the power to do anything to change it.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
025	If it's going to be this way, I might as well never have received this power!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
026	Tina, this isn't a burden for you to bear alone. We're here for you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
027	Glurrr...glurppp...glurrrrpp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0004
028	Tsk... What bad timing! Let's talk after we take out the Jam!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
