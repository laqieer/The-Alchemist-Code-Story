001	I searched everywhere else. This is the only place left.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0030
002	Bold, aren't they? Generally when one runs away, they try to get as far as possible.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
003	But to hide right under our noses like this... They are determined, I'll give them that.
004	It's no surprise. They didn't retreat with the intent to give up, but merely to regroup.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0007
005	And they've had ample time now to prepare their counteroffensive. It does beg the question, what are they plotting?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0004
006	What, indeed...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
007	...!
008	There they are.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
009	Just as predicted. Leave the soldiers to me. Your role is—	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
010	The Shield Maiden, Mesarthim, I know. She will be dealt with!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
011	Well, well. Is it just you I'll be facing, then?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0044
012	I'm more than enough. And I will stop you.
013	I like your energy. Show me what you're made of!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
014	...
015	You've hidden yourself well. It seems you've learned to take full advantage of your environment.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
016	However, so long as you do not risk yourself in actual combat, nothing can truly begin or end. There is no winning unless your opponent loses.
017	You're right.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
018	And that's precisely why we're not going to show you any mercy. But just remember: a battle's not won on firepower alone!
019	What's this?!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0019
020	You're definitely strong. But your strength is that of a warrior.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0002
021	And that's something I can take advantage of. If I slow you down with my techniques, then even the sharpest edge of your weapon will be far less effective!
022	...!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0042
023	Clever thinking. You have indeed exposed one of my vulnerabilities.
024	Appreciate the compliment. It might only work once, but it works, and that's what counts!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
025	It was a mistake to assume that you could completely neutralize my weapon like this, however.
026	What?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
027	Come forth, avatar of Gluttony, and consume me!
028	It's another Cursed Beast phantom!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0019
029	Roooooaaaaaaaar!!!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_a
030	Nngh... I guess it really was overly optimistic to think that would work.	VO_nix.nix_battle_0022
031	Fall back, Nyx! I'll purify that phantom with my Spiritbonding.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
032	Got it!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0038
033	Grrrrroooooaaaaar!!!	VO_beelzebub.beelzebub_battle_0028_b
034	Hmph. Shall we play a bit of hide-and-seek, then? I do rather enjoy the hunt, so I'm happy to indulge.
035	Found you!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0001
036	Space-Time Manipulation?! Drat! It must be because the magil shifted!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
037	This is the end!
038	Hmph. An interesting, if reckless, gambit.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
039	Oh, don't worry, I've got plenty more up my sleeve!	VO_nix.nix_battle_0016
040	...!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0022
041	I used Space-Time Manipulation to make those arrows fly way faster! Not too easy to dodge them now, huh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
042	These arrows are...Alchemy...?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0020
043	Finally! We've got you now.
044	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0032
045	I can't remove them?!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0039
046	You're fast, and strong. We can't attack you head-on.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0003
047	And while my skills can't ever measure up to Julia's, I can at least assure you that those arrows are going to burn you from the inside out.
048	What?! Then I'll just have to kill you before they do!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0042
