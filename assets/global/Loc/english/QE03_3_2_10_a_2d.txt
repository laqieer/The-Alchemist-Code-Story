001	Huff...huff...! Um...Alma? What is Belphegor?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
002	You've guys have at least heard of it, right?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
003	Some of the countries in Babel have their own Sacred Stone. Apparently, this country's Sacred Stone is called Asmodeus.
004	I've heard of that, but...what about it?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
005	The Belphegor that Dias referred to...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
006	Apparently, it's the Sacred Stone that was hidden in Slothstein.
007	That's not even a rumor...that's government secrets! Where do you even get your information from?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
008	Anyway...so, the fact that Belphegor is in this country...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
009	So it's true that a man entered from Slothstein?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
010	I see...Slothstein, huh?	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0005
011	Salomo?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
012	That country is a haven for mechanical engineering. I've heard they have flying machines.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0031
013	My guess is that the man was riding on a super-fast machine that was flying through the sky.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
014	Or else it would be impossible to break through this country's security.
015	A super-fast machine that flies... Do you think it can fly above the clouds as well?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
016	That's the final hope left to us.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
017	If the man was caught, shouldn't he be imprisoned in the royal palace?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
018	Let's go back to the royal palace!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
019	We...we won't...let you!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
020	Whoa! I thought we just defeated you!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
021	We'll never let you back into the royal palace!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
