001	With a flick of Morrigan's wrist, an illusory Eira materializes from the surface of the shimmering pool.
002	Mmh...
003	Oh, child.
004	I have borne witness to your troubles, though I know not the depths of your suffering.
005	From the day we met in that frozen forest, your innocent soul has intrigued me.
006	Will you tell me more?
007	...Scary smell lady...
008	Ah. The helgwn...and the attack on your facility.
009	Share with me your heart.
010	...
011	Eira's spirit holds out a small hand, transporting them to a faraway plane of memory.
012	I smelled blood on the wind as screams reverberated around me.
013	My senses were on fire; my legs were raw from running.
014	To think a child as young as Eira had lived through such horrors.
015	No... No!
016	Uuu...
017	Where...is this?
018	*sniff* *sniff*
019	No more...scary smell.
020	Village...?
021	I see it through her eyes. Tröstendorf.
022	This was where she met the ones she would come to call her siblings.
023	The fear of her flight faded with time, until her nightmare tailed her once more in that dark Goetia basement.
024	There you are.
025	I've been looking for you.
026	No...
027	Scary smell lady...
028	Uuu... Emmy!
029	The hound bays for the fox's blood...
030	*growl*
031	Dormach...!
032	Heh...
033	Weak.
034	The dark corridor transforms into a frozen waste - a reflection of Eira's innermost sanctum.
035	(Courage or folly, great power belies her youth... That much is certain.)
036	(The question is, what will become of it?)
037	There's nowhere left to run, little fox.
038	I'll tear you from limb to limb.
039	Ugh...!
040	No! Enough!
041	Eira...fight!
042	*SNARL*
043	So you wish to fight against your fears.
044	Very well, child.
045	I shall bear witness to your resolve.
