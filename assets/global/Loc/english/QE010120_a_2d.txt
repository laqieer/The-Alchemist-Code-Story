001	N-no! This conflict is ridiculous! Stop!!!
002	Father!
003	Logi, you hold back Sabareta and the Lizard Brigade. We need to limit the damage to as few as possible on both sides.
004	But...
005	...Zeke is right.
006	If our armies clash here, everything we've struggled for until now will be for naught.
007	It's all right. Trust me. I will protect Agatha.
008	...Understood.
009	Sabareta!
010	Good luck, hero of Envylia. Let's go!
011	Dias, stop this foolishness and put down your sword.
012	Ack! Father... Why have you changed so much?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
013	How can you endanger your daughter to achieve your own ends? Whatever your reasons may be...I will not allow Agatha to be caught up in the ravages of war!
014	You've got it wrong! Becoming the representative of the Wratharis Dominion was my own—
015	Shut up, Agatha!
016	You don't know father's true motives!
017	We are nothing more than...tools to him!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
018	What...?
019	You were my hero, a knight who I looked up to! I was proud to call you my father!
020	I cannot stand by and watch anymore as you deceive others and pursue the path of treason!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
021	Father...please, open your eyes! Or else, I will have to cut you down!!!
022	!!!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
023	Dias...	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0019
024	Once again hiding in the shadows, Gabirond observes the scene before him with a grotesque smile playing on his lips.
025	Hmm. Well then, hero of Envylia, what's your next move?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
