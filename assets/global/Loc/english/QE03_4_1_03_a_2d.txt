001	Well then, young lady...um, Lisbeth, wasn't it? About the way to get above the clouds...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
002	Ye-yes!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
003	It's true that Slothstein has airships, but...still, they won't go that high.	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_1015
004	Really? That's so disappointing to hear...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
005	That being said, there was a guy who tried to make a vehicle that could go to the sky.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
006	Huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
007	He's the only mechanic I could entrust with the maintenance of my buddy.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
008	He wanted to look down at the clouds just once, so he made a rocket.
009	A locket? One of those things you put around your neck?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
010	No, a rocket. It's one of those rides that take you straight up into the sky.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
011	It used the engines that were made to fly the airships.
012	He used three of those and flew it straight up to the sky.
013	Three? You mean the airships flew on just one engine?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
014	Yeah. That's how much power you need to fly above the clouds.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
015	You use one engine to fly you up to its limit, then, when it runs out of power, you switch to the next one.
016	By repeating this, he discovered a way to fly that high. But—
017	Right before completing his goal, the engine exploded...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
018	That crazy guy...he never came back down from above the clouds.
019	Th-that's awful...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
020	Sounds dangerous...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
021	For starters, there's no vehicle in this country with that much power...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
022	Of course, there is.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
023	What?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
024	You witches can fly with your own power, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
025	The ones who caught me could fly as high as an airship. And there are three of you, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
026	...!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
027	Yes...that's it! The three of us can try flying like a rocket!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0045
028	I-I understand the theory behind it, but...do you think it'll work?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
029	For starters, if we fly that high, we'll freeze.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
030	The reason why there's a flight restriction is to prevent us from freezing to death, right?
031	No, freezing to death might be an exaggeration. Do you think they'd place valuable court mages in the sky just to prevent us from freezing to death?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
032	Are you saying there's another reason...oh!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
033	It's so that no one can get close to Asmodeus...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
034	Now that we know the intentions of the queen, it's entirely conceivable.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
035	Height limit...right, that's why I was caught.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
036	Wow...just thinking about it is making me cold. Even with clothes, my body is getting unbelievably cold. If only I had some alcohol.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
037	U-um...we do actually have some, you know?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
038	Whoa!!! That's caramel jaeger! I never thought I'd see it here!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0024
039	All right then, I'll take some gratefully...aghh! It's hot!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
040	Huh?! Does it make you warm that fast? I heard that it heats your body, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
041	I don't know who made that stuff, but just one gulp and I'm drenched in sweat...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
042	That's it! If we drink this, we might not freeze even up in the sky!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
043	Are you being serious?!	VO_alma.alma_event_1013
044	It may be sweet alcohol...but you want to fly drunk?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
045	You brats! What are you doing there?! Flying drunk...? Are you going to commit further sins?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0012
046	Yikes! They found us! At this point, it doesn't matter if we commit any further violations!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0023
