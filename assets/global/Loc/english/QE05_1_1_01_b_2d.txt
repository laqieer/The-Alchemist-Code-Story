001	Are you hurt?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
002	Th-thank you, sir...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
003	You seem ill-equipped to cross this desert. Which village did you come from?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
004	Where...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
005	Ah, sorry. I should let you catch your breath first. Can you make it to the shade over there?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
006	Uhm, yes...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
007	You have lost your memories?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
008	Yes, I know that my name is Hisham, but other than that...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
009	Your wounds are not serious, but I can see that you carry the fatigue of one who has trekked a long way.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
010	These designs on your clothes indicate you're a member of one of the desert tribes, from around here, I expect.
011	(I have a duty to make my way to the royal capital and do as the Chief instructed....)
012	However... There is no way I can abandon a child.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
013	Um, what should I do?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
014	Sephiron guides us all in mysterious ways. Do not worry. I will not leave you to your fate here.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
015	I will help you. We shall check with the nearby villages. Hopefully, there will be someone there knows more about you.
