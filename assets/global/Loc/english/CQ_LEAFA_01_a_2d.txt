001	…*Sigh* It's a little early to break for recess, but it's not like we're getting much talking done…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
002	I thought Greed Dike and Wadatsumi could settle their differences by jointly managing the Mikaboshi…
003	Greed Dike should have control of the Mikaboshi! We can take care of it properly.
004	Nothing good will come from giving power to a group of heretics!!
005	(I used to regard the people of Wadatsumi as heretics…until I met Yomi. Thanks to her, I've gained a valuable new perspective.)	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
006	(As Greed Dike's general…)	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
007	(I must end the fighting. I must do so for my friend, whose wounds have yet to heal.)
008	General! I've been looking all over for you. So this is where you've been.
009	…Yes, forgive me. I needed a moment to cool my head.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
010	The meeting is about to recommence. Better head back.
011	…
012	…What's wrong?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
013	…Actually, the meeting has been suspended to accommodate a visit by the Lord Commander.
014	…The Lord Commander?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
015	(The handling of the Mikaboshi is an important topic indeed, but I wouldn't have thought the Lord Commander himself would…)
016	(…He must think there's a threat to peace percolating in Greed Dike.)
017	…I see. Thank you. I'll make my way there.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
018	…Um, General Leafah.
019	Hm?	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
020	Um...It's not your fault the meeting isn't going well…
021	So...please try not to overexert yourself. We're here for you.
022	Overexert myself? Don't be silly! I don't know the meaning of the word. I'm a general, aren't I?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0012
023	Yes, but…
024	Let's go. The Lord Commander should have arrived by now. We can't keep him waiting.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
025	Oh… M-my apologies!
026	…Making my subordinates worry--what a rookie mistake…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
027	Pleased to meet you. I am Lord Commander Basheeny. Allow me to be brief…	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
028	I'd like to request your immediate help with the Mikaboshi.
029	My help? I could've sworn you came here because you doubted us…
030	Why would you think so?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
031	B-Because…
032	There's no reason for me to doubt anybody in Greed Dike.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
033	Kagura told me all about you--a Greed Dike general and an ally to Wadatsumi...
034	She said you risked your life defending Wadatsumi.
035	…S-She's too kind. I just did what I thought had to be done--	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0011
036	I had to fulfill my duties as general, and to help Wadatsumi and my friend…
037	Whatever the motivations, your actions speak volumes. Yomi also spoke highly of your character.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0031
038	Yomi did--did she?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
039	Because of the importance of this meeting and your position as a general, she was worried that you might overdo it.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
040	Yomi said that… I'm sure she's even worse off than I am, but she still worries about me…
041	How dependable can I be if I make Yomi worry about me, especially when her health isn't great?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
042	Give me the full report.
043	Greed Dike extremists are attending the meeting about the management of the Mikaboshi.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
044	Until recently they were a relatively small group, barely on our radar…
045	But I've heard rumors they're after the Mikaboshi in order to bolster their power.
046	So that's why you came to meet in person…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
047	If that's true, then Yomi has a lot on her plate. I'll have my most trusted men assist in guarding the Mikaboshi.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0037
048	I'd appreciate that greatly.
049	I had planned to keep a sharp eye on instigators at the meeting, but I never thought they'd try to steal the Mikaboshi…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
050	I'll take it upon myself to monitor their movements and connections. I'm sure we can learn things from the inside.
051	If this blows up, all our efforts to establish a peaceful relationship will have been for naught. That would be inexcusable to the people of Wadatsumi.
052	I won't allow them to be this reckless!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
053	I'm grateful for that offer, but... You could also try to conclude the meeting yourself. What do you intend to do?
054	Of course, that's my responsibility as well. I'll do both to the best of my ability.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
055	…
056	Perhaps you should focus all your attention on the meeting. I heard it wasn't going very well.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
057	…	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
058	… Why don't you let your subordinates gather intel from the inside?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
059	I couldn't possibly--
060	!
061	…Who knows what lengths the extremists are willing to go. If there are any mishaps, my men could be in danger.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0003
062	It'll be…just like that time the ogre blood illness….	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0043
063	...So, I will protect the Mikaboshi and find and detain all the radicals!
064	That way everyone will be safe--the Mikaboshi, my troops and even Yomi...!
065	…
066	…The radicals are sure to view you as an obstacle. Please keep your wits about you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0003
067	Yes, I will…I don’t want to be taken hostage and have my men put in a difficult position.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
068	Sorry to interrupt, General Leafah! Fights have broken out at the meeting.
069	The Greed Dike faction and the Wadatsumi faction are clashing...
070	What!? I've got to stop this immediately!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
071	Um, General…
072	…I should probably go, too. The extremists may be whipping up the crowds. Can you take me there?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
073	...Yessir!
074	(Discussions only lead to disputes about the Mikaboshi's power… Building a world of peace isn't easy.)	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
075	(I bet Kanon would know how to handle this… Well…)
076	(I promised I would protect the world she entrusted to me and lead it to the future. I can't lose hope now…)
