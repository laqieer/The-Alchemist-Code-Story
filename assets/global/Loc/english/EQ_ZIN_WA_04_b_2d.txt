001	I'm guessing that's the ruler of the mountain...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
002	Who knows? In any case, we're almost to the top where the Snowbells should be...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0031
003	That being said, there are strange traditions and laws in this country.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0031
004	Not allowing strangers in where there are sick people...
005	I wonder if the law really is more important than the lives of the sick...	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0030
006	This country may have been destroyed because it deserved to be...	VO_zin.zin_sys_0030
007	What are you saying all of a sudden?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
008	Having been outside this country, that is what I thought. Abroad...especially in the Desert Zone where you come from, I found freedom.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
009	This country...does not have the same freedom that others do.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
010	Are you sure? Other countries are constantly at work and I don't think they have as much freedom as you say they do.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
011	If you thought you were freer when you were abroad, why did you come back?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0001
012	You seemed to feel suppressed in this country.	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0002
013	Was it just a matter of wanting to heal Demon's Blood?
014	...Yes.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
015	Really?	VO_aqil.aqil_sys_0045
016	Yes...I'm sure. I obtained the medicine to cure Demon's Blood. That's why I returned.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0004
017	But I also returned to fight one more thing...	VO_zin.zin_chara_1007
018	To fight? Fight what? Sickness?	VO_aqil.aqil_battle_1018
019	That too...but that's not what I'm talking about. I came here to fight myself.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0005
020	I ran away from the law here...and from my sister.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
