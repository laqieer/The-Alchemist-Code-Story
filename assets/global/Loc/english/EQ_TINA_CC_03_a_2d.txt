001	Icicle Edge!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
002	Take this! Stormwolf Fang!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0007
003	Haaaaaaargh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
004	Agh...!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
005	Mocca! Are you all right?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
006	Miss Mocca!
007	Don't worry, I'm fine.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
008	But...I'm the reason you got infected with the corruption. I'm so sorry.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
009	Don't say that, Tina. You have nothing to apologize for. As a matter of fact, I want to thank you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
010	You saved Tamis for me. You saved Saga. Thank you.
011	Mocca...
012	Everything's fine now. Let's get back to the wind shrine.
013	Mocca... What do you plan to do from now on?
014	I figured that's what you wanted to talk about.	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
015	I intend to leave Saga. I must find a cure for this curse.
016	You're...leaving?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
017	I somehow knew you'd say that, but we can't even be sure if—	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
018	I know. There's no way of telling if there is even hope.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
019	Truth be told, I'm scared. If I can never find a way to lift this curse, I'll...
020	Mocca...
021	I may not even be able to see Saga in its former glory.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
022	Just thinking about that, I... I...
023	Mocca...
024	Ah... Sorry. I don't mean to whine.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
025	I just don't want it to end like that. So I choose to leave Saga.
026	I'm worried about Tamis, but I know that the Sprite Trio is at her side—not to mention Tina.
027	So, Tina... I entrust Tamis to you.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0041
028	...
029	Well, let's get back.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
030	...
031	Tina...?
032	(I...)
033	What's on your mind?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
034	It's...nothing.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
035	We should get back.
036	Miss Tina? Did you want to go with Miss Mocca?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
037	No, that's not true. I am the Chief of the Toxotes tribe. I have duties and responsibilities.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
038	Then why do you look so miserable?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0021
039	I'm not. Let's go, Lisbeth.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
040	Miss Tina...
041	Just drop it!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
042	Oh...
043	I... Sorry. I-I didn't mean to—	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
044	Ah!
045	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
046	I'm sorry if I made you mad! I don't know what came over—	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
047	No, it's fine. I'm not angry.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
048	I just... I need you to fight me, right now.
049	Why? Why do we have to fight?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
050	Just move your body! Get active! Wear yourself out until you can barely even think!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
051	Whatever's left afterwards has got to be your truest feelings!
052	Stop! What is supposed to come of this?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
053	You'll get over what's bearing down on you, Miss Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
054	I... There's nothing—	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
055	I can tell! I've spent time with you, no matter how short it was...
056	So I won't hold back!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1015
057	My friend is killing herself from the inside out! I can't just look away!
058	...!
