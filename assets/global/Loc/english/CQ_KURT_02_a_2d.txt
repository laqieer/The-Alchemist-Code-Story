001	Urgh...grrr...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
002	It is done. Be on your way.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
003	Aaaaaaarghhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
004	No!
005	Why did you kill him?! The battle was over! We won!	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0019
006	The battle isn't over so long as your enemy lives.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
007	What?
008	Have you sworn a vow of non-violence or something? You're way too soft for someone so talented.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0003
009	W-wait!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
010	Reimei!
011	...
012	You're the leader of the Shiba Senko, aren't you?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
013	So? Do you have a grudge against me, too?
014	Have you heard of the Sosenko?
015	Yeah. Doesn't mean anything to me, though.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
016	Then I must teach you the error of your ways. I'm sure you know why.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
017	It's kill or be killed in this world. That's all I know, and that's all I need to know.
018	A man of your strength should have no trouble fending off attackers, no matter how many times they come back after you spare them!
019	That's a shockingly rose-tinted glasses sort of way to look at it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
020	What?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
021	I mean, how naive can you get? Who the hell can afford to practice mercy and non-violence in Wadatsumi nowadays? Times are tough. You don't always have a choice. Sometimes it's you or them.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
022	I...
023	Our country was torn apart in the recent invasion and is still being occupied by Greed Dike. Nothing is certain within our nation's borders right now.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0012
024	There are those who would take advantage of the chaos, use it to extort people, drive them further into desperation. It's thanks to them that my business is booming.
025	Your business?
026	Killing people. That's what's in demand right now in our beloved Wadatsumi. People don't want to save others, they want to protect themselves.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
027	...
028	I admire the Sosenko's ideology, I do, but...
029	A blade that doesn't kill can't save anyone either.
030	...
031	He's back.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0012
032	Reimei!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
033	Y-you!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0003
034	Told you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
035	Reimei, today you will fall to my blade!
