001	Ack... I can't believe it's this bad...is the royal palace safe?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
002	Notice to all troops! All those who have finished with the incineration task, head to the South-West D area!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
003	Where did that super useful magic come from?! How are they doing it?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
004	It's forbidden to students. If you used something like that, you'd get to talk as much as you want during class.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
005	You could spread rumors!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
006	Now isn't the time for that! More and more are coming!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
007	We're already tired and beat up from what went down at the royal palace...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0021
008	You seem tired. I doubt you can change the country in your current state.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
009	Aghhh! Wh-what the...?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0024
010	Sa-Salomo?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	This forest is the second home for my friends. And you're going to burn it?!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
012	You scum! I hope you're prepared to pay the consequences for your actions!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0032
013	This is horrible! Lisbeth is troublesome enough...now Salomo as well! All incineration units, abort mission! This is an emergency!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0029
014	Lisbeth! Whatever side you take, I'm going to kill all these witches here!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0003
015	If you're going to try to stop me, then you'll have to crush me first!
016	Wa-wait!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
