001	Hyaahhh!	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0007
002	Hmm... Something isn't right.	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0031
003	You're pretty spirited today, little savage.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0002
004	Richie!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
005	So you're aiming to be number one in that sports thing?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0001
006	It's not just any old sports thing! It's the Phantom Skirmish Sports Festival!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0016
007	I'm sure Leema will team up with me again if I become number one!	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0019
008	Oh, right! Leema is the mechanic who makes all my mech gear, by the way.
009	I know, I know. She's your partner, right? Wait, are you two not working together anymore?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0004
010	Ungh... Waaah! She said there's no way we can win at the Mech War Games together! She said I'm too i-impractical!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0019
011	Unnghhh... How could she say such a thing after becoming a Phantom?! Leema's a demon! A beast! A... A machine freak!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
012	Jeez you're annoying... Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for you to observe the different ways in which other people operate? That's probably why Leema said such a thing to you.	VO_rish.rish_battle_0019
013	I don't know about that, but if I become number one, then we can start over for sure!	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0019
014	Did Leema say that?	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
015	Leema said that for now, I have to gain more experience through battles.	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0020
016	Hmm... Come to think of it, is there prize money for this sports festival?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
017	Yeah! Leema said so!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0004
018	I see, so they're... Well. In any case, you should go back to practicing. This is no time to be crying.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0045
019	Y-yeah... You're right. Of course!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0004
020	(It's almost admirable how fast she can change gears.)	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
021	It needs to be more like "Zoom!" and "Wham!" and stuff, you know? According to Reagan's Theory on Mechanical Engineering, this should go like...	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0031
022	Hmm... So you're even getting wrapped up in Reagan's Theory, are you?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0044
023	Hahah! I'll do whatever it takes to win at the Mech War Games!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0007
024	Also, Leema told me that most of the techniques for the Mech War Games are actually explained by Reagan's Theory.
025	Oh?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
026	Wouldn't it be better if you simply had Reagan teach you about mechanical engineering directly?	VO_rish.rish_sys_0001
027	Wait, can I?! Richie, do you know Reagan or something?!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
028	No, I don't. He's from another time. It doesn't matter if one knows him or not, though. He's a Phantom, so if you want to ask him something, all you need to do is summon him.	VO_rish.rish_event_1006
029	But I've never talked to him before! Do you think he'd be okay with teaching me?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0039
030	Well, it's all the same to me. Don't push yourself. Anyway, I'm going to go buy one of Elrike's lunches.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
031	(Ugh. Fine. I guess I can lend her a hand.)	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
032	Elrike's lunches...
033	Welcome, welcome! Boxed lunches for sale!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0008
034	We are honored to have won this season's Babel's Next Top Lunch! There are only ten available, so don't delay! Once they're gone, they're gone!
035	If I wanna be a winner, I need a winner's lunch! I've gotta get one!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
036	Thank you for your business!	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0033
037	Oh! Oh! Elrike! Can I have one of your lunches?	VO_daisy.daisy_battle_0019
038	Oh, I'm sorry! I just sold the last one. There were only enough for the first ten people.	VO_elrike.elrike_sys_0036
039	What?!
040	(N-no way... I didn't even make it into the top ten!)
041	How am I supposed to come first in the Mech War Games if I can't even buy a lunch box?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
042	Little savage, stop whining in the middle of the street. You're blocking traffic. Here... This is for you.	VO_rish.rish_battle_1010
043	Wow! Thanks, Richie!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_1024
044	You know, you spend far too much time dilly-dallying. That's why you miss your chance at things like buying lunch boxes.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0030
045	You're not much of a thinker, so why don't you try talking to someone about what's going on inside that head of yours, instead of trying to mull it all over alone?
046	For example... Why don't you talk to Teona? She uses a lance, like you, and she's champion of the Colosseum.	VO_rish.rish_sys_0031
047	I think learning in an actual fight would be far more effective for someone like you than listening to lectures on theory.
048	You're right! Richie, thank you! I'm going to go ask her right now!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0046
049	Hey, Teona! Teona...! Teona!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0003
050	Whoa! Daisy? What's wrong?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
051	So, here's the thing! I wanna be number one, but...
052	Ah, I see. I understand. (Wow. She's just as Richie described her.)	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
053	You do?!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
054	Of course. What you have just described is a wall which those who aim for the top often run into. I've seen countless children at the training school hit that very wall.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
055	What should I do? I want to perfect my use of mech gear and become the best, but nothing seems to go my way!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0030
056	I want to gallantly soar through the air, gracefully strike, and show off my lance with a bam, but even though Leema made the coolest weapon in the world for me...
057	No matter what I do, I just can't get it right!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0018
058	Now Leema's upset with me, and it's probably because I'm not making the best use of my mech gear.
059	Hmm...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
060	All right. I have an idea. Leave it to me, Daisy!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
061	An...idea?
062	I came to the arena because Teona told me to, but I wonder what she has planned?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0031
063	Whoa, there're so many people! Oh, wow! Even Reagan is here! I can't believe I finally get to meet him!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_1024
064	Ah, it looks like the best of the best have gathered, so... Let us begin!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
065	Begin? What do you mean, begin?	VO_regen.regen_sys_0025
066	Yeah! You've got a lot of nerve summoning us here! Explain yourself!	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0014
067	Oh, please excuse me. I got a little ahead of myself just now.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
068	Ahem... Thank you all for coming here today! I have called you here for one reason, and one reason only!
069	In order for us to train for the rapidly approaching Phantom Skirmish Sports Festival, I have prepared a special training exercise for you all!
070	It's called... The Survival Race!
071	Survival...Race?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0006
072	Let me explain. Do you seek power?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
073	Power...?
074	Can you be more specific?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
075	What exactly do you mean?	VO_reyda.reyda_sys_0016
076	Teona, what are you talking about?
077	(Oh! I get it, now! Teona must be doing this for me!)	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0025
078	Yes, yes, yes, yes! I want power! I want to be number one!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0006
079	That's the spirit! Two Teona Points for you!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
080	What the heck are Teona Points? Also, why are you the one in charge?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0030
081	Well, someone has to run this thing, don't they?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
082	I've already had my fare share of the spotlight, so I think I'm fit to be an impartial judge. There's nothing holding me back, so to speak.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
083	You're not making any darn sense!	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0002
084	Minus Teona Points to you nit-picky people! We're past the point of no return now, just so you all know.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
085	Here, in this holy arena, with weapons in hand, you will put your very souls on the line and fight for victory!
086	You know this isn't the arena you fought at... She's not even listening.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0016
087	Now, then. First, I would like to have you show off your powers for me!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
088	Show off for you? How are we meant to do that?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0005
089	Over here are some monsters, freshly caught. They've been causing trouble in the area, you see.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
090	Don't be shy! Punish them!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
