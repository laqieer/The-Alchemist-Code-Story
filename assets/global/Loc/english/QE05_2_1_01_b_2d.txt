001	H-he was alone! There was only one of him! Why are we fighting an entire army?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
002	Wait... Aren't those soldiers ours? Ones who fell during our advance?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
003	What is this terrible magic?! Fall back!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
004	Hngh...! Though they are not particularly noteworthy souls, transmuting so many at once still takes much out of me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
005	But I can still fight. With this power, I can—
006	I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I just wanted to protect this country from...	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0018
007	Th-this isn't what I signed up for; it's not why I picked up the sword. This is just slaughter...
008	Kamui, please... My son... He doesn't even know how to use Spiritbonding yet...
009	Nngh... Yes, I understand. I do.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0042
010	This war cannot save anyone. It will do nothing more than cause the shedding of blood and tears.
011	I must save as many souls as possible. Please, lend me your strength.
012	Aah...
013	Aah, aaahh...
014	Ngh...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0042
015	Every time I summon them, it feels as though a part of my soul is torn away. Is this the price of wielding the power of the Alchemy Source?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
016	Still...it is a cheap price to pay to save the village!
