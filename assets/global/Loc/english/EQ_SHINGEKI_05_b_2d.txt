001	Hey! Helloooo! Looks like no one's here, either.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
002	Hey, not so loud! You'll draw the Titans or the Giant Taurus right to us!	VO_budd.budd_sys_0025
003	I can't help it! We've been searching like crazy, and we haven't found anyone yet!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
004	Shhh! Be quiet, both of you! Over there!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
005	Hmph. You're not as dumb as you look.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0010
006	Were you testing us?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
007	Those who can't sense their enemy's presence will get themselves, and those around them, killed.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0005
008	Sorry about that. He didn't mean anything by it. He's just that kind of guy. Let this slide, will you?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0036
009	You're the soldiers from another world, right? Could you fill us in on the situation here?	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
010	Fine, but we'll need to walk and talk.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0034
011	Right now, we're defenseless. We need to find Judith as quickly as possible.
012	What happened?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
013	The Giant Taurus and the Titans came after us.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0037
014	We got separated from Judith during the battle.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
015	We can't use our ODM gear right now, so our fighting ability is extremely limited.
016	We helped the people at the Earth Temple to safety, but we can't do much on our own like this.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0012
017	Dangit, this is what walls are for! This whole situation is only going to get worse.	VO_eren.eren_sys_0021
018	We're here now, so don't worry too much. We'll keep you out of harm's way.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
019	We're the Holy Guard who administer justice in Babel. That's our job.
020	...
021	Well, reinforcements are welcome. All I need to do now is complete my research.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0039
022	Th-this is...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
023	These are some samples of skin and tissue I collected in the previous battle against the Giant Taurus. With this, I hope to at last uncover the beast's weakness.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0007
024	I will get to work immediately!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0008
