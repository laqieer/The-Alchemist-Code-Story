001	You told me...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
002	That you wanted to be my friend.
003	Even when I became a demon...
004	You did everything you could to reach me.
005	I won't forget you.
006	You protected my brother, and encouraged him.
007	Everything we achieved was thanks to your words.
008	You were always on my side.
009	I want to be there for you, too.
010	I want to be your friend.
011	Ngh?!
012	It might sound a little childish, but...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
013	I...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
014	Never mind.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
015	Ngh... Unnnnggghhh... Yomi! Yomi!!!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0019
016	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Unnnnggggghhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0029
017	It's going to be all right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
018	B-but... But, I...! I...! Uwaaaaaaaaahhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
019	I know. You were so scared. I was scared, too.
020	But if you keep crying like that...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
021	You'll start looking like a little kid, you know?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0008
022	Unnngghh! I-I'm not a kid! Uwaaaaahhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0019
023	I-it's just...my...baby face! Uwaaaaahhhhhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
024	...
025	You've been pushing yourself too hard, haven't you?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
026	But it's all right.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
027	I'm here.
028	Unnnghhh, nnnngghh... Y-Yomi!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
029	That was excellent.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
030	Lady Kagura!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0027
031	It's all right, you don't need to get up.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
032	I'm glad I was able to witness the power of the sealed sword, Kagomurasaki.
033	I see now that there's a reason why you're the clan leader.
034	I am unworthy of such praise.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
035	Devouring and storing demonic power...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
036	It is a fitting cradle.
037	Yomi...
038	Does that mean you're carrying even more corruption around inside of you?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
039	It just means that I don't have to wait much longer.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
040	It's not something you need to worry about, all right, Leafah?
041	...
042	Lady Kagura, how is the battle progressing?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
043	It's only a matter of time—and I mean that in our favor.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
044	What with General Leafah and her troops, our forces are even stronger—thanks to you, Yomi.
045	Our allies are converging on the Shiba Senko's main forces.
046	All we need to do now is join them.
047	Then let's go! Just a little more and we'll be able to—!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0004
048	Yomi.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
049	Y-yes, Leafah?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0005
050	You were right.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
051	What are you talking about?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
052	We of Greed Dike made many pretty speeches, but we never actually changed anything we learned from the past.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
053	You could say we haven't learned anything at all.
054	In order to rebuild our great nation to reflect the ambitions of our young leaders, we attempted invasion once again.
055	I knew it.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
056	Hmm...
057	Joining forces with the Shiba Senko, we tried to take Wadatsumi.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
058	That is quite the betrayal.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
059	...
060	What are you going to do, Leafah?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
061	I cannot turn my back on my country.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
062	It's the only home I've ever known.
063	Then...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
064	However...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0018
065	I had a saving grace.
066	I found comrades, who have tried to come to terms with our shameful past and build a better future for all...
067	People who strive to be just.
068	Not only those of Greed Dike, but people from Wadatsumi as well.
069	I, however... I lost confidence in what I thought was just.	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
070	Leafah...
071	But I do know this.
072	I want to be on your side.
073	I want to be on the side of your justice.
074	A time without conflict, where the days roll peacefully by without anyone killing or being killed...
075	That's what Jin wanted, isn't it? He wanted to protect Wadatsumi.
076	Right!
077	Please, let me be your friend; your ally.
078	I'm always being helped by someone.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0008
079	Heheh. That's how I feel.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0008
080	Can I ask you a favor?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
081	O-of course!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
082	Will you let me lean on you?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_1011
083	H-huh?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
084	Hehe. I, uh, sort of overdid it back there, and my body is quite, um, sore...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0047
085	Oh! Yes! Yes, of course!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0050
086	It seems all that waiting finally paid off.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0007
087	I had faith.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0004
088	But General Leafah, are you really all right with this? There are Greed Dike soldiers amongst the Shiba Senko.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0001
089	That's fine.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
090	Truly?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
091	They told me my actions were like a child throwing a tantrum...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
092	But if they are respectable adults...
093	They should be able to forgive the actions of a petulant child.
094	I'll show them how courageous their general is!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0014
