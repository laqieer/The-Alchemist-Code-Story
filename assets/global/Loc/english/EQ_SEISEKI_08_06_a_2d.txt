001	Like you've observed...I am from Lost Blue...just like you are.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
002	I knew it. It's been a while since I've heard that name. Brings back memories.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
003	Lost Blue...? Weren't you from my country?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
004	No, after I was chased out of Lustburg...sorry, out of this country, I moved around from place to place, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
005	After a few years, I finally arrived at Lost Blue. Although, the period I was there wasn't too long.
006	I've heard much about you along with many anecdotes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
007	They say that Captain Othima of Lost Blue is a hero.
008	Huh...?! Aww, come on. Stop it. That was a long time ago.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
009	For you, Captain Othima, it may seem like a long abandoned past, but...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
010	For us from Lost Blue, you are a symbol of hope.
011	Ah, no, it's not necessarily a past I've abandoned...um, you know it's not really good to do that.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
012	It's a bad habit of people from Lost Blue to always think of things in a negative way.
013	Do you two know each other? Wait, don't tell me...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
014	Hey...don't get any strange ideas! I don't know anything about her! We just happened to be from the same village...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
015	Perhaps it's best to call it the same province?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0005
016	Yes, that's it! The same province! We're from the same province! That's the only thing...
017	As this is the case, I have been requested by our leader to deliver a message to you, Captain Othima.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
018	From your leader? To me? What is it?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
019	As you are also from Lost Blue, would you like to join our cause?
020	Huh? Are you saying that you want me to quit the Holy Guard and join you guys?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
021	Yes...to put it bluntly.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
022	Hmm. I appreciate the invitation, but that'll be a little difficult.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
023	...Is it because you want to abandon your past in Lost Blue?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0022
024	No, it's not a matter of that. The truth is that, more than an adventure-filled life, I'd like to live a calm and stable one.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
025	Huh...?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
026	Besides, more than anything...I don't think I can keep up with your principles.
027	...What do you mean?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
028	You do not hesitate to kill people to achieve your goal. That's what you were just doing right now.
029	Placing your objective as the main priority seems like the standard thing to do.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
030	I don't intend to change my opinion about your way of doing things. Just thinking of becoming one of you is enough to make me feel sick.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
031	In other words, you won't agree to my proposal? If you cannot accept it, I was told that I must take your life.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0044
032	I thought as much. That being said, I don't plan to go down so easily.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
033	Are you sure about that? Sword!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0010
034	?! ...You're fast!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
035	Uhaa! You're so dangerous. What's with that speed?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0016
036	Uck...!	VO_venus.venus_battle_0019
037	No, you won't manage that! She'll already have her blade at you before you can finish chanting the spell!
038	Your Highness, please just focus on avoiding her attacks!
039	In that case, what am I supposed to do? You won't have enough time to chant your spells either, right?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
040	That's true. What should we do about it?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
041	My apologies, but I must obtain the Sacred Stone. That's all there is to say.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0035
042	No way...! How did you come up behind me so fast?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
043	...It's over.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
044	Agh-aghhh!!! ...What's going on?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0013
045	?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0027
046	Ughh...! A magic fortification...?!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
047	You're too fast for me to keep up with, so I have no choice but to make you come to me instead, right?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
048	You made an opening on purpose...?	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
049	I don't like the idea of turning a girl from my province into solid ice, but the situation calls for drastic measures. Don't think badly of me.
050	Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
051	Aghh...!!!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0025
052	Whew. I'm sorry, Your Highness. I don't know how to put it...I got you involved in my past as well.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
053	No...but her magic attack...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0039
054	It's all right. I've already poured the highest amount of energy into her.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
055	Not even the strongest magic defense in this world will be able to penetrate it.
056	As someone who shares some of my past, I feel responsible in helping her see the error of her ways.
057	I feel...honored...that you would think that way of me.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
058	?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
059	Wh-what the...? Her left eye is glowing red...	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
060	...! Get down!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
061	...Axe!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0007
062	No way! Argh! Was it too shallow? Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0043
063	Her left eye is shining red again!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0042
064	Is her left eye melting the ice?! Is it a Philosopher's Stone or something?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
065	Thank you...Sol...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0033
066	Agh...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0043
067	Your Highness!
068	I won't lose to you...as long as I'm protected by the power that you've given me.	VO_acht.acht_battle_1029
069	That impossible. Why doesn't it work?! Using a Philosopher's Stone shouldn't be enough to melt my ice...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
070	This ice...it's warm...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
071	...?!
072	We are still...living in that lightless world.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
073	Compared to that painful life...even your ice radiates warmth...
074	!!! Ac-ackk...! Piercing Light!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
075	Behind you...!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0027
076	?!
077	I am one of the Veda Templars...Acht, the 7 Tactics Master.
078	In order to realize the ideals of Sol...I cannot afford to lose. Gauntlet!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
079	Aghh...!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
