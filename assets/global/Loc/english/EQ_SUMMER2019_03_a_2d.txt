001	Are you all right, Su Yi? Are you hurt? It's going to be okay!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
002	Um...
003	What is it?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
004	S-sorry. I'm f-fine.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0035
005	Thank goodness! Don't run off like that, okay? You scared us!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
006	S-sorry...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
007	Hahah! There's no need for that. I'm used to impulsive kids charging off on their own. Don't worry!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0008
008	Hmph. Well, I'm used to dealing with overbearing instructors who lack poise!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
009	Hey! That's mean!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0016
010	Not really... Those qualities are also your strengths.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
011	In any case... Su Yi, there's nothing for you to fear. Bertha is a very kind person.
012	...
013	She's been orphaned... I feel sorry for her, but I sure as heck can't look after her. I'm barely making it through the day with just myself to take care of, just like everyone else in this village.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
014	Besides, she's sick, ain't she? Can't work her, can't sell her. Can't afford to take care of some good-for-nothin'.
015	...
016	It's gonna be all right, Su Yi!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
017	From now on, you're with us! You, me, and Liu Shen—we're as good as family!
018	Shenmei...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
019	Th-thank you.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0033
020	Relax! We just want to help! Could you tell us why you ran off like that?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
021	Well...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0014
022	I wanted to help look for Shenmei, too.
023	Ohh! I guess hearing all that stuff about the octopuses made you worried, huh?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0045
024	But Liu Shen wanted us to wait here for him. We ought to stay put.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
025	Where would we even begin to search?
026	B-but...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
027	There's that face again.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0002
028	I told you, if you have something to say, you ought to say it. You can't expect people to read your mind. Remember?
029	I know you're shy, but if we're going to be working together, communication is essential.
030	Aw, Sharon. We only just met. She can't help it! Not everyone is capable of the same things right off the bat.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
031	I...suppose.
032	So don't push yourself too hard on our account, Su Yi!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
033	I bet Liu Shen will find Shenmei in no time!
034	You're both very kind and dependable.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0007
035	You think so?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
036	Am I...dependable?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
037	Of course you are!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0016
038	(And here I am, depending on their kindness and waiting for them to talk to me...)
039	(I might be a Phantom Soldier, but I guess nothing much has changed. I'm just the same old Su Yi.)
040	(Depending on Shenmei and Liu Shen to take care of me...)
041	...
042	What's up?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
043	Su Yi!
044	What's wrong?! Are you feeling sick? Did something happen?!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0027
045	N-no! I'm...fine.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
046	Oh... Good. You just looked like you were on the verge of tears, that's all. I was concerned.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0022
047	Where did you come from?! You scared the life outta me, you maniac!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
048	Ahem... My apologies. I am simply very protective of Xiao-Xiao here.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0035
049	Is there a reason for that?	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
050	Xiao-Xiao was born with a fragile constitution.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
051	We come from a very poor, remote village. We couldn't buy medicine or get her the care she needed—there wasn't even a doctor for her to see.
052	Not only that...but she was orphaned at a young age and there was no one to take care of her. So you see, that's why...
053	According to this map, the herbs that we need to make that cure-all are in this cave!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
054	Still, it is far too dangerous. We would have to cross the sea! Besides, that location is known to be a den of monsters.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_battle_0019
055	I've told you before and I'll tell you again! It's my dream to become a legendary pirate!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0010
056	I'll never be worthy of such a title if I can't even save my precious little sister! We might not be connected by blood, but pirates look after their own.
057	Shenmei...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
058	Hrrgh! I've had it up to here with all these octopuses!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
059	Not another one! Just leave me alone, will ya?! Squelchy vermin!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
060	Not an octopus, I'm afraid. Although I could use an extra arm or two...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0035
061	Holy sea cow! Is that you, Kaya?! I can't believe it!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0028
062	I could say the same. What are you doing here?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
063	I don't really know. I was just chasing this suspicious shadowy thing and before I knew it, I was in this cave.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0030
064	A suspicious shadow...?
065	If I was gonna go exploring, I'd much prefer it to be in some ruins! At least then I'd have a better chance of stumbling across some treasure...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
066	Ruins such as these?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
067	Huh?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
068	The only ruins of note on this island are the ones I am currently investigating. That is, the ones in which we are currently standing.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
069	What?! You're telling me these are ruins?! I thought this was just some smelly old cave!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
070	It certainly is a cave, yes.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
071	Yet it is here, in these naturally-formed caverns, that we can find altars and other archeological remnants of an ancient religion that was once declared heretical and promptly stamped out.
072	What at a glance appears to be an ordinary cave is in fact an archeological site, erased from the annals of history and forgotten by the people.
073	I think most people on the island are not aware that this site even exists.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
074	So these caves are actually ruins... Does that mean it's here?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0044
075	You know about that? About the Demon sealed within these ruins?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
076	Huh?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
077	Grooorgghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
078	Speak of the devil...and it shall appear.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
079	Wh-what?! Hang on! That wasn't what I was talking about!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
