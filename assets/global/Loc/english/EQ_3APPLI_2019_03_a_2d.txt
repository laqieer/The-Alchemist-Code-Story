001	N-Nyxie... Um... D-do you...want a taste?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
002	Yes, please, Ragi-Boo.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
003	...
004	Nyx, Hiiragi, and Mira are having a rather awkward first date at a restaurant...
005	While the rest of us, alongside some of the villagers, watch the uncomfortable scene unfold with bated breath.
006	So sweet...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
156	A-are you...talking about the food?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
157	No, silly! I'm talking about you, Ragi-Boo. I could just eat you up!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
158	Eek!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0027
007	U-um... Nyxie-boo? Wh-what about me?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
008	Mira... I made up the nickname Ragi-Boo, and she calls me Nyxie. You've gotta be more original!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
009	B-but...your name's so short! Give me something to work with here!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
010	Do you know what I want to work with, sweet sister?
011	H-huh? How should I know? I-I've never had time to think about love before now.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
012	Well, now that we're here...we have all the time in the world.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
013	Wh-wha...? What're you...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
014	Shall I tell you?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
015	Urgh... My skin is crawling.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
016	How does it feel to have your younger brother teach you about love?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
017	I-I don't know! That's not the issue here!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
018	Such greed...	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0010
019	A-Artemis! Put your bow away! Please! Stay your hand!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0026
020	While we're here...can't you look at me not as your family...but as just a man?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
159	Wh-what?! Are you being serious?! N-Nyx, you... Do you really...?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
021	Now it's your turn, Ragi-Boo. Say "ahh"!
022	Uh... I-I...um...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0045
023	There's no need to be coy. Just say you'll be mine, won't you? I hope to hear those words roll off your lips soon.
024	I... I... I-I-I-I-I.... Uh...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
025	H-hey! Don't forget about me, um...Nyxie-baby!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0018
026	Baby? Not sure I like that, but I guess I am your baby brother...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
027	Wh-why don't we feed each other?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
028	That's it... Lean on me more. Do what you want with me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
029	Mmph!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0043
030	Say "ahh"! A-and I want you to feed me, too! C-c'mon, hurry up!
032	Why don't you try using your favorite phrase? You know what I mean. "Right now."	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
033	I want you to open your mouth right now, and say "ahh" right now! Right now, right now!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
034	C'mon, now. That was a bit sloppy, wasn't it? Make it short and sweet, smooth and sultry. Make me feel your love for me!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
035	Feed me, right now!
036	I'm not even sure what's happening anymore.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0026
037	It is fine. She is simply expressing herself.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0008
038	Exactly what part of this is fine?!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0047
039	It's all very sweet.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0008
040	Has the world gone mad, or have I? She sounds more like a child having a temper tantrum than a cute date.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0031
041	All right, sweet sister, open wide and say "ahh"! This is your reward!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
042	Ugh... Ahh!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
043	Heheh!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
044	Wh-what's so funny?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
045	I'm just wondering when you'll give in and fall for me already.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
046	Nrgh!
047	They've a platonic relationship, haven't they?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0031
048	Have they?!
049	...
050	Oh, Ragi-Boo...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
051	D-don't worry about me. J-just enjoy yourselves.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0047
052	You've got some food on your cheek! Umgf!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
053	Eeeeeek!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
054	Tch...
055	I feel embarrassed just watching them.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0047
056	They are terribly awkward.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0011
057	...
058	Oh, dear. Mira seems a little...	VO_titania.titania_sys_0003
059	Huh? Mira? What's up?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
060	...
061	Aw, don't tell me you were jealous! Do you want a little nibble, too? I used to do that a lot when we were little, didn't I?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
062	...
063	Um...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0001
064	I'm really ticked off!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0040
065	Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
066	M-Mira! What's wrong with you?! I just said I'll—!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0025
067	Waaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0027
068	You're so annoying! So...cheeky! You're horrible! This is horrible! This is all just a stupid, stupid farce, and I can't stand one more microsecond of it!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0019
069	Hey!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0019
070	Are you just bad at being a lover boy? Are you too pure? There should be more...more... Just more! Right now! There's so much more to dating than...whatever this nonsense is!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
071	W-well, not that I've ever actually done this before... I've never had anything to do with romance until now...but I don't think it should be like this! It should be more...normal!
072	And Nyx! You might be my little brother, but your tactics here are terrible! You're making me cringe, hardcore!
073	Oh, sure... That totally explains why you were blushing earlier.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0030
074	Mira! Get a hold of yourself!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0027
075	I can't believe you're like this! We might share the same face, but you...you...! You disgust me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0040
076	Oh no!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
077	A-Almace! We must stop Mira!	VO_titania.titania_sys_0027
078	All right, all right! Tch!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0019
079	People of this city, I must ask you to flee! All of you! We will resolve this situation posthaste!	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0018
080	C'mon, Ragi-Boo! Let's get out of here!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
081	O-oh! Um... O-okay!
082	I don't... I don't know what's normal.
083	Normal?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
084	I mean... You didn't have fun on our d-date, did you? I made your sister furious, too.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
085	Nah, Mira's just impatient. Besides, I kinda feel like I'm the one who should be sorry.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0036
160	Huh? R-really? Well, um...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
161	Did I seem...insincere? Did I hurt your feelings?
162	W-were you just...pretending?
163	I knew Mira would get mad, you see.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
164	That's what I wanted, so I could be alone with you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
165	O-oh! Um...um... Aaahh!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
086	I n-never know what to do when boys... When I... Um...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0035
087	I'm the same.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
088	N-Nyxie, you're...good at this.
089	Oh, Ragi-Boo. You can just call me Nyx.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
090	Aahh! U-um, well... Y-you know, you could just call me...Hiiragi.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
091	I don't know what's normal, either. I've been fighting giant monsters left and right...
092	And now I'm not even sure I know why. What am I fighting for? A normal life... That's not something I'll attain even in my wildest dreams.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
093	I... I feel the same.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0011
094	Love is...forbidden.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
095	You can't fall in love?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
096	It's the Kunoichi Code. We sacrifice our right to fall in love and thus gain our powers.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0037
097	Day in, day out, we wake in our village, receive our orders, and fight upon them. Danger lurks beside us on a daily basis, you see.
098	That's why love isn't something we can...indulge in.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
166	I knew it. It has to be you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
167	H-huh...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
099	There's no need to hurry.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
100	B-but...we can't go home unless...!
101	All will be well, so long as time is correctly maintained.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
102	We don't know anything about normal, or about love, so it's only natural that we would have no idea how to do this normally. It's difficult for us to even fall in love with someone, isn't it?
103	So in the meantime, while we figure ourselves out, why don't we just do something we like. Together. At our own pace.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
104	Do you really...mean that?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0011
105	I guess I've been a little...hasty, myself.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
106	M-more than just a little!
107	All right, Ragi-Boo. Tell me about your hobbies.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
108	That's exactly the sort of...! I want you to stop that! S-stop calling me Ragi-Boo!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0016
109	Wow! I've never seen a stone like this before... It's so pretty!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0046
110	Look, Hiiragi. There's another one over here.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
111	Where?! Wow! It's all sparkly! It's so pretty!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0044
112	Check out all these stones I've found. Pretty cool, huh?
113	Wow! How did you find so many?! They're all so lovely!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0045
114	Ohh! Nyx! You stopped time so that you could collect them without me knowing, didn't you?!
115	I wouldn't use my technique to play tricks like that. These stones are the result of my careful analysis and investigation.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
116	Don't compare me to a layabout like you.
117	Pffft!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0017
118	Heheh. Go on, take any one you like.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
119	Mmm...
120	Huh? Hiiragi...?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
121	Nyx... Don't laugh, okay? M-my hobby is...collecting stones.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0007
122	Why would I laugh at that? That's an awesome hobby! Getting to see all these different colors, each of which speaks logically and provides evidence of geological features, makes me feel at peace.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
123	R-right! All stones are natural marvels, and no two are the same! Not just in appearance, but in the feel of them!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0005
124	They have different properties based on where they're found, and all kinds of things affect their formation! The surrounding environs, the flow or speed of a river—even the weather of the region can have an impact!
125	It makes traveling all the more exciting—and when I get home, I get to decorate my room with them! I put together different complementary shades, or create displays based on the region in which I found them.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0008
126	Then I just sit back and admire them, and let the memories roll over me! I get endless enjoyment out of the stones I collect. Endless!
127	Heheh.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
128	Aahh! You laughed! You laughed at me!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0017
129	No, no, no, no... You've got it all wrong.
130	H-how so?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0016
131	Seeing you get all excited made me feel really happy. That's all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
132	O-oh! Um...well... Thanks.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0047
133	Not at all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
134	Hurry up and kiss her already.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
135	Mira!
136	Ooooraaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0001
137	Aaaahh! The Lovesickness!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0027
138	If you kiss in front of the Lovesickness, I bet you'll be cured in an instant!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
139	K-kiss...!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
140	What? You scared?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
141	M-Mira! We can't just... I mean...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
142	Don't be silly! Lovers who can't kiss? That's ridiculous!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
143	We've already kissed, haven't we? A long, long time ago, at that!
144	(He is my little brother, after all.)
145	...
168	If you won't do it, Hiiragi, then I will!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
169	Heheh. Tell me how you really feel, Mira...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
170	Wh-what?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
171	W-w-well, why not? It can't be helped! What's a kiss or two? We're family, aren't we?
172	W-wait!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
146	Oh? If you're going to be my little brother's girlfriend, you've got to get my approval first. Got it? I'm not his big sister for nothing!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
147	Don't, Mira. I don't want you two ladies fighting over me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
148	Fine.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0005
149	Not you, too, Ragi-Boo!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
150	You're going to kiss him?! For real?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
151	No.
152	No?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
153	Nyxie said...that we could just do something we like together, at our own pace.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0008
154	B-but I don't want to lose someone who's that good at collecting pretty stones.
155	That's... That's all.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0012
