001	Wadatsumi Expedition - Departure Date<br>4th Regiment - Near Barracks
002	Chihaya...are you talking the priestess from Wadatsumi?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
003	Hmph. So you finally remembered.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0029
004	Wait! Was she killed? Th-that priestess?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
005	Enough with your mocking.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0013
006	I am well aware that you used the blade of that knife to end the life of Chihaya.
007	That's nonsense! I was making my way to go save her!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
008	Why would I kill the woman who I tried desperately to rescue?!
009	I monitored your movements, and now I finally know the answer.
010	You killed Chihaya in order to obtain the Mikaboshi, didn't you?
011	The Mikaboshi...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
012	Chihaya was the priestess that was leading Wadatsumi's reconstruction into the next age. She was deeply trusted by her people.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
013	However...for someone who was aiming to take the Mikaboshi...which can be called the treasure of Wadatsumi, she wouldn't be anything but an obstacle.
014	Idiot! What proof do you have?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
015	...This.
016	Is that the coat of arms for the Holy Guard?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
017	Yes. It was left behind after Chihaya's assassination.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
018	What...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
019	If you're going to talk about the Code of Chivalry then why don't you admit it?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
020	You killed Chihaya. You pretended to help her, and when she let her guard down...
021	Did you pretend to help her in order to smoothly implement the assassination?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
022	Or does that also happen to be a strategy that I haven't been told of?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
023	The nape of your neck is wide open, Captain!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
024	You're not gonna even turn to look?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
025	What's going on? Is the truth I know...the real truth?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
026	You...that aura...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0027
027	Fine then,	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
028	No matter what I say, if you can't believe my words, then come and attack. I don't haven't time to waste.
029	You imbecile...!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0013
030	Take this...Steel Cutting Blade!!!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0032
031	... ...
032	...behind you.
033	These two swords will truly sever your breath! Begone! Steel Cutting Flash!!!	VO_reimay.reimay_chara_0020
034	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
035	...?! ...Aghh!!!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0027
036	U-ugff...! Wh-what the...?! Aghh...!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0043
037	It's over. You chose the wrong opponent.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
038	Heh...heheh.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0008
039	What's so funny?
040	I was just contemplating how pathetic of an end this is. I couldn't even save her...and now I'm going to die here like a dog.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
041	Her...? Now that I think about that, I don't understand.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
042	Why would a professional assassin like you wield your sword for a dead woman? Were you in love with Chihaya?
043	Wh-who knows...but...I-I know that...at least, I'm grateful to her...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
044	Grateful?
045	Yes. In the past, I was responsible for the restoration of Wadatsumi.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
046	I took on the job of assassinating Chihaya's predecessor.
047	Things went smoothly without a hitch, except for the unexpected fact that Chihaya had seen me.
048	How is that connected with gratefulness?
049	When you've been in this business for awhile, you'll encounter times when people see you at the crime scene.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
050	At times like that, the ways that such an eyewitness can respond are pretty much pre-determined.
051	They'll either frantically flee, beg for their life, or attempt to retaliate violently.
052	And the priestess?
053	She didn't fit in any of those boxes. She wasn't scared, instead, she asked me questions.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
054	She couldn't understand why someone from Wadatsumi would kill another person from Wadatsumi.
055	Heheh. I was the one the one who was perplexed...unable to find any reply to her question.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
056	It's not just what was in front of her. She was looking far into the future...to the country of Wadatsumi itself.
057	For better or for worse, she brought me back to my own way of living.
058	What I was living for...my goals in life and how I was going to pursue them...
059	... ...
060	Her direct gaze was enough to make me determined. Before I knew it, that was my goal.
061	True. If you asked me if I was in love with her, I would say you might be right.
062	But...she was suddenly eradicated...because of your greed.
063	It all came about because of your lack of power.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0030
064	Yes. Indeed.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
065	I could neither save her nor was able to get revenge. In fact, I have no thing left to live for.
066	Come on...kill me.
067	You're wasting your time. I don't have time to take you on.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
068	What...what do you mean?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
069	Nothing. Just going on a whim. I know the same sensation of not being able to protect those that you love.
070	No, even now, I am placed in that situation.
071	This time, I will save her with my own hands.
072	I don't have time to be taking care of you.
073	If you let me live, I'll attack you again. You'll regret it.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
074	Do as you please. At that time, I'll once again overwhelm you with my power.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0009
075	Tsk...that imbecile...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0020
