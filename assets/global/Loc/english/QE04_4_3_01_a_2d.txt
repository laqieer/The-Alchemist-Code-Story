001	Nngh!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
002	It's the same tentacle that attacked Georgios! Tehre, are you—?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
003	Stay away! It's targeting me because I destroyed the core. It's...draining...all...my...strength.	VO_terre.terre_battle_0022
004	So desperate...to cling...to life... Ggh!
005	Tehre!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
006	I said...stay away! Turn back! To Voda and Fuu! Warn them of what happened here!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0042
007	This casualty...was within my calculations. I gave...Tamis the power of my Matter...for that very reason.
008	My only regret...is not being able to honor my promise...to Georgios.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
009	Honor your promise?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
010	I entrust it all...to you. Save Saga...and recover Beelzebub. Urrgh!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0019
011	Tehre!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0020
012	I may have seemed cold and distant to you...but that makes this easier.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0035
013	No, you weren't! I never did understand what you were thinking...but...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0018
014	But you've never been wrong about anything. I've always looked up to you!
015	I suppose telling a child to dry their tears would be harsh of me...but do not be saddened; I am grateful to be able to see Alia so soon!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
016	I leave the rest in your hands, Wind Shaman and company!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
017	Hic... Hic... Tehre!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0019
018	No time to even grieve?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
019	Let's go. We need to tell Voda and Fuu! He has entrusted us with finishing what he started!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0011
