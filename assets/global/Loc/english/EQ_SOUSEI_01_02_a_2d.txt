001	Finally... Finally! I'm finally here!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0046
002	H-here they come!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
003	Oi... Are you a friend of that blacksmith who lives outside the village?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
004	You here to take us over?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
005	Stand back!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
006	H-hey! Come on, now...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
007	Don't move!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
008	Keep your hands where we can see them, or this won't end well for you!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
009	Just hold on a second, will ya? The name's Adaleigh!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
010	I came here from the Acedia Belt Region!
011	From the... Where? Acid...ear...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
012	Why have you come to the land of the Sephira?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
013	Sephira...? Oh, I get it. So this place is called Sephira, huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
014	It's really beautiful! Everything is so green, as far as the eye can see! Not a chasm in sight!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
015	Wow!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
016	Wh-what...?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
017	Do you guys get earthquakes?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
018	Earth...quakes?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
019	Well, occasionally.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
020	Come to think of it, I don't think there's been one for several years.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
021	Wow! So you don't have to worry about earthquakes here?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
022	Then this really is the place! I've finally found a world free from sin!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0009
023	There is no such thing as a world free from sin. Not so long as there are people living in it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
024	Huh?!
025	Who're you?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
026	My name is Nimul. I am something of a leader to these people... To the Sephira. Well, I will be, soon.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
027	I've been listening...
028	And I would like to bid you welcome, visitor from the other side of the Barrier.
029	This is the Sephira Village: a withering land beset by the corruption of sin.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
030	The Sephira Village...? The corruption of sin?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
031	Wait... Does this mean that there's a Cursed Beast here, too?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
032	There is, indeed.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
033	Are you for real?! I can't believe this!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
034	I came all the way out here for nothing!
035	I would like very much to speak with you. I want to hear about your quest...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
036	And about the place from which you came.
037	All right. I can do that.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
038	Excellent. Well, Adaleigh, if you would follow me back to my home, I'd be more than happy to accommodate you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
039	Sounds good. I... Ahh...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
040	Is something...?
041	H-hey! What's wrong?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
042	Are you alright? Hey!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
043	Snnrk... Frrrr...
044	Is he...asleep?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
045	It can't have been an easy voyage.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
046	He had to traverse the Dark Barrier, after all.
047	(The Dark Barrier... It is said to be a wellspring of corruption.)
048	(Yet this man passed through it to get here.)
049	(What does that mean? What is the Dark Barrier, really?)
050	Nimul... What should we do about him?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
051	I'll take him back to my place. He should feel better after he's had a decent rest.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
052	Hello? Hey! Where is everyone?! Hellooo!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
053	What the...? No! Not another earthquake!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
054	Arrrgghhh! This is really bad! This is the biggest one...ever!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0022
055	...
056	H-hey! Look out!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
057	Urgh... Nnrgh...
058	What the...?
059	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
060	Fallen?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
061	Haaaarrrrgghhh!
062	N-no! Aaaaaaahhh!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
063	Aaaahhhhhhhhh!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0025
064	You're finally awake.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
065	H-huh? Where...am I?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
066	You collapsed, so I carried you back to my house.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
067	Oh, uh... Thanks. Haa...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
068	It seemed as though you were having a nightmare.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0003
069	Yeah, I... I had a terrible dream. It was about the place I came from.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
070	There're all these chasms, which are just full of corruption...and in my dream, a man accidentally came into contact with the stuff, which turned him into one of the Fallen.
071	The Fallen...? You mean to say that they exist in other regions?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
072	I would like to hear more about the region you came from...if you wouldn't mind.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
073	Sure thing. I...
074	Oops.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
075	Perhaps you should have something to eat first.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
076	Seems like that would be for the best. I'll bring him something right away.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
077	Ungh...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
078	Umgf! Hrmpf! Mmm... Umgf!
079	You...must have been starving.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
080	Sorry! Umgf... Can't help stuffing my face. Never seen anything like this before!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
081	Make sure you chew, at least. Wouldn't want you to choke.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0003
082	Urrgk! Ooorf... W-water!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0043
083	What did I just tell you?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
084	I guess he was just that hungry.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
085	Haa... Haa... I thought I was gonna die!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
086	Slow down. The food isn't going anywhere. Take it easy.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
087	Yeah, yeah...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
088	Adaleigh, while you eat... Take as much time as you need, but if you could please start telling us of the place from which you came...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
089	Okay...
090	My home... The Acedia Belt Region... It was punished in the form of earthquakes.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
091	The ground shook multiple times a day, every day. Big quakes, small quakes... They split open the earth.
092	And from those chasms came the corruption of the Cursed Beast. It bubbled up from underground, black and sick...
093	Shaken both mentally and physically by the constant tremors, terrified of falling into the yawning chasms... We lived amidst the corruption in a state of constant fear.
094	...
095	As I'm sure you can imagine, the Acedia Belt Region has none of the beauty and greenery of your village.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
096	But I... I wanted to save it. The ruined earth, the suffering people...
097	So I built an airship and set out to do just that.
098	You...?!
099	You made that ship?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0025
100	Sure did. I'm an engineer!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
101	An engineer...? Hmm...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
102	So... What was the purpose of your voyage? How did you plan to save your home and people with a ship?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
103	I was hoping... I was hoping that there was somewhere peaceful out there, somewhere where sin wasn't running rampant and destroying people's lives!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
104	I thought that if I found someplace like that, I'd be able to find a way to improve our situation, even just a little!
105	But it seems like that...isn't gonna happen.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
106	You're right, Nimul. Wherever people are, sin will find them. There's no such thing as a human utopia.
107	Perhaps, but that is the way of this world. As it is now, that is.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
108	Huh?
109	Well, I'm not gonna give up! This is only the second place I've been to. I'm sure there's gotta be somewhere out there that—	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
110	This is the second place? So you landed somewhere else before arriving here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
111	Yeah, that's right. I've been to one other place.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
112	According to the people I met there, it was called the Luxuria Belt Region.
113	The Luxuria Belt Region...
114	What was it like? I suppose that it was also burdened by sin.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
115	That place...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
116	It was frozen solid.
117	The entire region was buried in ice and snow. It was nothing short of a frigid wasteland.
118	That's how the Luxuria Belt Region was punished...with intense cold.
119	You're leaving, aren't you, Adaleigh? It's a shame... I was really starting to like you.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0022
120	Mira...
121	You're right. I'm going. I need to find a place that's free from sin. There has to be somewhere out there!	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
122	That's why I built this ship... That's the reason I'm here!
123	I know... I haven't forgotten.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
124	You know what? I believe in you, Adaleigh! I know you can do it. I mean, time is infinite!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
125	C'mon, Mira... Not this again. Human time is finite. You know that!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
126	Shame on you, Nyx! Don't you believe in Adaleigh?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
127	It's not a question of belief.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
128	Adaleigh... What you're doing is dangerous.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
129	It doesn't matter who you are. There's no guarantee that you'll make it through your next trip.
130	In fact, it's pretty much a miracle that you made it here in the first place.
131	You think I don't know that? Still... If I have even the slightest chance of success, I have to try.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
132	No... There's no "try" about it. I'm going to do it!
133	I know I can!
134	Well... It's not like I had any intention of stopping you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0022
135	I wish you all the best.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
136	Thanks!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
137	...
138	Adaleigh...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
139	Oh, uh... Sorry. It's nothing.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0035
140	Anyway, I wanna hear more about this Sephira village!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
141	You called it a withering land, but it sure doesn't look that way to me. Is it really—?
142	It is.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
143	The only reason that the true state of this land isn't plain to the naked eye is thanks to the existence of the Tree of Life, Sephiron.
144	Sephiron, huh?
145	The combined powers of Sephiron and the Guardian Dragon Nidhogg are what suppress the corruption with which the Cursed Beast assaults us from its slumber beneath the earth.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
146	S-suppress it?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
147	And the one who wields those powers is the priestess, known as the Vessel of Purification.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0037
148	Vessel of...Purification...
149	...
150	Is that... Is that really possible?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
151	Indeed. Well, it is for we of the Sephira, who possess powers of purification.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
152	So then... You mean the same thing wouldn't work for other lands?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
153	Correct. It would be impossible.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0040
154	No. Not impossible.
155	What?
156	I am currently in the process of researching Spiritbonding, and with said research, I am attempting to produce an entirely new technique.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
157	Spiritbonding? A new... Huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0050
158	Spiritbonding is the power of Mother Nature herself, of Sephiron.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
159	It is an art native to these lands, and one that can be used only by the Sephira.
160	However, the new Spiritbonding technique that I am developing is different; anyone will be able to acquire it.
161	Once it is complete, it could even be used to suppress the onslaught of sin in—
162	In other regions?! You think I could take it home with me and use it to save my people?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
163	I do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
164	No! Nimul, this cannot be allowed!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0015
165	Huh?
166	It is far too powerful! I cannot believe that you would even consider teaching it to an outsider!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0014
167	Waginau...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
168	He... Adaleigh has come all this way, just to find a way to save his home. Despite the untold danger in which he is placing himself, he is doing all he can to change this world for the better.
169	So you see... He and I share the same ideal.
170	Wh—?!
171	Nimul, please! I need you to teach me this new technique!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
172	I'm sorry, Adaleigh, but I can't.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0039
173	Wh-what...?
174	Not yet, at least. It is...not yet complete, and may not be for some time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
175	That is why I... No, why this world needs your help, Adaleigh.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
176	Nimul...
177	Okay. I'll do it. Whatever you need!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
178	Thank you, Adaleigh. I appreciate that.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
179	(An engineer who built his own airship... I can see him being very useful in completing my research.)
180	But...	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
181	Yes?
182	Before that... I wanna try it out.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
183	Try out...what exactly?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
184	Spiritbonding! What else? And that new technique of yours!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
185	You doubt Sephiron's power? Hmph. How foolish.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
186	I think I'd be more of a fool if I just believed everything I'm told without checking out the facts for myself.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0010
187	You impudent little...!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0012
188	Oh-ho! You wanna go?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
189	Hmph. Be careful what you ask for, boy.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
190	B-boy?! Who do you think you're calling boy?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
191	I merely call them as I see them.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0008
192	You...! You take that back!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0013
193	And why should I? You are behaving like a little boy, and so I name you such.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
194	Will the two of you cut it out?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
195	Ngh... I'm really ticked off—but that's just perfect! Hey, Nimul!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
196	Yes...?
197	Let's see how this jerk's Spiritbonding and your new technique hold up against my Engineer Soldier!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
198	Your...what?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
199	My Engineer Soldier! It's a masterpiece, and my life's work!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
200	Interesting... Very well. Let's see what you've got.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
201	What?! Surely you're not serious, Nimul!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
202	Don't forget that you're the one who provoked him, Waginau.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
203	Hmph.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
204	What is taking him so long?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0017
205	You heard him. He's going to fight with his Engineer Soldier. I suppose he's still preparing.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
206	This...Engineer Soldier... Have you heard of it before?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
207	Of course not. How could I possibly have heard about it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
208	Hmph.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
209	Hey! Sorry to keep you waiting!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0023
210	Wh-what is that? A steel...doll?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
211	Ah, so this must be your Engineer Soldier.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
212	That's right! It's a real masterpiece!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
213	It absorbs the magil in the atmosphere and uses it to attune the Soldier to my thoughts, so it can move about on its own!
214	I...wasn't aware that such a substance existed in the atmosphere.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
215	I suppose the fact that it can power this doll means that it can be converted into energy.
216	Magil... Hmm... This bears further investigation. Thank you, Adaleigh.
217	Get your head out of the clouds, Nimul! Do you really intend to fight this...thing?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
218	Heh... Pipe down, Waginau. All we need to do is win.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
219	Are you so confident of that?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
220	What? Think you can't beat something just because you've never seen it before?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
221	Didn't think someone who stands at the forefront of the Sephira Guard would be such a coward.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
222	Hmph. I'll teach this child to respect his betters!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
223	Bring it on! Show me your Spiritbonding and this new technique!
224	Go get 'em, Engineer Soldier!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1030
