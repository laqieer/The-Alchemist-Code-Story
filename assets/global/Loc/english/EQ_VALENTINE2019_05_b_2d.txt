001	Wow... The two of them certainly are remarkable warriors.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
002	Hmm... You know, I feel like Itsuki seems somewhat hesitant.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
003	What?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
004	Not bad for a human! Didn't expect you to put up a fight.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
005	Why do you feel the need to keep mentioning that?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
006	Huh?
007	Humans this and demons that... You're the only one who cares about that here!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0017
008	The only reason you can say that is because you've never had to live as a demon!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0012
009	You've never been persecuted for being who you are!
010	I have been betrayed, time and time again!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0029
011	I wanted to trust humans. I wanted to believe! But you humans could never accept us!
012	There is no demon before me.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
013	What?
014	I see no demon. Before me stands a worthy rival, and that is all that matters to me!
015	Y-you...!
016	Huzzaaahh!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0006
017	Aaagh!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_battle_0022
018	A clean hit! Show's over!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0004
019	Are you all right, Itsuki?	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
020	...
021	You see no...demon?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0022
022	Erm... Itsuki?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0003
023	Argh! I can't believe I lost!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
024	Well, I suppose a promise is a promise. I am sorry about what I said earlier.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0036
025	There's no need for that.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
026	What?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0025
027	I felt your struggle. That was enough.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
028	Suzuka...
029	I'm back! Seems like everything's all good now. Did something happen?	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
030	Nothing too crazy, I hope? Anyway, let's get to making some chocolate!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
031	Itsuki, if you don't mind... Would you like to make chocolate with me?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
032	I, uhh...	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0025
033	I know that I cannot hope to fully understand the hardships you have had to endure.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
034	Yet I would like for you to make the best of your time as a Phantom in this world.
035	I guess I was the only one who was obsessing over this, huh?
036	Do you think...I could make chocolate as good as that?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_chara_1005
037	I'm sure you could. I've done it!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
038	Course you can! It's dead easy!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0005
039	Well, then...	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
040	All right! Let's make some chocolate!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_chara_1006
041	Yay! Let's do this!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0004
042	So! We'll be needing this to make chocolates like the ones we tried earlier, right?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0002
043	What? Hot peppers?! Why?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
044	I love spicy food! That chocolate we had earlier was so good!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0023
045	I want to make some that's even spicier!
046	Is everybody ready? Let's get this party started!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
047	All right!
048	It seems that Itsuki was the one who ended up with the other spicy chocolate. Are we just going to let her do this, Emma?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0045
049	Mmm... Why not? Who says chocolate has to be sweet?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
050	I do!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0019
051	Pfft! All that matters is that we're all having fun. Isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0008
052	All people are equal under the deliciousness of chocolate. Have a nice, sweet Valentine's Day!
