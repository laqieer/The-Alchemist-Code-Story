001	Your blade is rigid... Inflexible. So... You still believe that the path you have chosen is the only means of salvation?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
002	...
003	Not in the mood to answer? Perhaps this will loosen your—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
004	This tremor... The dragon is on the move?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
005	It is time.
006	Hold it! You intend to flee?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
007	I have seen right through you. You are not good enough to hinder me.
008	Tch!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
009	Surely you have realized it by now... You don't have what it takes.
010	Regardless of how impressive the arms you forge, and how much you improve your sword skills... You will never reach the Truth.
011	So what?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
012	I forge weapons. Nothing more, nothing less. One day, these hands will create a blade capable of destroying a God. That is, after all, why my life was spared.
013	Know this... The next time we meet, you will draw your last breath, and you will die as the final quester of the Avarice Belt Region.
014	...
015	Nimul needs me. I had best hurry.
016	Warning. Extensive turbulence has been detected. Immediate change of route is required. Repeat, immediate—
017	Aaaaahhh!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0028
018	Lady Emmel!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
019	Th-thank you, Julia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
020	We don't have time to stand on ceremony, my lady. What are we going to do?	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
021	You're right...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
022	I think...the Great Nidhogg is taking flight!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
023	This is bad. Nimul and the others are still in the dragon's interior!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
024	Hrrghh! No! The Matter isn't responding! I can't do anything!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
025	Aaahh! L-look! Fallen are...emerging from inside the Guardian Dragon!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
026	Uuuuuuhhhhhhhhh!
027	No! They're going to damage the airship!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
028	Leave it to me, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0001
029	Uuhhhh...
030	From your garb and equipment, I can see that you must have once been warriors of note.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
031	However... Your attacks are no longer as skilled as they once were, and I cannot feel a hint of the burnished light of the Sephira from within you.
032	I suppose...such is the fate of one who has fallen to the corruption of sin.
033	Haaaaaaaaarrrhhhh!
034	And for you to attack the Vessel of Purification, even though you should be prepared to risk your own life for her sake...	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
035	Truly, not a single shred of the pride of the Sephira people remains within you.
036	Therefore, it is up to those of us who came after to show you the error of your ways.
037	Pray, prepare yourselves.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0007
038	What was that?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
039	Now that Sephiron's protection has receded, I felt it necessary to employ a little trick of mine.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
040	You see... I used a technique that allows me to imbue my gear with Sephirium, thereby strengthening the blessing of the great tree.
041	I am aware that Yna was able to succeed at this on his own, but a similar technique is known to those of us in the Sephira Guard.
042	Now, please... Stand back, my lady.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
043	I will be the one to correct the misconduct of these fallen warriors of the Sephira, as their fellow—
044	Julia! I can fight, too!	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
045	Very well. I ask only that you do not push yourself too far, my lady. There is only so much I can do to protect you when you are fighting by my side.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
