001	You're surprisingly adept, for an army of two. But this is as far as you go!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0010
002	Quence!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
003	Got it. Sorry about this, Ignacio.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
004	...!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0019
005	Father!
006	Urgh! When did you have time to set up such an attack?!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0042
007	You use no incantations, yet achieve such power? Was this your plan from the start?!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
008	Even if we are all of the Infinite Serpent, that doesn't mean we're allies.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
009	It's important to have a trick or two up your sleeve for when it comes time to part ways.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0008
010	Quence! Have you already forgotten how Father saved you?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0043
011	Oh, of course I haven't. I am a man with renowned memory, after all. That said, I don't feel particularly indebted to him.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
012	...	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
013	Now it's just you and me, one on one. I hope you're prepared.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
014	You certainly do leave a lasting impression, don't you?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
015	This magil! It's of the Guardian Dragon of Gula Belt, Nidhogg!
016	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0032
017	Ghh! I've grown weak... I wasn't prepared for a fight when I came to greet you!
018	Accept your defeat.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
019	That, I cannot do. I've been entrusted with an important wish, and a belief that I must fulfill.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0039
020	Lucifer! It's time to awake!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
021	What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
022	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0001
023	It can't be...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
