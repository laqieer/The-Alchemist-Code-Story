001	Eek keke!	VO_albarmin.albarmin_battle_0020
002	Whew!
003	Sorry about that! Thanks for the help.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0036
004	It was no trouble, but...
005	All right, our destination is straight ahead! Better hurry, you wouldn't wanna be late!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
006	...
007	I'm home!
008	Welcome back, Mira.
009	Oh! You guys are back already? That was fast!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
010	Um, uh, yeah...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
011	...
012	Jeez...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
013	What is going on with you two?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
014	I am not entirely certain, as I did not join them until later, but it seems that the hearth's fire was out.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
015	The hearth's...? You mean the fire of the blacksmith's forge in this town?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
016	Ahhh, well...Agape doesn't actually have a blacksmith.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
017	Agape also doesn't have any specialist craftsmen or carpenters.
018	How can this town function without them?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
019	I told you! We use magic in our daily lives, so we can make do without such things in our region!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
020	That means there's no demand for craftsmen, so there was no real need for them to have successors, and the whole industry just kinda died out.
021	At the moment, it's Ambrosia's magic that's keeping everything held together.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
022	Dunno how long she can keep it up, but...
023	Concerned for your dear teacher, are you? If you really cared, you would complete your magical studies and take over some of my duties to ease my burden.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
024	Ambrosia! We've returned!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
025	Tsk... If only your enthusiasm for mischief extended to your studies.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
026	Don't worry, Ambrosia! I've also got tons of enthusiasm for food! Yum, yum!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
027	Mira, you know that's not going to impress her.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
028	It's disheartening how little you've changed over the years, Mira. Take care that you don't eat your way out of fitting into your wardrobe.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
029	Aw, but Ambrosia! It's not my fault that your cooking is so delicious!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0010
030	Which means it would be your fault if I had to buy new clothing! Hah!
031	Nonsense! Honestly... When did you become so cheeky?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0012
032	Don't worry, Ambrosia! I'm pretty sure she was born that way. Nothing to do with you or me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
033	Well, isn't that a relief! At least you've turned out well, my dear Nyx.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0044
034	Hey! You're playing favorites! That's totally unfair! Nyx, you're always taking Ambrosia's side, you traitor!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
035	Well, duh. You're the only one who's ever making trouble!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
036	Ambrosia! Did you hear that? Nyx is bullying me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0019
037	Oh, my. That's so disappointing to hear, Nyx. Tsk, tsk.
038	What? That's petty, Mira! Those crocodile tears are manipulative! Ambrosia, don't be fooled by them!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0016
039	Ahem. Well then. Anyone hungry?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
040	Now that you mention it, I'm starving! We haven't eaten a thing since we ended up in this Belt Region!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
041	What?! Well, we can't have that. It's been a while since we had any visitors. What a perfect opportunity for a feast! Are you ready to eat a lot?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0008
042	This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
043	Oh, my goodness. This is too much! Thank you, um...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
044	Address me however you like. To be frank, I'm old enough to be your grandmother several times over, so perhaps...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
045	Oh, I see. Thank you so much, um...ahem, Miss Ambrosia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0033
046	Oh... I had hoped you might call me grandmother.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0025
047	Come on, Ambrosia. I wouldn't call you that.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
048	I mean, you basically look the same age as us.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
049	At least she called you Miss Ambrosia. So polite! She didn't need to do that!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
050	What are you talking about? I'm over five hundred years old, you know!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
051	I mean...you don't act like it.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
052	Um, Grandmother? Sorry to interrupt, but I'm so hungry I think I might die, so...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
053	Oh, my! Well, we can't have that. Go ahead, dig in! I've never had any complaints about my food.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
054	All right! Thank—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0009
055	Urk... Bit my tongue.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
056	That's what happens when you rush to stuff your face like that.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
057	Lay off. What are you, my mother?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
058	Wow... That was amazing! All that food, mmm...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0008
059	Thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality, Miss Ambrosia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
060	No need to thank me! I merely did what I saw fit.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
061	Now, I must admit I'm curious... What do you think of our region?
062	...
063	Uh oh...
064	What do...we think?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
065	Yes. If I understand correctly, you were all given the grand tour?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
066	Oh, yes.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
067	It's a lovely place. Despite the ever-present threat of the Cursed Beast, the residents are all very kind and friendly.
068	I appreciated how open they were to sharing their customs with us, despite the fact we...don't know anything about them.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
069	Perhaps a little bit...too open.
070	Hmm... So that is how you see it.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0022
071	What do you mean?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
072	Oh, I was only thinking out loud.
073	These lands... They were once brimming with life. Flowers and natural beauty abounded.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
074	Winter would come, but so would spring.
075	Back then, basking in the riches with which nature provided us, we took time to learn and grow wise, to refine our magics.
076	And then...Asmodeus came, and everything changed.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0021
077	Blizzards levelled our forests, our lakes froze over in the cold, and our sun was hidden by masses of storm clouds.
078	At the time...I was naught but a little girl. I hadn't the power to save anyone.
079	There was nothing I could do against this calamity that threatened our survival.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0027
080	Wait... You're saying...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
081	You witnessed the emergence of the Cursed Beasts? The time that not even our oldest myths can tell us of?
082	Witnessed? Yes, perhaps...but I know nothing of how they came to be. I was merely present in that time.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
083	If you are looking for answers, I am not the right person to turn to.
084	What are the Cursed Beasts? Why do they torment us like this? Where do they come from?
085	I know not. All I know is that they are our enemy.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0039
086	Pardon me, I didn't mean to speak at such length. The older I get, the more common this becomes...
087	So. What do you plan to do?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
088	Plan...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
089	You must understand by now, surely.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
090	Your only hope of leaving this place, your ship, lies broken in Asmodeus' territory.
091	While most would give it up for good, perhaps find some way to move on and build a new life here...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
092	I suspect that that is not an option for you.
093	First, we will reclaim our ship.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
094	How?
095	...
096	...
097	...
098	...
099	If we must, we will defeat the Cursed Beast.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
100	Hm...?
101	Aha...hahaha...hahahahahaha!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0008
102	Defeat...the Cursed Beast? Hah! With what strength? How incredible that you would even say such a thing after being so thoroughly defeated by Asmodeus!
103	You must understand how incredibly outmatched you all are.
104	Yes...we understand.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
105	(I cannot deny what she says, as frustrating as it is to hear.)
106	(We do have the ability to use our pure magil to counter the corrupting influence of the Cursed Beasts, but...)
107	(It didn't affect Asmodeus at all.)
108	(There is still much we do not know about the Cursed Beasts. Knowledge we need in order to overcome them.)
109	Tell me... How do you plan to defeat the Cursed Beast?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
110	Of that I am not yet certain. However, I urgently feel that now is the time to do so.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
111	Oh?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
112	I was hoping that the great Abstinent Witch and her apprentices might be generous enough to lend us a hand.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
113	When you saved us from the Cursed Beast, your magic injured it.
114	Despite that, from what I can tell, the magil you were using was not even as powerful as our Matter.
115	In other words, I believe that some kind of unique factor is required to defeat the Cursed Beast.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
116	...
117	Miss... You know something about the Cursed Beasts that you're not telling us, don't you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
118	Do I? Even if that were true, I have no obligation to tell you.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0045
119	Why would you keep it a secret? Do you not trust us?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
120	An interesting assumption in light of everything up till now. Not that it matters. There is no point in asking me about this.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
121	Especially not after you said all those lovely things about our little mockery of a town here.
122	Mira, Nyx.
123	Yeah?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
124	What is it, Ambrosia?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
125	Please prepare rooms for our guests. I suspect that their stay in this town will not be an altogether pleasant one.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
126	Yes, Ambrosia.
127	I will allow you to run in your circles, my impatient friends. Perhaps if you try your very best, you will indeed accomplish what you aim to do.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
128	...
129	What...just happened?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
130	She knows how to defeat the Cursed Beasts. She just doesn't want to tell us.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
131	Huh? For real?! What's with that?! Just tell us what we need to know!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
132	Adaleigh, use your head for a moment. Of course it's more convenient for us if she tells us, but she has no real reason to do so.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
133	What do you mean, no reason?! Doesn't she want to take that Cursed Beast down? What better reason could there be?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
134	Consider this. If she does knows how to defeat the Cursed Beast, why has she herself not attempted to do so before now?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
135	I guess...either it requires too big of a sacrifice, or...there's no guarantee that it would even work?
136	Precisely. In fact, both reasons are likely. If the stakes are too high and success is uncertain...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
137	It is reasonable to assume that one might not make the attempt at all.
138	Hmmm...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
139	I must say...I did not expect that.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0028
140	What are you referring to?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
141	I never thought I would see you of all people bow your head to another like that.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
142	Even if it was for the sake of defeating the Cursed Beast, I am still surprised that you would beg anyone for help as you did that witch.
143	After what happened back in Gula...I realized I had committed a grave error.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
144	Oh?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
145	Back then, I was utterly consumed with the idea of creating my new technique, and when I got my hands on that Matter...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
146	It was like I lost my mind. I became arrogant, convinced that I alone could save the world.
147	And then what happened? I saved no one. I was unable to protect anything that mattered to me, and I lost...everything.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
148	Once I thought that I had the answer to everything. Now...
149	Now I see that I should have been more cautious, more humble...more willing to listen and to rely on the help of others.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
150	No matter how much power a single human holds, that one person cannot do everything alone.
151	I should have known that. No...I did know that. And yet, I...I...!
152	Nimul...
153	I will never make that same mistake again. To the end, I will do anything, even if it means I have to kneel before another, tears streaming down my face, begging them for aid.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
154	I will do whatever it takes to protect that which I hold dear.
155	...
156	Well.
157	The Sephira, people of wisdom and compassion who have been blessed by the great tree.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
158	I would test their resolve, but...
159	Hmmm...what is the best way to go about this, I wonder?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
160	Grooooooooooaagh!	VO_asmodeus.asmodeus_battle_0019
161	This frosted world of white, in which everything lies frigid and corrupt...	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0008
162	Feels like it's been a while since I laid eyes on such a place.
163	Really? I feel like we never left.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0006
164	Truly?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0007
165	Truly.	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0004
166	Well, then...shall we begin?	VO_mela_dark.mela_dark_sys_0004
167	Yes. This is the purpose for which we were born. Ahh, but...	VO_nix_dark.nix_dark_sys_0005
168	Hmph. This really is a hassle.
