001	Are you serious, Father?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
002	Of course.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
003	It is the will of the proud people of Superbia Belt.
004	We have no gods to watch over us now, so this is the path the people have chosen for themselves. It is their future to shape.
005	But it's our job as high elves to help guide them along that path, is it not?!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
006	Yes, that is indeed the task we were entrusted with by the dragons who came before us. However...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
007	Humans must determine their own fate. The world, as it progresses, belongs to them.
008	I understand that. I do. But...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
009	What if they make the wrong choices? What if they regret what they've decided upon, and wish to take back their past?
010	Then they are free to do so.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
011	Humans have the right to control the world's destiny. But with that right comes the responsibility to bear the burdens of the changes they have brought about.
012	Then what about him? Why did you decide to take him in, and raise him?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0022
013	If you knew such a decision was to be made from the very start, then what was the point?! That isn't mercy—it's cruelty!
014	Helene...
015	We've had to do as that snake girl says, and she even gave him that name...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0018
016	It's all for the remaking of the world, my dear.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
017	That's what all the humans, high elves, and even dragons have sacrificed everything for.
018	But I haven't!
019	Then how about this, my child?	VO_chahele.chahele_voice_0018
020	If you should ever find the right path—the one that promises to lead humans onward to their best possible future—I implore you to choose it for yourself as well.
021	Do what you must to defend those who must be protected. Do what's needed for the sake of your mission. Even if you must one day fell me.
022	I...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0025
023	Promise me, child.
024	Father...
025	I promise. No matter what I must do.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
026	The winds are as strong as ever today.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
027	It's almost as if the gales act with malice of forethought, to obscure our future...
028	Will there really come a day when these winds will cease?
029	Helene?
030	Nimul? What are you doing in a place like this?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0003
031	Well... I'm staring at the sky. Wondering when that lid will ever open.
032	We are doing our best to make that happen.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0005
033	I know. But still...
034	I wasn't the chosen one. It wasn't me.
035	So... Well, I can't help but wonder if our true savior really even exists beyond this sky.
036	I couldn't say for certain.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
037	But what is certain, regardless of who was chosen, is that you are my beloved brother. Nothing can ever take that away.
038	Thanks.
039	Come, now. We should return home. This magil-infused wind is poisonous to humans.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0001
040	(He still has a future. No... Not just him. Everyone who lives in this Belt Region does.)
041	(Things can't end yet. I won't let them.)
042	I'll protect everyone...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
043	Hmm? Did you say something?
044	No. Nothing at all. Come on.
045	Sorry for the trouble.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0035
046	Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're back, safe and sound.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
047	So, this is what Avaritia Belt was like before, huh?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
048	Yes. The city is almost completely restored already.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
049	Or rather, replaced, I suppose. There have certainly been some fundamental changes.
050	Its people no longer crave power. Or to be more precise, they now seek power in an altogether different form.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
051	That's what this era's Benika told me, anyway.
052	I guess we really did change the timeline. No more Lord Kuvera, for starters...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
053	But beyond that, defeating the Cursed Beast was certainly bound to alter the region all on its own.
054	I...have completely changed your homeland, haven't I? I'm so sorry.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
055	Change isn't always bad. Particularly when some things could have only been saved through it.
056	Do you want to go back home, at least? That way, you can see—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
057	No, I don't. I made my peace with everything already.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
058	I'm glad enough to know that you cared for her in her final moments.
059	She didn't have many friends she trusted enough to really open up to.
060	I'm sorry...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
061	I just want to see what things are like now. I want to confirm for myself that this wasn't all for nothing.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
062	Yeah. After all that...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
063	All right. Here we are; right back where we started.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
064	Even the parts of town that were destroyed are back to how they were before. Or, I suppose, they've already been reconstructed. So much time has already passed...
065	The power to move freely through time is truly a fearsome one.
066	It has its drawbacks, though. A power like that is inundated with restrictions. Space-Time Manipulators place even further restrictions upon themselves, as well.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
067	Ambrosia...
068	I made an exception for you. I've broken the restrictions I placed on myself in direct response to my foolish apprentice's gross misconduct.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
069	However, this power is not to be taken lightly. Misuse of it could lead to...incalculable loss. It must be handled with all due respect and care.
070	I'll remember that well.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
071	That goes double for you, Mira! And you too, Nyx!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
072	Yeah, yeah.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
073	Don't worry. We have no intention of abusing this power.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
074	Are you sure about that, or are you just saying that so I'll lay off of you?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
075	Rude! It wouldn't hurt to trust us a little more, you know.
076	I think it just might! Particularly in your case. You'd best not even think about using this technique to travel back in time and get more snacks, or something equally frivolous!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
077	What do you take me for?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
078	I am truly grateful to you. The next thing to do, then, is—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0033
079	Ah, the search for your sister. You never did manage to find her, did you?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
080	No. Not yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
081	I mentioned this before, but these lands have the power to correct the flow of time.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
082	If she still lives, she should be drifting about somewhere in this era.
083	Emmel...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
084	We should be able to search for her, at the very least. We do have a mode of transportation around the region, after all.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
085	What are you looking at me for? I was just about to start heading back to Acedia Belt!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0025
086	You're not going anywhere, motorcycle man. Those in possession of convenient powers and technologies should be prepared to use them to the last!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
087	Ugh. Fine, whatever.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0016
088	We'll go around the other regions to see if Emmel is there. In the meantime, the rest of you—
089	I know.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
090	We'll head to Superbia Belt.
091	Are we really going back there?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
092	Yes. Lord Kuvera instructed us to do so with his final words, and there is still the chance that Emmel has drifted to that Belt Region.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
093	Never thought I'd be setting foot on those lands again...
094	Oh, yeah. You used to be part of the Infinite Serpent, right? Is there anything we should be aware of?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
095	You're going to have to use dust-warding magic while you're there. The winds are extremely powerful, to the extent that it's much like being in a perpetual sandstorm. And a poisonous one, at that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
096	Furthermore, don't expect anyone there to be particularly...forthcoming. Keep your trust in check.
097	All the inhabitants of that region are strict adherents to the Infinite Serpent.
098	All of them?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
099	Blasted Minario... Look what you've done to my poor baby!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
100	There we go. That seems like it'll do the job, no?
101	I've finished connecting the airship to the new Libra. It should run just like before.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
102	Excellent! Everything should be ready, then.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
103	It's like a man-made ark...
104	Gah! You startled me. Don't skulk around like that!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
105	I've been here the entire time. You must be woefully unobservant to have not noticed my presence until now.
106	Ugh, I'll notice your presence, you little—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
107	Zafeiris, is it true that you have a spectral dragon body?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
108	That is correct. Right now, I am nothing but a spirit. I am no more than the imperfect echoes of bygone thoughts.
109	You're pretty clear-minded and solid for a mere apparition, though.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
110	That is thanks to the strong will my host body possesses.
111	So the reason this guy's so annoying is because of Waginau? Hey, Waginau, you might want to discipline your pet!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
112	Don't speak as if I'm his owner! I'm no happier about this arrangement than you are, you know.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
113	He does help during battles, but other than that, he usually just haphazardly wanders off and gets himself into trouble.
114	So, what are you doing here now? What do you want?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
115	I have no particular reason for showing up. I was simply observing.
116	Observing what, exactly?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
117	Our princess has acknowledged you humans as beings of worth.
118	I simply wished to know how she arrived at such a conclusion.
119	You're probably better off looking to Nimul for that.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
120	I already know his worth. His powers of Alchemy, which allow for humans to enact true change, are terrifying even to me.
121	However, he himself does not acknowledge that worth.
122	It almost seems as if he feels there is something even more valuable in this world than he.
123	Yeah, probably Emmel.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
124	He does kind of obsess over her. Bit of a sister complex on that one, if you ask me.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
125	You're one to talk.
126	Excuse me?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
127	Nimul believes that everyone who lives in the seven regions has the ability to one day overcome their sin.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
128	Does he? Sin magil eats away at us all, including the princess—the being most revered among us dragons, whom even you humans regard as a goddess.
129	Yet you truly believe your kind holds the power to overcome such a universal force?
130	That's what we've been fighting for, under Nimul's banner: that we may light the path to that eventual victory.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
131	...
132	They will undoubtedly overcome it. That is what I am here for...and why you are here as well.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
133	We, the Infinite Serpent, are this world's final sacrificial offering.
134	The dear girl you brought forth—the Primordial Serpent—surely wishes for the same thing.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
135	You are certainly an amusing bunch.
136	What the...?! Ugh, how unpleasant, mumbling something cryptically sinister and then scurrying off...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
137	I don't care for people like that!
138	Now, now. Best to leave him be. He didn't seem to have any ill intent, after all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
139	It's the principle of it, though!
140	Zafeiris...
141	O Princess...Primordial Serpent, diviner of all Truth in heaven and earth alike...
142	Your power flows through the gentle wind, the lush flora, the murmuring rivers, and the sun in the sky...
143	Which will make your descent into sin all the more devastating to this world...
144	There must be a way to stop that from happening.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
145	Nimul, Pursuer of Gluttony. What is it you seek as you covetously devour all the knowledge of the world?
146	I seek a future where all can live in joyful harmony.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
147	Do you mean to say, all humankind?
148	I do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
149	Then you must intend to hold the Ceremony of Creation.
150	Yes. That is my aim.
151	Bianca referenced that as the sole means of saving this world, but what exactly is it?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
152	It's exactly as it sounds. It is a ceremony by which the world can be created anew.
153	Long ago, in a time when calamity rained down upon the dragons and brought us to the very brink of extinction, it did just that, altering heaven and earth alike on our behalf.
154	The time of the dragons...
155	Beings who determined the law of the land, much as Nidhogg did in the Gula Belt...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
156	It's hard to imagine a time before humans became the dominant force, when dragons ruled the land...
157	I guess you really are one of them.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
158	Of course! Though I am but a phantom now.
159	We are no more, ruined by our own hubris and our decision to step off the path we were supposed to follow.
160	Why did your kind try to bring corruption to Gula Belt?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
161	The Fallen cannot give birth to sin. They are born from sin, but they do not birth any themselves.
162	Yet despite wallowing within it, they also consume it for sustenance, serving to purify this world in the process.
163	They eat sin? That explains a few things.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
164	You were basically allowing us to be consumed by sin so we could do the dirty work of clearing sin magil from the world, then.
165	It was the simplest way to protect the world's order.
166	Such arrogance! We humans decide our own futures through our free will. We have the right to choose what tomorrow will bring through our actions!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0040
167	And you worked to take that away from us by force. You manipulated us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
168	That free will is the reason.
169	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
170	That strong will and determination you humans possess—the will to overcome hardships, and to survive even in the face of unimaginable struggle... We dragons lacked that.
171	We gained power and surpassed all other beings...
172	But in doing so, we lost the strength that we were supposed to inherently possess as living beings.
173	That's why we clung to our "God."
174	...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
175	We prayed to our fabricated god for the power to overcome the calamities which threatened to destroy us.
176	We tried to bring back the lives that were lost and the blood that was spilled by restoring the torn skies and the broken earth, but—
177	You failed.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
178	That was the moment of our end. We stared down the inevitability of our extinction as we realized the one power we didn't have was the power to resurrect the world.
179	However...
180	There were beings from an outside world you could call upon. And perhaps those humans might be able to do what you could not.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
181	The possibility was there. And we believe that fragmented piece of the Primordial Serpent is striving to do the same.
182	But for this to succeed, a sacrifice would be required. One of such magnitude that it absolutely could not go unnoticed.
183	What...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
