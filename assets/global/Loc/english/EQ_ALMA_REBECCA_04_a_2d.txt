001	A-alright! Wait... Where'd Melvy go?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
002	She can't just wait around here for us to get stronger. She's got work to do!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
003	True. I think...I understand so much better now why there's such power in her fists.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
004	Huh?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
005	Do you really not mind?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
006	Huh? Mind what?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
007	That I'm trying to become queen. You're the one with rights to the throne, after all.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
008	Ew, no thanks. I'll hard pass on that one. I don't have the right stuff to be a queen, and besides, isn't it weird for the throne to be passed on based solely on lineage?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
009	It'd be way better if a hard worker like you took over.
010	But...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
011	Melvy said it before, didn't she? That Venus didn't want to lose to a man, even in martial arts?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
012	I think that was all that drove her in the beginning.
013	Then, at some point, she just...became queen. Everyone has their own aspirations and goals, you know?
014	Everyone just aims toward those goals and dives in head first, ending up changing the world without meaning to. Liz was like that in the beginning, too, remember?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
015	That's why I admire your type; always thinking about the future of the country. You're amazing.
016	That's why I think it would be better if you became queen.
017	Alma...
018	I was disciplined strictly from an early age.
019	No matter who kicks you down, head for the top. That's the Helkovara family motto that was drummed into me.
020	Yet, in spite of all our talk about aiming for the top, not one Helkovara witch has ever become queen.
021	They just resigned themselves to being the elite.
022	What I mean is that we should not bind ourselves so firmly to a label associated with a family's standing and the blood ties behind it.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0004
023	That is precisely why I changed my own last name from one associated with a sinful nature.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0030
024	She was opposed, but eventually she caved under the pressure from her family.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0022
025	She couldn't break free of the control that the family held over its members.
026	Rebecca...?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
027	I just...want to stand at the top. That's all.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
028	If I stand at the top then there's no longer a need to knock anyone else down a peg anymore.
029	At the top, you can offer your hand to others instead of using it to slap them away.
030	That's why I have been so focused on getting to the top.
031	Her Majesty was able to see right through my contradictory intentions.
032	I tried to fight against my family's teachings, but I was bound by them without even realizing it.
033	You're the type who overthinks things at the worst possible time, aren't you?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
034	That you can even think about it like that is a big deal. Don't blame yourself so much, okay?
035	Alright... Thank you, Alma.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
036	So this is where you ran off to, Alma Haas Lustburg!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
037	The one from before?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
038	Ack, you're back? What do you want? Why are you after me?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0027
039	Is it actually because I caught you cheating before?!
040	Wh... You saw that?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
041	Huh? What? You mean you're here for a different reason? You're not here to cover it up?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1024
042	It doesn't matter!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0042
043	Why should we have to worry about fidelity anyway? There're so few men, they should be shared among everyone!
044	(This is just the same as it was before, but the sexes are reversed. This country just keeps repeating the same mistakes!)
045	(What should we do to make everyone equal? Just giving men favorable treatment will start this whole cycle over. What should I do...?)
046	That got serious real quick. Isn't there still the matter of honor? So, uh... What? Why are you after me?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
047	Hmph, you already know the answer to that.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
048	No, I don't. That's why I'm asking.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
049	Tell me the secret techniques of the Empress that you inherited!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0001
050	Secret...techniques?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
051	The magic that strengthens the body... It's the magic that conquered this country. I came here to observe your mastery of it!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0004
052	Huh?! It's something that cool?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
053	I mean, I just stumbled across it and started using it, but... Did you know you get fat if you're not careful?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
054	That's just because you don't know how to use it properly. Besides, we don't intend to use it on ourselves.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
055	Used on these monsters, it can turn them into an unstoppable force!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0007
056	Now that the Bugmail are gone and the palace is in ruins! This is our chance! We, the Helkovara family, will take our rightful places as the leaders of this land!
057	Helkovara?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
058	I knew it! You witches are from the branch family!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
059	We couldn't reveal our heritage in front of the headmistress, but that's right, Rebecca!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0004
060	Now, catch Alma and bring her here!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0007
061	What did you say?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
062	The head of the fam—or, rather, your mother—is counting on you.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0001
063	You've defeated the Bugmail, cornered the queen, and gotten into her good graces.
064	Your achievements are impressive. Now, all you need do is bring this young lady as a present to your mother!
065	You keep talking about defeating people and all, but it'd be pretty awful of me to just sit back and let you keep rambling on like you know what you're talking about.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
066	Wh-what? Who's there?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
067	I'm the boss of the organization you keep saying is gone! My name is Salomo! As long as I exist, the Bugmail will never be gone!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
068	No matter how many times it takes, we'll always emerge from the ground at your feet, time and again. This is our indomitable spirit!
069	S-Salomo? What...?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
070	You're alive?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0020
071	This is no joke. There's no way I'd die by the alchemy of some brats!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0030
072	That's...what I'd like to say, but...I have to admit even I thought I was dead.
073	The reason I'm still here is probably because that witch shared her life force with me.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
074	Liz's cure came just in time, then.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
075	Don't get in the way! Isn't Venus your greatest enemy?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0022
076	Or, rather, weren't you trying to defeat her? You'll assist us now in our own endeavor, correct?
077	Sorry, but I thought I was going to die.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
078	So I entrusted the future of this country to Lisbeth. She was the one who found the cure to the curse of Asmodeus.
079	Besides, she left Venus alive so there's gotta be a reason.
080	It wouldn't be fair to go and kill her just because I don't like her.
081	And hey, if we're on the subject of things I like and don't like, you lot are definitely on the list of things I don't.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
082	If one of the Helkovara is going to end up on the throne, then I would definitely prefer her to be it.
083	E-even if you flatter me like that, I don't have the power to pardon you for your uprising, you know.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
084	Don't go putting words in my mouth! I'm not going to become some yes-man for the nasty little witch who beat me!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0040
085	(Ugh... Neither of them is being honest with themselves. What a pain.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0027
086	Hmph! The resistance will be disappointed to hear about you turning against them! You've become a spineless coward!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
087	Say what you want, but my focus has always been, and always will be, the restoration of men's rights.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
088	The sacred stone is gone and now our society is starting down the path to change. What's the point of clinging to methods of terrorism that have already failed?
089	If the renegade won't shut his mouth then we will shut it for him! Everyone! Ready Battalion! Spare only Alma!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0025
