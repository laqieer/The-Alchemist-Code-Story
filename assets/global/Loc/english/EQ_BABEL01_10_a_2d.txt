001	...
002	Natalie, does the medic unit need to resupply? Natalie...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0002
003	Huh...?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
004	I know how you feel...but this is no time to let ourselves lose sight of things. Your unit needs you to lead them.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
005	You're one to talk. Time has passed since...but you haven't bounced back yet either.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
006	What are you talking about? I'm fine.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
007	The knights are worried about you, you know. They've been saying that there are shadows gathering within Sunbright Vettel.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
008	Hmm. I thought I'd been doing a good job of hiding that.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
009	I just haven't come to terms yet with all the things we lost when the Lion Monarch Orion descended on us.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
010	Yeah.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
011	...
012	Uh... Ahem. I'm sorry to interrupt.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
013	You don't need to be so polite, Nina. What is it? Did Victor do something again?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
014	Um... No! It's really not his fault, he's just quite, um...loud? He didn't mean to startle me. It really was my own fault for... Ahem. I apologize. I seem to have gotten off track.	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
015	I needed to speak with you in regards to another matter.	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
016	Another matter? What do you mean, Nina?	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
017	I'm so sorry. I know it's not my place, but...I just thought that maybe...it might be good for the two of you to, um... Maybe perk up a little?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
018	I know that Sir Gerald wouldn't be happy to see the two of you this way.
019	Gerald...?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
020	Um, well... It just feels like we're letting him down by not being able to move on.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
021	I remember he said something like...
022	"We swore that our iron wills should stand indomitable in the face of hardship in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!"
023	Something terrible happened. We lost someone important to us due to senseless violence. That's our  reality. However...if we lose sight of our promises and what we were fighting for in the first place...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
024	...!
025	...Honestly, I think he would sneer at us. He fought until the bitter end for the principles he held dear and the vow he once made with you.
026	Sir Gerald entrusted me with carrying on all that he held in his heart.
027	Like his hope to support Captain Vettel in continuing his role as the heart of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
028	Like his devotion to the Scarlet Flame Guard, always putting it first, before even himself.
029	I truly hope to become like him; someone who fully embodies all the ideals of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
030	But I can't do it alone. I need you to look to the future and do this with me.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0041
031	...Heh. Nina's got that spark, just like Gerald always did. Don't you think, Natalie?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
032	Hmph!
033	Oh no... I'm sorry! I'm sorry for letting my mouth run away with me!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0016
034	You! You are so like Gerald. It makes me sick! I can practically hear that idiot laughing at us!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
035	Heh... By the way, Nina, does that mean you're aiming for the same position he held? Are we looking at the future Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
036	U-um... I-if that...was what Sir Gerald would have wanted... I will do my best! I will definitely do my best to become a suitable Vice-Captain!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0050
037	In that case, I will do my part by healing your wounds! Just...like I used to do for Gerald.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
038	Indeed... It's time to start looking to the future. That is the path he left behind for us. Right, Vettel?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
039	Indeed. Thank you, Nina!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
040	Come on, it's time to shake this all off. We need to pump morale back up!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
041	Morale, huh?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
042	About that... Actually, I kind of have an idea. You know the dress uniform for knights...?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
043	This is...where the Scarlet Flame Guard began!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
044	Yes. This is where Gerald, Natalie, and I made the vow that started all of this.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
045	Huh. Interesting place to decide to have some swordfights.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0044
046	It was Nina's idea! It seemed a fitting way to honor Gerald, who spent his life in battle until the very end.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
047	She thought that it would be nice to come here to show him that our iron will has not faded, that we are still fighting the good fight wherever we can.
048	Gerald saw battle, even practice matches, as a place that opens up the potential to grow.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
049	Even if it was a training match, Ironheart Gerald would come at you with his full strength, no mercy.
050	And after a thousand swings, too. That guy was certainly consistent in his bull-headedness... Well. Are we going to do this or what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
051	Aw, yeah! I'm pumped up about this! This is gonna be fun!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0032
052	Eep!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0026
053	Victor! Quit freaking Nina out!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
054	Ahem. Now then, shall we begin this...unconventional memorial service for my old friend, Gerald? A training mission of sorts.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_1030
055	Are you watching, Gerald? I hope you're happy! We're doing this for you, you know! Scarlet Flame Guard, at the ready!
