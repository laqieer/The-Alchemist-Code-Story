001	Tch... We'll withdraw for now, but sooner or later, you'll come looking for us yourselves!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
002	Hold it!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0012
003	They ran away super fast... I wonder who they were?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
004	It's not about who they were.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0012
005	What do you mean?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0020
006	The way they were talking about the egg... It's obvious that they must have been the ones who took it.	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0018
007	Which means that instead of standing around, pondering their identities, we should be chasing after them!
008	I'm not sure I like your tone, but I must admit that you have a point.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0031
009	If we're chasing down prey, then leave it to me! My sweet little babies will have us snapping at their tails before you can say "egg"!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0038
010	Look! Up there on the altar! That's...!	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0001
011	The Imperial Easter Egg! That's it! That's the one I made!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0004
012	Hee hee hee. I knew you would come!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
013	Hand over the egg, and no one will get hurt!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0015
014	I see you have brought this year's Neica along with you. Hee hee hee... She looks rather nice indeed.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
015	How fortunate are we of the Brotherhood! It seems that the resurrection ceremony will be conducted in no less than twelve minutes!
016	Somehow, I don't think this resurrection has anything to do with the Easter one we've been talking about...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0031
017	Girl who would be Neica! You will use your powers to complete the Imperial Easter Egg for us, here and now!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
018	Then, we will take the enchanted wonder that is the Imperial Easter Egg...
019	Place it upon the altar here, and smash it to smithereens! Whereupon our Demonic Lord and Savior Most Unholy will be reborn!
020	So you guys are what we call, like...heathens, right?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0021
021	Worshipping an ancient, alchemic relic... These guys have totally lost it!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0012
022	Bah! Lowly filth like yourselves cannot be expected to understand! It matters not. All that matters is that we conduct this ceremony in the midst of the Easter Festival!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
023	Our Demonic Lord will descend unto us and realize our dreams of a resurrection!
024	Then our creed of fear will spread throughout the continent, taking over the hearts of the helpless masses, while we will be allowed to flourish under the glory of our Lord and rule over this nation in Their Name Most Terrible!
025	Heathens or not, such a dangerous organization cannot be allowed to go unchecked!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0012
026	We can't let them ruin this happy day for everyone! Trying to use this occasion to meet their own ends... That's the lowest of the low!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0017
027	Oh!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0025
028	I can't rely on you for everything!
029	Then you've gotta find yourself one so that we can match! These accessories will be our special memory of today!
030	I wonder what kind of look the person playing Neica will go for this year?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0003
031	Right?! The costumes are always so on point! I can't wait to watch her enchant the Imperial Easter Egg!
032	(But here I am, half-hoping that the egg will never be found, so that the whole event will be called off.)
033	(I was so desperate to get out of participating that I didn't care what became of the festival. That makes me no better than these people.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0018
034	Who cares about the festival?! Seize the Neica girl!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0030
035	You're horrible.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
036	Huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
037	I can't believe you'd try to use this peaceful festival to meet your wicked ends!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0012
038	You're even more terrible than I am! And let me be clear—you won't get away with this!
