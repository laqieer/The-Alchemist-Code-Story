001	Doraaaahhhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
002	Whoaaa! Th-that was dangerous...if I take one of those hits directly, it's lights out for me!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0016
003	You and your pathetic tricks! You gonna man up and have a proper fist fight with me?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0017
004	Nope! Why is that even a requirement?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
005	I heard that Monzein engaged in proper battle fair and square! Can you even call yourself a Paladin?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
006	There are different types of people! The old man just happened to be that sort of guy!	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
007	Me? I use my brains more! ...Like this.
008	Huh...?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
009	Is this...magic fortification?! Aghh...my body!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
010	There are different ways you can hunt down your opponent...this is my way of doing it.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
011	Ughh! Uggghh!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
012	...Huh?
013	Uggh! ...Ugghhhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0043
014	Huh...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
015	Uggg....gyaaahahahhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
016	Gyahahahah!!! Do you think something like that can stop me?! Huh...? Where did you go?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
017	Behind you.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0017
018	?!
019	Your power is a little too much.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
020	I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take you out quickly. Ill Atmosphere!!!
021	...?! Aghh!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0025
022	Phew... Seriously, what a guy...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
023	...Ouch...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0029
024	?!
025	Huh...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
026	I said that hurt. What did you soak me like that for...Argaaahhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
027	!!!
028	Argh! You gotta be kidding me...you even got it in my ear.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0022
029	No way...! Did he stop my ice with his...bare hand?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
030	Hey, listen up, Hero of Lost Blue. That's my spot.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
031	Huh?! N-no...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
032	Agh!!! Ughh...gahhh!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
033	Hey, seriously?! Are you really Othima? I didn't get the wrong guy, did I?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
034	Ug...gh...! Wh...what brute force! Ne-next level...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
035	Come on. Stand up.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
036	Ugh...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
037	Everyone touted you as a hero so I thought you'd give me some fun. Really disappointed.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0020
038	Aghh...!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
039	...Tsk.
040	It's been a while since I've had such a boring fight. I guess I should hurry up and beat you to death so I can go home.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0022
041	Ugh...wh-why...aren't you the leader?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
042	Huh...?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
043	Yo-you have so much strength...why aren't you the leader? Is this guy Sol...even stronger than you?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
044	If it's just a regular fight, I've never lost to him once.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
045	A...regular fight?
046	When I raised my hand against him in the forbidden area of Veda, I tasted dirt for the first time in my life.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0037
047	Ever since then I've never had another chance. To be honest, I feel like I can beat him now...but I can't quite figure him out.
048	He's the only opponent who I've ever acknowledged as being strong.
049	The forbidden area of...Veda?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
050	Whoops. Look like I said too much again.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0025
051	Well...anyway, you're gonna die here so it doesn't really matter.
052	Wa-wait! That power...Veda...does it have something to do with that tower?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
053	Who cares about the power?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
054	I was fascinated by his aspirations. That's why I decided to serve under him. That's all.
055	Aspirations?
056	Well, he spoke of his ideals. In order to make those ideals come to fruition, I would be willing to sacrifice my life.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0005
057	I felt that way. That's why our relationship isn't based around something as cheap as strength.
058	Wh-what were those...ideals?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
059	To obtain our own sky in Lost Blue, the place where light doesn't reach.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
060	The size of his aspirations when it came to the future of Lost Blue is what fascinated all of us.
061	A sky in Lost Blue...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
062	Wait...you haven't met him yet?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
063	Huh?
064	He said something about talking with you before going home. Jeez...what was all that about?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
065	Talk...with me?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
066	If you have business with Orion, you'd better look elsewhere.
067	Huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
068	No...we were just summoned by our captain.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
069	No way...was that him?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
070	Hey, what're you spacing out for?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
071	?!
072	It's all over now. Bye then, Hero of Lost Blue.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
