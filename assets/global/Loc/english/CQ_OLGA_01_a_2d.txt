001	If what that village elder said was true, I should be seeing that market soon... The one where merchants and weapons from all over the world are gathered.	VO_olga.olga_sys_0031
002	A festival of weapons and barter... I am so excited to see new things!
003	Oh, man! I should pump myself up for this market! This is gonna be fun!	VO_olga.olga_sys_0016
004	Woof, woof!
005	Hm? Could that be...?	VO_olga.olga_sys_0025
006	Kiki? Adel?! Then that means...	VO_olga.olga_sys_0024
007	Olga! How've you been?! The last time I saw you was at your village!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0003
008	Aruba! I knew it! Hey Kiki, Adel! Man, it feels weird seeing each other outside of Saga.	VO_olga.olga_sys_0023
009	Woof, woof!
010	I'm headed to this thing called the Old Market. Are you on your way there too?	VO_olga.olga_sys_0001
011	Absolutely! It's an event I can't afford to miss out on as a weapons dealer!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
012	It's pretty close to Saga, so I figured a weapons maniac like you would be there. I just didn't expect to see you before I got there!
013	You seem a bit tired though. Rough trip?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0031
014	Hahaha...ha. Well, I had a bit of a run in with some bandits yesterday, and I think I dropped my wallet then. I'm so broke right now.	VO_olga.olga_sys_0011
015	What?! Are you okay?! Maybe you should go back to Saga for a while to reorganize.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
016	Mmm. I wouldn't mind going back since I kinda rushed off without being fully prepared, but...	VO_olga.olga_sys_0031
017	I'm not going back until I learn everything I can about this world, and personally feel like I've grown!
018	That's what I said to everybody in the village before rushing out here, so... I mean, it hasn't been all bad, though!	VO_olga.olga_sys_0022
019	The village elder that I saved from the bandits treated me to breakfast this morning!	VO_olga.olga_sys_0007
020	I heard about some other bandits earlier, so I was thinking I'd go take them out, too! Fun, isn't it?
021	You have not changed a bit.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
022	Hey, would you like to see the market with me? If you find something you like, I don't mind getting it for you.	VO_alba.alba_sys_1050
023	Really?! That is amazing! I feel like you can help me find something really, really rare!	VO_olga.olga_sys_0024
024	Grrrr! Woof!
025	What the—? Monsters?! Where did they come from? Monsters around these parts are never this ferocious!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0025
026	Grrraaaarrgghh!
027	Maybe they're riled up by all that fighting I did against those bandits yesterday... But we can figure that out later! For now, we fight!	VO_olga.olga_battle_0019
