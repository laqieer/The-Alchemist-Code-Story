001	We caught one. Finally! That was a lot more difficult than I expected.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
002	P-please! Don't kill me! I'll tell you everything!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
003	The caravan attacks. Were they your doing, and if so, what were you trying to achieve?	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
004	Gluttony Foss... They pay a good price for fresh slaves.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
005	What?! Why?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
006	I don't know! They just suddenly started paying bandits like us to kidnap people!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0047
007	Bandit scum! Human traffickers are the worst of the worst! You're unforgivable!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
008	Eek! I'm so sorry! I swear I'll never do it again! Please let me go!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
009	Shut up! It's people like you who are destroying the peace of the desert!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0013
010	Slavery is not that rare of an occurrence here in the desert. Frankly, it's more surprising that fresh slaves would be worth a high price.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
011	Ryle, you can't be serious.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
012	Of course I am. There are even those who find happiness only after being sold into slavery. Life in the desert isn't easy, after all. Not everyone born here is able cope.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
013	I've been fighting to change that! Anyone who just stands by is being—dang it! Uh...negligent!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
014	I pray you never find out who is truly guilty of being negligent.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0010
015	Who's there?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
016	Hmph. How did I not see they would spill the beans so soon? I hoped our operation could stay covert for a little longer, but no matter. You there, girl. I have business with you.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0007
017	With me? I don't remember promising a date to some old man.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
018	Carla, stay back.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0002
019	Hmph, you don't even know your own worth, do you? Fool. Then you are nothing more than a tool.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0010
020	That insignia on your armor is Gluttony's... I see. So you're the one pulling the strings from behind. I take it back, I guess we do have business.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
021	What's the purpose of this human trafficking?! If you plan on disrupting the peace of this desert even further, you'll have to answer to the Sand Hawks!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
022	Ha! You're an energetic one, aren't you? I have nothing to explain to such an ignorant little peon.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0007
023	You don't need to explain anything. The only demand I have is that you keep your business away from this highway.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
024	I don't care for this desert's peace or whatever, but this highway is the Desert Wings' lifeline.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
025	If you plan to disrupt our territory any further, we will be forced to take action. It'll be a lot less trouble for all of us if you just withdraw.
026	Hmph... I have no objections. I have gathered all the slaves I need. I give my word that I will no longer meddle in your affairs.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0007
027	Glad we could come to an agreement. We're leaving, Ankh.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
028	Understood, Master Ryle.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0005
029	Hold it! Are you two just going to leave with the mastermind of all this standing right there?!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
030	What do we gain by doing otherwise? If we do something about this man, another one will just come to take his place.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0016
031	You'll never know unless you try! I know that deep down inside the people of this desert are hoping for a peaceful home!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0029
032	...!
033	How is that not incentive enough?! Even if it doesn't benefit you directly, that's something that everyone benefits from equally!
034	You have no idea what it is that truly needs protection. It would do you some good to figure that out first. Goodbye.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
035	Ugh! So high-handed! He just says whatever he wants and leaves?! Gosh darnit, not even a second glance this way!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
036	Did you expect anything more from people like them?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
037	You said you have business with Carla, but there's no way I'm going to let you anywhere near her. Give it up.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0031
038	Hahahaha! Looks like you actually understand the situation. No matter!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0024
039	It does not change the fact that you're just another pawn in my plan. Now, step aside!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0032
040	Balt, be careful! He's not some second-rate soldier!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0019
041	Yeah, I got that!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
042	I'm not the one you should really be worried about.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0005
043	...?!
044	Carla! Are you okay?! Z-Zofia?! What are you doing here?!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
045	Ah! Oh, hahahaha! Not good. Rashba. Zofia feels...not good! Really not good!	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0021
046	What's going on?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
047	You just have to listen to what I tell you, Zofia. We're taking her with us, and if she tries to resist...silence her.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0002
048	Take! Got it! I can take!	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0004
049	Zofia, stop! Why are you doing this?!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0015
050	You're wasting your time. Zofia lacks the mental capacity to answer such questions. She's Gluttony's property. Nothing more than a weapon; a tool.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0010
051	?!
052	I took her in after she was discarded for being too powerful to manage. They only ever gave her simple grave keeper tasks, so she never developed the proper cognitive skills beyond those needed to follow orders.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0037
053	She must somehow know she doesn't mix well with other children of her age. She used to not show any form of emotion.
054	It was difficult breaking her in enough to obey my commands, but it would have been a waste to let her vast Alchemia reserves go unused.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0008
055	Yah!	VO_zophy.zophy_battle_0007
056	How can you force such a young child to fight in your stead?! You coward! Zofia! That's enough!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
057	Young, old, what does it matter? Resources are meant to be used up! Is that not how you desert dwellers live as well?	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0010
058	Don't you dare think we are like you!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
059	You reproach me, yet you refuse to see the obvious. Is this desert itself not testament to how you lot have drained the resources of this land dry?	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0013
060	...!
061	Be quiet. No resist. Stop.	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0014
062	Hand her over and Zofia does not have to fight. I'm sure you know what the correct choice is here.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0002
063	Not only do you force a little girl to fight, but you also use her as leverage to get what you want?! Dang you, you're irredeemable!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0012
064	Those who do not know their own worth, like you and Zofia, are only good for being tools to advance someone else's ambition!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0016
065	The Corpse?! Tch! I didn't think they'd catch wind of this so soon!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0025
066	They don't seem to be his reinforcements, but they don't seem friendly either. Carla, stay close to me!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0019
067	Don't worry. It's not like I'm raring to get kidnapped.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
068	We cannot let the Corpse have her! Zofia, go!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0042
069	...!
070	You shan't lay a single finger on her! The beautiful desert lily, my prestigious sister, demands so! My future depends on her not killing me for failure!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0016
071	You fiends plotting the demise of my desert, your schemes and offenses will all be brought before the sun for judgment!	VO_rameses.rameses_battle_0007
072	I, Ramses, successor to the sun, shall be the hand that seals your fates! Revel in the glory that is me!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1001
073	Y-you're...!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
074	Tch! We'll just have to take care of them all! Zofia, get them!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0018
075	Like hell you will! Carla is not going anywhere!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0004
