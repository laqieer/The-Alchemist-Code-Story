001	As the monsters are gone, we shall continue with our practice. Allow me to remind you that you cannot use magic. Understood?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
002	I will be taking a look around the perimeter to make sure there are no more monsters.
003	(This area isn't where monsters live. Aren't they supposed to live in forests?)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
004	Phew, glad we made it through! Right, Alma?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
005	Well, I guess we got our exercise in before eating, at least... Huh?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
006	Urgh... My stomach...hurts...
007	Me too. Ever since I tasted the stew...
008	Really? Oh no. You all did all that with a stomachache? Are you two all right?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
009	I feel fine. And you seem fine too, Lisbeth? I...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
010	Hmph.
011	(She's...smiling?)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
012	We'll swap out the other groups' herbs with this and take everyone else out. How about it?
013	(No way! She didn't... Did she really swap out the herbs in all the madness earlier?!)	VO_alma.alma_battle_0023
014	(She really went and did something so petty. But tattle-telling on her won't lead to anything interesting.)
015	(And that herb isn't that toxic, so it'll be fine if I let things go on as they are.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
016	Urgh... Ow, ouch...
017	Hey? Are you okay? Where does it hurt?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
018	Recovery magic! ...That won't work! I haven't learned any magic that'll heal stomach pain!
019	Hey, calm down, Lisbeth. You can't use magic during practice.	VO_alma.alma_event_1013
020	If you use magic, you might lose points. Is that what you want?
021	Now's not the time to be worrying about something like that!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
022	?!
023	(Why... Why does she care about other people this much?)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
024	(I took it for granted that all witches would resort to anything to become elite.)
078	(That's what all the witches I met were like.)
025	(But this girl might be different from the others.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
026	Wait! Why are you okay?! That's weird!
027	I don't know. Maybe you all messed up when cooking yours?	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0010
028	Now that I think about it, weren't you at our cooking station when the monsters came?!
029	You! You didn't put something in our stew, did you?
030	I saw her over there, too! So what's your explanation for this?!
031	Huh? What? What are you talking about?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
032	Sigh... Why don't you just give up and tell the truth?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
033	I-I... Yeah... That's right. You said that we should use this opportunity to mess with the other groups.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0042
034	A-Alma was the one that told me to do it!
035	What?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
036	What are you talking about?! I would never do that!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0003
037	I could see Alma doing that. She's always standing off to the side, never really bothering to talk to any of us...
038	And her grades aren't that good either... Maybe she did it to improve her grade in this class. Urgh... Hurts...
039	...
040	(I knew this wasn't going to end well. Ugh. This is so annoying.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0022
041	Sigh... So if I gave the command, I should just apologize, right?
042	Wait!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
043	Why do you have to apologize, Alma? You can't!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0012
044	Huh?! Wh-what's with you all of a sudden?
045	Well, I know for a fact that you would never do something like that!
046	N-never? Why are you so sure about that?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
047	Because you're not a bad person!
048	You came to help me carry the firewood!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
049	And you noticed the small scratch Matthew had that he even didn't notice he had!
050	Because you're kind! So there's no way it could've been you!
051	Besides, it doesn't matter why their stomachs are hurting right now! Healing them is much more important right now!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0031
052	Th-that's true, but...!
053	So everyone! Eat the stew we made! It'll heal you in a flash!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
054	Huh? You wanna give it to them? But it's our assignment.
055	Yeah! Is that all right with you two?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
056	It's fine with me, but what about you? We put a lot of effort into it and it's perfect.
057	Of course it's fine!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
058	B-but! If we give everyone some, the stew will be all gone! At least let the teacher grade it first...	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0021
059	Geez, now's not the time to talk about practice when everyone's feeling so terrible!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0010
060	Besides, the stew came out great.
061	It should be eaten while it's hot. Right?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0008
062	Uh...
063	(If it were graded, it would've been our first step towards becoming an elite witch.)
064	(Eating the stew while it's hot is more important? Seriously?)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
065	Insects?! At a time like this?! They're crawling all over the place! So gross!
066	Why are there insects here?! They're not supposed to be aggressive! They're only supposed to attack if they're attacked first!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
067	Shoo, go away! Wh-why are they only coming towards me?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0027
068	Yui is getting surrounded by insects! I have to save her!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
069	Wait, how is you jumping into things going to help?!	VO_alma.alma_event_1013
070	But I can't just leave her to fend for herself!
071	What?!
072	(Can't leave her? But if it means sticking your neck into danger... That's crazy.)	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
073	(It's crazy, but...)
074	(She's serious.)
075	Grrrah, fine!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0004
076	Alma, it's too dangerous! We should call the teacher...
077	Hiyah! You're right, but I jumped in the fray before I realized I was going to!
