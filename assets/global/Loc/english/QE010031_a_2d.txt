001	I never thought I'd end up in the Holy Guard.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
002	Are you dissatisfied? You know, it took quite the effort to get you inducted.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0030
003	Lord Gabirond! N-no, I'm grateful.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
004	Don't lie. Your dissatisfaction is written all over your face.
005	Well, to be honest...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
006	I can't shake off my distrust of the Holy Guard. They boast that they are the justice of the continent...yet they show little sign of ending this world's conflict.
007	This is in spite of the fact that they wield the incredible power of Alchemy. How is that supposed to give me a positive impression?
008	It sounds like you're the one who's blowing smoke. Are you saying that you have the power to change this world?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
009	I'm confident that I do.
010	Hmph. How amusing. By all means, demonstrate this power of yours during this mission.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
011	The Holy Guard and the Blue Flame Guard will initiate a joint attack on the two strongholds of Wratharis.
012	We will head to one of these strongholds—Fort Asard.
013	It's been my intention to demonstrate my power all along. How can I change the world, if I can't even help my beloved siblings!
014	Mark my words! I promise you'll see results from me!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0011
