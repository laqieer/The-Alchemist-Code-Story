001	Foreign magic! It is as swift and powerful as they say. However...
002	Gah—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0012
003	How naive of you to care for our lives! Know that you mock us with that caring!
004	Urk!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
005	Such...power...!
006	What is with their coordinated precision, on top of their individual strength?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
007	It's as if they're using their fellow soldiers as shields—like they're expecting them to be cut down from the very beginning.
008	Yes, that is exactly the way we fight.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0039
009	Are you kidding me?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
010	Bloodshed from crossing swords is natural. To lose your life on the battlefield is honorable. Everything is for that singular victory.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
011	Underestimating our resolve will be your downfall, outsider.
012	Ngh! You all...value life...so little?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
013	This is the end for you. I had interest in the depth of your strength.	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0016
014	But if you are unwilling to wield it in a battle for your survival, then it is the same as not having it. There is no need for me to measure anything.
015	Finish him.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
016	Yes, sir!
017	(Urgh! My body feels heavy... I'm still feeling that blow from earlier.)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
018	(But I cannot fall here! If I die here and now...)
019	My dream of changing the world and securing my friends' safety...
020	Ngh... I can...still...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
021	You're still alive?!
022	It can't end here!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
023	I see your anger.
024	Huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
025	What's this...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
026	Impossible!
027	That was the power of a Cursed Beast.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0027
028	Very good, Nimul.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
029	That is the power we need. That way of drawing power from the other side, just as a Cursed Beast does.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0003
030	Your Alchemy will be the key to reshaping the world once again.
031	Phew... It's gotten pretty late.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
032	Skree?
033	Yeah, you're right. We have to go pick up big brother.
034	He's always waiting for me to come pick him up, right? Eheheh.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
035	Skree.
036	Hm? What's the matter, Luke?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
037	Skree!
038	Ah! Where are you going?!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
039	Luke, you silly goose. What's gotten into you, going down this back alley?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
040	Skree!
041	Oh, there you are! Don't just go off on your own like—	VO_benika.benika_sys_0012
042	Oh.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
043	Huh? Eeek!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0026
044	Y-you startled me. Are you wounded? Did you fail your insect toxin training?
045	Oh, uh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
046	No, I think...I've met you before. Are you a traveler?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
047	I still...
048	If I don't change...
049	The world, everything...
050	For the people...Emmel's smiles...
051	Even if it turns out to be a mistake...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
052	Skree skree!
053	I know that it goes against our laws...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0016
054	But if there's someone in trouble, I have to help them.
055	Luke, carry that side!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
056	Skree!
