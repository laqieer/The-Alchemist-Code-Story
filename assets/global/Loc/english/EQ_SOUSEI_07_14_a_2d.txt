001	Glorious.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
002	Oh, how perplexing, irrational, and selfish humans are.
003	But for them to be this capable...	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0021
004	Now, all that's left is to deal with this corruption.
005	.........
006	Lord Kubera?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
007	This is the Cursed Beast's core. It is the source of the power that can maintain or destroy this region.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0004
008	Wait! The core holds all the region's sin within it!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
009	If you keep touching it, you'll...!
010	Let go of it, now! If you don't, you'll fall to the corruption of this region's sins! Or even worse, you'll—
011	Become a Cursed Beast?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0031
012	Lord Kubera, you're not thinking of—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
013	Traveler... Your power, your fighting style, and the reasoning behind it... All of this was unheard of to us.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
014	But the thing that surprised me the most was your ability to wield the power of a Cursed Beast.
015	You use...Alchemy, was it? It is truly a new technique, capable of changing the world and the meaning of strength.
016	However...
017	I have yet to experience just how strong it is myself.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
018	You would gamble your life just to test Nimul's strength, Lord Kubera?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0021
019	Indeed.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
020	As I have said before, we are willing to sacrifice everything if even one of us can obtain the ultimate power.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
021	.........
022	The seat of ultimate power! An unparalleled dream! The one closest to it...is you, Nimul.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
023	So how can I not test it? Why must I sheathe my blade without a fight?!
024	A duel I have bet my life—bet everything on. Will you not accept, Nimul?
025	I...
026	I've decided to accept all sins. Not just my own, but the ones you bear as well, Lord Kubera.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
027	You have my thanks.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0035
028	Now then, shall we begin to determine which of us should be called a god of war and lord their power over others?!
029	This will be the end of your fruitless struggling!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0008
