001	And now...let us officially commence our annual Valentine's Day event!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0023
002	You mean, walk through the door of the home economics room?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
003	Albea! It's important to set up the right atmosphere when doing something like this!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0014
004	Now then, Noah... I'll teach you my special recipe for chocolate, so listen carefully!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
005	My mechas can grind the cacao beans. They did it last year and it'll be quicker than doing it by hand.	VO_albell.albell_event_1009
006	○▼◎☆!
007	O-oh, that's really helpful. I appreciate it.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
008	We'll go find Emma and keep her company! It's no good to leave just one person out of something.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0001
009	We'll see you later!	VO_raaf.raaf_sys_0007
010	Okay, let's put the pedal to the metal! Making chocolate isn't easy, you know. Noah, your determination and strength will be tested to its limits. Are you ready for the ultimate chocolate challenge?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
011	Yes!!!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
012	Does chocolate-making usually inspire this kind of fervor...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
013	I... I did it.	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
014	Indeed you did! It actually looks pretty good. Simple and sophisticated; no frills attached. As befitting a chocolate made by you, Noah.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
015	Yeah... Just thinking about how to decorate it makes my palms sweat.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
016	Don’t worry about it. It's better to stick to something you're comfortable with. Besides, the taste should more than make up for it. Try some!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
017	I-it's delicious!	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
018	Right? It's my special husband-hooking chocolate recipe! Still, it should work in your favor as well.	VO_eve.eve_chara_1020
019	How about it? Feeling courageous yet?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
020	Yes... I think so.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
021	Wonderful! Then let's get going!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
022	I asked Polin to bring Emma here to the back garden, but...it looks like they haven't arrived yet.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
023	...
024	You'll be okay, Noah. You've really poured yourself into making this chocolate. I'm sure Emma will be able to see that.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
025	Right. Ah. They're here.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
026	Emma!
027	...
028	Emma... I have something to give you.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1047
029	...?! Noah, watch out!!!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0027
