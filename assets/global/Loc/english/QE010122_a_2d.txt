001	Where did Dias gain that cursed power of darkness?
002	Since you wield Alchemy, you should have some idea.
003	Was it from...Ouroboros?!
004	She's a clever one. She uses sweet words to lure us into the darkness.
005	Furthermore, your brother was pursuing power. He may have accepted the invitation with open arms.
006	No! Don't speak about things you know nothing about! Dias is an honorable knight!
007	Heh. Can you call a man who dirties his hand in the darkness an honorable knight?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
008	Dias is willing to pay the price alone in order to change the world!
009	I'm sure he's trying to distance me and everyone else from the darkness.
010	Honestly... You're too pure for your own good. It's unlikely he's motivated by such noble—
011	You don't know anything about him!
012	He's the type of knight who would sacrifice himself to protect others!
013	Why do you believe in him so much?
014	It's not about how much I believe in him; that's the truth. I understand my younger brother better than anyone else!
015	You are a true idiot. Your overwhelming level of idiocy has made me remember idiotic ideals from my past.
016	Huh...?
017	Tsk. The Holy Guard are approaching. Let's go!
