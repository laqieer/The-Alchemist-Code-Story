001	...Bertha’s taking a while.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0030
002	I’m sure she’s fine. Anyway, if anything happens, she’d fire a signal for us!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0031
003	I hope that Sharon girl is okay, too...
004	Oh? Even though she said horrible things to you, you’re still worried about her... You’re so nice, Alaia.	VO_patty.patty_sys_0005
005	Even though I’m a human and you’re a therian, we became friends by playing music together and learning to understand each other.
006	So I feel like I can learn to understand Sharon, too.
007	Hmm...
008	I said that I was angry at her, I never said that I HATED her.	VO_alaia.alaia_sys_0002
009	That means you haven’t given up on understanding her yet...right?
010	Heh... Ahaha! Wow, Alaia! You really get me!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0008
011	I agree with you! “I will create a future in which humans and therians help one another and laugh together.”
012	I want to walk down the path that Nina created... Especially with another therian!
013	Huh?! That sound...!	VO_patty.patty_battle_0019
014	It’s Bertha’s signal!	VO_alaia.alaia_battle_0020
015	Let’s join up with the Royal Knighthood! We have to go save Bertie and Sharon!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0032
