001	I thank you for rescuing us. If you hadn't come, who knows what would've happened to both us and our weapons.
002	I'm sorry to hear about Count Maldini, but I'm sure he would've been pleased to know that some of his troops survived, though, however few.
003	A thousand thanks.
004	General Vlad, this is the power of Alchemy.
005	I'll acknowledge it's strength. However, Alchemy is a power best avoided. A battle where one does not risk their lives...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
006	When has such chivalry changed the world?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0006
007	What?
008	Resolve yourself, General.
009	Whether what we use the Forbidden Art or not...unless we win in the end, nothing will change.
010	Ack! Do you understand what you're saying?!
011	The cause of the war that devastated Wratharis 17 years ago was Alchemy!
012	So, in order to avoid repeating history, you want us to stand against their mighty Alchemy with only our blades?
013	Heheh. That will be quite some act of chivalry, General.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
014	You insolent...!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0013
015	During these 17 years, while you've remained paralyzed by fear, how many people do think have lost their lives?!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0013
016	...!
017	After the Dawn of Wrath, this kingdom came under the rule of Envylia.
018	Over these 17 years, Envylia has governed us with repeated acts of exploitation and repression!
019	No longer able to grow crops in our war-starved land, we can't even sustain ourselves.
020	Yet, we must pay the heavy taxes imposed on us by the nobles of Envylia, causing our livelihood to grow heavier!
021	The streets fill with beggars; our people kill one another to eat; and those who can work continue to abandon our country!
022	Listen, that's the reality of Wratharis! At this rate, if we do nothing, the people of Wratharis will inevitably perish!
023	You...	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0005
024	With our resources and people on the verge of exhaustion, do you think we have the luxury of fighting among ourselves?!
025	We've got to do the most we can with our limited power!
026	...!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0018
027	It's true; the power of the Philosopher's Stones is dangerous. If we don't have enough Alchemia stored, we compensate with our lives.
028	But, if we have the Philosopher's Stones, we can change our determination into power!
029	We are willing to sacrifice our lives!
030	We'll use this determination as fuel to fight!
031	General, please give it some thought.
032	Sabareta has ceaselessly pursued Alchemy for this day,
033	to provide us with enough power to launch a counterattack.
034	I'll say it once again. General, we need your strength.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0005
035	To further strengthen the resolve of all here, I want to revive the Deadly Trio of Wratharis!
036	What? The Deadly Trio?!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0027
037	During the Dawn of Wrath, the Deadly Trio was the beacon of hope for the people of Wratharis.
038	With the power of Alchemy, I want you to resurrect the Deadly Trio and give our people the courage to fight.
039	Impossible! Are you talking about Caesar and Neville?!	VO_vlad.vlad_sys_0002
040	Take the Stone, General Vlad!
041	Now is the time for the world to know the power of Wratharis's Deadly Trio!
042	...!
