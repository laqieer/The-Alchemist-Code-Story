001	This range is extremely rugged and mountainous. Do you really think the enemy troops are transferring the Demon through here?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
002	There is said to be an ancient tunnel in this vicinity.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
003	You are more likely to discover Philosopher's Stones in places that have a connection to ancient Alchemists. It's possible that the Lizard Brigade may target here.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0004
004	True...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0031
005	Even if we don't discover the Demon itself if we find the Lizard Brigade we can have them give up the location of where they are transferring it.
006	Indeed. You seem to be quite invested in all of this, don't you?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
007	Not particularly. I want to quickly deal with this Demon mess and quickly embark on searching for Agatha.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
008	Hm. Right. I promise that we will focus all our efforts on rescuing Agatha.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
009	I will not allow you to suffer the same grief you experienced in your past.
010	Lord Gabirond, I want to ask you how you know about my past?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0018
011	Hmph. As the grand councilor of Envylia, do you think there is anything that I do not know?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
012	Then, do you know my blood type?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0004
013	Hmph. Type Qe.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
014	Correct. What about my likes?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
015	Agatha and Logi, of course.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
016	Correct again! Wow... Guess you do know everything.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0046
017	Of course. The Internet tells all.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0009
018	The Internet? What other secrets does it hold?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
019	You... Might not want to know.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
020	What? Why?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
021	There are some harsh things written about you there.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0020
022	What?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0026
023	For example, Headstrong Dias has become a common term, used to refer to those who refuse to listen to others.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
024	What?! That's not fair! I have a lot going on in my life!
038	That's it! I am going to cut you down where you stand!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
025	That right there! That extreme and hasty nature is what gets you criticized online.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0028
026	Criticized? For what?! I'm cutting you down!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0012
027	Like I said, you're being hasty! You should think before you act!
028	Think first, then cut?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
029	No! No cutting people down!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0014
030	Think, then stab!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
031	No stabbing either! Your hunger for power is also hurting your popularity.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0013
032	I... I see. How can I get people to like me again?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
033	We might have to get the developers to fix this.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
034	Do you seek popularity?
035	I want popularity... Popularity to change this sorrowful world!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
036	Hmph. So his conviction remains true, despite having lost his composure after partaking of the mushrooms.
037	If his desire can be sustained, then perhaps...
