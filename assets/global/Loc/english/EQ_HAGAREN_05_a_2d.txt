001	Great job, Vivi! You secured us a really solid hideout!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0023
002	I had a bunch of these places prepared in my past life. Most of them are too old to use anymore, but there are still some good ones here and there.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0007
003	Good thing, too! I can gather a lot of information this way. For example, it looks like the Holy Order is up to something fishy in Wratharis, too.
004	Take a peek out the window. See that hill over there? There's a massive tower being built on top of it.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0002
005	That tower is a vital part of the Continental Circle...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
006	Hm? Continental Circle? I've never heard of that one before.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0005
007	It's a transmutation circle the size of a continent, created for the purpose of transmuting and opening the Dimensional Gate.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
008	Those towering structures are being built in every region of Babel. Linking them together will form the base of the Circle.
009	Thank you. It's nice not to have to scrounge for information for once...but is it alright for you to tell us so much?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0044
010	I don't believe they will mind. This is but a single moment in the Holy Order's history, and I am only explaining my role in that history as the Blessed One.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
011	You're talking about things that go over my head again. What does your role have to do with any of this?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
012	The soul of the Blessed One was created to become a component of the Continental Circle. My life shall fuel its activation.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
013	Wait... What did you say?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0042
014	You were...what? Born to be a part of the Continental Circle? Your...life? What?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
015	Those are the facts. Why are you so agitated? What is there to be upset about?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
016	What do you expect us to do? Be happy for you? Not likely! Spill it! I want the details!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
017	I don't understand why you're angry.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
018	The Blessed One's role is to provide the required energy for the Circle.
019	In order for me to do so, my powers were enhanced at birth, and then I was trained to draw out that full potential.
020	Didn't you tell me to be more enthusiastic about my lofty position? What...have I done wrong?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0031
021	Toritoh... I've traveled this entire continent, and I've never heard of anyone using a human being like that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0021
022	Um... Miss Toritoh...I know that you grew up sheltered, but...something within you must know that there's something wrong with that.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
023	You were born and raised to be sacrificed, and you've never questioned it? I suppose you must have been brainwashed into accepting it.
024	But that should make you angry, too! Don't you feel angry?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0029
025	I...don't know. Is this something one should be angry about?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
026	The Holy Order has always had its own way of doing things, but I'm shocked to know they would sink quite this low.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0013
027	Their own way of...? Who cares about that?! I'm not gonna let them get away with this!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
028	How could they use a person's soul like that?! How could they raise a human being for such a purpose?!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
029	B-but the Holy Order is under the Magna Code. Everything we do is to serve the common good. I don't mind sacrificing my life for such a cause.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0031
030	You should mind! I certainly do! Your rearing as a paladin has blinded you, General!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
031	...!
032	I know what I'm going to do. I'm putting an end to their plans!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
033	The quickest way to do that would be to destroy that building in front of you. There's just one problem.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0031
034	There's a barrier around it that repels anyone born outside of Wratharis.
035	It's connected to the Dimensional Gate, right? It must be there to affirm a person's birthplace, their home world, and their soul bearings.
036	That means none of us can get near it, but have no fear; I've got a lot of pals from Wratharis!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
037	I'll go pick them up on my bike! They might need a little convincing, though. They're a bit rough around the edges.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
