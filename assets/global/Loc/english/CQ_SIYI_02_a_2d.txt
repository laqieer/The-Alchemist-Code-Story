001	Har har!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0009
002	H-Holy cow! He's just tearing through monsters. He has such amazing strength...	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0022
003	(I think I've heard of Gormalas before... Shenmei mentioned he's the Black Keels'...)
004	(What should I do? If he knows I'm a friend of Shenmei's...)
005	If you value your life, hunker down there and put your hands over your head.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
006	Hurry or you're dead. Your head will be rolling along the ground.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0008
007	Geh, I take what I want from whoever I want. I'll take it from you before you take it from me. That's the way of pirates!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0011
008	...
009	Heh... You wanna die here? ...Hey! What are you doing in a place like this?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0031
010	Eep...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0027
011	...
012	Oops...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
013	You're so pale and small... Are you frail, as well?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
014	Uh...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
015	Blegh... I thought you'd be a fine replacement for the treasure, but such a brittle child... You're of no value.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0016
016	...
017	(My body isn't weak anymore... My medicine has cured my seizures, but...)	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0014
018	Captain, don't be so blunt! You'll make the kid cry.
019	You think so? You got something you wanna say?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
020	N-No! That's not what I meant!
021	I'm so sick of being lost in this dank cave. All this walking is infuriating!
022	We've been wandering around this bizarre terrain. And that map you brought is useless! No one could make sense of it!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0030
023	There was never any hope of bringing back this phantom treasure! We were tricked by false dreams!
024	Ah, hell...!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_battle_0025
025	...Ah!	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0019
026	Eh? What's that you got? Hand it over.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0006
027	What?! That's no good, girl.
028	Ah, but...!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
029	Eh? This is just some map. It's barely even legible. ...Wait! Is this...?
030	W-Well...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
031	Hey, is this map just something you drew?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
032	Oh, y-yes...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0006
033	It actually looks pretty good.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0024
034	Oh...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
035	I never forget a path I've walked, so I can say for certain this is a good and accurate map.
036	Oh, Miss, that's amazing! If the captain says so!
037	Oh, um, w-well...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
038	(Is he... praising me?)	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0020
039	But what is this bit here?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0031
040	Well, that's...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0039
041	You wouldn't need a map like this unless you were looking for the treasure... Are you doing the same as us?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0003
042	I, uh...
043	A little weakling like you wouldn't happen to be a pirate, right?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0008
044	...
045	(You're wrong. I'm not some weak kid. I'm a pirate. And it's as a pirate I've explored this cave...)	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
046	(That's what I want to say, but... I'm too scared to say it.)
047	(I'm sure Shenmei would be able to stand up to him, and Liu Shen would...)
048	(I guess I'm not strong enough to be a pirate like you two.)
049	...
050	Well, I don't care who or what you are...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
051	I'm taking this map.
052	What?!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
053	A little fledgling like you wouldn't have much use for a map like this, but I do.
054	Pl-Please... That's my...
055	It's mine now. For this map, I'll kindly ignore you going away.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
056	B-But...
057	That's very kind for the captain. You should be glad you could give him the map.
058	Don't say anything rude, and get out of here before you offend the captain.
059	But that map...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0014
060	(That map... I made it to share in the adventure with everyone else.)
061	Remember, this is the way of the world, kid. The weak get robbed.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0038
062	Freedom is the right of the strong. The weak can't do what they want.
063	...!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0043
064	Can't do what they want...
065	That's not true!
066	Su Yi can go wherever she wants! She makes brilliant maps!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
067	If she's ill, then she can get well! I'll be sure to bring her the medicine she needs!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
068	And when she's well, we'll go on real adventures! She'll be a fearless pirate forging her own legendary stories!
069	With Su Yi's maps, we can go anywhere.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
070	...!
071	(Shenmei always praised my maps, and said I could go wherever I wanted.)
072	(She promised me that with my maps we could go on adventures anywhere together.)
073	(When my illness immobilized me, and I drew a map from what I could read about, Liu Shen praised me.)
074	(That made me so happy, so I studied and worked on my map more and more. And now, it's being stolen from me...)
075	Remember this. Weak little kids getting taken from is the way of the world.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0038
076	Freedom is the special right of the strong. The weak don't get to do what they want.
077	(The weak can't do what they want...)
078	(I can't...take this anymore!)
079	W-Wait!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0002
080	What do you want?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
081	G-Give me back that map! I'm not giving it to you!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0015
082	I made that map especially for my family, the crew of the Xiao Shenmei, so you can't have it!
083	Xiao Shenmei?!
084	You're friends with that cheeky spitfire?! You're a pirate?!
085	Hmph. I can tell you're like that impertinent little brat enough to be from her crew, but...	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0011
086	Do you know what it means to say to me that you're a pirate like I am?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0002
087	...!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0027
088	(He's pretty scary, but...)
089	I'm not just some pathetic kid. I'm going to go on all sorts of adventures to all sorts of places with everyone!
090	I can go wherever and do whatever I want. So be quiet and give me my map! I won't accept anything else!
