002	Ack! Where is the Demon headed?!
003	It has nothing to do with you! Don't interfere!
004	I swore with Dias that we would create a warm and peaceful world for Agatha!
005	That monster is the incarnated destruction of that idea! I will defeat it at any cost!
006	That Demon is the people of Wrath's last hope. I will not let you touch it!
007	I need to rescue Agatha as soon as possible. I don't have time for this!
008	Sabareta, if you stand in my way, I'll have to defeat you!
009	What nonsense! Descendant of sinful Envylia...let the flames of Wrath burn you!
