003	Agh! This is the being who destroyed ancient Babel! It can't be defeated!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_battle_0020
004	No... We still have a chance.
005	Dad! What chance do we have?!
006	If we combine all of our strength, there is a chance we can win.
007	!!!
008	Do you mean you expect us to fight together with you?!
009	Yes.
010	Otherwise, there is no other way out of this predicament.
011	Ack! Never! We will never fight on the same side as you!
012	Sabareta, as the leader of the citizens of Wratharis, I ask you this.
013	Do you wish for your obsession with revenge to drive your people to ruin?
014	Don't you wish for the citizens of Wratharis to have a peaceful future?
015	...!
016	Even if our past is filled with hate for each other, the future we hope for is the same!
017	Please, Sabareta...for the future of both our kingdoms...for the peace that we all desire!
018	Please! Lend us your power!
019	Sabareta...
020	Zeke bows deeply towards Sabareta and continues to speak.
021	I, too, ask this of you...please...fight together with us!

026	Huh?

028	We will temporarily fight alongside the Blue Flame Guard! Destruction of the Demon is of the highest priority—we must take it down!
029	Sabareta! Thank you!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
030	Make no mistake! This is just to destroy that malformed Demon—that is all!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
