001	N-no..	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
002	Mother! Father!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1007
003	Please, don't go! Please... Someone!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_2007
004	?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_battle_0019
005	Ah, you're awake.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0003
006	I don't recognize this place... Where am I?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
007	This is my village. You collapsed on your way here. You don't remember?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
008	Um... I was... I remember searching for water like usual...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
009	Like usual...? No, wait. I was walking in the desert with Kamui, and then...
010	Urk... My head...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_favorite_0001
011	Are you all right? Please, calm down. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
012	Y-yes, ma'am.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
013	Can you tell me your name?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
014	My name i-is...Hisham.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
015	I am Malta. I'm an old friend of Kamui's.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
016	Um... I'm... Am I...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
017	I-I'm sorry. I can't seem to focus.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0036
018	I see... Just rest, then. You can answer my questions when you're feeling a bit better.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
019	How is the boy?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
020	He's sleeping. I think the heat really got to him. He seemed very disoriented.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
021	I also think that perhaps it triggered a painful memory.
022	Hm...	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
023	Chief, allow me to take the boy under my wing.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
024	Ah... That is a difficult request to grant, seeing as we are a hidden village. We cannot simply let new people in.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
025	That boy, Hisham... He has no place to call home, no one to call family.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
026	He is only a child. A child deserves to feel safe, to know that someone is looking out for them.
027	For a while now, that someone has been me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
028	Please. I do not expect the rest of the village to be responsible for the boy. Just allow me to care for him until the war is over.
029	Hmm.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
030	I don't see this as being a problem.
031	Happily, this year, our defense force for the great tree, Sephiron, is particularly strong. We have more than enough people to harvest the fields and maintain our herds, as well.
032	Even if we factor in what we will add into our reserves for next year, we have more than enough to care for one youngster.
033	Father, please. That boy, he was having the most terrible nightmare. After seeing that, I cannot imagine throwing him back out into the desert.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
034	I see. Well, who am I to deny the leader of our warriors and the druidic priestess of our village?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
035	Not to mention your beloved daughter!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
036	Malta... I am trying to avoid accusations of favoritism as Chief!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0027
037	Ahem.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0047
038	Kamui. Your request has been granted. The boy is in your care now.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
039	However, you must have already realized. That child holds a great amount of Alchemia within himself.
040	Keep him away from the deepest parts of the village, for his own safety.
041	Understood. Thank you, Chief.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
042	Nn...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1002
043	Urgh?! I overslept! The sun is already that high in the sky?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_favorite_0004
044	Ah, you have finally awakened, I see. I am sorry to say that breakfast is long past now.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
045	Aw, man... You couldn't have woken me up?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_battle_0025
046	Today is your seventh day in this village. I believe it is time for you to understand what it means to be a part of this village.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
047	There are only so many minutes in a day, but a mountain of tasks to address, including caring for the fields and the livestock.
048	Right...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0016
049	I'm coming in! Ah, Hisham. Overslept again?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
050	Mister Isidore?! You can't just go barging into people's homes!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_favorite_0007
051	Yes, yes... Wait. Is that how you plan to address me? Mister?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0010
052	You know I'm the same age as Kamui, right? Come on, at least give me an "Uncle Isidore" or a "Big Bro" or something.
053	I don't know... I'm not really feeling it. Kamui is Kamui, and you're...you.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0012
054	You know I'm kind of important, right? I'm the commander of our village's warriors and everything.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0016
055	And what does our almighty commander need of us before we've even had breakfast?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
056	What? You haven't eaten? Here.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0005
057	Wow! Is this fruit?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
058	It's good, right? I got this straight from the foot of the great tree, Sephiron! Cream of the crop!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
059	This, right here, is the most delicious thing you will ever taste in all of Gluttony Foss!
060	It's so sweet and refreshing! This is making me reevaluate you completely as a person, Mister!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
061	How was that? Still hungry? En garde!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_1011
062	What?! What kind of trick is this?! What kind of person just attacks a kid?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
063	Tsk, tsk, Hisham. You should know that everything in this world comes with a price.	VO_ishido.ishido_favorite_0002
064	It's time for your training to begin! I'll make a warrior out of you yet!
065	Ugh... Mister, you're a real piece of work...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
066	Come on now, give me some credit. I'm not gonna just cut down a kid.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0030
067	Really...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
068	Hm? What have I done to cause such doubt?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0006
069	Ah, you're thinking of the time I accidentally sent you flying... Or wait, that other time when...?
070	I'm thinking of all of it! All of it!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
071	Ahem. So, what exactly is it you need from us? You're usually training with the other warriors at this time, no?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
072	Oh, right!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0005
073	There are more beasts that are drawn to the nectar of the great Sephiron this year than usual, so we need to take action a little earlier than expected.
074	As a result, I'm here to make a humble request of help from one of my oldest, bestest friends.
075	I am no warrior.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
076	However, you are one of the few Spiritbonders in the village, at the same level as Malta or Iakov.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
077	Think of it as helping a friend! With your strength, we could take care of this in no time.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0041
078	Isidore, you... Fine. Hisham, you stay here. I will be heading out for a bit.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
079	Got it! Um, hey, if you're going out, can I borrow another one of your books?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_favorite_0008
080	As you wish. Now, Isidore, tell me where we are headed.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
081	Come along and I'll show you.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
082	Kamui's got a lot on his plate, huh... Well, at least I've got these books to keep me company!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
083	Hm, I think I've read "Ecology of the Desert" already. I haven't finished "Following the Water" yet, though...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
084	Grrrrrrr...
085	You were right, there are quite a number of beasts here. Not just the usual ones, either.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
086	The unrest of this civil war shows its effects even here...
087	Indeed. This bunch must have come here as a result of all the refugees fleeing from the South.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
088	I heard that another village in the South was burned down recently.
089	Yes... I saw it with my own eyes.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
090	I see...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
091	I have heard that King Narol is a sensible man, but not all of his advisors agree. Vigorously so. Almost treasonously.
092	Right, General Ceclidis... I have met the man before. He has cruel eyes.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
093	The Liberation Army is doing its best, but it seems they are being pressed by the sheer number of soldiers to fight against.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
094	It is truly a shame. However, we must focus on the task at hand.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
095	I feel a bit sorry for these creatures, but it is our duty to keep them from causing any more disorder than they have.
096	Yep. The blessings of Sephiron must be protected from these creatures of the night!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0005
