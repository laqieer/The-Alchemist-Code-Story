001	Whoa!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0024
002	Roast fish, venison steak, vegetable soup! This is a feast!
003	I didn't know you could cook, Corvus!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
004	It's not a particularly difficult skill. I learned the basics in order to impersonate a chef and infiltrate a noble household on an assassination job.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
005	Wait a minute... Assassin cooking skills?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0005
006	A-are you trying to poison us?!
007	Of course not.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
008	I dunno... How can we trust you?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
009	Enough fooling around. Come on, eat up.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
010	Don't mind if I do! Umgf!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
011	Mmm!
012	Gimme some!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
013	Mm-mmm!
014	I can't believe it! This is delicious, Corvus!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
015	Umgf... Mmff... Umff... Umgf! So good! Like, crazy good!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0046
016	Good. I'm glad it's to your liking.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0007
017	Hm?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
018	...
019	What's the matter, Spica? Lost your appetite again?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
020	No, I just... I knew Letitia was a better cook than me, but I didn't expect to be outdone by you, too, Corvus.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
021	Well, I... erm...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
022	(Tell me, my darkness… should I be honest with her?!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
023	But you didn't cook anything—you just burnt it to a crisp!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
024	Ila!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
025	Ngh...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
026	It's only because we lived off of nothing but fruits and berries in the forest!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
027	On the rare occasion we'd go into town to buy bread—but that was it!
028	I've never seen Spica cook anything before today!
029	Really? That was your first attempt, then?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
030	Y-yes. I thought I just needed to heat things up.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
031	And you saw it as a chance to beat me... I see.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
032	Why don't you just get Corvus to teach you how to cook, then?
033	Huh?!
034	Ila! I'm supposed to be teaching you the art of combat, not how to cook!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
035	C'mon, Corvus! Why not?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
036	If Letitia ever goes away again, you'll be on cooking duty every single night at this rate! Is that what you want?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
037	Nrgh... Every single night? Gods, no.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
038	That's what I thought!
039	It's in your best interest to teach us all how to cook, so we can take turns making dinner!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
040	I suppose you have a— Wait a minute!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
041	All of you?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
042	Yup! I want to learn how to cook, too! Don't you, Ila?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
043	Well, I do like Letitia's cooking—and Corvus's, too...
044	But I really don't like eating food cooked by other people.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
045	So... yeah! I wanna be able to cook for myself!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0011
046	But—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
047	Then it's settled! We'll be working together on this now, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0008
048	Um... R-right!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
049	Thank you, Corvus! I'll do my best to learn from you!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
050	Hmph...
051	(How did it come to this, my darkness?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
052	It's been quite a while since I last saw this castle.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
053	I've put you through a lot, haven't I?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
054	You were laying the groundwork for me in Wratharis the entire time I was in the Holy Guard.
055	Oh? Is that your way of saying you appreciate my hard work? Hee hee. I'm flattered.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
056	But I have never once considered anything I've done for you to be an effort of any kind.
057	I merely waited patiently for you to come to me as a knight of Wratharis.
058	I remember your appearance on the battlefield like it was yesterday.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
059	The way your sword gleamed in the sunlight as you struck down countless Envylian soldiers in the blink of an eye...
060	The way you charged onto the battlefield like a proud stallion, your hair a fluttering mane of silver...
061	It was even more incredible than I had imagined.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
062	That's in the past now. The Wratharis knights were just a stepping stone on our path to greatness. We must keep our eyes on the future, Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
063	True. It's most unlike us to reminisce like this.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
064	I expect we have our destination to blame for this sudden nostalgia.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
065	Haha... Probably.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
066	It would seem even I have developed a sense of longing for my homeland.
067	I suppose this is what happens when you have companions.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
068	Hee hee. We've both lived very long lives; I think it's only natural to allow yourself such indulgences from time to time.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
069	Indulgences? Hmph. Perhaps.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
070	Shall we proceed, my sister?
071	Yes, Zahar. Let's.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
072	So, these are the dishes you prepared?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
073	Yup! I made the vegetable salad!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
074	I did the fish.
075	I roasted the meat.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
076	I see... Well, I'm afraid you've all failed.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
077	What?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
078	Why?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
079	You only cut up vegetables, Silma. That's not cooking—nor is carving up a raw fish, Ila.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
080	The dishes you've prepared might be food… but they're not meals.
081	What about mine?	VO_spica.spica_chara_1003
082	You overcooked it. This isn't roast meat—it's a burnt lump of flesh.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
083	Ugh! This is way too difficult!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
084	I don't wanna do this anymore!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
085	You're giving up already?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
086	I-I'm not giving up! Let me try again!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
087	Very well... Go on, then.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
088	Excuse me... sir?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
089	What is it?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
090	I'm not sure our stores can withstand another attempt.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
091	Hmph. In that case, I'm afraid your next attempt will have to wait, Spica.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
092	Understood.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
093	Well, you three… Thanks to your cooking practice, we're running low on ingredients. What am I going to cook tonight?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
094	(How did they manage to use up so many ingredients, and yet only produce raw fish, vegetables, and meat?)
095	Sir! Sir!
096	What is it now?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
097	The group who went into the forest to go hunting has been gravely injured!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
098	What?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
099	They said they were attacked by a mythical beast!
100	Oh no!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
101	What?! That thing's still hanging around?!
102	Spica, Silma, Ila—you know what this means, right?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
103	Yep!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
104	You can count on us!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
105	Let's go, Corvus!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
106	We have to take down the beast.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
107	Feel anything yet?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
108	No... Nothing yet.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0031
109	Yeah... It's kinda scary. I can't sense anything. Like, anything at all.
110	Hey...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
111	Yes, Ila?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
112	I can't sense anything... but I can smell something.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
113	You can?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
114	Yeah... Blood.
115	B-blood?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
116	Now that you mention it... It's a bit faint, but I can smell it, too!
117	It's coming from over there!
118	Grrrrr... Graargh! Hrrrghh!	VO_MwolfBig.MwolfBig_battle_0020
119	Ngh!
120	Urgh...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0021
121	Is that a paladin it's eating?
122	But why would a paladin be here?
123	I think I know why.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
124	The basement we raided… They were conducting experiments on animals using Alchemia.
125	This creature probably escaped from there. It could've been a normal animal that got turned into a beast.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
126	No!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
127	It's just a theory, and I've got no way to test it—but as for that paladin...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
128	Do you think they followed the beast here and tried to recapture it, but ended up getting overwhelmed?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
129	I think it's a possibility.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
130	Hah! Serves 'em right for experimenting on animals, the cowards!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
131	Well, we can't just let it run around the forest.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
132	It must have suffered so much...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
133	Spica?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
134	I'm sure it did. Being experimented on must have been... horrible.
135	Oh, Spica...
136	Corvus, this creature is suffering. Let me—	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
137	Let me save it.
138	If that's what you want... you know what you need to do.
139	Yes... Let's go.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
140	Right.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
