001	Oh, dear...
002	This is the end, you old snake.	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
003	Are you not a serpent yourself?
004	I've found a new nest to roost in.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
005	Ghh...	VO_chahele.chahele_battle_0019
006	I had a feeling this wouldn't be enough of a test for you all. So now, only one option remains...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
007	It's time to wake up again, Lucifer! Provide some entertainment for me before my meal, won't you?
008	This is it...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
009	(I have to stay calm. I've watched Nimul fight alongside his friends so many times... I can do this. I know I can!)
010	I'll end this right here and now! I won't let another soul get hurt!
011	Rrraaaaaaah!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0021
012	Ulgh! Of course it'd be stronger than Satna!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
013	...	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
014	Gear of Judgment, activate!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_battle_0004
015	This is to be the final curtain, dear friends.
016	No, it's not! It's the beginning of a new era!
017	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0007
018	Are you using up your last dregs of Matter for this? That won't be enough to achieve anything, you know!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
019	By this new oath shall I gain true worth as a Vessel...
020	These undulations of magil... Are you trying to use the Cursed Beast cores within you?!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0025
021	I bear a wish: for peaceful days to slip away with the sunset glow dappling through emerald leaves, as the gentle wind lulls the body into quiet slumber...
022	Even should this flesh be rent, my wish shall live on, that a better tomorrow await thee!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0032
023	So this is the crystallization of your resolve, is it? I am compelled by my mission to test it; let us see just how well it holds up!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
