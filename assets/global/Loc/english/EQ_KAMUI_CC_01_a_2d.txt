001	It's been some time since that man dragged Ceclidis through the Door of Truth.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0016
002	We shouldn't waste any more time. There's no point in waiting.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0002
003	No, Kamui will come back. I'm sure...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
004	Right...
005	Even though the Jam problem is gone, the next King of Gluttony and the Crown's Guard are here.
006	We don't want anything to happen to them for the sake of the peace of this land.
007	We Paladin will go to defend them...and leave this place to you, Logi.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
008	Thank you, Dias.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
009	...
010	Logi...
011	Wait, the wind has turned...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
012	Agh!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
013	What?! Sacred Stones?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
014	Kamui!
015	N-ngah...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
016	Logi...?	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
017	That's right! Kamui, welcome back—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
018	Calm down, Logi. From the looks of him, he's exhausted. Let him rest in a safe place for now.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
019	Uh, yeah. You're right.
020	I-I'll go get everyone!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_chara_1006
021	Am I...alive?
022	I can't even believe you... Rest, Kamui.
023	No one here will begrudge you for it.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
024	Good to know...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
025	Is it true that Kamui is back?!
026	Protector, thank goodness you are safe!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0007
027	This is...
028	Is this a dream?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0025
029	Somebody's fighting, but I've never seen this place before...
030	...!
031	Urk! I don't have time to be thinking about that!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
032	But this much I do understand. That corruption...
033	...is something that we, the people of Sephira, must purify!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
034	Then there's only one thing for me to do.
035	"I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0032
