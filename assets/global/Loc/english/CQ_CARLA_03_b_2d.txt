001	Oof!
002	Phew…looks like we won! Thanks, Miss Carla.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
003	"Looks like?" You were pretty impressive back there!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0011
004	You think so? I only kicked half as much butt as you…	VO_alba.alba_sys_0011
005	Still, you pick up a thing or two when you've worked as long as I have.
006	You don't say?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
007	Ugh….N-No way! We hired those guys from the mercenary guild!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
008	Damn… They proved totally useless when we needed them the most.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0012
009	You'll regret this! The guild gives us access to very powerful people.
010	Relying on connections to clean up your failures? You people are truly pathetic.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0013
011	Sh-Shut up!
012	What's going on here?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
013	!
014	Perfect timing, sir! You see, these hooligans…
015	Well, if it isn't Aruba! I've been expecting you. Did you bring the tea I sent for?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0024
016	Of course! A merchant's word is his honor. Here you are.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
017	That fragrance is unmistakable! I could drink it up this very instant!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
018	I can't thank you enough. Whenever I entertain guests, they rave about this tea!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0033
019	That's why I pulled some strings to get you membership into the guild.
020	!
021	Wha-! You can't be serious! An outsider like him?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
022	Of course. It's all been settled. I say it's time we breathe some new life into our local economy.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
023	Tch…	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0016
024	Looks like he was interested in your wares, too.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
025	I'm grateful for your reliable service, Aruba. The desert market is better off now thanks to you.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0008
026	I'm...shocked! Who'd have thought things would turn out so well!
027	It was a long road, but I finally delivered the tea. And now I'm a guild member!
028	Normally outsiders aren't allowed to join, but my persistence paid off.	VO_alba.alba_sys_0007
029	That's why I came here, even though I didn't make much profit.
030	I was "planting a seed!" First, I had to show them how amazing my wares are!	VO_alba.alba_sys_0008
031	And now you can enjoy the fruits of your labor, huh?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0039
032	For anybody else, it would be a daunting task, but that's what makes you a good merchant.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0011
033	Both of you have a knack for stick-to-itiveness. I admire that.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
034	Once you realize these sands are alive, you begin to wonder, "Isn't there more I can do?"
035	If we try, we can bring back greenery to this land so that it will become fertile again.
036	That's my plan, anyhow. See? The sand is already starting to feel different, isn't it?
037	It's not about immediate gains for you two. It's about the long haul... How inspiring!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
038	That's it! I've made up my mind! I'm going to follow your lead and start something of my own.	VO_karla.karla_chara_1001
039	Oh? Wonderful! And what might that be?	VO_alba.alba_sys_0004
040	Well, being with you made me realize I can't just focus on the here and now.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
041	I'll never grow that way and might wind up like those jerks from before.
042	I may not know much, but if I keep the desert safe, I know it will be a more welcoming place.
043	And merchants like you will be able to travel freely!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
044	Unlike you and Hawk, I may not know exactly which "seed" to sow…	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
045	But I won't give up until I find what works best for me!
046	You better not give up either, kid! I'm looking forward to seeing your face a lot more around here!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0008
