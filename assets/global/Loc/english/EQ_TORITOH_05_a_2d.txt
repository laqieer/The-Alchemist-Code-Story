001	What amazing power! But...I've heard of Burning Seal before.
002	It's the secret art passed down only to captains of the Holy Guard.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0037
003	It can only be used at the final moment of life. It's a technique that allows one to weaponize their remaining life energy. With this...I can win.
004	You would go that far?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0019
005	Of course I would! She is the one thing I can't lose.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
006	Everything I do now is to save Kanon!
007	This power is too strong! Is this the true power of a captain of the Holy Guard?!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0046
008	But...!
009	Ggh! Ahhh!!!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_battle_0019
010	Is this still not enough...? But I want to save her, no matter what...and I want to see her, no matter what.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
011	Just a bit more! Just... But I...
012	Can I really not save my only friend?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0042
013	Is this... Is this my fate?
014	...
015	No! I won't accept that!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0019
016	I'd bet my life, but...it's still not enough.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0018
017	So this is how everything ends? Huh...
018	Sorry for dragging you into this, Toritoh.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
019	It was just as you said. I was too reckless.
020	It looks like this is the end.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0042
021	Give in to me.
022	(I was right.)	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
023	(Ah...I wanted to see her again, at least for a moment.)
024	You're too used to fighting alone.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
025	Toritoh...!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0027
026	Huzzaaaaaahh!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0032
027	Toritoh!
028	You're the one who asked for my power!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
029	Your passion, your willingness to risk your life for her...that's enough reason for me to fight!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
030	You have moved me, to tell you the honest truth!
031	I have someone who is important to me, too, and if we were in the same situation, I'm sure I'd do the same as you are now.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
032	If you bet your life on something, and you borrow my power to do it, then the least I can do is bet the same.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0003
033	That said, I've already died and become a phantom, so I have no life to offer, but...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
034	I can still bet my existence itself!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0010
035	Toritoh! That form—!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0042
036	I heard a phantom's form depends on the current state of their soul.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
037	To think, I'm finally taking on the form that embodies my being... How naive I must've been.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
038	This new form is proof of the brilliance of my soul, and...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0003
039	Of my determination not to give up!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0032
040	Right!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0037
041	I'm always worrying someone. I always thought I was alone, but...
042	I took that outstretched hand. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have made it this far.
043	I can see it, now... Even now... I'm not alone.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
044	My enemy may be a Sacred Stone, but I will not lose!
045	Lend me everything you've got, Toritoh!
046	It's all yours, Lakina!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
