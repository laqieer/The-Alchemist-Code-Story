001	Oaaaaaaaaaghh!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0032
002	A bit sloppy, but you've got the spirit, I'll give you that much.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
003	Like I said... Nobody gets to kill you but me. I won't surrender. Not to you, and not to Mammon.
004	I guess you could say, I'm through being a kitten. I've grown into a lion.
005	Oho, the kitty's got claws after all. You could call that its own sort of greed. But if you really are a lion...	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0037
006	Well, perhaps I should be prepared to find your fangs at my throat.
007	Now that you've taken off that boorish mask of yours, I'll be waiting for the day you strike.
008	As if I'd even have the chance. You'll never let me catch up to you. Don't even try to pretend you would.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
009	Oh, of course not. But then, you're the one Mammon's sucking dry. My life energy remains largely undisturbed.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
012	That's okay. I'll become just as strong as you and reshape this land into one that doesn't give in to Greed.
011	Intriguing. Then we shall both struggle ever onward, together!
