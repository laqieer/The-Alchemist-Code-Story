001	An assassin hired by Waginau...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
002	Yes. I am connected to Lord Waginau and can wield the power of darkness. It appears we have similarities.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
003	Y-you scum! How could you...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
004	So...you were the wielder of the power of darkness after all!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
005	Yes. I am sorry for hiding it from you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
006	Just so you know, I have no intention of joining them. Don't place us in the same boat.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
007	Hey, please wait! You can't go any further...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
008	...? Why?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
009	Well, I'm not exactly sure why. I just don't want to let you through.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
010	What are you talking about? You've got business with Kanon as well, don't you? If that's so then...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0028
011	I told you, you can't go passed me. I still can't fully comprehend the meaning of her words.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
012	I can't afford to let you get in the way.
013	The meaning of Kanon's words?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
014	Yes. She was going on about being bonded and about feelings...the same kind of nonsense that you two have been going on about.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
015	I'm starting to get interested...in this uncertain thing that she places so much value in.
016	...You!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
017	In any case, I can't let you advance any further. I'm sorry I have to do this to you being that this is the first time we've met, but...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
018	Captain Kudanstein...I'll stop you with all my power.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0010
019	You were hiding...this much dark power?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0017
020	I don't understand what you're talking about, but now isn't the time for you to get involved. Stand back!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0013
021	He disappeared...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
022	I'm behind you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
023	Ack?! ...You're fast!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
024	That's nothing yet.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
025	Agh?! Wh-what...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
026	Just so you know, I'm more accustomed than you are to using the art of darkness. After all, I've been trained since I was little.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
027	...!
028	I'm sorry. I'm ending it here! "Banishment"!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0014
029	Aghh!!! Ackkk...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
030	No way! ...And against Kudan out of all people!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
031	You and I are very similar. But...it's odd...my interest lies elsewhere.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
032	Wh-what...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
033	More than Lord Waginau...I am interested in learning about what the Commander Kanon thinks.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
034	Ack...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
035	You're quite tenacious. Do you still have strength left in you? I won't go easy on you even in the end, you know?	VO_basini.basini_chara_1010
036	...I won't allow it.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0009
037	Huh...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
038	Tsk. I didn't ask for your help...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
039	This man is seeking far greater heights than you are. This isn't the time and place for the likes of you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
040	No...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
041	...Huahhhhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
042	?!
043	Ack! Who...are you?	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
044	Victor?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
045	Little frog! Why...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
046	Right back at you! Why are you...fighting against Kudanstein?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
047	That has nothing to do with you. More importantly...you should be running away.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
048	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
049	This person is obviously on a whole other level than you are. You'll just end up hopping around on the ground like a frog.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
050	Hey, hold on...why are you worrying about me?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
051	...I've started to feel like I want to experience it.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
052	Huh?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
053	I want to experience this thing you guys call a bond.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
054	...!
055	Don't make me have to put in an extra effort.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0020
056	?! Not good!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
057	Ack...! Huzzzaaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
058	Ugh...?!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0024
059	Little frog!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
060	Huff...huff...! You've finally become decent, you idiot!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0018
061	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
062	I'm telling you that passionate feeling you have now is what lies in the center of being human! Come on, let's go!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
063	...! Yes!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
064	What beautiful and mesmerizing friends. That being said, don't allow his actions to sway you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
065	...! Wait! Don't recklessly involve yourself!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
066	Huh...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
067	While we're wasting time here, Kagura...this world...is being placed at risk...! I...won't...let...you...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
068	No! Guard yourself against it!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
069	H-huahh!!!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
070	...Dis...appear!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_1014
071	...!
072	Captain Kudan...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
073	Commander Kanon!
074	Kanon...!
075	Is everyone all right?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
076	...I-I'm sorry...Commander Kanon...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
077	Huh?
078	My mission was to protect you...but you ended up saving me.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0035
079	Basheeny...hehe...it's fine. Try and rest a little.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0007
080	Commander Kanon...
081	Who would've thought you'd be the one to make your way to me. It's been a while, Kanon.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
082	Captain Kudan...
083	Be careful, Kanon! Captain Kudan's power of darkness is even stronger than before!
084	I know...thank you, Seida.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
085	I came here to take Kagura from you. Where is she?
086	I can't allow you to see her, Captain Kudan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0035
087	I see...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0037
088	The destruction of the Mikaboshi will lead to destroying the equilibrium of this world. If it's to save this world, I won't go easy on you!
089	The existence of the Mikaboshi will lead this world to destruction!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
090	As the 11th Lord Commander...if it's to prevent this destruction, I must turn my sword against you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
091	Hurrrahhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
092	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
