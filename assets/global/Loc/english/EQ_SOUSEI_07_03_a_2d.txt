001	Don't you think it's a little cruel to lock me up now that I've come back?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
002	Priestess of Ouroboros... You, who will reveal a new path to us...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
003	Roh Ku is looking for you, for the Mammon subjugation ceremony.
004	Oh my, is he? So that's why you came for me yourself.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0045
005	Even though you are the Master of this Belt—
006	The Avaritia Belt's symbol of armament and power. Kubera.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
007	Your useless self-effacement and pointless humility are unnecessary.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
008	We only need strive for strength. The path to true power is the sole purpose for the people of Avaritia.
009	You told me you can impart that knowledge to me. Can you not, "Temptation Snake"?	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
010	That's not my name.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
011	But I did make a promise, so I'll teach you.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
012	You want a way to steal the weapon born from the twisting of truth of the world, the power of a dragon.
013	...?!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
014	Where...am I?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
015	(The equipment in this room, this distinctive smell... It couldn't be!
016	Yna? How long are you going to sleep in?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
017	Ah!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
018	You're finally awake! Even if you stayed up late last night, you can't sleep in till noon!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0012
019	Benika!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
020	Whoa! What's with you, big brother?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0025
021	Did you have a nightmare? You're such a scaredy cat!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
022	You may be right.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
023	Huh? Are you really okay? You're acting strange...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
024	You usually say "There is no weaker human in this Belt, Benika."
025	That was... Those were just jokes.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
026	I know. You don't care about how strong someone is, anyway.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
027	Plus, I am weak!
028	That's not something to be proud of.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
029	Eheheh...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
030	Don't overdo it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
031	I know, I know. But the pain from the corruption isn't so strong today, so I'm fine.
032	.........
033	(This is definitely the Avaritia Belt. And this form is...my younger self?)	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
034	(Which means, I was blown into the past...and merged with my former self?)
035	(I don't understand. If I were Nimul and had this amount of information, I would have thought of some sort of hypothesis.)	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
036	Luke! Din dins!
037	Skree, skree!
038	Benika, where did that animal come from?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
039	Oh, um... It was a stray. From your master's workshop's...uh...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0005
040	Nameless Isle?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
041	Yeah, that's right! It was hurt, so I treated it and it became attatched to me.
042	Are you even capable of taking care of it properly?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
043	Yes, of course I can!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
044	All right then.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
045	(Benika started caring for that animal, Luke...the month before this Belt was destroyed.)
046	(Which means there's no time. But... But I...)
047	You can't tell me you're not interested. Wouldn't you like to see your sister again, Yna?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
048	...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
049	(What should I do?)
050	Oh yeah. You're going to your master's workshop today, right?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
051	Oh, uh, yes... I am.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
052	Um, do you remember what day it is today?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0001
053	(Right. Today is...)
054	(It should be all right. I have memories of returning home today.)
055	Your birthday, right? Don't worry. I will return home before it gets dark.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
056	Really?!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0009
057	I also have a present for you. Look forward to it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
058	You promise?	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
059	Yes. I'll be back soon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0037
060	Have a good day, big brother!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0037
061	It's just as I remembered.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
062	My hometown...
063	If it isn't Yna. Are you heading to the workshop right now?
064	Indeed. Master called for me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
065	It's rare for that misanthrope Roh Ku to ask for anyone.
066	He must really like you. I'm sure you'll become a great smith one day.
067	That would be nice.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
068	We're all looking forward to the day you'll make us some strong weapons.
069	Right...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
070	It makes sense, since it is the same past I lived through before, but they never change.
071	Avaritia soldiers only train and strive for strength. They are the most covetous of the seven regions.
072	If what lies ahead for them is destruction, I...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
073	What should I do?
074	No answer will come today. But there is still time.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
075	First, I must go to Master's workshop.
076	Groooooooaaah!
077	Damn. Master's workshop is just a few steps away.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
078	(The me of this time was not as adept in battle as I am now. I do not know how well I will do, but...)
079	I have no intention of just lying down and letting you kill me. You will get out of my way, or die!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
