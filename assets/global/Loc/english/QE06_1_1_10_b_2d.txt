001	Sorry to gather you all to this remote base right after the banquet.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
002	Enough with the formalities. Get to the point.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
003	Our scouts report that one of the pure-blood demons, the Hidden Ogre, has been sighted in the castle town.
004	What?!
005	Then the one who attacked the Second Squad disguised as you was—	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0014
006	Most likely the Hidden Ogre.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
007	I see. Any news on its current whereabouts?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
008	Nothing. They have been unable to pick up its trail after losing sight of it.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
009	We should take care of it before it can do serious harm.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
010	Won't it make its way to Castle Aquila Rubrum eventually? We are its ultimate target, are we not?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
011	...
012	Are the demons after something?
013	Seems so. The demons have definitely begun targeting Castle Aquila Rubrum specifically.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0002
014	Any ideas why?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
015	None at all.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
016	Hm. I was really hoping you would.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0022
017	Me particularly? Why is that?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
018	I'm originally from Greed Dike. Considering its history with Wadatsumi, I wouldn't be surprised if people absolutely hated me.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
019	But I cast off the shackles of the past and now dedicate myself to the betterment of Wadatsumi.
020	So I want to see the threat of demons eradicated. I only regret that I can do nothing more than provide support.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
052	I understand how deeply passionate you are about this issue. We absolutely will rid Wadatsumi of demons.
053	That's good to hear. I honestly believe it was the best decision to make you the Blade Fox's commander.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0041
021	Thank you.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0033
022	We the people of Greed Dike have long wished peace for Wadatsumi as well.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0016
023	In fact, it is something I wished for personally. You need not say any thanks.
024	I still would like to thank you.
025	If you find out anything at all, please let me know, for Wadatsumi's sake.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0005
026	Even if the Hidden Ogre is headed towards this castle, we shouldn't just stand around and wait for it.
027	Indeed. We don't know the extent of the damage it could cause on his way here.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0031
028	We should go to where it was sighted tomorrow morning.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
029	That's the plan. Make sure every soldier is on heightened alert.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0038
030	This Hidden Ogre will be a foe unlike any we've ever faced.
031	Demons in castle town?! Could this have something to do with the Hidden Ogre?	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
032	Captain Tanosuke!
033	Let's hurry!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0010
034	Second Squad, follow me! Azami, let's go!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
035	Yes, sir!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
036	You better not die on me.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0001
037	Back at you.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
038	We may have lost the initiative here. Tanosuke, I'm counting on you.	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
039	I've got this.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0038
040	First Squad, accompany Tanosuke on this mission!
041	What about you, Celis?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
042	I'll hold the fort here. I can't let this castle fall while everybody's out after the enemy.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
043	Got it! Captain Tanosuke, wait up!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0038
044	All right, let's go!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
045	No! P-please, it wasn't me!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0028
046	Shut up! I know you're the one that killed my son!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0032
047	I swear, it wasn't me! Believe me!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0018
048	Screw you! There's no way I can— Gah!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
049	If none of you will believe me, I'll... I'll just kill you all!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0029
050	What...is this...?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
051	This is Hell.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0042
