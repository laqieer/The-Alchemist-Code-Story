001	Once we pass the grasslands, there's a village...and beyond that...
002	...Are the gates of Castle Valderik! The promised land where Wratharis and Envylia may be united in peace!
003	Indeed. If things go well, that is.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
004	Lord Gabirond!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
005	I am relieved to see that you are safe, Lady Agatha.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
006	Or...perhaps I should call you the representative of peace from Dominion of Wratharis.
007	Y-you...flatter me.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0047
008	Hmph... And what is the grand councilor of Envylia doing in these war-torn parts?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
009	Sabareta! Don't be rude!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0012
010	Do not worry. Pompous formalities will get in the way of honest communication.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0008
011	Tr-true... Are you not the one leading the Holy Guard?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0004
012	Please, have them stop their attacks on the Lizard Brigade!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
013	I'm sure you've been made aware of this, but we are currently seeking a peace treaty between the Kingdom of Envylia and Old Wratharis!
014	At least stand down until we arrive for peace talks!
015	You appear to have misunderstood something.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
016	We are simply here to confirm what your true motives are. We have no intention of attacking, whatsoever.
017	You wish to propose a peace treaty to King Patrick in order to establish unity between our two kingdoms, am I correct?
018	What? Oh, yes! Our aim is to hold an audience with the King! We want him to hear our proposal!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
019	Hmm. You truly are Captain Zeke's daughter. Quite impressive for one so young.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
020	Very well. I will convey your intentions to the King. Be careful on the road.
021	Y-yes! Thank you!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0004
022	Watch out for that man.
023	...Huh? What are you saying? Even now, he is concerned for our safety?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
024	Honestly, you truly are naive.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0030
025	There's something suspicious about him—something completely separate from both Wratharis and Envylia.
026	I understand why you might be deeply skeptical, but you can't just suspect everyone.
027	Fine.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
028	Still, it's best to avoid all dangers. In order for me to fulfill my promise to Zeke, I want you to remember to pay close attention.
029	Yes, I know. All right, let's go!
