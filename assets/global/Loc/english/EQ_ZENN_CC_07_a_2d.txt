001	Hah! We match.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
002	What're you looking at?! You reek of alcohol! Your breath stinks! Your hair is a menace! Keep your stinky breath, freaky eyes, and ugly mug away from me!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0014
003	Gimme a break. Just makin' an observation.
004	What did you mean? "We match"?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
005	I'm talkin' about the scar on your face. It's a big ol' cross, just like mine.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0005
006	...
007	Hmm... Come to think of it, how'd I get this scar, anyway?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0031
008	Don't ask me. You've had it since I met you.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
009	Well, whatever the reason, it just doesn't seem to want to heal.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
010	So? It's cool. Crosses are rad.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
011	Huh?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
012	I'm sayin' it suits you.
013	I don't get it.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
014	So, what about you, old man? Are you thinking of joining the Templars?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
015	I'm going to help you reach the top of Mystic Tower Veda. However, I don't plan on joining another organization in this lifetime.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
016	You made an enemy of Greed Dike, right? Well, the Shadow Messiah made an enemy of the Holy Order. What's one extra enemy?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
017	It wouldn't hurt me...but it might hurt you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
018	Huh.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
019	Not very friendly, are we?
020	Neun!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
021	I'm just sayin'... The people of Lost Blue don't have a choice in the matter. We've got no money, no food...just our fists. We have to go head to head with the world.	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
022	It's the only way.
023	Since you're here and all...why not do everything you can? What's the point of holding back?
024	I'm sorry.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0035
025	Tch. You're just a coward.	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
026	Hey, uh...gramps?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
027	What?
028	We kill a lot of people, you know.
029	And?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
030	And we do a lot of bad things. We're not afraid to torture our enemies. In fact, we enjoy it.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
031	We're a real pack of monsters.
032	As for our noble mission... Like cheap torches, we only light up the path of the people closest to us. Not to mention, we're the biggest bunch of egotistical maniacs this world has ever seen. We're even pretty shady in our dealings with each other.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
033	All we really do for the citizens of Lost Blue is convince them that they're good people, then let them live the way they want, because we sure can't do anything else for them.
034	I mean, our leader actually said that, right now, the best we can do is focus on making the people here feel welcome.
035	I...see.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0020
036	So... Thanks.
037	Why are you thanking me? I've already made it clear I'm not joining your organization.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
038	It's enough that you're helping out. You're seem crazy strong.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
039	Besides, having a samurai watch our backs is pretty cool.
040	I'm not a real samurai.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
041	Anyway, I was thinking... Since you're helping us out anyway, why not climb the tower with us?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
042	I...
043	Didn't you hear him? He's not a real samurai. What do you want to take a fake samurai along for?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
044	Because!
045	Because, what?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
046	Excuse me. I...have to go.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0035
047	Hah. I've never met someone so gutless. He won't even rise to an insult when it's rubbed in his face.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
048	Apparently he has kids, up in the Slothstein slums.
049	Well, if he doesn't start contributin', he won't have 'em for long. Everyone in this area, above and below, is on the verge of starving to death.
050	He's planning on leaving them behind when he has to go fight in a faraway battle.
051	Wait... I thought he said his kid died.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
052	I remember him spouting some nonsense about reuniting with his lost wife and kid on top of the tower.
053	Well, there's meant to be immense power up there, right? The font of the Alchemy Source.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
054	Even normal Alchemy is powerful enough to turn Alchemia into life, however briefly.
055	Imagine what the Alchemy Source could do! You could probably use it to reshape the world to suit your ideals.
056	You could also use it to bring your loved ones back from the dead, or heal them with a wave of your hand... At least, that's what he believes.
057	On what grounds?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
058	Y'know...sometimes, you just have to believe.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
059	Feh. No point bringing anyone back if the world's gone to hell.
060	That's why we're searching for a solution to all the world's problems, isn't it?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0003
061	Even if we can't fix our mistakes...
062	We don't want to die without having tried.
063	...
064	Found them. So this is where the remnants of the Shadow Messiah have been holing up.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
065	...
066	Kill them. All of them. Don't let a single one of them escape.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
067	...
068	They are to meet the same fate as Ila and Mia.
069	After I disposed of the assassins, I noticed that there was a picture book on the bed. It was a story about a samurai.
070	Come on, Mimi! Sit properly. Be a good girl, now. Look! Mister Cuddles is sitting down!
071	On to the next part! This one's my best story yet!
072	Not just any samurai...me. The book was filled with the stories I had told Ila and Mia of my travels.
073	Isn't this fun?
074	In this place, this hard-won slice of safety and comfort, Ila and Mia would act out these stories with the other orphans.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0007
075	But the samurai was only ever a hero among the pages of that book.
076	A man without honor. A fool. A murderer. A lowly chess piece. Once unshakeable of spirit, I became a deserter of my own heart. Even my blade wept to see me fall.
077	No one is going to forgive you for the wrongs you have committed. Murder, betrayal, treason...
078	Huzzaaaaaaaahhh!
079	(You abandoned them, didn't you?)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
080	(You fought for the revival of the Shadow Messiah without once mentioning their names.)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
081	(That is how you protected them. You imparted your ambitions unto Ila and Mia, then embarked on a journey of rebirth, all so that you could live in the darkness. In doing so, you found a new path.)
082	(Meanwhile, I fell into disgrace.)
083	(These wounds are deep.)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
084	I made an enemy of all I encountered: the emperor of my homeland, the allies of justice, the Flame Dragon, and the man who forged my katana.
085	(No one's going to save me this time.)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
086	Surrounded by enemies, the whole world his foe!
087	(I have no one left. No one to smile at me.)
088	Karma always catches up with us in the end. I deserved this fate, for all the wrongs I committed, for all the deaths I caused, and for turning my back on the world.
089	(No one to remember me.)
090	Where's Mister Samurai?!
091	Mister Samurai will protect us! He's our bodyguard!
092	This opportunity is too good to waste. Their protector is nowhere in sight. Dispose of them, quickly.
093	S-stay away!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
094	Ila!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0019
095	For a bunch of brats, you've done well. You anticipated our raid and evacuated the orphanage. You even managed to fight us off all this way.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
096	Wh-where's the samurai storybook?!
097	We left it behind! M-Mister Samurai doesn't even know we're here!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
098	Y-you leave these kids alone, or I'll tear you limb from limb!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0022
099	I suppose that means we should kill you first, then.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
100	Run, Mia! You have to get them to safety!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
101	I-I... I'm not sure I can! M-my legs feel like they're made of jelly...
102	Mia!
103	Mister Samurai! Help! Please!
104	Die!
105	Ahahahahahahaha! Bwahahahahah!
106	What the...?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
107	M-Mimi! No! Stay back!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0026
108	Ahahahahahaha! Hahahahaha!
109	Hush, Mimi!
110	Ahah... Ungh... P-papa...
111	Mimi?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
112	Pa...pa...
113	Papa! Papa!
114	Papa!
115	A tool with a soul.
116	Ngh!
117	A vessel with a heart.
118	How could I forget?	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
119	How can you get up after that?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
120	Even if I am forgotten...I cannot forget.
121	My scar is burning.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
122	I will undo this wound. I will reclaim my loved ones.
123	I will bring back my family!
124	I am a tool no longer. I have a soul, and a will of my own. I am a samurai!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
125	Rise, and let the rivers of blood turn to fire!
126	Fool... If you run now...you could yet...survive.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
127	If you keep pushing yourself, you won't last long! Your wounds need healing—	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
128	Nothing can heal me!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
129	Yes... Your wounds are beyond repair.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
130	Your body is doomed to break.
131	You cannot recover naturally. You will not live long enough to see those children grow.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
132	You will die before you settle down with a family.
133	My wounds are as permanent as the cross on my face.
134	For in order to obtain the powers of the alternate dimension, you had to sacrifice all your ties to healing.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
135	Laugh if you will! Tell me I am not worthy of calling myself a samurai! Tell me I am weak, and cowardly, and worthless!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
136	Open your eyes, and place the rusted blade on the pyre!
137	Tell me that it's pathetic to put up a fight now, when the play is already over!
138	My apologies. I tend to run my mouth a bit when I'm afraid.
139	(I'm still as much of a coward as you were, my love.)	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
140	Huh?! He sheathed his katana!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
141	He's preparing an Iai stance!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
142	I will slice apart anything that stands in my way. I will rend through darkness, truth, and hell itself.
143	For the light of that day awaits me, and I would do anything to reach it! My heart is warm, because that distant light is my strength.
144	And it is powerful enough to light a fire in the hollow grate of my soul!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0015
145	The blade...has gone quiet.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
146	Even should this perpetual rage change me into a bloodthirsty demon...it will not become a light of remorse, but remain one of hope!
147	Lord Zahar!
148	Be ready. That stance means trouble!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
149	Train the arm and polish the blade, for this katana was the final one made!
150	Keep your distance, Kanon! If you get too close, he will cut you down!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
151	Now swing it well, samurai, and be prepared to die!
152	You know what Mister Samurai did?
153	We come to the end, foretold by my deeds. I am but a shadow of who I was, devoid of dreams.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
154	He searched far and wide, till he found us a home!
155	Even more thrilling in flesh than in tale! Let his samurai soul burn on and prevail!
156	He went out to find an answer, and he was gone for a long time. He made a bunch of mistakes, and got hurt lots, and had to start over again several times.
157	But even when he was covered in scars and scratches, he kept going. He kept searching.
158	This is the end.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
159	Mister Samurai isn't here right now.
160	I have been prepared for this moment since I made this mark upon my face.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
161	We're a real pack of monsters.
162	He's gone to turn the world on its head!
163	Yet don't you sometimes find thrilling plays a bore? Aren't poetic monologues enough to make you snore?
164	Hark, impetuous youth, your audience I crave!
165	Fools! You will regret this!
166	I am not destined to play the part of the hero.
