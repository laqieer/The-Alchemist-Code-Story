001	There! That takes care of your hired goons.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
002	Grrr...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
003	Are you ready to face the consequences of your actions? Thanks to your unscrupulous sales, a lot of people have gotten sick and are suffering gravely.
004	Why would you lie about your chocolate in the first place?! You're disgracing all merchants everywhere by misrepresenting the effects of your products and selling them to unsuspecting people!
005	...
006	Hey! Are you even listening to me?!	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
007	Shut up already! I don't care about any of that honor-among-merchants crap; as long as I can sell my wares...I'll do whatever it takes!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
008	A gun?! And there's nowhere to take cover!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
009	Margaret!!!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_battle_0020
010	No...!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_0019
011	My gun!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
012	Sorry to burst your bubble, but no one's faster or more accurate on the draw than I am.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0016
013	Caris!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_1011
014	Just in the nick of time, it seems. Apologies for the late arrival. It took me a while to wrap up my investigation, but the things I was able to learn were definitely worth it.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0035
015	Like what?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
016	Like the fact that every person who got sick after eating the chocolate was a student from the School of Magic.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0004
017	And every one of them learned about this pathetic excuse for a peddler from the same witch.
018	...
019	Wait, so this person was working with a witch from the School of Magic in some backdoor deal to sell Rainbow Cacao?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
020	Nail right on the head. She was doing it right under everybody's noses at first, but she wasn't careful enough about covering her tracks, and the powers that be caught wind of it.
021	That's when she started leaking information about the black market to the students so she could lure them out here, just a touch away from prying eyes.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0022
022	Seems she planned to send everybody on a wild goose chase and cause a bunch of unfocused chaos so she and...I guess her accomplices had time to escape amidst all the confusion.
023	...
024	So what's it gonna be, bub? Where is she?	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
025	She's long gone by now, and taken all the Rainbow Cacao with her! You can search my stall if you don't believe me; you'll find all the shelves are empty!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
026	What?!
027	Oh... The hooded figure from earlier! She did look like she was loading up a suspiciously large amount of the cacao.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
028	She's gonna sell the rest of it in the other kingdoms, and it's too late to stop her now; she's already slipped through your fingers!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
029	Lustburg has a monopoly on every cacao except brown, so it's bound to sell for a fortune abroad. And once she's sold it all, she promised she'd split the profits with me fifty-fifty.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
030	Oh, you poor, miserable sod. Do you really think she's going to keep that promise? Don't you understand the position you're in? I'm quite certain she's left you to take the fall for her.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
031	!!!
032	Blast. You're right. What was I thinking?! I shouldn't have believed a word that witch said! I even taught her how to pitch and sell her products. She has no reason to come back for me anymore!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0022
033	Oh, dear. Hoist by your own petard.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_event_1015
034	This is all your fault! I could've become a court merchant with the money from this scheme, if only you hadn't come along and wrecked it!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
035	Then I would never have had to worry about another meal in my entire life. That's the only reason I did all this, you know!
036	But now everything's gone up in smoke thanks to you!
037	Excuse you? Do you even hear what you're saying?!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0013
038	First of all, you taught her to pitch and sell her products?! Your way of selling things is so underhanded and disrespectful, I can't in all good conscience even think of you as a merchant!
039	You're a scoundrel, plain and simple. There's no pride to be had in selling goods through lies and deceit. That's not even commerce at that point; it's just a grift—a scam!
040	Furthermore, trying to monopolize sales of a product only makes it harder for people who really want it to get it!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0010
041	Providing customers with what they need is a merchant's job, and that's exactly why their whole livelihood depends on a healthy and robust market!
042	It's a cutthroat business, but improving sales by finding ways to garner more exposure and curate only the best goods is a merchant's mark of pride and proof of their professional integrity!!!
043	Ooh, Margaret! Amazing! You tell him!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0009
044	Yeah, not bad. You even got me goin' a little. I never knew you had such passion in you.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0008
045	Well, of course! And now that this unscrupulous cretin is tied up, what say we chase after that witch?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
046	I'll go ahead first, since I got the bike. It won't do us any good if she sells all the cacao and makes a run for it before we catch her.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0002
047	You two, take this guy's carriage and follow after me so we can use it to confiscate the Rainbow Cacao once we've got her in custody.
048	Roger that!
049	All right... Pedal to the metal! Everybody outta the way unless you wanna get flattened like a pancake!	VO_charis.charis_chara_1004
050	And just like that, gone in a flash. She really is the fastest person I've ever met. Shall we be going, too?
051	You bet! Sorry, mister, but we're going to be borrowing your carriage for a bit.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0037
052	Whoa, whoa! Good horse! Just keep following the path.
053	I had no idea you knew how to drive a carriage. You truly are a woman of many talents.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
054	Hehehe! I sometimes sell my products out of one, so don't worry about a thing; everything is under control! Feel free to rest inside while I take the reins.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
055	Sorry I can't help with that. Thanks so much, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0033
056	You don't have to apologize! I'd do anything at all for you, Lizzy.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
057	...
058	You know, I feel a lot better after hearing your impassioned speech to the peddler. You put so much pride and care into your work as a merchant.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
059	Hmm? What do you mean?	VO_margaret.margaret_chara_1011
060	Well, you're always giving me products for free, and I've always wondered if it was really...okay for you to do that, considering your profit margins and such.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
061	...
062	But I guess I had nothing to worry about after all. You're every bit as competent and well put-together as I always supposed you were. But then, you are my little sister, so I'd expect nothing less! Hehe.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0008
063	Oh, Lizzy!	VO_margaret.margaret_battle_1030
064	You really don't have to worry. The things I give you don't come out of my profit margins, but from my never-ending font of love for you. When it comes to business, trust me when I say, I sell by the boatload!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0007
065	By the boatload, is it?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0006
066	Honestly, I don't know if I'm as...how did you put it? Competent and well put-together? I don't think I'm quite that...	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
067	But I think a merchant should always be able to provide people with what they need, when they need it. That's our job. And it means a great deal to me.
068	You saved me when I was sick and suffering. I needed you at that moment, and you were there for me.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
069	And while I might not be able to give people medical help like you can, I can at least provide them with the right goods at the right time to make their lives better, and I take great pride in that fact.
070	That's very noble of you, Margaret.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
071	And it ties in with what I do more than you may think. Whenever I'm making medicine for my mother, for example, I often say to myself, if only I had this particular ingredient, or this particular tool...	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0031
072	I think it's wonderful that you're so committed to your cause of helping those in need.
073	...
074	And I think I finally understand now why you're so eager to remove the restrictions on the sales of Rainbow Cacao.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0004
075	At first, I had no idea why you were so adamant about it.
076	But it's simply because there are so many people out there who want some, isn't it?
077	Yes! That's exactly it!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0006
078	Hehe! I'm so happy that I understand you a little better now!	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
079	That's enough to make you happy? Even though it's not a particularly big deal?
080	Of course. Why wouldn't it be?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_chara_1009
081	I guess...I just didn't know such little things could bring you joy. I suppose there's still a lot for me to learn about you, as well.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0031
082	(Come to think of it, this might be my first time ever having a real heart-to-heart with Lizzy.)
083	(Ever since we met, even after I became a Phantom Soldier, I've always devoted every fiber of my being to her, first and foremost. And yet, somehow, I've never truly gotten to know her...)	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0016
084	Well, that's an easy problem to fix. All we have to do is chat more often and learn even more about each other.
085	That sounds perfect!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0038
086	I'd like nothing more than to talk with you, learn more about you, and become someone you can depend on even more in the future.	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0008
087	I like the sound of that quite a lot! For now, though, let's finish up our task and take back that Rainbow Cacao, shall we?	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0007
088	It really is a shame, though. This incident has gotten so out of hand, I'm sure all the cacao will just be hauled away by the court as soon as we bring it back.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0022
089	I do so wish we could convince them to let some of it go. It has so much potential in so many regards.	VO_elizabeth.elizabeth_sys_0016
090	...
091	Lizzy? Can I ask a favor of you?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0002
092	Oh, look! It's Caris! We caught up with her!
093	Thought you could ditch your business partner and run off, did you? You're not getting away that easily!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0016
094	Hmph! You sure about that? What if I were to do something like...this?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
095	Aah! Is that...?	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0025
096	Hey, no playin' dirty! Huh? Wait, this is Purple Cacao, isn't it?!	VO_charis.charis_battle_0021
097	Be careful, Caris! When the beans impact the ground, they're splitting open, diffusing their scent!	VO_margaret.margaret_sys_0027
098	Huh? Are you saying...?
099	Oh, come on! Not monsters again! Isn't there anything else this purple junk is good for?!	VO_charis.charis_sys_0025
100	Heh. Plenty, but nothing else quite as useful in the moment. Now be a good little girl and feed these poor dears, won't you? They seem absolutely ravenous!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
101	Grrrraaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0003
