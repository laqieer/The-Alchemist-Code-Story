001	I'm, I'm alive... Thank you, oh, thank you.
002	What in the world happened here?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
003	Welp, I was transporting these here marshmallows for the fair, when alluva sudden these beasties showed up outta nowhere.
004	I scurried off in a hurry, but all them marshmallows got gobbled up... Welp, at least I didn't meet the same fate.
005	What's the deal here? Aren't these your run-of-the-mill marshmallows?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
006	Just between you and me...these little puppies are pretty gnarly. Create craaazy dependency.
007	Dependency?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0012
008	Yeah, just look at these monsters. Probably not great for humans, but whatever turns a profit, right?
009	But man, they ate everything we had! How'm I supposed to explain this to that hoighty-toighty noble?
010	They ought to take responsibility for making you transport such dangerous cargo.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
011	Didn't ya hear what I said about profits? Can't stop the rumor mill turning, anyhoo.
012	Now that I've lost all their merch, I bet they'll gimme a real tongue-lashing. Maybe even load some debt on me...
013	......
014	At any rate, I oughta head back.
015	This whole thing stinks to high heaven.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
016	Yeah. His story, that noble, the marshmallows—don't think we can leave this be.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
017	Unforgivable. Let's spank that corrupt noble, make him pony up all the dough on him, and give it out to everyone.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0012
018	First, I'll track down wherever he lives, and I'll—
019	That's a bit overkill.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
020	Us getting back what's been stolen's one thing; going around stealing ourselves is another, though.
021	Overkill? How so? Our foe is a scoundrel. All his money, ill-gotten gains from tormenting the people.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0010
022	I'm not talking about stealing willy-nilly. Take from the vile rich, give to the needy poor. That's what a chivalrous thief does.
023	Toward that end, I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
024	Even...taking a life, in need be?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
025	I don't like killing. If it's to save the destitute, however, I won't hesitate.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0004
026	Murder is wrong, even if the murdered is a crook.	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0019
027	Every human should get a chance to pay for their sins, and start over fresh.
028	I get what you're saying, but that's just idealism. That sort of thinking won't save anyone.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0003
029	...
030	Evildoers who prey wholeheartedly on the poor can't be rehabilitated so easily. Leave him be, and you'll be right back where you started.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
031	Well I—
032	Irredeemable villains, rotten men, all the people they hurt. I've seen it all, over and over.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
033	Such beautiful idealism wouldn't put food on the table in the Wadatsumi I grew up in.
034	That's why I became the Night Fox—why I do things my way.
035	......
036	Welp, the era we came from was pretty much the same.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
037	Yeah, you're right. It's just...
038	Just?
039	I was just thinking: the conflict in Wadatsumi never ended, even after our time.	VO_kureto.kureto_battle_0019
040	......
041	Oh! Welcome back, Tsuru.
042	That's what I'm talking about! My partner makes quick work of whatever he does.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
043	What? Things feel awkward? Between me and him? No, of course not. Right, Creto?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
044	Huh? Oh, uh, right, 'course not.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
045	See? Creto agrees. Aww, why're you acting so unconvinced, Tsuru?
046	Hmm, hmm, I see, I see... Huh, is that right?
047	What's Tsurubami saying?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
048	That marshmallow ingredient comes from Wadatsumi.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
049	Toasting the grass makes it sweet; then eating—even smoking the stuff—fosters a powerful addiction.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
050	Tsuru remembers some time ago when people used such addiction to wrap unsuspecting impoverished people around their little fingers, so to speak.
051	He thought he got another whiff of that grass, and when he went to check, it lead him to the marshmallows.
052	Addiction... That lines up with the merchant's story. That explains how all the fairgoers were acting.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0012
053	Oh, those were only the first symptoms. They'll recover after a small dose like that, but keep eating them and there's no going back.
054	I don't like the sound of that. We have to handle this, before more people fall victim.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
055	Roger, dodger. Tsuru also looked into where the marshmallows are being made. Hurry, follow us!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0038
056	Evil must be crushed without delay, for the sake of this land.
057	......
