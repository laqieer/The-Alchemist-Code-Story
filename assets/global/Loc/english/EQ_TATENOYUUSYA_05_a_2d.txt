001	So that's the power of the shield. A pretty powerful gear, I'd say.	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0044
002	......
003	He can alter the shield's shape in order to release magic-like power... Mysterious, indeed.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0031
004	I don't really get why people would hate the guy.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0045
005	That's as much of a mystery to me as it is to you. I was hated and despised as soon as I became the Shield Hero of that world.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
006	The people there refused to listen to a word I said.
007	...
008	(Normally we'd easily be able to notice a tiny group of monsters like that...)	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
009	(We were distracted because of our childish argument... What on earth am I doing? I should be ashamed of myself.)
010	...
011	You okay, Melty?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_sys_0001
012	Oh... Yes, I'm fine since Naofumi protected me...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0004
013	S-sorry, Naofumi...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0035
014	Don't mention it. But watch your back. These monsters are stronger than the ones back in our world.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0039
015	You're right... I thought so, too. They're nothing like the Balloons we've fought up until now. But why?	VO_melty.melty_sys_0005
016	Beats me... Maybe the powers of this world are entering the Balloons somehow.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0016
017	If that's the case... They could be mutating by absorbing Alchemia.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0003
018	Alchemia?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0025
019	Alchemia is the source of power that lies within each and every living creature in Babel.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
020	Manipulating the Alchemia in nature allows one to use magic. It's magic different than what you use, though.	VO_lamia.lamia_sys_0004
021	It sounds like an energy source specific to this world is having an effect on the Balloons here. Hmph. Makes enough sense to me.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0045
022	That just makes me even more worried about Raphtalia and Filo... We need to find them right away...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0001
023	That's what I was planning on doing, anyway. But we don't have time.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0004
024	What do you mean by that?	VO_anastasia.anastasia_chara_1004
025	Heroes can see a countdown of when the next Wave occurs. We don't have much time left.
026	We need to find those two before then... We won't be able to suppress the Wave without them.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0031
027	Raphtalia fights for me as my sword, and Filo...helps out in her own unique way.
028	I have no means of combat... Makes sense for someone called the Shield Hero.
029	Naofumi...
030	Let us help you out, then. It'll be easier to look for your pals if you're with people who are actually familiar with the area.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
031	I'm sure it'll also save a ton of time compared to wandering around aimlessly.
032	Are you expecting us to return the favor somehow?	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0002
033	Hold on, Naofumi! You don't have to be so rude!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0012
034	Yeah, that's kind of what I was hoping, actually.
035	Huh?! Naofumi was right?!	VO_melty.melty_sys_0025
036	Yup. We can't take that Wave down if we don't have this Hero with us, apparently.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
037	So we'll need you all in tip-top shape for the battle to come.
038	The more there are of you, the easier it'll be for us.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
039	Guess that makes sense...	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0045
040	All right. I'll work together with you people for a bit. At least until we find Raphtalia and Filo.	VO_naofumi.naofumi_sys_0037
041	Wow... I never thought I'd live to see the day when the obstinate Naofumi was actually convinced to do something...
042	Naofumi doesn't believe a word anyone says. He won't even listen to me, a princess...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0016
043	He doesn't follow the orders of my father, the king of the Melromarc Kingdom.
044	What he's been saying isn't totally wrong. Though he IS pretty stubborn...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
045	But it would be a waste of time to work together if both parties don't benefit from it.
046	If he's not listening to anyone, that means that the king and anyone else of high standing aren't offering him the right terms.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0045
047	Mutual benefit...	VO_melty.melty_sys_0031
048	Those in power have to pay more attention to those things... As annoying as that can be.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
