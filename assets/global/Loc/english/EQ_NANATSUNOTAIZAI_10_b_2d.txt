001	You still want to keep going? You know you're outmatched, right?
002	I'm not finished yet!
003	Mmn... Hm? Whoa?! Zeldris is getting beat up?!
004	The tides of the battle turned while you were knocked out, Captain Leftovers.
005	I was knocked out?! Aw man, I missed out on the fight!
006	This should be good enough. Let us finish this in our world.
007	What did you say?!
008	What is happening?!
009	I was contemplating how I might dilute the boundaries of our worlds with my magic.
010	I know you were told defeating Zeldris and the Albions would do so, but...
011	I thought it would be most appropriate to bring this fight to a conclusion in our own world.
012	Is that what you've been keeping yourself busy with?
013	It was. My magic alone couldn't affect the principle foundations of this world, so I had to borrow the powers present here.
014	I had to stay focused to do so.
015	Tch...! You may have prevented me from attaining new powers today, but remember this, Meliodas!
016	This isn't over yet! I will not forgive you!
017	Well, what are we waiting for? I'm out.
018	Couldn't he wait on us?
019	Let's just go, Diane.
020	Escanor, you go on ahead. Thank you for all you've done today.
021	Let's go, Cap'n!
022	Yeah, sure. I'll be waiting for you on the other side, Elizabeth.
023	We don't have much time for goodbyes. Do try to make it brief, Princess.
024	...
025	What will you two do now?
026	There isn't much to do, really. Phantom Soldiers disappear once their mission is over.
027	We will return to darkness. So whispers the darkness within me.
028	Just when I was starting to get attached to that darkness of yours...
029	That's awful!
030	Oh, there's nothing to be sad about. We were happy to have fought alongside you.
031	The trust you have in your friends brought back some fond memories.
032	I'm sure that's something I'll take with me, even if I don't keep memories of this specific event.
033	I will never forget this!
034	These memories of another world... There's no guarantee that you'll remember.
035	...
036	We will be one with the darkness...and with the gifts you have given us. I am satisfied with that.
037	Elizabeth! It's time to get out of here!
038	...!
039	Go on, Elizabeth.
040	May the darkness guide you.
041	The darkness? Would we want it to, though?
042	Okay! Thank you so much!
043	Someday, somehow, I'd love to see you two again!
044	Let's go, Elizabeth!
045	Will I forget them?
046	The experiences I had and people I met here...
047	Everything that reminded me of the importance of trust.
048	I'm sure that's something I'll take with me, even if I don't keep memories of this specific event.
049	We will be one with the darkness...and with the gifts you have given us. I am satisfied with that.
050	All right, then...
051	Thank you...so very much.
052	What are you doing? Let's go, Elizabeth.
053	Coming, Meliodas... Everyone.
054	What's up?
055	I find myself hopeful for the future we will share. I'm sure it's going to be wonderful!
