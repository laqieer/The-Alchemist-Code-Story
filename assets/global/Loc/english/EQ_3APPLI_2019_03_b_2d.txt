001	Lust?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0025
002	Matters of love and romance are alien to me. I believe that they are unnecessary afflictions, even now.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0010
003	Well, then...why are you helping them?	VO_titania.titania_sys_0017
004	Why, indeed.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0031
005	Although burdened by the sin of lust, they have lived and fought, all while controlling its influence over them.
006	However, just in case their companionship should reveal itself to be something vulgar and crude, I am prepared to bring them down immediately.
007	They kinda already hit the lowest of the low, didn't they?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0031
008	They really did.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0030
009	So...?
010	Be that as it may, I felt like there was something to be achieved by playing along with that farce, and perhaps there still is. That's why I shall continue to merely observe...for now.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0031
011	...
014	I don't know anything about love, either, but I'm pretty envious of the fact that you can fight with such discipline.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0018
015	I can't help but leap into action, and it always gets me covered in scars and bruises from the get-go.
016	Why? Do you not care for your own appearance?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0022
017	Tch... It's all because of my unreliable master.	VO_almace.almace_sys_0004
018	I need to get back... Not that I'm worried or anything, of course.
019	Of course.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0045
020	What's that tone for?
021	You are eager to meet your master, are you not?	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0008
022	I-it's not like that! It's just that I need to be there, to protect them! It's not like I care or anything!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0047
023	...
024	What is it now? Why've you gone all quiet?	VO_almace.almace_sys_0002
025	Perhaps...she believes that your feelings are not so pure as you claim, but are in fact steeped in lust.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0025
026	Wha—?! No! It's not like that! I swear! Don't strike me! Please!	VO_almace.almace_sys_0026
027	Hmhm. I am aware.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0007
028	Thank goodness.	VO_titania.titania_sys_0030
029	I understand what it is to want to protect one's master.	VO_arutemisu_blk.arutemisu_blk_sys_0004
030	There is nothing wrong with that.
031	Heheh. Nyx. You've grown up so much, haven't you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
032	I-I'm sorry, Mira.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0035
033	It's fine, Hiiragi. I feel like I'm finally able to approve of your relationship.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
034	Th-that's not, um... Haa...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0047
035	Feel free to call me "sis."	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
036	S-sis...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0003
037	Our little family has expanded!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
038	Y-you're awfully happy about this...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0016
039	Now we've had confessions of love, a date between lovers, and Hiiragi has even been welcomed into her boyfriend's family. The Lovesickness should be pretty satisfied right about now, hey?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
040	You've been thinking ahead all this time...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0044
041	Half of it was just for kicks and giggles.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0010
042	M-Mira!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0019
043	Like I said, just call me "sis"!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
044	...	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0019
045	Shouldn't be long now.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
046	N-Nyx...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0001
047	Ragi-Boo! Call me Nyxie!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
048	Aahh! I-I'm sorry, Nyx...ie.	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
049	You're all mine now, you know.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
050	U-um... Nyx? You really don't have to keep forcing yourself. The Lovesickness has calmed down now, and...	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0001
051	Heheh! Don't be silly, Ragi-Boo.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0023
052	We're just getting started.
053	N-Nyx...? What do you mean by that?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
054	I wasn't talking to you.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0016
055	Wh-what?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
056	Right, Ragi-Boo?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
057	Huh?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0026
058	Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0035
059	Ooooooooraaaaaahh!	VO_uzushiomaru.uzushiomaru_battle_0003
060	But everything is turning out just as I thought it would.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0009
061	Th-the Lovesickness, it's...!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0027
062	It's multiplying into lots and lots of...me?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0028
063	Yup.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
064	What the hell is going on here?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
065	I told you, didn't I? From the moment I saw you, I thought you were great.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
066	H-huh?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0025
076	I've never actually been in love with any of you. From the start, it was all just a ruse.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
078	Wh-what?! W-well, actually, I'm pretty relieved to hear that.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
079	The Lovesickness isn't my affliction, you see.
080	Wh-whose...?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
081	Ngh...!
067	I suppose it's about time I revealed my true purpose here.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
068	Jeez! You think you're so clever, don't you, little brother?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
069	I'm going to make my very own Hiiragi Harem, right here, right now.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0008
070	Hiiragi...Harem?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0039
071	Hiiragi Harem.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
072	Hiiragi...H-Har...em?	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0029
073	These lovely ladies are all mine.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
074	Wh-what?!	VO_hiiragi.hiiragi_sys_0006
075	My little brother has lost his marbles!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
