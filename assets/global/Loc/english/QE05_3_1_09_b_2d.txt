001	Nngh... I'm just...not powerful enough. We're no match for the Protector.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
002	This is the end. You know that you cannot win.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
003	Have you forgotten? That life of yours is the blessing Sephiron bestowed upon you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
004	...
005	Heh. Heheheh.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
006	Protector. Do you realize how cold this place is? There is no sunlight spilling from between the leaves, no fruits to be borne. Only desolate land as far as the eye can see.
007	...
008	We did not want to live to see this land. We would have gladly died with Sephiron!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
009	Yet we were forced to live on! By you, by the desert, by Gluttony Foss!
010	We never wanted any of this!
011	That may be so, but it is our duty to impart everything we know onto the coming generations.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
012	We cannot resign ourselves to that so easily! Oh, great mother Sephiron, why have you forsaken us?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
013	If this is the trial you have given us, then—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
014	Oh flesh and blood that is mine, run inverse along the transcendent staircase!
015	Ascend from the depths of the sea, oh shapeless one!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
016	Wh-what is this?! This is not among the works of Sephiron!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
017	I have fallen to the abyss. I have seen the Door of Power!
018	Gah!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0019
019	Th-this is... I know this feeling.
020	Kamui! Are you all right?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
021	I am, but I fear that this foe will not be easy to bring down.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
