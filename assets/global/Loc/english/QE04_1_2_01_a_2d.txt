001	Are you sure it's okay?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
002	What is okay?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
003	Leaving the village. Now that Chief Adone has died, you're the chief, right?
004	The village is protected by the Elder and the support of all the villagers...it will be all right.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
005	For starters, you were the one who wanted to take me with you, right?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
006	Right. If we can revive the power of the wind...of Matter, we should be able to suppress the outbreak of Jam.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
007	I want to protect Saga. That feeling still hasn't changed, but...when I think about your tribe...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
008	Don't worry about it. It was my father's wish for me to leave the village.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
009	Not that I have any idea how all of this will end up.
010	You're strong.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0007
011	Huh...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
012	With Chief Adone dead, I thought you might be discouraged, but...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
013	My father said he'll always be watching over me.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
014	He still lives in my heart. I have nothing to mourn.
015	Heh. Don't worry. I'm sure it'll all work out. We'll do everything we can to restore the wind...agh!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0007
016	...! Are you okay?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
017	Ye-yeah... If I can overcome the pain and fever, I should be fine...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
018	That being said, the time is approaching. We must hurry to Voda.	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
019	First of all, let's take a break in the village. We're almost there, right?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
020	Yes.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
021	Paza village, huh? I've always wanted to go there.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0009
022	It's got one of the biggest markets in all of Saga, right?
023	It faces the main road that connects with the other villages. For the tribes around here, it's something of an intersecting village. It should still be flourishing more than ever.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
024	It should still be...? Don't you always pass by it when you visit Voda?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
025	I usually avoid Paza village and go through the forest. The reason why we're heading there now is so that you can get some rest.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
026	You usually avoid Paza village...? Why?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
027	Paza is a neutral trade village where people from different tribes come and go. Because of that, the strife between tribes never ceases there.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
028	We of the Voda faction dislike conflict. That is why we avoid the Paza village.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
029	There is strife between the tribes even in the famous Paza village with its free market?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
030	Yes. In order to avoid any unnecessary conflict, my father often told me not to go near Paza village if possible.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
031	If you had the physical strength to make it through the forest, I wouldn't be stopping by.
032	I see. Naturally, there'll be plenty of merchants at the marketplace.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0045
033	We may be able to gather information regarding the outbreak of Jam. We're almost there, right?
034	Wait here.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
035	...?! Where are you going...?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
036	It'll be faster to confirm how far we are from on top of a tree.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
037	Wh-whoa! No wonder they call the Voda faction the guardians of the forest.
038	That being said...it's hard to believe that the strife has spread to the point that even they are shunning this land.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
039	I can see it! It shouldn't take more than 20 minutes for us to get there. Let's go!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
040	Bleeaaargh!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0027
041	Honestly...I've never had a customer who got so dragon-sick before.
042	Aren't those broomsticks that you witches ride on a lot more uncomfortable?
043	We...well, this dragon...it shakes and smells like a beast...and...bleeaaargh!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
044	Gluah...you're making me feel sick too. Anyway, we've arrived.
045	This is Paza village. It's a fairly large one where a market is held.
046	Paza village... I've finally arrived...in Saga!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
047	So this is Saga! Wow! There's a lot of people!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
048	Paza village starts from around here. It's a neutral trade village with a vast marketplace.
049	What do you mean "from around here"?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
050	This village of Paza was formed when people began to gather and form a market along the main road.
051	In theory, the center of the town is a little further ahead, but there are no clear territorial boundaries. There are a lot of villages like that in Saga.
052	That's why even the customers need a "permit" from the chief of a tribe, or else the land would be overrun by intruders.
053	Wow! So it's like the entrance gate into Saga!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0044
054	This road is connected to each tribe's village. It should be easy to get to any one of them.
055	Um...what did you mean earlier when you called it a neutral trading village?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
056	Ah. In Saga, the individual tribes...
057	They are roughly divided and belong to one of three factions based on their code of conduct.
058	There are deep chasms between each faction and, unless you have a valid reason, you can't move freely between villages of different factions.
059	That being said...there are some things that just can't be supplemented for within an individual community, right?
060	Oh...so it's a village where anyone can enter?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
061	Yep. It's a neutral area that goes beyond tribe or faction where you can obtain whatever it is you are lacking.
062	That's what a neutral trading village is. It's a village where individuals from any faction can come and go as they please.
063	I thought it would be the perfect place to first take a foreigner like you, young lady.
064	So, even though it's a place of freedom, there's still quite a bit of friction going on here. What are the three factions?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
065	There's the "Tehre of Earth" faction that merchants like myself belong to that actively tries to incorporate new cultures.
066	Then there's the "Fuu of Fire" faction that is a warlike tribe responsible for Saga's military.
067	Finally...there's the nature-worshiping faction called the "Voda of Water." They place an emphasis on training new shamans.
068	Tehre...? Fuu...? Voda...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
069	They're the names of the three great shamans they call the Sprite Trio.
070	Tehre is the shaman of earth...Fuu is the shaman of fire...and Voda is the shaman of water.
071	And they're the ones who manage the artifacts called Matter, which resemble Philosopher's Stones.
072	In the past...the Wind Sprite also existed...and together they were called the Sprite Quartet.
073	Wa-wait...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
074	There's so much to learn. Why didn't you tell me all of this during the trip?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0012
075	Weren't you the one who told me not to talk to you because you were feeling sick?!
076	Sorry...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0036
077	In any case, the Sprite Trio consists of the three ultimate shamans gathered from amongst the various tribes.
078	Essentially, they are supposed to work hand-in-hand...
079	Unfortunately, due to their beliefs, I would be hard-pressed to say they were united. That's the current state of the tribes in Saga.
080	How could that happen? You're all from the same land of Saga.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
