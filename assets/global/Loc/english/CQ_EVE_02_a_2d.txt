001	...I am truly looking forward to seeing you again, Lord Fraise. Yours truly. -Eve
002	She really gave me quite the surprise at first, but, now that I think about it, her everyday bride training almost resembles my code of chivalry.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
003	Hm? A visitor...?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
004	Lord Fraise!
005	L-Lady Eve?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
006	Yes! I found something nice, so I came running all the way here.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
007	You came running here?! From Lustburg...?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0029
008	Yes. I wrote about it in my letter, right? Actually, I found a really delicious ingredient. It's important that it's fresh, so I hurried over here.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
009	Fresh? Is this a monster?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0016
010	Yes. It's a really rare one. Even some in Lustburg have never eaten it before...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
011	Lady Eve, be careful!	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0019
012	Agh...!	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0020
013	Lord Fraise!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0047
014	Wh-why? I thought I killed it properly...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0021
015	I've read about this type of monster in a book before. When it senses danger, it pretends to be dead until the danger passes...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0018
016	Wo...
017	Wow! Lord Fraise, you're so smart! Mmm! I'm so proud of my future husband♪	VO_eve.eve_sys_0024
018	Ri-right now isn't the time...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0046
019	...?! Here it comes!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0027
