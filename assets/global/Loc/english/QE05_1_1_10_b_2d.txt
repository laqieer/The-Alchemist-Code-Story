001	I-impossible! We outnumber you!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0021
002	Thinking of us Paladins as just another group of knights was your downfall.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
003	Our defenses...	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0022
004	What the...? What's going on?! What do we do?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
005	Everything has gone according to plan. Send a message to every soldier!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
006	Wipe them out and show no mercy! Hunt down every last one of them!
007	Lord Waginau!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
008	Do you object, Kamui?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0006
009	The enemy has been defeated. There is no need to pursue them any further! That will cause pointless casualties on both sides!
010	Did you forget? Those Royal Army soldiers burned villages and massacred civilians!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
011	That's true, but...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
012	Justice lies within one's own heart. The will to strictly discipline one's self is the only way to restrain excessive power.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
013	These men have strayed from that path. Drunk with power and plunder, they've strayed from humanity. They are nothing more than beasts.
014	Beasts that have learned the taste of human flesh will hunt people again.
015	Unless we vanquish them now, more innocents will fall victim to their frenzy.
016	Not all of them are like that! Surely some of them just could not object to their orders!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
017	Pandering to an evil authority is an act of evil itself. Had they any moral foundation, they would have stuck to their principles.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
018	If they were apathetic enough to willingly follow evil, then they are nothing more than cattle.
019	As long as they remain loyal to the same handler, they will continue to obey evil commands, becoming beasts ruled by their own bloodlust.
020	But this is just...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
021	You have been sheltered by the great tree for too long. Watch and learn. This is what it takes to extinguish evil.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
022	This is what is necessary to represent absolute justice!
023	...
024	I was looking for you, Kamui.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
025	Teona. I heard you were going to join the Liberation Army.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
026	I am a gladiator. I have fought only within the boundaries of rules and regulations.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
027	I have never felt that to be restricting in any way.
028	Follow the rules and challenge one's own skill by taking on opponents face to face.
029	There was honor in that. I was proud of that, and carried myself without shame.
030	But the way the Royal Army fights... It lacks any of that honor.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
031	Subjugating through violence, cutting down the unarmed, and pillaging as they please...
032	I cannot let that pass.
033	It seems that Waginau will be with the Liberation Army for a while as well.
034	Yes, I heard that as well.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
035	He goes too far in the name of his own justice. Somebody has to keep him in check, or else more unnecessary blood will flow.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
036	You mean to take on that role?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
037	I know what people will think. How could a simple gladiator question the acts of the Holy Guard?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
038	Even so, I must help this civil war come to an end with as few casualties as possible.
039	I want to do whatever I can to prevent more children from ending up like Hisham.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
040	...
041	I've been told there have been countless villages burnt to the ground by the Royal Army for the sin of supporting the South.	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
042	If a child was wandering alone where you found him, then that could only mean...
043	Yes, most likely...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
044	Are you going to head back home, Kamui?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
045	Yes, and...I will be taking Hisham with me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
046	Will you? I'm sorry to renege on my promise to protect him.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
047	It can't be helped. Under these circumstances, we do not have the time to find his parents.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
048	If we prioritize his safety instead, there is no other option.
049	Even if this means I am leading him down the same path I once walked.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
050	What do you mean, Kamui?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
051	No, it's nothing.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
052	Well, I guess this is goodbye. I had hoped we would have the chance to cross swords once more, but...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
053	I am grateful that I now have the opportunity to stand up against inhumanity. Thank you both.
054	Thank you for everything you've done.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0034
055	Same to you. Well, um...see you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
056	Yeah.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
057	Change the country for the people, huh...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
058	That is a noble cause, but...this civil war will continue on as long as that is the motivation.
059	The Sacred Stone and this civil war... What is this apprehension in my heart?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
060	I must hurry back and tell the chief of everything I have seen and heard.
061	People of Gluttony Foss! Our country is in turmoil!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
062	Not only do we face discord with Saga and rebellion from the desert dwellers, but also this uprising by General Leordas in the South!
063	General Leordas' reckless actions have led to the devastation of our southern resources, the effects of which have reached even our royal capital!
064	We of the North have been forced to suffer because of the General's despotism as transport of necessary goods has been delayed and they have hoarded their access to trading ports and harbors!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_battle_0019
065	Are we to let the South continue their insurgency?!
066	How much longer can we endure the desecration of our pride as Gluttony Foss of the Seven Kingdoms?!
067	I say, no more! We must take decisive action immediately!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0039
068	What do we hold most precious in our country?! What do we value above all?!
069	It is you, the people! The strength and righteousness of each and every one of you who have loved this country are the greatest treasures this country has!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0005
070	To protect something so valuable as that, we must stand together!
071	We must unite, to crush the wickedness and deceptions of the enemy, and to allow true justice to shine in our country!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
072	Quite the speech.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
073	I do not appreciate your sarcasm. To incite the ignorant masses, a little exaggeration is necessary.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0016
074	That little inspiration has turned every citizen into a soldier for your cause. That will increase casualties exponentially.
075	That will not be an issue. I did not lie about the people being our most valuable resource.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
076	We have the largest population in all Seven Kingdoms. Greed Dike and Northern Pride do not even come close to our numbers.
077	Casualties can be supplemented with ease.
078	It seems your people are little more than pawns to you. This is an ideology that conflicts with ours.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
079	And? As long as our interests align, you will do nothing, correct?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0044
080	It would be wise, however, not to test our patience.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
081	If it becomes unfavorable for us to ally ourselves with you, it will be your head, not King Narol's, that rolls down the castle hall.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
082	Huh, I'll keep that in mind.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
