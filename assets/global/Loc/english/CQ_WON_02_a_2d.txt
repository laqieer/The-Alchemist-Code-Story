001	Won! Now!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0032
002	Huzzzaaahhh!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0032
003	I thought we were here to deal with Wildpeckers. What's wrong with these guys?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0002
004	The sudden appearance of the Wildpeckers must have stirred them into a frenzy. Let's have a look around, shall we?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0031
005	You know, you're not bad, Strie. I guess I misjudged you.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0003
006	Perhaps I should say the same to you. You're not all talk after all, are you? You're quite a capable young man!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
007	Hey... How come you let me tag along on this job? You could've easily taken care of it yourself.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
008	The pay is most generous—profitable enough to be shared, I think. That's not the only reason, however.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0010
009	The village must be in an awful lot of trouble for them to offer such a sum.
010	I suspect that the villagers must have scraped it together amongst themselves, as a community... I wanted to get the job done as quickly as possible, for their sakes.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
011	Hmm... You're a good person, Strie. I wasn't thinking about anything other than lining my own pockets.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0006
012	What? That's why you came along? You were so reluctant to accompany me that I was sure you must have had some other, far more pressing reason.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
013	Huh?! What's that supposed to mean?! What's your grand reason for wanting all that money, then? You're nothing but a gambler!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0025
014	Well... You're not wrong.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0031
015	Hah!
016	You see...I come from a very poor village. I pass all the money I make onto the people of that village.
017	H-huh...?
018	Having money allows me to indulge in my passion for gambling, as well as bring joy to the people of my village. That's why I wanted the reward.
019	I would call that a rather grand reason, wouldn't you?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0011
020	I'm, uh...sorry. About what I said.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0036
021	Oh? You don't need to be, dear. You merely said what you felt, and it happened to be the truth.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0006
022	The truth... Huh.
023	Are you hiding something, Won?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0002
024	Wha—?! What makes you say that?!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0025
025	Tee hee. You'd make a terrible gambler, if that's your poker face. I assume you have your reasons.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
026	My reasons... Well, maybe, but they're nothing so grand as yours.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0022
027	I never got along with my dad, so I ran away from home.
028	My family is famous for its swordsmanship, and I'm the heir to it all, but our technique...it's designed to kill.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
029	I could never bring myself to accept that. I didn't want my dad to find out where I was. I came all the way out here to find work.
030	I don't want to be bound to that fatal technique, or to my dad! That's why I decided to use my fists to liberate those in trouble, as a jack of all trades!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0038
031	Well, I left my apprentice behind in Greed Dike when I came here, so I've gotta go back eventually, once everything's settled down. But I don't have the funds to turn back yet.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0030
032	Doubt...
033	Is that the freedom your heart desires, I wonder?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
034	Huh?
035	To me, freedom means money. Money allows me to buy the children of my village their favorite things.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
036	What does freedom mean to you?
037	Huh? What does it...mean...?
038	Wildpeckers! We've finally found them! Let's do this, Won!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0016
039	R-right!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0038
