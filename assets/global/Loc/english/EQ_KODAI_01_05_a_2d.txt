001	Wow!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0046
002	Oh, wow! Wha—?! Wow!!!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0023
003	What are you so worked up about? What's so fascinating about this boring old burg?	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
004	I've never seen so many humans in one place before!
005	And the walls here aren't all cracked and crumbled!
006	What in the world? Did you used to live in ruins, or something?!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0039
007	Anyway, keep up the pace! Claybelle's is just over this way.
008	What? What is it now?
009	I want to go on an adventure!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
010	Umm... How about before that, we go to—
011	There's so much I don't know about! I want to learn more about the humans, and about you!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0003
012	That's my duty! Or at least, that's what Schmeier told me.
013	I have to learn about a whole bunch of things if I'm going to save everyone!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
014	Hey, you're my friend, right?
015	F-frie—?!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0025
016	Y-y-you and me? F-friends?
017	Hmmmm? We're not?
018	W-well, you do seem to be a bit ignorant as to the ways of the world...	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_battle_0019
019	And I suppose it's a witch's duty to guide those who are lost. So, yeah, sure! Why not? We can be friends.
020	Yay! Does that mean you're gonna show me around?!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0009
021	If you'd like. The people here, including me, certainly owe quite a debt of gratitude to your kind.
022	Huh?
023	If you really want to know more about this place, then listen up! That over there is the blacksmith's workshop, and that's the store we go to for magical items. Oh, and that one there is—	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0003
024	Wow... Ooh! What about that one?! What's that?!
025	That'd be the patisserie. They sell cakes, but they're so expensive, we only go there on special occasions.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0004
026	They sell what? What's a cake?
027	A cake? It's a kind of pastry. Food! It's food. It's baked. It's sweet, and delicious!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0007
028	But it's their fruity pies that taste the best! That's...another kind of food. A similar one! They're so enchantingly sweet, it's like they melt in your mouth.
029	Huh, okay. Food that melts. Got it.	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0045
030	Somehow, I doubt that.
031	You know what? Here. For you. I was saving this for later, but you should try a bite yourself. I think you might like it.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0031
032	Tsk, tsk, Ambrosia. Didn't you tell me you had no idea where the last slice of pie I baked went?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0012
033	Q-Quence!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0025
034	Who's this?
035	Nice to meet you, little miss. My name is Quence. I'm sort of a guardian for that one next to you.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0037
036	So you're a Zafeiris?
037	A Zaf... What? I'm sorry, but I don't speak the dragons' language.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0006
038	How did you know she's a dragon?
039	Isn't it obvious? No human can physically house such an immense amount of magil.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0004
040	I'm Lil! I'm Sia's friend!
041	Oh, really? Sia's friend, you say? As in, Ambro-Sia? Heh.
042	Don't give me that look. No, I did not trick her into anything!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0012
043	But, a friend? You? And a cute nickname, at that? Is it snowing today, or are these white plumes from the wings of flying pigs I see? Hahaha!
044	Quence! You're being mean!
045	Hahaha! I'm sorry, it's just the first time I've ever heard anybody regard you as their friend.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0008
046	You have no friends, Sia?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
047	What? No! I-I mean, yes! Are you judging me?!
048	It's okay. Schmeier said Zafeiris doesn't have any friends either!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
049	I don't know either of those people. That means nothing to me.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0030
050	I take it she's lost.
051	Yes. I've been trying to bring her to Claybelle's, considering the fact that she's a dragon.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0006
052	Really? What do you think our teacher would be able to do for her?
053	Teacher?
054	Oi! Keep that big mouth of yours shut, Quence! We're not supposed to let anyone know Claybelle's teaching us magic, remember?!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0026
055	"Mere humans must not dare reach for the sagacity of the great dragons," was it?
056	Let those envious so-and-sos judge all they want. I don't care what they think.	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0030
057	Claybelle recognized our talent, and chose to bestow her knowledge upon us. That's all there is to it.
058	Y-you're not wrong, but... Still!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0042
059	(I just don't want the townspeople bad-mouthing you again...)
060	Hmm? What was that?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0005
061	Ah, nothing!
062	You two are really close, huh?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0031
063	Pfft, no!
064	Quence is always teasing me. He skips out on all his chores, and is an absolute menace!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0003
065	Oh? What was that? For a moment there, I thought I heard the buzz of a fly that can't even cook for herself.
066	Excuse you?! I can cook just fine, thankyouverymuch! I only ask for help so you might have a chance to feel useful, for a change!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0005
067	Lies! Lies and slander! You know what she told me? She told me she's too scared to even hold a kitchen knife! How can she be so afraid of kitchen implements?! And she calls herself a witch...	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0004
068	I never said that! I can use a kitchen knife just fine!
069	See? You two are besties!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0008
070	What part of our interaction could possibly lead you to believe that, Lil?!
071	Lil?
072	That's my name! They said it means "ocean"!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0006
073	...
074	Enough is enough! This tour is over! I'm taking you right to Claybelle's now!	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0016
075	Okay. Thanks, Sia!
076	S-sure. No problem. What are f-friends for, right?
077	Yeah!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
078	Territory of the Seven Sins, the Lust Layer... I believe this is where Claybelle resides.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
079	Can't believe she really lives among the humans! We dragons are destined to leave this world soon. She should know better than to fraternize with them so intimately.
080	I will do as I please, Zafeiris.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
081	...Long time no see. You seem tired. Schmeier working you to the bone, I take it?
082	...
083	Hahaha! Always with the silent treatment! You could at least be polite and say hello.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0008
084	Anyway, come on in. I prefer to have my conversations indoors, where it's warm.
085	Humans are still immature. We ought to walk side by side with them until they learn from us just how to survive in this world.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
086	Claybelle, I...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
087	I know, I know. You have no interest in humans. Or, perhaps, what little you do feel toward them amounts to nothing more than self-condemnation and regret.
088	...
089	Nail right on the head, I take it? Still regret failing to protect our world, don't you?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0016
090	I...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_battle_0019
091	Mm, it's a touchy subject. My apologies. I shouldn't have even brought it up, really.
092	Just know that I care not for the dragons, much as you care...little...for the humans.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0002
093	Creation of a new world? Atonement for the future? Leave me out of all that nonsense. I want no part in it.
094	I stick with the humans solely because I personally consider them to be worth my time, interest, and guidance.
095	Amidst that great calamity that enveloped the seven worlds, I was only able to save a scant few with these hands, and they alone are precious to me.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0006
096	...Sorry, but did you happen to see a little girl around here recently?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0002
097	Excuse me?
098	A little dragon girl. Her name is Lil. Schmeier said she sent her here.
099	She hasn't visited this home of mine, at least. Why was she sent here?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0031
100	Ophioneus is after her.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0037
101	That Dragon of Pride, after one little girl?
102	...
103	Silence is golden, eh, Zafeiris?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0001
104	Unfortunately for you, your silence is telling me loud and clear that you're hiding something.
105	I take it that little girl is Ouroboros? Which would mean Schmeier finally completed her little project.
106	Her name is Lil.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0039
107	I see.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0045
108	You've become attached to her, haven't you? Is she not merely a tool for salvation to you?
109	No! She's...
110	Lil...is just a child. She has no drive or determination to save the world. She's just...	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
111	I mean, is it right to force a child like that to bear the fate of the world?
112	Since when do you care what's right or wrong?	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0003
113	Our civilization has come to an end. Our extinction is imminent. And just why do you think that is?
114	It's because we were "wrong."
115	I can't say what we were wrong about, specifically, nor would I even entertain the notion that we were wrong about everything. But clearly, we made a pivotal error somewhere.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0030
116	And where we are now is the result. We have to acknowledge and accept that.
117	We were wrong, and whatever in blazes we were wrong about, we're long past the point of making it right again.
118	Our only two choices now are either to prevent an even worse wrong from occurring, or to double down on our errors and defy the very fabric of reality.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
119	...
120	Which choice are you picking, Claybelle? Will you defy reality?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0003
121	...Are you really that oblivious to the threat encroaching upon this world?
122	Come with me. I have something to show you.	VO_clabul.clabul_battle_0015
123	You need to come face-to-face with the newest calamity this world is about to suffer.
124	What?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0004
125	Is this a...facility for imprisoning criminals? Why do you have such a place on your property?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
126	Because I can't risk letting those I care for see this.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0029
127	How would I even explain it to them?
128	Explain what?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
129	Haaaaaaaaarrrghhhaaahh...
