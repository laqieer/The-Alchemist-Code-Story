001	Ais! Thank goodness...you're all right!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0030
002	...
003	What are you doing all the way out here?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
004	Honestly, I don't know. All of a sudden, I found myself in an unfamiliar place with monsters I'd never seen before.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0011
005	Do you know anything about all this?	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0031
006	You had to fight before you even knew what was going on? Somehow, that...almost suits you.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0025
007	Let's see, where do I even begin?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
008	...I see. The wind does feel a bit different here, now that you mention it.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0006
009	That's your biggest takeaway?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0026
010	Yes. Now that I know it's a different world, I just have to adjust myself to it, at which point I should be able to carry on as always, I imagine.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
011	Hey, Bell! The kid's awake! Get back here!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
012	Oh! Ais, sorry, but this is important. Let's finish catching up later!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0035
013	So...Kevin's gone off to make sure the child gets sent somewhere more secure.
014	...
015	It was just as I thought. It's the children who always pay the dearest prices out here.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0039
016	From what I was told, they were doing some kind of experiments, right? I can't imagine what they'd be trying to accomplish, though.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0002
017	Anyone who would round up abandoned kids to experiment on isn't in their right mind.
018	I don't care what those creeps were trying to accomplish, if they were sacrificing children to do it, it needs to be stopped.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
019	Sacrificing?!
020	There are objects called Philosopher's Stones, which provide the Alchemia needed to perform a powerful magic known as Alchemy.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
021	But Philosopher's Stones don't just come out of thin air. They require a certain...energy...to be produced.
022	Wait, are you saying...?!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0027
023	Whoever did this seems to be using Philosopher's Stones made from the life force of children to exercise control over the demons around here.
024	...
025	The monster that kid saw when running away...was probably one of them.	VO_ila.ila_sys_1034
026	It's possible it could've been the monster from my world, too. Though there's no way to know for sure.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0016
027	I guess some kind of Alchemia misfire is responsible for connecting our world with yours.
028	It's unconscionable, performing experiments like this on innocent children... It's the actual worst. The worst possible sort of filth and villainy there is. I can't stand it. It makes me sick.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
029	Me too. And I won't let them get away with it.
030	No matter what, I will stop them!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0013
031	Bell, you...
032	Look, Ila, I want to help you with this. No... I want to settle this matter with you, side by side.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
033	Okay. Let's take this scum down, then!
034	I will lend my aid in this fight as well.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0038
035	Ais!
036	Oh, you're Bell's friend.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0002
037	When there are people being terrorized by monsters...	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
038	Be it in this world or any other, what I must do remains the same.
039	I will slay those monsters.
040	Oho! Looks like we've gained another comrade while I was away. And you all seem to be good friends now, too!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0025
041	Who says they're my friends?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0047
042	Now, now. Since Kevin's back, we've got a full complement, so let's see if we can get to the bottom of this whole mess.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
