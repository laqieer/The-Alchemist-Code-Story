001	Now that is out of the way...	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0032
002	All that's left is to deal with Alraune!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0005
003	He...lp...me... Adventur...ers...pl...ease...
004	If we take her down, we'll all be able to go home!	VO_fencer.fencer_battle_1030
005	Indeed! This should also cure the infection plaguing the villagers!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0005
006	What do you mean? Does this monster have something to do with that?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
007	I fear that it is so. Greenish discoloration of the skin...? Yes, that sounds exactly like the disease caused by Alraune's spores! It is the Green Death!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0004
008	That is just as well. Taking down this beast means cutting off the source of the infection, as well as...	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0045
009	Helping us get home! Excellent. This simplifies things.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0045
010	Be careful! The Philosopher's Stone is incredibly powerful!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0020
011	All right! Here she comes!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0021
012	A-adventu...rers!
013	Welcome!
