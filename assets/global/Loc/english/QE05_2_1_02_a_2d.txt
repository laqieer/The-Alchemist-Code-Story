001	Urgh... The fire has made it all the way here?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
002	I just have to push through. Then I should be able to meet up with the other survivors!
003	Not as easy as I had hoped, but I cannot give up!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
004	Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0032
005	Isidore?! You returned!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1009
006	Kamui? Is that you?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
007	Yes! I was just on my way to the Chief's place.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
008	Malta... How is she?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
009	We were attacked during the ceremony. She escaped with Hisham and should be safely out of the village by now.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
010	She's okay?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0027
011	Yes, but if we don't stop the Royal Army here, they may soon target those who have escaped.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
012	We must find the Chief and figure out how to handle the situation. Do you know where he is?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
013	...	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
014	Isidore?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
015	I...have not seen him yet. The village is under attack on several fronts, so the warriors have been spread thin. We haven't been able to spare anyone to search for him.	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
016	I see...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0045
017	It seems we don't have the time for a proper discussion anyway.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
018	Looks like it. We'll just have to make it through this fight first. Will you lend me your strength?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
019	Of course, my friend. I must...protect... It is my duty to protect...!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0038
020	Thank you, old friend!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
