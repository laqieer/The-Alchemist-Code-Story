001	Saga region. Near the Wind Temple.
002	...So this is the settlement of the wind tribe-the resting place of the final Matter.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
003	But...what is this? There appears to be no sign of human life.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
004	... ...
005	Hey, how about you say something? I wouldn't mind burning down this entire landscape if I have to, you know?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
006	Are you an idiot? With all the commotion you've been causing, anyone would get a wind of what's going on.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0012
007	...What do you mean?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
008	The Alize people that live around here are the people that Seida grew up with.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0029
009	They're a tribe that's gifted in their ability "read the wind" and perceive what is going on around them.
010	You blast your way forward with no regard for your surroundings. I'd be more surprised if they hadn't picked up on you approaching.
011	So you're saying they've fled? Tsk. Anyway, let's head to that temple.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
012	It's pointless. Seida's tribe is an astute one. I highly doubt they've left any tracks.
013	That may not be the case.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
014	In fact...there's plenty of chance they may have left the Matter behind.
015	Listen to how quiet it is. Do you really think they've left the Matter here on its own? Of course not...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
016	There's a basis for my argument. Until now, each faction has kept their Matter in their temple.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
017	Most likely, they were all aware of my approach...yet they kept it in such an obvious place.
018	There may be some reason why they have to store their Matter in these temples.
019	That's just wishful thinking.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
020	Say whatever you want. Anyway, let's go.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0017
021	I can't afford to waste time here.
022	... ...
023	You've got to be kidding me. We've come this far. I won't let this opportunity escape me now. I'm going to find it all costs.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
024	The blue landscape.
025	Huh...?
026	That's what you said.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0003
027	You told me that you were looking for a sky like this-a beautiful deep, blue landscape.
028	What did you mean by that?
029	Why are you asking me now? What good would that information do you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
030	What good...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1002
031	If I understand your reasoning, we might be able to find a way to co-exist, right?
032	There may be another way that doesn't result in unnecessary casualties.
033	Understand? That's impossible.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
034	...Why?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
035	You can't ask someone to sing when they've never heard music before.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
036	You've lived peacefully in this world. There's no way you'd understand what it feels like to live at the bottom rung of the ladder.
037	Of course, I won't...not unless you take the time to explain it to me.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0031
038	Can you imagine a life where your very existence is a crime?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
039	What...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
040	Lost Blue is a city built by those who have fled their pursuers from all across the world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
041	If we were to try and express our existence, our pursuers would catch wind of us and our livelihoods would be destroyed.
042	Those who live there have no choice but to deny their own existence.
043	...!
044	In that dark underground, neither the beautiful sky or the ocean exists.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
045	As you can guess, in such an environment, obtaining food is no easy matter. Constant hunger and strife are daily occurrences there.
046	What exists in that place is envy and resentment towards those above the ground.
047	It is a colorless world where nothing but negative feelings swirl through the air.
048	That is the land where you were born and raised...
049	Yes. I believe that Lost Blue's current way of existence is wrong.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
050	The hopeless environment is one created by our predecessors who continued to neglect and flee from reality.
051	The people of Lost Blue have abandoned all hope. I want to lead them to the light.
052	The light...!
053	However, pipedreams alone will change nothing.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
054	In order to truly lead them to the light, it is necessary to have power-enough power to overwhelm the forces above ground.
055	So that's why, like Orion, you're also seeking the founders of Alchemy...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
056	The founders of Alchemy...? You underestimate my ambition.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
057	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
058	I'll ask you again: do you believe there is only one reality that exists?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
059	The founders of Alchemy...they're just one embodiment within this small world.
060	This world is just one amongst many. There is an equal amount of realities in existence.
061	...? What are you talking about? Are you saying that the founders' power isn't the one you are looking for?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0039
062	Indeed. The immense power I seek...you might even call it the origin of the founders of Alchemy.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
063	That power undoubtedly lies beyond that tower which leads to another dimensional layer. I am certain.
064	Which tower? Are you talking about the Tower of Babel in Northern Pride?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0031
065	No. It's similar, yet exists in another dimension. It is a distant tower that cannot be seen by the naked eye.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
066	The people of Lost Blue call this tower Veda.
067	Veda...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
068	...The summit of the tower has still not manifested itself yet.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
069	In order to make the summit visible and, thus, obtain immense power...
070	A considerable amount of Alchemic energy is required...energy comparable to that of the Sacred Stones.
071	Is that why...you're collecting the Matter?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
072	You could say that. Although, if I were to take my time, eventually I should gain access to the summit.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
073	However, with the Sacred Stone or the Matter's Alchemic energy, this could be achieved without wasting any time.
074	In other words, we could reach the summit immediately.
075	So...that's why you're serving under Greed Dike in their search for the Sacred Stones.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0044
076	Hey, hold on. Just so you're clear, we don't serve under them.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
077	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
078	We were originally searching for Slothstein's Sacred Stone, but...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
079	We couldn't seem to find it anywhere.
080	That's when Orion approached us with talk about the Matter's existence. He informed us that its power was comparable to the Sacred Stones.
081	We merely took on this mission on the basis of receiving the Matter as a reward. We're equal partners in this venture.
082	As a reward...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
083	For starters, the Matter doesn't belong to Greed Dike! It belongs to the tribes of Saga!
084	None of that really matters.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
085	Come on. We go to the Wind Temple. If the Matter has been left there then this will all be over.
086	It will be the end of all our troublesome problems.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
087	So...ultimately, this was all to fulfill your own desires. You're like a child.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
088	Huh...?
089	Are you telling me that Captain Monzein and all the tribesmen and tribeswomen were desecrated for the sake of appeasing a child like you?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
090	Seida!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
091	So...you're Seida, huh?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
092	You can try to dress up your actions as much as you like. Either way, what you and your people have done is unforgivable!
093	With this bow...I will avenge those who were robbed of their lives!
