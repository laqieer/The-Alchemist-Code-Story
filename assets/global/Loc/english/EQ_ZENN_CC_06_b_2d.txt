001	So, I have to know. Do samurais actually commit seppuku?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
002	Sep...puku?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
003	It's a Wadatsumi custom; a form of ritual suicide. I believe it's also called harakiri. It's where you pierce your own stomach with a katana.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
004	Eurgh!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0026
005	Gross! Why the heck would anyone do something like that?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
006	It's a form of penitence. A way to demonstrate one's willingness to atone for one's crimes.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
007	Y-you mean people do it willingly?! No way!
008	It's an incredibly painful way to go. A slow, torturous death—unless someone grants you the mercy of a beheading.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
009	Why don't they just get someone to behead them in the first place?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
010	And why does it have to be the stomach?! I mean, yikes! Ow! I'd take a beheading any day of the week—I mean, if I had to.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
011	Sometimes the leader or commander of an organization commits the act, sacrificing themself to protect the honor of their family and subordinates.
012	I see... "Take me instead," huh? That's certainly a very final way to get the message across.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
013	Unthinkable.
014	Right?!
015	Death achieves nothing.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
016	In this life, we don't have time to regret, or reflect on our mistakes. We best pay tribute to those who have fallen by moving ever forwards in their name.
017	...
018	The path of life takes many forms. For some of us it's a straight line, faithfully followed from beginning to end, with all side paths ignored.
019	For others it is a maze of indecisions and mistakes, with many forks in the road, much backtracking, and not a little wandering astray.
020	We may stumble, but only by standing up again and pressing on can we guarantee that we will someday reach the truth.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
021	True enough.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
022	Welcome to the Shadow Messiah. Vagrant, murderer, bodyguard... Whatever you may be, you may make yourself at home.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
023	Thank you for the meal, and for allowing me to stay the night. I am in your debt.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0033
024	Think nothing of it. It serves my interests as well as yours.
025	This lot have been starving for company, you see.
026	Huh?! No we haven't!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
027	It's so quiet here without Silma...and Spica...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
028	W-well, maybe she has, but not me! I don't get lonely or nothin'!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0011
029	From time to time, even I find myself missing how these halls used to ring with laughter...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
030	Ahahaha!
031	It's been a while since I've been able to give my wife a decent meal and a good night's rest.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
032	That you continue to fight, even after all you've been through—even after the death of your daughter, and the ruin of your wife's mind...
033	I must admit, I am impressed. You are clearly strong of will and determined in your purpose, unafraid to fight alone.
034	You know, I daresay we have something in common. We, too, seek to reset the world...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
035	And remove from it those who would harm our family.
036	We will achieve a new order, under which those we love will be provided for.
037	You...have a family?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
038	Her heart lives on within me...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
039	Eternally.
040	Maybe Yogi had a point...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
041	You're goin' to have a hard time fightin' off her attackers with her on your back like that.
042	I will proceed alone from this point on.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
043	No way! I’m a member of Shadow Messiah! I should always be with you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0020
044	I...I swore to Corvus that I would!
045	If you truly are a member of Shadow Messiah...then you are one with me, and you will inherit my will, Shadow Messiah Ila.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0038
046	Oh!
047	Protect Mia from harm.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0041
048	Yeah, okay...	VO_ila.ila_sys_0018
049	You are the ones who will inherit my will. You will carry my beliefs along the passage of time. Do I make myself clear?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
050	Y-yeah...
051	Yes.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0004
052	Zehn, I leave them in your care.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
053	Understood.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0038
054	Perhaps that was his version of committing seppuku.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0031
055	The Shadow Messiah was on the verge of collapse.
056	Maybe, by leaving it behind, he hoped to bury his past self...
057	I suppose this is why people seek companionship, or a place to call their own. We all need a receptacle in which to deposit our burdens when they grow too heavy.
058	Who do I turn to now, Mitsu?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
059	Y-you're not going to kill yourself, are you?!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0025
060	Believe me, I would if I could.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
061	Wh-what?!
062	But I can't leave her behind.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
063	S-so, what? You're just going to carry her around with you? Forever?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
064	Besides...the only thing that deserves a place around my neck is this.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0030
065	What's...?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0006
066	This scarf was their birthday present to me.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
067	I'm going to hold on to it, no matter how much it hurts.
068	(And I will hold on to this, no matter how much it hurts!)	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
069	A zebra could never hope to best a lion.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
070	Obviously. I am well aware of that.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0016
071	Then why don't you give up? Your pitiful resistance is only delaying the inevitable.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
072	Hmph. You don't understand, do you?
073	What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
074	There was once one who put the lion in his place.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
075	In one fell swoop, he managed to delay the invasion of Wadatsumi, force the abolishment of Imperial Security, and rob you of a valuable pawn.
076	Not only that, but I've heard tell that when Greed Dike's hostilities suddenly stopped, some fled Wadatsumi, allowing them to escape the chaos to come.
077	Tch!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
078	Make no mistake, the man you thought so little of changed the fate of a nation right under your nose!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
079	However minute an effect that might have had on history, it cannot be denied that he left a scratch right across your snout, lion!
080	What are you trying to say, whelp? What part of this do you claim I fail to understand?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
081	You still don't get it? Well, then, allow me to enlighten you: He proved that you can be harmed by the weak.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
082	Hmph. If you're quite done spouting nonsense, I'm ready to finish this.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
083	Come, now. What's the hurry? You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
084	Hah. You're amusing, I'll give you that.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
085	In that case...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
086	You ought to remember me!
087	But just in case...I'll give you something to remember me by!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_battle_0040
088	Fool... You cannot touch me.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
089	Satisfied?
090	Thanks for clearing the room.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
091	So kind of you to grant him the opportunity for his little battle to take place.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
092	I merely showed him the respect a warrior deserves.
093	What are you going to do about that fellow he mentioned... D. Lily, was it? Will you have a different agent of the Elite Guard take care of him?
094	D. Lily?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
095	We are still searching for him, of course.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0031
096	My survival of the fittest policy remains intact. Nothing has changed.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
097	I expected as much.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
098	At least...not within the beliefs I hold as ruler of this nation.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
099	Oh?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
100	I find myself wondering... What was the point of scrapping Imperial Security to create the Elite Guard?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
101	Was it not because you wanted an organization to guard you more closely?
102	Hmph. That was rhetorical; I wasn't asking you. Anyway, to return to our previous subject... Who's this D. Lily you mentioned?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
103	What? Surely you jest! Was he not the traitor who tried to kill you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0025
104	Did that happen?
105	It's not ringing any bells. Whoever they were, I've clean forgotten them.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
