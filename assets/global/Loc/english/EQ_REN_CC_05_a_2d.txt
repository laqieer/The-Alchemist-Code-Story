001	Now I think... My sister really was a terrible liar.
002	She may have not lied to me directly, but she didn't tell me everything. I think that's not so different from lying.
003	I didn't understand what following the code meant.
004	For Natsume, it meant protecting the people who created and followed it.
005	Just like how the Scarlet Flame Guard fought to protect their code and their beliefs.
006	She was protecting me, too.
007	Even though she knew that doing so would take a toll on her body.
008	Really... She was a clumsy fool.
009	You're an idiot, Natsume.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
010	But the fact that I never noticed how you felt...
011	That makes me an even bigger idiot.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
012	Natsume, I...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
013	I wonder how you died.
014	I spent years slaying demons, exterminating evil, and protecting Wadatsumi from corruption.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
015	I didn't know how long my body would last. The knowledge that I was running out of time was exactly why I was able to devote myself to the code as I did.
016	I wanted to protect it all. Ren, Wadatsumi, their futures.
017	I'm sure I'll die well before I'm able to achieve that.	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0019
018	I don't wish for a quiet, peaceful death. If I'm to die before completing my goal, I'd rather leave behind whatever I can.
019	The moment I thought it, I began to truly feel just how short my remaining time was.
020	What remains beyond all the killing? Nothing could change the fact that my body was dying.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0043
021	I had no excuse to talk down to Ren like I did.
022	I'm ashamed of how I spoke to him.
023	I see... So he's in Envylia...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
024	I hope you're well, Ren... I'm...
025	I...
026	It seems I have to leave the code and my dreams in your hands after all...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
027	Even after all I've tried to do to prevent it from coming to this... It's so frustrating!
028	...
029	Someone prepare me some paper and a brush.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
030	Thank you. Please, give me some privacy.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0033
031	Now, then...
032	"I'm sorry, Ren." Ha. Hahahaha.
033	After wielding a sword for so long, I can't even hold a brush...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0011
034	So be it. This is what fate has decided for me.
035	It may be pitiful of me, but I must ask you to exorcise the demons.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
036	The Shiba Senko have been up to no good, and their actions have caused the number of demons to rise.
037	This should be my responsibility, but my body can no longer handle it.
038	Laugh and curse at me as much as you like, I don't mind. But for the good of our code...	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0022
039	I must ask for your help.
040	I don't want to burden my sweet little brother any more than I have to, but I couldn't think of anyone else who could take on this responsibility.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
041	Not because you're my brother. Not because you're a Black Star. Not because of our code.
042	But because I would give everything to protect you.
043	That's why I trust you with this.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
044	In addition, it's possible that we may need someone with Black Star blood. That is our current situation.
045	You are under no obligation to accept. This has nothing to do with the code. It is a simple request from me, your sister.
046	I want you to be the one to do this.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
047	I'm afraid it's difficult for me to write any more. I don't know if you'll read this letter. But...	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0019
048	I wanted to entrust you with this one thing of mine at the end of my days, Ren.
049	Selfish, aren't I?
050	Even I'm surprised. All my life I've adhered strictly to our code, and yet now that my life is at its end I want to ask for something completely unrelated.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
051	I don't expect you to forgive me. I understand if you hate me.
052	I just don't want to die lying to you.
053	This is my honest, selfish request.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
054	Please... Please...
055	...
056	The only thing I can do now...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
057	And so you resist within your restrictions... I've taken a liking to you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
058	Should I care?
059	Maybe. Have you heard this?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
060	The blade Sumeragi is no longer enshrined where it once was.
061	Don't be ridiculous! The Kagomurasaki have protected Sumeragi for generations.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
062	Even if what you are saying is true, as the head of the Black Star clan, the true wielders of the blade, I would have been informed of it.
063	Yes, usually that would be the case. However, other forces are in play.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0037
064	...Is that so?
065	You've heard, haven't you? About Jin, the older brother of Yomi, the head of the Kagomurasaki.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0003
066	...The man who killed his own family.
067	Yes. It seems that Yomi has left Wadatsumi in pursuit of Jin.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
068	You mean to say that in her absence the sword has been moved? How do you know this?
069	The Shiba Senko are making moves. They plan to bring corruption never before seen to this land.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
070	Add the goings-on with the Kagomurasaki, it's only natural that the dying head of the Black Star wouldn't be informed.
071	Only a very small number of the Kagomurasaki are aware that Yomi is pursuing Jin. They don't want to worry the Black Star any more than necessary.
072	Or at least that's what they say. I'm sure they don't want it getting out that there is internal strife within their ranks.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0012
073	I asked you why you know all this.
074	Didn't I tell you? I have my own goals. It just so happens that I hear quite a lot in the process of pursuing them.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
075	I believe that Wadatsumi will be faced with a great crisis in the near future. One that may call for the use of Sumeragi.
076	...!	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0019
077	I hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not...	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
078	...
079	...I suppose it's time to go.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
080	Lady Natsume! You'll aggravate your condition!
081	Don't try to stop me. This is for the Black Star and for Wadatsumi.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
082	But...
083	I hope you'll be kind enough to grant me this final bit of selfishness. This final wish: let me go.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0035
084	...!
085	I can still wield a sword, but...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
086	I am no longer what I once was.
087	Urgh!	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0043
088	(It feels heavier than it used to... If I fight like this, I'll...)
089	...!
090	I can't watch this.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
091	You...
092	You're about ready to keel over on the spot. Is your code really so important?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
093	No. I'm doing this for me.
094	I still don't understand you. You'd use the remainder of your life on something like this?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
095	I don't need for you to understand me.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
096	If you're here, that must mean that you're going to Sumeragi. Is that right?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
097	I don't need any help.
098	No need to be so strong.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
099	I said I don't need any help.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
100	If you're allowed to act selfishly, then so am I.
101	I'd like to see where this leads you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
102	You're a strange man.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0010
103	As I said before, I've taken an interest in you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
104	You planned for me to come here, didn't you?
105	And if I did?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
106	That doesn't change what I have to do. I'm going to die how I want to die.
107	It's better to burn out than to fade away.
