001	U-um...!
002	Huh?!
003	What are you doing here?!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
004	Thank you, sir! M'lady! I came out here to try and take care of these baddies myself!
005	But then I got scared, and hid—but before I knew it, the two of you showed up, and took them all out like a couple of whirlwinds! Thanks so much!
006	It's good to be brave, but you mustn't try and tackle problems like this yourself, all right?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0014
007	I-I know... It's just like dad said.
008	He told me that if money can free the village from those creatures, then no price is too steep.
009	But then...what're we gonna do if it happens again? We don't have that much money.
010	That's why I tried to take care of it myself, but the moment I saw those things, I got so scared...
011	Well... I think it's great that you want to protect the people of your village. You should definitely hold on to that!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0007
012	B-but... I did want to protect the village, but to tell you the truth, I also wanted to get away from it for a bit.
013	Why? If you're the son of the mayor, you don't have anything to worry about! You've got status and money...the whole shebang!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0010
014	But... I should be able to do so much more for the village than my father—if I just had more freedom!
015	Ahh... You're still a child. Did you really think that you would find your freedom just wandering around outside the village?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0001
016	So long as we live amongst others in this world, none of us will have complete freedom.
017	B-but...
018	Tut-tut! I won't hear any more arguments. Think about your father! He gathered together an enormous amount of money just to protect your village!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0016
019	If you can't see that the freedom you speak of is not worth betting on, then I'm afraid you're doomed to die an untimely death.
020	That's going a bit far, Strie... Kid, you tried to protect your village in your own way, and that's better than sitting on your hands and doing nothing.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0011
021	The name's Won. I'm a jack of all trades. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0007
022	I'm not taking on any apprentices right now, but I can train you up a bit!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
023	Whether you train on your own or have me help you is entirely up to you, kid. You just do whatever you think is right. Protect the village however you see fit.
024	Got it! Um... Thank you both so much for protecting our village!
025	Tee hee hee! You are a businessman through and through, aren't you, Won?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0008
026	Duh! Never know what's gonna make you money! Looks like everything's in order here, though. No more monsters. Shall we head back?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0005
027	Yes, let's.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
028	You fought well! How about I buy you a drink?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
029	Oh, uh... Thanks.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0011
030	Oh? Hiding something again, are we?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0002
031	No, that's not it. I just... Thanks, Strie.
032	Oh, my. What's gotten into you all of a sudden?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0025
033	Nothing! That stuff you said earlier... It really made me think about what freedom means to me. That's all.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
034	And have you found your answer?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0006
035	Nope! But...I did remember something.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0008
036	And what would that be?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0005
037	The reason I left home... It did have a lot to do with sticking it to my dad, but that wasn't all there was to it.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
038	I was determined to win my freedom with my own two fists.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0024
039	That's how I felt, but then everything you said to that villager kid really resounded with me, so I got to thinking... Who would that freedom actually serve, anyway?
040	Oops! Did I accidentally lecture you, too?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0031
041	Nah... Well, it wouldn't have been such a bad thing, anyway.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0005
042	Ooohh, I don't like this at all! Courtesy doesn't suit you a bit!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0012
043	Your freedom lies in fulfilling your own desires; mine doesn't. Have I just been rebelling against the world?	VO_wong.wong_sys_0031
044	I'm starting to wonder if what I wanted was just...hollow.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0008
045	Hollow, hm? And so what if it was? You want to get rich, don't you? It's up to you to make that happen, little man!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0044
046	If you want freedom, you must claim it for yourself!
047	Heh! Tell you what. The next time we see each other, I'll make sure I have my answer ready!
048	I look forward to hearing it.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
049	All right! Now that that's all settled, the next one's on me! Cheers, big ears!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0023
050	Doubt...	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0010
051	Not that again! I'm serious over here!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0025
052	Really? Are you sure you don't mind?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0009
053	Yup! It's the least I can do.	VO_wong.wong_sys_0005
054	I haven't done anything to earn it, but I will graciously accept. Cheers!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0033
055	Hey, Strie? Let's go on another job together sometime!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0002
056	I'd love to.	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
057	I don't wanna think about things for a while. My brain needs a time out!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0004
058	And your pockets need to be filled?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0007
059	Pfft! Anyway, if nothing else, I trust in the strength of my fists, and in the Tiger-King Fist! At least that's a technique that's designed to live and let live!
060	There we go. Now you're sounding more like yourself!	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0004
061	I think I'd even bet on you, you know.
062	Heh. Like I want a hopeless gambler like you betting on me anyway!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0007
063	Like I said... I'm gonna snatch back my freedom with my own two fists! These babies'll never let me down, you can bet on that!	VO_wong.wong_sys_0038
064	Ahh! That's the spirit! And speaking of spirits, why don't you buy me another drink?	VO_sutorie.sutorie_sys_0023
065	Sorry, I'm out of cash!
