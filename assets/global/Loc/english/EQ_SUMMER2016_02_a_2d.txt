001	Who are you lot?! What makes you think you can just step onto my ship?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0001
002	Hmph! Come on! You're the one who's docking your ship here without permission!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0012
003	Who are you, you little pipsqueak? Where are your parents?!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0004
004	Shut up! You don't have to talk so loud. We can hear you.	VO_charis.charis_sys_0049
005	Monsters have been emerging one after another from this ship. It's bothering those who've come to visit the sea.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
006	And how's that supposed to concern me?	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0029
007	I've claimed this harbor as my own. Do you realize that you're trespassing right now?
008	Hey, you can't do that! You're incredibly selfish!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0032
009	Huh? Sorry, I couldn't hear what you said.	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0012
010	Cowards, shame on you!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
011	Shame? Gwahahah!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0007
012	Wh-what's so funny?	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
013	Shame has nothing to do with this! For a man of the sea, power is everything!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0010
014	I am the leader of the Black Keels, Gormalas!
015	If you have any complaints, tell them to me after you've taken out all the monsters!	VO_gormalas.gormalas_sys_0023
016	Arghhh! He's so infuriating!	VO_rin.rin_sys_0013
017	What's his deal?! I'm so annoyed! Let's hurry up and take him out!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0029
018	Yes, let's!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0006
