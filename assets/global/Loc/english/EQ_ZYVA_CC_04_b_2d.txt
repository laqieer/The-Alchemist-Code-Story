001	Prototype Zero.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
002	Resurrection has never taken so long before.
003	Hah...hrgh...haa...ungaaah!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0027
004	What happened?
005	I-I... I d-don't want to r-re...remem...ber.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
006	Answer me. Now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
007	A-all of th-them were...there. A-all of them were...d-dead. The researchers. The test subjects. E-everyone...	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
008	All of them except you.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
009	Every...day...h-he would elect someone to participate in m-measuring the results of the experiments that were c-c-conducted on the prototypes of Corpses and the Immortals.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
010	These measurements were supposed to be taken by criminals or by soldiers who had been deemed w-worthless. They were designed to provide evidence of the prototypes' strength.
011	It was suicide mission. No ordinary human could hope to face the prototypes and l-live.
012	H-however he s-survived, multiple t-times, growing stronger and stronger, until he was capable of rendering entire battalions of Immortals to bits of f-f-flesh and bone, from which resurrection was impossible.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0019
013	He was...! He was no longer worthy or capable of being human. Heartless, inhumanely powerful...!
014	Aaaaaaaaaaghhh! Agh...no...! Stop! I beg you! No more! Don't...aaaaughhh! I-I-I...aaaaaaaaaauughhhhhhh!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0028
015	His mental faculties will need to be altered if he is to be of any further use to us.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
016	This calls for a temporary suspension.
017	That goes for the warrior replication and the soldiers' immortalization, too.
018	Ughhhh... Unnnngghhhhh...	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0019
019	He laughed as if...as if he were bored.
020	He killed me over, and over, and over again, and whenever I came back to life...
021	He was always laughing...idly...	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
022	Yet despite his false laugh, he would say that it was...amusing.
