001	Oh... This is a settlement of this region? Look at the ice covering the streets and the buildings. It's very...I'm not sure how to put this...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0046
002	Peaceful. It seems like a truly lovely place. This calm and quiet is something that I wish our homeland shared.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
003	...
004	Oh!
005	Nimul! Thank goodness you're all right!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
006	Emmel! You are unharmed?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
007	Oooh, look at that, Adaleigh! Your girl is totally abandoning you for that guy!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
008	Uh, that's her brother.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0011
009	Seriously? I had no idea siblings could get along so well.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
010	Yeah, the two of us are always butting heads.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
011	Oh yeah.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
012	I mean, if Nyx was just a little more perceptive, maybe we'd get along better.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
013	And if only Mira could be a little more thoughtful, then maybe we wouldn't have so many problems.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
014	Glad to see the two of you are having fun.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
015	Sorry, Adaleigh, we just can't help it! You should try to be less interesting when we poke fun at you.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
016	Plus, our teacher is always super supportive when we mess around like this. How could we resist?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
017	Ugh! Gimme a break...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
018	So you two are Mira and Nyx?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
019	Yep! Who're you?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
020	I am called Nimul.
021	You saved Emmel and Adaleigh, correct? I am indebted to the both of you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
022	...
023	...
024	Nah, bro! We were just doing what any friend would do. Saving their butts in their time of need!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
025	We are delighted that we could help protect the people you hold dear.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
026	Thank you, truly.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
027	I must ask...that power you possess, what is it exactly?
028	Huh? You mean Space-Time Manipulation?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
029	Space-Time...Manipulation?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
030	How long are you children planning to mill around out here? Let's get going.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
031	Fine... Ambrosia, you're so impatient sometimes. You're gonna get wrinkles like that!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
032	Uh, Mira? You shouldn't talk to Ambrosia about age—	VO_nix.nix_sys_0040
033	Why would you bring that up?!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
034	Yikes! Ambrosia, you make my hair stand on end when you yell like that!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
035	All right, I'll head back first and get some tea ready.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
036	Ugh... I don't know why I ever decided to bother with apprentices.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
037	Listen up, visitors from another world. Our home is down this street, beyond the hill and the grove.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
038	Take your time and explore. Once your curiosity has been sated, you may find us there.
039	I thank you for your kindness, but there is something we must do, and posthaste.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
040	We cannot really afford the leisure of sightseeing.
041	Ah, youth. Always in such a rush.
042	How exactly do you intend to get where you need to go? If I am not mistaken, you have yet to plan that far ahead.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0002
043	I...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
044	Don't waste your energy running in circles.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
045	Better to take a break, until panic and worry cease to be at the forefront of your mind. You can't do anything right now, anyway.
046	...
047	This...really is a lovely place.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
048	How interesting that you think so.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
049	Wh-what?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
050	Never mind. In any case, it's time for me to head back home and take a rest. It's been a while since I got wrapped up in kerfuffle like this.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
051	Interesting? I wonder what she meant by that...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
052	Nimul, what should we do?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
053	Ah. Well...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
054	I want to return to the Sephira village as soon as possible.
055	However, what that woman said is true. It will be no simple matter.
056	The ship is where we left it, and it still needs repairs.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
057	We should take this time to figure out a way to get around the Cursed Beast and repair the ship.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
058	It's likely that we will have to face the Cursed Beast again in order to accomplish our mission.
059	How are we going to do that? It all seems...impossible.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
060	Here, we have none of the Sephiron's protection. Without it, there's no way for us to make full use of our Spiritbonding abilities. And...
061	Even the Matter wasn't able to do anything to the Cursed Beast.
062	That's...true.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
063	...
064	We have no other cards to play. We have no choice but to try and figure something else out, and soon.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
065	Like what?
066	In a settlement of this size, there must be a blacksmith, or somewhere with a forge of some kind. Perhaps I can borrow it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
067	Oh! I wanna use it, too! I know which parts I need to repair the ship!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
068	If I could somehow get my hands on those, or make them, I should be all set when we get back to the ship!
069	I was just thinking something of the same. I believe that it is worth seeing what might be useful to us in this settlement.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
070	Besides, I think it might be good for me to take some time to collect my thoughts.
071	What was that last, Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
072	Er, nothing.
073	In that case, should we show you around?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
074	Whoa! What?! How long have you been here?! Don't just jump out like that!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0026
075	I thought the two of you had gone home?
076	Uh, yeah? And now we're back!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
077	We know this place better than the back of our hands.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
078	With Space-Time Manipulation, we can be wherever we want in a snap!
079	All we need to do is mess with magil a little and we can play time and space like a fiddle!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
080	We can avoid enemy attacks, and jump from one place to another...!
081	The manipulation of time and space?! What an incredible ability! I never imagined that there could be such a thing! This Belt Region is beyond all of my expectations...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0024
082	Actually, we're still just apprentices, so messing with time's a little outside of our reach right now. And space? Well...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
083	You'd be really surprised how limited this ability is. Everyone thinks it's super cool, but there are a lot of rules.
084	There are only certain distances that can be traveled, and only a certain amount of weight that can be moved at once...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
085	Nyx, why're you always so negative? Always focusing on the bad side of things!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
086	No, I just think that it's important to know your own limits.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0003
087	So Space-Time Manipulation is a way of using magil in this Belt Region?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
088	Uh...I guess?
089	Mira! Come on, you know the answer to that. It's got nothing to do with this Belt Region. It's a technique unique to us! Or...I guess to Ambrosia. She's the one who came up with it, after all.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
090	Oh, right! Ambrosia invented it. Isn't that cool? I don't like to brag, but I am a little better at it than Nyx.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
091	And since this is a bit of an eccentric type of magic, we're...not so great at the so-called regular magics.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
092	We're doing our best to learn them, though!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
093	Is magic something that everyone is able to use here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
094	I mean, not everyone, but, um... Yes, it's about that time... Oh, look at that!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0003
095	What? That person?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
096	Just keep watching. Look! Did you see that?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
097	They created fire...from thin air. It is nothing compared to what Spiritbonding can achieve, however.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0046
098	That person is a lamp lighter! Their job is to light the lamps when it starts to get dark, so that there'll still be light at night!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
099	We use magic to light fires in our stoves and hearths. We even use it for hunting!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
100	I see. In the Sephira village, we ascribe a certain divinity to our Spiritbonding, but the value of magic here lies in how it has been incorporated into your daily lives.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
101	Wow! Has our humble little home piqued your interest?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
102	Let me tell you more!
103	Ah, thank you, but I... Er...all right. Please, if you would let go of me, I can really walk on my own.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
104	This way! There's more to see over here! Come on!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
105	Looks like Mira's taken quite a liking to Nimul.
106	Maybe, but I think she's also just excited to show someone around.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
107	We don't get many opportunities to do stuff like this. Mostly it's just Ambrosia getting mad at us.
108	She's really strict, huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
109	Like I said...lots of rules.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
110	Space-Time Manipulation isn't magic that's easily controlled...and if it's not done right, the consequences can be dire and difficult to predict.
111	Sounds dangerous. Ahem...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
112	Hey! Don't run away! That's hurtful! You think I'm going to do something to you?!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0039
113	Anyway, so...yeah. Ambrosia can be pretty strict.
114	Plus, Mira's...well, Mira.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
115	Sometimes she just goes ahead and does what she wants, and then the both of us get punished. Ambrosia's not one to let us off lightly.
116	I see...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
117	...
118	Nimul, I'll go with you! Wait for me!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
119	Hm? Are you also interested in magic?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
120	Um...yes! Of course! Especially the way you talk about it. You really make it sound really very...interesting.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
121	Wow, okay! Come on, you two! Let's go! I leave the others to you, Nyx!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
122	Yeah, yeah... All right, you two. What did you say you're looking for again?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
123	A forge, or any kind of large hearth where we can do some smithing.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
124	Ohh...right. Well...	VO_nix.nix_sys_0011
125	Is there a problem?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
126	Let's just go and take a look around. Adaleigh, are you—huh? Adaleigh?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0005
127	Uh, yeah? Huh? Emmel went with Mira and Nimul...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
128	Adaleigh... You're really easy to read, you know that? You said that last part out loud, by the way.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
129	Oops... I mean, hey! What're you trying to say? I can be—I mean, I am mysterious! Cool and mysterious, a man among men!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
130	Yeah, yeah. If you say so. Shall we go on then, Yna?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
131	Yes. The sooner, the better.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
132	Huh? Where are you...? Hey, don't just ignore me and leave me behind!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
133	...
134	Hm...
135	Where is everyone? I seem to have missed them.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0016
136	Well...
137	I suppose it's not really necessary for me guard Nimul and the others in a place like this.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
138	If Julia were here, I could simply leave that task to her.
139	Oh, a visitor?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0002
140	How unexpected! We don't get many visitors. Which settlement do you hail from? Are you here on your own?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0003
141	What brings you here?
142	Oh, I, um...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
143	(What should I say?! If I tell them I'm from another Belt Region, would they even believe me? I didn't expect to have to explain my presence here...)
144	You've so many questions for our guest! Don't you see you're making him uncomfortable? What kind of welcome is that?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
145	Besides, there's really only one reason young people come around these parts.
146	I suppose you're right. I'm truly sorry about that, Stranger.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0035
147	N-no, it's fine.
148	(What a relief. At least I don't have to explain myself now.)
149	Apologies for interrupting your search. I hope you find a good partner for yourself soon.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0036
150	We'll be rooting for you! You never know when your love story is going to unfold! The perfect person might be waiting just around the corner!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0007
151	Wh-what?
152	What a lovely gentleman you are! Where is your better half?	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0003
153	You must've just got here. Were there any available women left in town? You know, I'm not sure...
154	Oh no, we can't have this!
155	Hm?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
156	What're you gentlemen all huddling together for?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0002
157	A crowd of men like this is way too intimidating for a young woman to approach alone! This is all wrong!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0030
158	What? We're just⁠—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
159	Ahh, perhaps you don't know much about attraction? That's just no good, my friend.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
160	There must be someone around here who piques your interest. Don't be shy! Just go ahead and talk to them!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0007
161	Love is great! It can change your entire life! It's so wonderful, I want everyone to know how it feels!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
162	Ah... Right. I'd forgotten that this region was like this.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
163	They're friendly, but, uh...a bit preoccupied with love, you could say.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
164	...
165	Which reminds me, Nyx! You didn't say anything about this at all! What's with that?
166	Nyx...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
167	Huh? You done talking? Let's go.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0004
168	Uh...okay...
169	How should I put this?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
170	If I were to describe this place in a few words, they would be "overflowing with love."
171	That's a really pretty way to put it, Mister Nimul!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
172	Do you disagree?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
173	I dunno. I mean, what really is love? I wouldn't know the first thing about it.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
174	You don't have a crush on anyone, Mira?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
175	Nah... I mean, there's no one here for me, really.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
176	That can't be true. I don't believe that.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
177	Ooohh, what about you, Emmel? Have you ever been, you know, in love?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
178	Um, well...no. I guess I haven't.
179	Then we're the same!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
180	Perhaps, but...I do have an idea of what love might be.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
181	What? Really?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
182	After witnessing it from up close for so long...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
183	Oooh! Sounds juicy. Tell me more! Tell me everything!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
184	U-um...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
185	Hm...?
186	It's, um...it's a secret! I made a promise to never tell anyone about it, ever.
187	You promised? Aw, man. Well, I guess it is what it is. I'm so curious, though...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
188	Anyway, on with the tour! So, the origins of this fountain are...
189	Such beauty...
190	M-Miss!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
191	O-oh? Me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
192	Yes, Miss! You!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0004
193	My name is Winnick. I apologize for approaching you so abruptly—I simply had to speak to you!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0036
194	O-oh, okay. How can I help you?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
195	Um...so...well...	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0049
196	I-I have fallen in love with you! It was love at first sight!
197	Please, would you do me the honor of becoming my better half?
198	Wh-what?!
199	That's very...direct.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
200	I-I... Thank you, but I am not interested. I don't even know you.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
201	I know we've just met. I don't blame you for thinking that way.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0005
202	I completely understand that you might be suspicious because we don't know anything about each other. I might have come on a little strong, and yet...
203	I am completely and utterly captivated by you! Please, just give me a chance!
204	B-but I don't... Nimul?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
205	Er, I'd rather stay out of it. It's up to you to decide how you want to respond.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
206	Yes, but...! This is just so sudden!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
207	Are you really okay with this, Mister Nimul?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
208	As her brother, I feel a little conflicted, but...it's her life. She has to make her own decisions.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
209	My duty is simply to watch carefully and ensure that, whoever she chooses, they treat her right.
210	That's a little unexpected. You said you were...Sephirans, was it? Your people are way more open-minded than I thought!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
211	Open-minded? What do you...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
212	I-in any case, this really isn't the time! I'm sorry, but I cannot return your feelings. Please leave me alone.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0014
213	Oh... All right. I understand.
214	I apologize for troubling you. Excuse me.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0036
215	Are you sure, Emmel? He was quite the looker.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
216	What? What are you saying, Nimul? If I'd really decided to go with him, surely you would have stopped me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0012
217	I'm not sure. I would have needed to see what kind of man he really was first.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
218	To be frank, I am altogether unfamiliar with this area...
219	But I must say, he had quite some nerve to approach my little sister and ask to spend time with her! A stranger! It is not such a simple thing to become a part of this family, let me tell you!
220	I told you! You're so overprotective.
221	I am well aware!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
222	Anyway, this is no time for such things.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
223	Our priority is to return to the Sephira village as soon as possible! Is that not so?
224	Right. Of course.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
225	Hah! You two are so interesting.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
226	Have you seen enough of our little town, then?
227	Yes. Thank you for the tour.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0034
228	I would like to discuss our next move with everyone.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
229	I believe we need only follow this road to get to the witch's abode?
230	Yep, yep! Ambrosia's house is straight down this road and—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0004
231	Eek...ekk...keke...	VO_albarmin.albarmin_battle_0028_a
232	What is this?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
233	An insect? I've never seen something like this before...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
234	Ah. Well, we've gotten kinda close to the outskirts of town.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0011
235	Ekk! Ekk! Keke!	VO_albarmin.albarmin_battle_0001
236	Get ready, you two! We're gonna bust our way through to Ambrosia's!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
237	Just do me a favor, okay?
238	These guys are just a little excited, so be gentle. They don't mean anything by it!
239	Oh, um...okay.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0038
240	Here they come!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
