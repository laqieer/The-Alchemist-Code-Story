001	Its wounds are closing?!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0020
002	Its strength is annoying enough, but no matter how much we hit or stab him, it just won't go down! What kind of immortal monster is this?!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
003	That said—
004	I got this, Andechs! Make room!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
005	That's what I wanted to hear!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
006	Huh? Eeeek!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
007	Oh? What is this chill?	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0019
008	Good, now that it's frozen we can—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
009	What?! It managed to break through some of my most powerful alchemy!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
010	I know you... Those who defeated the Pillar of Envy.	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0001
011	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
012	That which is beyond the humans power. You that try to overcome the taboo... The next sin you seek to obtain is mine.
013	This world is naught but the law of the wicked. The flame that scorches all in its path—	VO_dirtyflame.dirtyflame_battle_0003
014	I knew it. Your words are not merely random! You've got an intellect! Does that mean you also carry a free will?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
015	...
016	There's no point in talking! We've got to run!
017	Ngh... "I am Transcender of the Gate of Gl—"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
018	(This guy's fast! I don't have time to deploy my alchemy!)
019	—That's enough of this.
020	Oh?
021	What's this? Is our dear Sulva planning to betray his beloved queen?
022	...
023	I don't know.
024	But I can't let this continue.
025	This sword, the Red Blade, was made to be wielded for one specific purpose.
026	Huh? This is—!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
027	This sword obeys the rightful ruler of the Ira Belt.
028	You will be able to use your full power as long as I'm recognized by this sword. Just like that serpent.
029	Whoaa! I can feel it! The magil around us is stabilizing!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
030	Nimul! We'll be able to do this!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
031	Indeed. Well then...
032	Thanks for gathering in one place. It'll make it easier to burn you down.
033	There's more of them?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
034	Leave these balls of flame to me. You all should go after the serpent.
