001	Phew! I think we got 'em all.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0022
002	What is going on? It's not normal for octopuses to attack like this.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0031
003	This island region has always been densely populated by octopuses.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
004	However, it was not until very recently that a giant octopus came along and began banding all of its kin together.
005	They've always been a rowdy bunch, but now they're organized to boot. It's turning into a bit of a problem.
006	R-really?!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
007	I am afraid so... Yet, despite the danger, there is one who failed to heed my many warnings.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
008	...
009	It's nothing new, of course. Xiao-Xiao has always had a terrible sense of direction. However, these creatures can be quite tricky to deal with alone...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
010	...
011	What's the matter, Xiao-Xiao?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
012	U-um... Liu Shen, I...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
013	There's no need to look so worried. It'll be all right. I will find her. It is the duty of the first mate to take care of his captain.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0007
014	B-but, um...Shenmei is...probably...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
015	I am going to take care of it. You wait here, all right, Xiao-Xiao?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
016	O-okay...
017	...
018	Hmmm...
019	I am going to go and search for my captain. Would you mind looking after Xiao-Xiao for me?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
020	Uhh... Sure. Okay.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0037
021	Thank you. I apologize for the trouble. We will commence our patrol as soon as Xiao-Xiao is found safe.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0034
022	Um...
023	What the—?! Where am I?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
024	How did I get in a cave? I was chasing after that suspicious shadow, but I don't remember coming in here...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
025	...
026	...
027	Waiting is so boring! I'd definitely rather be patrolling than just standing around like this.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0030
028	U-um...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0031
029	The name's Bertha! I'm a gunner in the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment. And this is Sharon!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0007
030	Pleased to make your acquaintance.
031	N-nice to...m-meet you.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
032	...
033	Hey, Su Yi? Is there something you want to say? Something you're holding back?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0003
034	H-huh?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
035	You've been making this face for a while now—like something's troubling you.	VO_berta.berta_sys_0005
036	U-um...
037	If you have something to say, you ought to say it. You can't expect people to read your mind.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0001
038	U-um...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
039	O-octopus...
040	Huh? Octopus?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0006
041	U-um... I... I mean...	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0018
042	Well? It's no good just saying octopus. You've got to explain yourself properly!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
043	I-I...
044	...
045	I-I'm going to go and look for Shenmei, too!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0036
046	H-hey! Wait!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
047	Su Yi! Come back!
048	Why'd she run off all of a sudden?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
049	There she is!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0025
050	Oh no!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0026
