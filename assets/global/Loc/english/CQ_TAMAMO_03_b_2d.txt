001	Hyaahhh!!!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_0009
002	I'm gonna become...collateral damage again...ughh!	VO_hayate.hayate_battle_0025
003	Wh-what strength! Y-you monster!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
004	Chief, please, don't leave us behind!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
005	Ehehe. Wait, did I overdo it again?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0011
006	... ...
007	Ko-Kon, don't get mad! I haven't really hurt you this time!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0029
008	...Lady Tamamo.
009	Oh, Hayate! Where were you hiding? Hey...are you okay?! You're covered in wounds!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0021
010	These wounds were inflicted by you, Lady Tamamo. Also, I was lying over there afterwards the whole time.	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1002
011	Oh, I see. Hahah♪ When I get too mad, sometimes I become unaware of my surroundings...	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1007
012	So you got hurt again. I-I'm sorry... You're pretty scary as well, Hayate.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0036
013	... ...
014	I'm sorry for bothering your training! Well then, let's return to Kuzunoha village, Kon.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0018
015	Seriously! You should be embarrassed about allowing those scum to almost trick you!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
016	Yeah...you're right...I'm sorry for troubling you as well, Hayate.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0049
017	That being said...I should be even more embarrassed about having been saved by you!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0016
018	Hayate...?
019	That's why, in the future...Lady Tamamo, no, Tamamo! Please, would you let me train with you?	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_1047
020	Huh...are you sure?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0025
021	Yeah.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0006
022	Yaaaay! I'd love that!!!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0009
023	St-stop! Don't hug me! If someone sees this...! I've already given my heart to a woman called Rin.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0048
024	Hey, oww, oww!!! That's too tight! You've got so much brute strength...! Let me go!!!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0042
025	All right then, as friends, I can come play with you again, right?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_battle_1029
026	It's not play. It's training! Besides, you're still too close in proximity...stand back!	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0029
027	Kon, this is the first time I've become friends with someone from the Gyobu tribe!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0002
028	I'm sure I'll become friends with other kids right away and I won't be lonely any more!
029	Kon, kon, kon!
030	Hahah, Kon, what are you crying about?! Come on! My instinct was right, wasn't it? There was a strange smell!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0023
031	Nothing is gonna happen, if I stay alone in the hole of the dead tree. That's why I need to muster my courage and go outside♪
032	Sigh... Well, I guess I'm fine with this.	VO_hayate.hayate_sys_0030
033	Hey! If you move around so much you'll trip and fall!	VO_hayate.hayate_chara_1024
034	Owww!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0043
035	Heheheh. This is much more fun than being alone♪	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0011
