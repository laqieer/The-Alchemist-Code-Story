001	...Now for my super move! Entrance Cleaning Mecha!!!	VO_carol.carol_battle_0004
002	Wh-what the...? You gotta be kid...aghhh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
003	It worked! I'm glad I made it. Now all I need to do is press this button, and...there...an alarm should go out to the Peacekeepers.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0007
004	Wow. You're well prepared.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0046
005	We'll take it from here. Thank you for your cooperation.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
006	Glad to help!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0041
007	You made that machine, Carol? But...I thought you were scared of machines... Even just earlier today...	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0002
008	Earlier today, I just got really surprised. Seriously! You don't get it, do you, Hazel?!	VO_carol.carol_chara_1011
009	Huh?!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0006
010	It's all thanks to you that I can handle machines now!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0013
011	What? Re-really?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0025
012	It's true that I hate the machines that killed my father and mother.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0029
013	That's why, when I woke up and found out I had to wear an artificial limb...it was awful.
014	Yeah... I can imagine.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
015	But...Vincent was there for me... You, too, Hazel... And you were also using prosthetics that Vincent had made.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
016	You supported me the whole time it took for me to get used to using my prosthetic limb.
017	I knew how much more difficult it must've been for you, Hazel, with you having to use prosthetics for both of your legs.
018	Yet, you never showed that to me. You always just smiled and stood by my side. You are the one who gave me the strength to get this far, but...	VO_carol.carol_sys_0016
019	Carol...
020	Hazel, are you always going to see me as someone who needs protecting?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
021	I wish you'd also see how I'm able to smile now!
022	Don't treat me like a younger sister...let me be your friend!	VO_carol.carol_battle_0019
023	Friend...	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
024	Yes! If we're friends, when I mess up with the cooking, you have to complain about it.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
025	Let me go shopping for cheese dogs with you.
026	But...Carol, something like what happened just now could occur again. Don't you understand that it's dangerous?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0003
027	Whether it be dangerous people or machines, I'll fight alongside you. I'll increase the number of Cleaning Mechas as well.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0010
028	I may not be as strong as you, Hazel, but I won't give up!
029	As your friend...I can no longer let you fight on your own, while I stand around doing nothing!	VO_carol.carol_battle_0019
030	...!
031	I guess "friends" would want to help each other when they're in trouble or in pain...wouldn't they?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
032	Yes. I want to help my friend! So, please, let me face the same scary situations that you face...with you!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
033	Heh...hahaha! You wanna put yourself in scary situations?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0011
034	Consider me told, Carol! "Friends," huh? Maybe if you keep telling me off, we can become even closer?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
035	Keep telling you off?	VO_carol.carol_chara_1011
036	I can do that!
037	Right. Thank you, Carol. I look forward to it.	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1020
038	Hey, you tried to pat me on the head again! Times like this call for a handshake!	VO_carol.carol_chara_1004
039	Fine...fine.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
