001	I heard about the Ceremony of Creation from him.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
002	A mere collaboration. Nothing more.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
003	One which the Infinite Serpent has taken over, after your wish to remake the world went unfulfilled.
004	Indeed. It has taken far too long for my will to form.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
005	My flesh and blood, the Shell of the World, has been far too eroded by the sins of humans. I am no longer capable of maintaining it.
006	But if the shell can be broken, so too can rebirth be invoked.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
007	I, the cradle of the dragons, shall be broken by those who are destined to do so.
008	But there is another way, isn't there?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
009	I suppose there is.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0006
010	Daughter of the Sephira, do you intend to inherit it, then? Will you become the cornerstone of Truth for the next era?
011	I am a Vessel of Purification. All my life, I have been trained to serve as a receptacle for sin.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
012	The hidden magic that is engraved upon me—that of the last Sephira—prevents my very being from succumbing to sin.
013	So there wouldn't even be any need for me to withstand the corruption that eats away at you; it would simply dissipate.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
014	If I were to take your place, that alone should be enough to save the world...no?
015	There is no way a human body of flesh and bone can endure the test of time forevermore. Once that body turns to dust, the world will simply be consumed by corruption once more.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
016	Then I'll just use Space-Time Manipulation!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
017	If I stop time within me and become a mere vessel for filtering the world's sins, then—
018	You foolish child! That's no different than being dead.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0029
019	If a sacrifice is required no matter what, then I believe this is the best way to save as many people as possible.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
020	Hmm... I see.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0044
021	I have finally come to understand. The sin you bear is not Gluttony.
022	...?
023	It is Pride. Or, more to the point, it is sheer arrogance. Arrogance in thinking your being is of equal import as the world. Undoubtedly, it is the will of the dragons.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0037
024	Is that...a backhanded compliment?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
025	Indeed it is.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0004
026	It is not loyalty or righteous self-sacrifice for which you give yourself up, but the desire to fulfill your own wish...
027	And that is your strength; a strength we never possessed.
028	I accept your proposal, child of Pride. You are well-suited to hold the world's destiny in your hands.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0008
029	Urgh...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0043
030	If you are truly so resolved, then let the pain and crushing weight you feel guide you forward.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
031	Bear it well, ye who now balance the world's scales. For though I cannot see where this path may lead you...
032	Surely...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0007
033	Ghaaah...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
034	You got what you wanted.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
035	I...did.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
036	The real show starts now. You have three Cursed Beast cores, and Nimul's got another three.
037	If you want to gain the power to tear down the Truth of this world—the power of Alchemy—you're going to need the final core.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
038	I know. But with this...the world has lost its Observer.
039	Now, the future can only be shaped by our own hands.
040	Our next destination is Superbia Belt. That all right by you?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
041	Yes.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
042	Are you sure, though? You could always betray me. If you betrayed me now, you could go back to the time you wanted to.
043	You mean because the Libra is broken? It would be difficult for me to defeat Asmodeus by myself, especially with her at her peak.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0020
044	Besides, I have it on good authority she's not crying anymore...
045	So I'm willing to let it go.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
046	Okay. Then what are we waiting for?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
047	Right. Let's go save the world.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
048	Confirming shutdown of virtual personality region. Beginning full system scan. Resetting environmental maintenance parameters.
049	Restarting the Ouroboros System.
