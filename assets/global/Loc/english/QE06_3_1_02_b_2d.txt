001	That was splendidly executed.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
002	Indeed. It should appear as though they awakened the ancient Alchemic weapon hidden in the ruins only to be killed by it. Their punishment, no doubt, for meddling with Alchemy.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
003	And of course, if there are any survivors, they will be charged with rebellion against the Holy Order for this transgression.
004	A dreadful, pitiable fate...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
005	Says the most dreadful and pitiable man of them all! Purging your own Guard is not exactly a pastime of the honorable.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
006	The Scarlet Flame Guard is on course to burn itself out anyway, whether I like it or not. This will do nothing but accelerate that process.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0022
007	Aren't you betraying that Scarlet Vow of yours, though?
008	Better that than resist the inevitable march of time and lose my life.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
009	A wise decision. And I give you my guarantee that you will receive what was promised to you.
010	I don't remember what happened, exactly. We just did whatever we could to stay alive.
011	And somehow, we did survive. But the entrance was still blocked off.
012	I turned back to look at those of us who'd suffered so much in these ruins, and every face was layered thick with despair.
013	......
014	We were trapped. Buried alive, essentially.
015	If only I hadn't followed the renegades so doggedly, we could have avoided this. Jubei had even warned me that it was a trap, yet I still persevered.
016	It was too late for regrets, though. They'd do us no good in these darkened depths.
017	......
018	Yet, the regrets kept coming. They were all I could think about. I'd made so many poor decisions that had led to this moment...
019	Vice-Captain. Your orders.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
020	Let's search the ruins. There might be an opening somewhere.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
021	Understood.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0038
022	I held back the words swelling up inside of me, as I knew the truth would crush everyone.
023	I could feel it. They were all hanging on by a thread—ready to snap at any moment.
024	......
025	......
026	......
027	Try as we might, there was no way out. Reality had well and truly sunken in. We were trapped here. This was to become our literal tomb.
028	None of us had to say it. We all knew it. We could all see how heavy it weighed on one another's shoulders.
029	Lady Celis... There doesn't seem to be any other way out over here.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
030	This wasn't her first report to that effect, and it wouldn't be her last. But she kept trying. And I kept thanking her. We were putting on as brave a face as we could for the others.
031	I see. Thank you, Jubei.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0021
032	I'll search the perimeter once more. I'll make sure to scour every corner.
033	......
034	In the midst of this dilemma, I remembered something I'd said not long before this mission. The words struck me a bit deeper now.
035	Despite that, the Holy Order continues to send us into those ruins time and again to kill innocent people...
036	I only had my own guesses and assumptions as to what may have happened here—my own theories. Not nearly enough to form any sort of reasonable conclusion.
037	But that didn't stop me from shuddering a bit as I considered the potential implications of...everything.
038	None of that was going to help, though. Theories don't facilitate escape.
039	It's no use.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
040	Don't give up. If we give up, we die down here.
041	But we're going to! No matter what we do, we can't get these rocks out of the way! There are just too many of them!
042	Even so, we have to try. Let's all get out of here, together.
043	Vice-Captain...
044	Quitting won't change anything. We have to do what we can.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
045	Get out of here together, huh?
046	That's right. Everyone, let's get out of here! Let's go home―to Envylia!
047	All day long, we tried every method we could think of to escape from our earthen prison.
048	And it was only after hours of trying that we realized we had a rather large problem we still needed to address.
049	......
050	It should've been obvious, really, but our minds were elsewhere. We needed food.
051	Our rations had been running thin since before we'd even arrived, and now that we were stuck, they seemed almost comically meager.
052	Of course, it was no time at all before they were completely gone.
053	Please... I'll take anything... I'm hungry... So hungry...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0027
054	I'm sorry. There's nothing left.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
055	No... This can't be happening...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
056	I'm so sorry...
057	Why do we have to suffer like this?! I just want to eat... I'm so hungry...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0019
058	I was painfully aware how he felt.
059	Even with all the resolve in the world, blind faith, and a sturdy katana...
060	The body simply won't function without food. It's the cornerstone of all power.
061	Why did this have to happen to us? I kept asking myself that, over and over again, as my regiment collapsed around me one by one.
062	Was this all planned? Had this all been some dastardly scheme?
063	Impossible.
064	And even if it were, I was the one who pulled the trigger. I was the reason everyone was here, starving to death.
065	I'd made an error in judgment, and this was the result.
066	All thanks to my own naivety...
067	!!!
068	Of course! My problem, my solution! I just had to cut open a path myself!
069	With all my heart and soul behind every blow, I began slashing at the boulders. Futile, perhaps, but I kept at it—hacking away, bit by bit, pebble by pebble.
070	I soon realized, I wasn't alone.
071	Jubei...
072	As long as I can still move, I can still dig. We can't give up, Celis. No matter what.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
073	Thank you, Jubei.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
074	How much time had passed, I wondered? How long had we been at it?
075	My katana had gotten so chipped, it almost looked like a rusty saw blade. And my arms felt much as it looked. But it didn't matter.
076	The only thing left for us—the only thing standing between us and eternity—was this. It was literally the only tiny twinkle of hope we still had. So my body kept moving.
077	Finally—miraculously—
078	Lady Celis!
079	Everyone, stand up! We're going home―together!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
080	When we got outside, the other Scarlet Flame Guard squad—the captain's—was waiting for us.
081	Something immediately seemed off about them, though. Perhaps it was that they weren't helping clear rubble, and seemed almost spooked to see us. But we were sure glad to see them.
082	And at that point, the primary concern on everyone's mind was food, so these red flags went almost completely overlooked.
083	......
084	Some had succumbed to hunger, unfortunately. But we could still save a few, if we were to get them food and water quickly enough.
085	That's what I believed, anyway.
086	Please give food and water...to the others. I can wait.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0002
087	Yes, Ma'am.
088	Sorry to keep you waiting. Can you eat?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0035
089	......
090	Can you swallow? No? I'm sure you must be famished. If you don't eat, I'll end up eating it all myself!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
091	......
092	Please... Please, eat! Come on! Somebody! Anybody! Don't die on me!
093	......
094	Lady Celis...
095	They wanted to eat so much... Why aren't they eating now?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0020
096	Lady Celis... That person is...	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0018
097	Come on! Eat! Please! Eat something!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0018
098	I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... It's all my fault...
099	The words I'd been holding in for so long came spilling out all at once, in a jumbled mess. All the while, tears were gushing from my eyes.
100	I kept muttering the same apologies—the same regrets—over and over, even though I knew the people I was saying them to were long past the point of hearing.
101	Over and over... Again and again...
102	......
103	What could I do?
104	What could I do to change this?
105	The question turned into something preposterous. I was asking to bring back the dead. I was asking for another miracle—a real one, this time.
106	But I still kept saying it. Over and over, again and again...
107	Finally, someone responded. Except, they were talking about something totally different...yet equally preposterous.
108	Wh-what...?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
109	I repeat:
110	Vice-Captain Celis of the Scarlet Flame Guard, you are under arrest for suspicion of using the forbidden art of Alchemy.
111	What?! That's absurd!
112	It has been confirmed that ancient Alchemic weapons were activated within the ruins. This is viewed as a blatant act of rebellion against the Holy Order.
113	And all such acts must be punished accordingly.
114	Wh-what?! But, that wasn't me!
115	If I may.
116	I would like to give an official statement noting that we scoured every corner of those ruins, but found not a single sign of any renegade within.
117	As such, it must be concluded that Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis, as the commanding officer in charge, is responsible for the activation of these ancient Alchemic weapons.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
118	Captain! How can you say that?! That was the renegades! They're the ones who activated those things!
119	So you claim. But no renegades were confirmed to be present in the vicinity during this mission.
120	What?!
121	The only people in the ruins were an archaeological team dispatched by the Holy Order for research purposes.
122	I can assure you that everything Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis is saying is little more than a ruse. To what end, however, I cannot begin to fathom.
123	!!!
124	I see.
125	The punishment for this transgression is quite severe, Celis.
126	No... It wasn't me! Those weren't just archaeologists!
127	Of course, as the acting captain assigned to this mission, I must take some responsibility as well. We will accept whatever verdict is issued.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
128	No...!
129	Everything was planned out from the start.
130	I believed that this bloodshed would somehow bring peace to the Continent of Babel, in the end.
131	But it was all a lie.
132	After that, nothing I said mattered. Despite almost dying in it, now that I was out, I had no ground left to stand on.
133	The verdict was issued in no time at all. Scarlet Flame Guard Vice-Captain Celis had acted with rebellious intent toward the Holy Order, they said.
134	In response, the public's trust in the Scarlet Flame Guard was tarnished beyond repair practically overnight, and the Guard itself was disbanded altogether.
135	As for me, I was lucky to get away with my life. The tribunal took mercy on me, for whatever reason, and exiled me to Wadatsumi.
136	Celis...
137	My dear Zeke...	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
138	This is the full story of how the Scarlet Flame Guard was purged, and how I came to be where I am now.
139	What's the matter? Cat got your tongue, Celis Crowley?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
140	Or shall I address you more formally, former Vice Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, descendant of the house of Rising Ashes―and partner to the renowned Zeke Crowley?
141	...!
