001	I've been waiting for you.
002	There's no need for introductions anymore, is there?
003	Have you taken into consideration Turn Orders and Agility?
004	In battle, if you hover your cursor over a unit, an hourglass is displayed at the far right end of its status.
005	The hourglass indicates CT, or Charge Time. Once this is charged up to 100, a unit may make its move.
006	CT is spent as actions are taken.
007	Agility is the speed at which a unit can charge CT, and this differs among Jobs and Units.
008	I've mentioned this when explaining Magic, but Cast Time is required before the invocation of skills.
009	The unit icons displayed at the top-left of the battle screen indicate the Turn Order of the Units.
010	Keep in mind that the order displayed may change according to CT, Agility, and Cast Time.
011	I'm not making you sleepy with all of this explanation, am I?
012	All right then, it's time for combat! Keep an eye on the enemies with high Agility and try to keep damage taken to a minimum!
013	Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!
014	Hrm, was this too easy for you? You have certainly exceeded my expectations!
015	Turn Order can be baffling at first, but it's possible for certain units to override the rules.
016	Merchants can use Jewel Investment, and Chronomancers can use Overclock to do so.
017	Do not worry. All of this will eventually come naturally to you.
018	There is nothing more I need to teach you. You now have everything you need to fight on your own.
019	What's that look for? There is no need to lament.
020	My name is Ouroboros. I am the bond between Truth and the World, the Observer of Destiny.
021	When your strength nears the Truth, I shall appear before you once again.
022	Well, this is the end of our momentary affair.
023	Now, let the brilliance of your soul guide you to the unwavering truth!
