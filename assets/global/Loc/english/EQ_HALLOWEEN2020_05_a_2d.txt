001	Come on, drink up. Once this antidote starts working, you'll be back to normal.	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0002
002	Numa...	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0028_b
003	Oh, I'm cured! Thank the gods!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0009
004	I only expected a pair of cute Ratty ears, not a total Rattening! I thought I was going to be stuck that way forever!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
005	I'm glad you are all right. Might I ask where you came by this potion?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
006	There were a bunch lying in a box over thataway. It said they were just Halloween novelties, so I figured I'd try a little drop.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
007	Sure, I grew some Ratty ears, but they disappeared after a second, so I reckoned it was safe to drink the whole thing.
008	The effects do differ depending on dosage.
009	What kind of fool drinks roadside potions in the first place?!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
010	Rosa? I thought you said you had disposed of those potions safely?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
011	I did, after a fashion... Look, do I look like I know how to dispose of garbage? Someone else always dealt with that for me!	VO_rosa.rosa_sys_0031
012	Good grief... All right, you come with me. We'll make sure all the new Ratties around town get the antidote.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
013	Oh, I just remembered! I saw the orphanage director taking a bunch of bottles back with him!
014	A bunch...? Say, isn't that kinda really bad?
015	Indeed. We must stop it before it gets worse!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
016	Unbelievable! Why would that girl even make such a potion?!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
017	Even so, I'm a little jealous.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0030
018	Of those who have been turned into Ratties?!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1002
019	That isn't what I meant.
020	Certainly, self-restraint is not one of Rosa's strong points.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
021	But she is positively overflowing with ideas for ways to surprise and delight other people, which I find admirable.
022	I simply don't have her creative spark.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
023	Julia...
024	But look at me, feeling sorry for myself when other people need my help.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
025	Say, Julia? Once we've sorted this out, how about we think of something together?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
026	There's got to be a pleasant surprise out there that fits you perfectly.
027	What's more, we shall help you find it! For the Successor of the Sun, no prank is impossible!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
028	I don't understand. Why would the two of you go so far for me?
029	Ah... Well, I should apologize on that score. My passion can burn a little hot at times.	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
030	My feelings, however, are sincere. I truly do wish for you to join the rest of us in enjoying this festival. As such...
031	I understand what you're asking. However...I don't have any right.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
032	What are you on about? Everyone's got the right to a happy Halloween.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
033	...
034	Your thoughts are on the person you served, are they not?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
035	How do you know about her?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
036	"If only I could share these joys with the one I served. They are rather wasted on me." Your words, I believe.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
037	Of course, I would not presume to know your past.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
038	I do, however, wish to ask: would this individual want you to spend Halloween in sadness?
039	Of course not. She was always kind towards me.
040	Then what holds you back?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0002
041	The issue is not what she would want, but what I can allow myself.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0042
042	I was charged with protecting her. That was all I needed to do, all I COULD do—but in the end, I failed.
043	When I laid down my life in her defense, I left her to walk her thorny road alone.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
044	You...died for her...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0018
045	...
046	My duty was to remain by her side for as long as she needed me. I...could not fulfil that duty.
047	A failure such as myself has no right to enjoy these festivities. For me even to be here is wrong.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
048	This must be why ideas for pleasant surprises still elude me. I cannot bring any joy to others if there is none in my own heart.
049	That's not true at all! It can't be!
050	You gave your life to save this person! How do you think they'd feel to know you were torturing yourself over it?!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0022
051	Blanchett...
052	I kind of know what you mean when you say you feel out of place here. I felt the same way, once.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
053	All I could think about was getting revenge. In my mind, a moment spent enjoying myself was a moment wasted.
054	Then someone told me something: "Revenge is only a small part of who you are."	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
055	"Even if your revenge ends, your life will continue. That's why you should start thinking about what happens when it's all over."
056	And that goes for you too. No matter how important your duty was to you, it's only one part of you. You're bigger than that.
057	Only one...part of me...?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
058	And you know, you did say you liked my cutouts. It made me really happy to hear that.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0031
059	You even said my scissors were like their own kind of magic.
060	Whoever this person was, she must have been very kind.
061	I'm sure that you hurting yourself like this is the last thing she'd want.
062	...
063	Your love for her alone would convince me of her good character. I cannot believe she would want you to suffer.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
064	Ramses...
065	Perhaps this is merely more unwelcome advice, but...	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
066	I cannot accept that someone who worked so hard to ready this carnival for others is not entitled to enjoy it themselves.
067	This Halloween belongs to the Successor of the Sun, and I decree that it shall bring happiness to all!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
068	Happiness...to all...
069	You have always served me well. I only want you to be happy.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
070	Lady Emmel...
071	It's only natural that I should wish for my friend's happiness, isn't it?
072	...
073	I never meant to tie myself in knots like this.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
074	In my final moments, I was so certain that was the end. Of everything.
075	But I...all of us, rather, have been given time that we never expected. We mustn't waste it being shackled to old parts of ourselves.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2001
076	Your duty is but one small part of you, Julia. There is much more that even you are yet to discover.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0006
077	There must be, for are we not here with you?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
078	I suppose you are.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
079	(I'm still not certain I'm ready to think about my own happiness yet, but if my duty is really only one small part of myself...)
080	(Then I want to learn what the other parts are, and try to find one I can hold dear.)
081	This must be the orphanage. It's rather in a state, isn't it?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
082	Look! The children!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0025
083	Waaaaah! Help us!
084	What's wrong? What is happening?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
085	The director drank a load of weird potions, and he... He...!
086	You're kidding me! He turned into that?! It's ginormous!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0026
087	Numa! Numa! Nuuumaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0002
088	All those potions must have destabilized his body. The Ratties from before don't even compare to this!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0020
089	Stay behind us, little ones! Fear not, for we shall protect you!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0003
090	Nu...numumuuu...
091	Watch out! It's coming for us!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
092	Nu... Nu... Numyuaaa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0019
