001	Hmm. Who would've thought there'd be a forest in the desert? Oh, there's even a small lake.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
002	Long ago, this land was not a desert. This is one of the few remaining remnants. One day, this too will wither away.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1008
003	Perfect. The sun is about to go down. Let's spend the night here.
004	All right, I'll take on the night watch, so I'm gonna get some rest now. Uff.
005	Fine, fine. Good night, dad.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
006	Zzz...
007	I always imagined an oasis to be some kind of puddle in the middle of the desert...hmmm...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
008	Miuna...what's the matter? Is there something inside the lake?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
009	Oh, there it is! Uff!	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1008
010	Huh?! What should I do?! She fell into the lake... I-I need to rescue her...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
011	Eeek! A-a fish?!	VO_uzma.uzma_battle_0022
012	Phew...! Look at this huge catch!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
013	Huh...? Huh? Miuna, what are you doing?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
014	What do you mean? I'm catching fish. That way we'll have something to eat for tonight's dinner, right?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
015	Are we going to eat...dinner?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0001
016	Of course. If we don't eat we die, right? I'm starving.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0017
017	Come on. What are you staring at? How about you go collect some branches? I'll try and catch a few more.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
018	O-okay...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
019	It should be cooked soon. Hmm...munch...munch... Yeah! It's perfect.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
020	.... ...
021	Are you not gonna eat it? It's going to burn, you know?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
022	Oh, okay...thank you.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
023	Hey. Why are you always so frightened?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
024	Huh...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
025	I understand why you'd be confused if you were suddenly attacked by a bunch of strangers, but...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
026	We're here with you. You can a be a little more at ease, you know?
027	N-no, it's not that....! I'm scared...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
028	Yeah, I picked up on that, but...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
029	No, you don't understand. I'm scared of...death. What I am frightened of is death...itself.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0040
030	Huh?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
031	I have foreseen the death of many people.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
032	No, not just the death of others, but I've seen my own death as well. That's why I'm scared of dying!
033	Um...so what you're scared of isn't this situation...but of death itself?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
034	That pretty much sums it up. Although, of course, I'm scared of this situation as well...	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1008
035	But, hey, every living thing dies in the end, right?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
036	...?! I'm sure you don't understand this fear that I feel, Miuna...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
037	...Sorry, but I don't like you.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
038	... ...
039	I don't understand how you could be so frightened of dying while you're still alive.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
040	I also don't like...people like you either...Miuna...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0010
041	Fuwaaaah! Mmmm! Ahh...I slept well...
042	Oh, smells good! Is it fish? All right! I'll have some as well! I'm starving!
043	Zzz...zzz...	VO_miuna.miuna_chara_1007
044	... ...
045	Can't you sleep?
046	...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
047	Well, a lot happened today. I'm sure you're feeling pretty overstimulated.
048	...No, it's not that. I've always had trouble sleeping.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
049	Are you scared of sleeping?
050	Huh...? Y-yes... I guess you were listening.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
051	Sorry. I didn't mean to, but I couldn't help picking up on your conversation with Miuna.
052	Ever since I was young, I've traveled a lot while training as a blacksmith, looking for material for weapons and such...
053	I've encountered dangerous situations on numerous occasions. Thus, I don't sleep very deeply when sleeping outdoors.
054	Besides...more than anything, I was born with the sharpest of ears! Hyahahah!
055	I...see.	VO_uzma.uzma_chara_1006
056	In any case...the fact that you're afraid to sleep must mean that your fear of death is quite deeply rooted in you.
057	I'm afraid that, if I were to sleep, I may not be able to wake up in the morning.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
058	Still, I ultimately wake up the next morning having fallen asleep sometime during the night.
059	I wake up somewhat disheartened thinking to myself, "It looks I survived today as well." I realize it's something of a contradiction.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
060	Hmm. By the way, what about your parents?
061	They're not around anymore. That is...there were killed.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0043
062	I see. You wouldn't happen to be a survivor of the Sephira folk, are you?
063	...?! U-um...	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
064	Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you if you are. I'm just curious.<br><br>
065	Y-yes. The blood of Sephira runs through my veins.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
066	I see. I've heard stories of them. Long ago, there were people here who worshiped the giant green tree of Sephiron.
067	They were prosperous both in their wisdom and their technological advancements. Viewing them as a source of danger, the Gluttony army destroyed them...I think that was how the story went.
068	Yes. I've heard about it as well. It happened before I was born...thus, I've only heard the stories from my mother.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
069	Hmm. From what I've heard, the invasion of the Gluttony army was an appalling one.
070	Even after the tree of Sephiron had gone extinct, the people of Sephira were driven off time and time again.
071	It's no wonder that you're afraid of death. I'm sure you've seen more than your fair share in this life already.
072	I agree, but it's not just that.	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0022
073	The Tree of Sephiron gave us wisdom. It was our cornerstone-we, the people of Sephira.
074	However, it is now lost to us. My people have no choice but to idly perish away. We will die...and vanish from the face of this earth.
075	I see. That being said, I wonder if it is truly death that you're afraid of.
076	What...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
077	Due to my line of work, I've associated with many a knight and warrior.
078	Amongst them, there are those who obsess over the way they will die.
079	The way they will die...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
080	Yep. They wish to die in a spectacular and graceful way. As for myself, I'm a blacksmith. I couldn't care less about the way I die.
081	I'm far more focused on what I can create while I'm still alive.
082	Until the moment I die, I want to listen to the voice of the iron that I strike, weld, and sharpen! That is my way of living.
083	Those that focus on how they die and I who focus on how I live...
084	Actually, we're not that different. Do you know what I mean?
085	...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0016
086	The way one dies is determined by the way they live. You know, Uzuma...
087	Maybe what you're really afraid of is being alive.
088	...Huh?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
089	Or better put...you're so afraid of dying that you've become scared of living.
090	That's how it appears to me.
091	Scared of...living?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0017
092	Are you...really alive right now? Or are you dead even as you live?
093	...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
094	Hah...hyahahah! All jokes aside, these are just the foolish reprimands of an old fart! Forget about what I said!
095	Ahh...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0027
096	Hm? What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.
097	Ack. Ku Yogi! Soon...you're going to...!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0018
098	...Hey. What are you lot doing sneaking about again?
099	Huh...?	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0025
100	...So you've detected us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
101	...?!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0029
102	We don't want to do anything unnecessary. All we need is you, Uzuma...you alone.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
103	If you come with us, we'll leave peacefully.
104	Ugh...n-no!	VO_uzma.uzma_sys_0042
105	Jeez. You're a persistent bunch, aren't you? The young lady here doesn't want to go with you.
106	I don't want to do anything unnecessary either. If you get my drift then you'd best clear off.
107	I guess negotiations are off then. Kill them.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
108	Miuna!
109	Gotcha!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
