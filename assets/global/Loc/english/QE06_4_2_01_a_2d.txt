001	They look surprisingly at peace. Almost as if they're asleep and dreaming.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0031
002	Apparently they've dived into Mikaboshi's consciousness...whatever that means. The rookie's explanation of it was much too ambiguous for me to understand.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
003	I'm sure it's necessary to learn Kagutsuchi, though.
004	I've noticed you persist in referring to Amane as a rookie. Why is that? It seems to me she's served your group admirably thus far, and for quite some time.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0030
005	Oh, she surely has. But her general lack of experience is undeniable, nonetheless.
006	That doesn't warrant—
007	Now, now! Captain Ugachi may have a sharp tongue, but it's clear he trusts Amane and her skills with everything he's got.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
008	You, yourself, are an outsider, yet you speak as if you know me?
009	Fair point. But even if I don't know you all that well yet, I've come to know Amane. And the way you talk about her, it seems like you see the same things in her that I do.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0004
010	She's a stout-hearted one, but still young. Makes her a little careless sometimes as a result, so somebody really needs to keep an eye on her, right?
011	Basically, you're tough because you care. Am I on the mark?
012	...I said she has a lack of experience, and I meant it. Your speculations on my intentions are nothing more than wild fantasy.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
013	Heheh! Aww, are you blushing, Captain Ugachi?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
014	I am not.
015	Suuuuure you're not. Anyway, Agatha, as you can see, you've got nothing to worry about!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
016	There's a real bond among those of the Blade Fox. It may not always be self-evident, but it's definitely there.
017	I see. That actually does put my mind at ease a bit. Thank you.
018	Are you worried about Logi?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
019	I am, but...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0005
020	I have every faith in him. He'll be back. We share a very strong bond of our own.
021	That's reassuring to hear. Well, then, there's only one thing for us to do right now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0044
022	We've gotta make sure the situation here is improved, even just a little bit, before Logi and Amane pop back outta that rock. Isn't that right, Captain Ugachi?
023	I believe I've told you before, I am not your captain. But you are correct that that is what we should be focusing on.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
024	I will make preparations for the restoration of Sumeragi. Kagutsuchi will only be needed for the final part.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
025	We must repair the blade with the demon's horn before even getting to that point.
026	You have experience smithing, Jubei?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
027	The Black Star Clan's education is quite extensive.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
028	Only the legitimate heir has the skill necessary to complete the restoration, however. Which leaves me out.
029	It's thanks to you that we even have this opportunity, though.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0001
030	Without you, the remnants of the Blade Fox would not have come together like this. We would have fallen to pieces, and each perished in some hopeless fight.
031	Honestly, I believe you are far more worthy to lead the Blade Fox than I could ever be.
032	No. It should be the strongest among us who leads. And though it pains me to admit it, that's you.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
033	Gauche, yet honest, just like always. But even you must see that I'm simply not fit for command.
034	I could never fill Lady Celis' shoes.	VO_juubei.juubei_battle_0022
035	Jubei...
036	I admit no such thing, Jubei. Raise that head of yours. You are, without question, the Blade Fox's Commander.
037	I understand that's the role I've been given. And I will do all that I can to fulfill it. I owe Lady Celis that much, at least.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0030
038	So get to work, then. We'll keep the place guarded.
039	All right. Thank you.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
040	...
041	Well, what do we do now?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
042	Protect the castle. Now that most of our essential fighting force is split between the Kagutsuchi and Sumeragi sides of things, we're a bit shorthanded.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
043	The demons may take this opportunity to launch an assault on us, and we cannot under any circumstances allow them to halt our restoration of the Sacred Three.
044	Aren't there members of the Blade Fox and Blue Tongues securing the immediate area? I can hardly believe they'd be easily surmounted.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0031
045	One can never be too prepared for the unexpected around here.
046	Reporting! Tamba has breached the outer lines, and is now in the process of— Urgh!
047	Talk about timing.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0031
048	Who's this?
049	Physically, an old comrade. Though he now serves as a vessel for the Demon King.
050	So an enemy in one sense, but an ally in another. That's a pretty rough spot to be in.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
051	What is to be found here?
052	We are. As you can see.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
053	Spare me your witty repartee. I can...feel it.
054	There's something of great worth here. Something related to me.
055	Ah...!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
056	Shush!
057	If you know something, tell me, and I promise I'll let you live.
058	Not sure I'd trust the word of big, scary demon like yourself.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
059	And who might you be?
060	A friend of Amane's.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
061	This doesn't concern you. Step aside.
062	I respectfully disagree, and no, I won't.	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0001
063	Then die where you stand.
064	You first.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
065	...!
066	Have you forgotten where you are? Deep behind enemy lines, surrounded on all sides, and you're really taking the time to taunt?!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
067	You still place yourself on the front line, even after losing one of your arms? You're an even bigger fool than I thought.
068	You are free to think of me as such all you'd like.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
069	Do you really think you can defeat me with only one arm?
070	I can at least hold you back for a time. And that's all that's needed here.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
071	What would you gain by stalling me?
072	Comrades. Who would come to our aid and take you down.
073	I was just gonna say that! We kinda think alike, Captain Ugachi, you know that?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
074	...I hate that you remind me of him.
075	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
076	Why do you stand before me on behalf of Wadatsumi? You are not even of this land.
077	Is it so unthinkable to want to protect the things your friends hold dear?	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0019
078	Even if it means you have to die for them?
079	Hey, we'll see about that part.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
080	Allow me to fight alongside you!
081	You stay where you are, Agatha! Keep Logi and Amane safe!
082	But...!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
083	Captain Ugachi and I will handle this guy! If something happened to you, what would we tell Logi?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
084	Or do you think we can't hold our own?
085	No. I believe in you.
086	Then leave this fight to us. We'll oust this demon. You can bet on it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
087	I take it I'm right to think there is something noteworthy here, then.
088	And I take it that's none of your business!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
089	Did you honestly think you could hit me with something like that?
090	Not really.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
091	Ngh!
092	What's the matter? Can't dodge a few bullets?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
093	So, you strike from melee as I'm preoccupied with ranged attacks? How...distasteful.
094	I'll just have to kill you off one at a time.
095	Quit spitting nonsense. You've angered me enough already.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0012
096	Oh? How so?
097	How so?! You cut down my comrades!
098	Hyah!	VO_edgar.edgar_battle_0003
099	Hrgh!
100	I won't let you pillage any further!
101	I will keep you glued to this spot, even if it costs me my life!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0037
