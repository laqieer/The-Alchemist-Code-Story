001	Hyaaaaaah!!!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0001
002	Are you okay, Kagura? Are you hurt?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
003	Of course, I'm okay! Don't get in my way!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
004	What are you talking about?! Now isn't the time to feign toughness!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
005	I can handle opponents of this caliber without your help!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0047
006	But the enemy is getting stronger and stronger, while our stamina is depleting. It would be safer if we fought together.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0031
007	It's not about that. I'm in the same position as you.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
008	Huh?
009	I need to become stronger. I need to gain the skills to survive on my own!	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0003
010	Huh? What's going on? Kagura, there's power emanating from your entire body!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
011	I'm not gonna stand for this anymore! Take that!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0001
012	Huh?!
013	That move you did just now... Was that the royal family of Wadatsumi's—	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
014	...?! N-no...
015	Yes, it was! Wasn't that the secret move called Kagutsuchi that's been passed down for generations within Wadatsumi's royal family?
016	... ...
017	I'm surprised a naive airhead like you knows about Wadatsumi.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0030
018	Well, I do happen to be a member of the Holy Guard, so of course I do.
019	I heard that Wadatsumi was annihilated overnight a few years ago though.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
020	Yes, it was.
021	Seven years ago, that historic country was suddenly invaded by Greed Dike's army and destroyed.
022	It ended all too quickly.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
023	Wadatsumi's beautiful streets and kind people were all turned into ashes over night.
024	What do you mean? You're talking as if you were there to witness it.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
025	I was. At the time of its destruction, the queen of Wadatsumi was my mother.	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0022
026	What?!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0047
