001	Can I have a moment, Xiao-Xiao?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
002	What can I do for you, Liu Shen? Is this about the new alliance again?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
003	That situation is still developing, but now I'm here to report on our recruitment efforts.
004	Oh my! Seems you've been quite busy.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0024
005	We're finally joining the Great Order of Pirates, so we must swell our ranks. Having the appropriate personnel is paramount.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
006	You intend to grow our numbers this much?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0025
007	Naturally. We have many rivals. Improving information gathering, expanding our base of operations, diplomacy... The more pirates we have the more we can do.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
008	As we discussed before, I'll take responsibility for all of it. You needn't trouble yourself.
009	Understood. I leave it to you. But if anything peculiar should arise, consult me.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
010	Pardon the intrusion! A letter has arrived from the Great Order of Pirates we recently allied with.
011	Hmph. And what does it say?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
012	It is a request for aid. One of the islands they control is under attack by monsters.
013	I see. And this enemy is too strong for them to handle?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
014	No... They seem capable of dealing with it on their own.
015	However, they're saying the captain and first mate should come.
016	Why would they ask us to do that?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0012
017	If they're saying they want us there, then we should go, Liu Shen.
018	Are you sure? But I suppose you're right...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0006
019	If we comply and go to fight alongside our fellow captains, then we can deepen our alliance.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
020	But the other pirate crew is quite large, right?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
021	That the captain would come to us doesn't seem like they're overly focused on us to you?
022	Our presence is simply that important.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
023	This event will be remembered and recorded, and should act as a stepping stone to building our partnership.
024	Is it really all right that you two go alone?
025	We'll be fine. But while we're away, please look after the Xiao Shenmei!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0038
026	You needn't worry! And take care!
027	Well then, Liu Shen... Shall we go?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0010
028	Let's be off.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
029	The monster incursion is ahead in the depths of this cave. We're supposed to meet the others here, but...
030	The stench of the infernal is strong. Let's deal with this quick and be gone... Ahem...
031	Captain Shenmei of the Xiao Shenmei reporting! I've come to lend aid!
032	Oh! Thank you for coming!
033	Due to an urgent matter, the captain and first mate couldn't come, so I'm here as council, instead.
034	Now, where're these monsters?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
035	As to monsters... They're there.
036	Xiao-Xiao!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_battle_0013
037	What's the meaning of this? We came here to rescue you! What is this treachery?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
038	Treachery? Don't make me laugh! We're pirates! We use whatever means to get ahead.
039	You're no different. Didn't you do whatever it took to prosper?
040	We're not like that! We got this far by building trust and working together with many others.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0012
041	We would never stab our allies in the back. That is sheer cowardice!
042	Hmph. What weak fools.
043	They're taming monsters... Hell! This is a training facility for demons, and we're now on the menu!	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0010
044	We've faced worse. Come on, Liu Shen! Let's turn the tables!
