001	Lord Zahar? Dinner is ready.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
002	Right.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
003	We're having sautéed rabbit meat tonight.
004	Yup, that's right! Caught by yours truly!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
005	And me!
006	...
007	I see. You lot went hunting, did you?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
008	I took them. It was part of their training.
009	Good. Keep it up.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
010	You got it!
011	You betcha!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
012	Yes, my lord.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
013	On that note, I have something to report, Lord—
014	Later.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
015	Must you be reminded again, Corvus? You should know by now that Lord Zahar doesn't like to be bothered during mealtimes.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
016	Right... Sorry.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
017	Now, let's eat. We wouldn't want our dinner to get cold.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
018	It looks so good! Doesn't it, Spica?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
019	Y-yeah...
020	Om nom nom nom!
021	Ugh. Ila, use your knife and fork.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
022	Why should I?! It's easier this way!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
023	Hmph. One of these days, I'm going to need to teach you table manners.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
024	Urgh! No, thanks! Those sound boring!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0029
025	I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist. You eat like a pig.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
026	Aw, don't be like that, Corvus!
027	When she first came here, Ila couldn't eat anything, remember? But now she joins us at mealtime every day!
028	So what if she's a little messy? At least she's eating!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
029	Hmph. Fine. I suppose there's no rush.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
030	...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
031	...
032	...
033	Spica? Is it not to your taste?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
034	Huh? Oh, um... No, it's… It's nothing like that. I just don't have much of an appetite.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
035	Oh, dear. That's no good.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
036	C'mon, Spica, try some! It's really good!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
037	Yeah, okay...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
038	...
039	That was excellent as always, Letitia.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
040	I'm so glad you enjoyed it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
041	Psst! Hey, can I ask you something?
042	I've been wondering this for a while, but does Lord Zahar only eat Letitia's cooking?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
043	I don't think I've seen him eat anything but fruits and vegetables when Letitia's not here.
044	He's always been like that.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
045	Oh, really?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
046	He only ever ate bread and vegetables when he was in the Holy Guard.
047	Considering he is apparently of Elven descent, I didn't think he would eat meat or fish...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
048	But when Letitia began preparing meals for him in Wratharis, he ate whatever she served.
049	I'm sure he wouldn't touch it if it wasn't for the fact that Letitia made it, however.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
050	Huh...	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0005
051	...
052	I don't like her, but she cooks good.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
053	I don't think that's why he likes it.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
054	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0006
055	Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
056	Ahem. Yes, my lord?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
057	Actually, all of you should hear this. I'm going away for a while.
058	What?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
059	Where are you going?
060	...
061	You're not going to tell us, are you?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
062	U-um... Can I go with—	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
063	I only need Letitia and a few of our rank and file to join me. In fact, Letitia's presence is essential.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0014
064	I... understand.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0029
065	Will you not share your plans with me, Lord Zahar?
066	Hmph. There is no need; I won't be gone long.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
067	Very well, then.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
068	During my absence, I will leave the Shadow Messiah in your care, Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0041
069	Babysitting duty, is it? Oh, joy of joys...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
070	Keep a close eye on Spica in particular.
071	Spica?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
072	We need to rid her of her doubts.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
073	Doubts, huh...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
074	Aaargh!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
075	Hah. It was a good idea to try for a sneak shot, but your execution needs work.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
076	Yup. It was super obvious what you were going for.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
077	Dang it!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
078	...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
079	C'mon, Spica! How long are you planning on moping around for?
080	Chin up!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0014
081	Silma...
082	If anything, with Lord Zahar gone for a while, now's your chance to make a change!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
083	What do you mean?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
084	This is an opportunity for you impress him! You've gotta train really hard, until you're strong enough to beat Corvus!
085	I-I can't do that...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0031
086	But, Spica... If you don't start getting stronger soon, Lord Zahar will abandon you!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
087	Wh-what?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
088	You want to be with him, don't you? You don't want him to leave you behind, do you?
089	I...
090	(Of course not... That's why I'm here. I want to be with Lord Zahar.)
091	Thank you, Silma. You're right—I'll see what I can do!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0033
092	That's the spirit! You've got this, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
093	Right!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
094	Erm... Sir?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
095	What is it? Did something happen?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
096	...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
097	Not exactly, no. I was just wondering what we're going to do about dinner.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
098	Dinner?
099	Yes. Lady Letitia isn't here, so I was hoping you would have some instructions for me.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
100	Oh, right. She always takes care of meals, doesn't she? Well... Let me think...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
101	...
102	I'm sure he wouldn't touch it if it wasn't for the fact that Letitia made it, however.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
103	Corvus? I-I'll do it. I'll make dinner!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
104	Oh?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
105	Huh?! B-but, Spica—!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
106	I insist!
107	(Wow. I've never seen Spica so serious about something before.)
108	Very well. Dinner is your responsibility tonight, then.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
109	Understood.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
110	S-Spica? Are you sure about this? It's not too late to back down—	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0011
111	Silma!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
112	This is my chance to grow.
113	This isn't what we talked about at all and you know it!
114	But I will grow!
115	(The darkness within me whispers unsettling things.)
116	(I'm... concerned.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
117	Lord Zahar? We have almost reached Wratharis.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
118	Good.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
119	Why didn't you bring Spica with you?
120	...
121	She seemed very eager to accompany you. Tee hee.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
122	Don't be ridiculous.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
123	I'm just teasing. But you've been worried about her, haven't you?
124	She's weak.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
125	True. She's a kind soul.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
126	Yes, and that's part of her chosen role—but right now, her kindness is merely weakness.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
127	Strength in kindness...
128	That's to be Spica's role in your new order, isn't it, Lord Zahar?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0045
129	She must be trained.
130	Well, that's Corvus's responsibility.
131	Indeed.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
132	Hee hee. I certainly couldn't do it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
133	We are the will. Corvus and the others exist to put our will into motion.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0005
134	As you—	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
135	Did you hear that?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
136	Yes... Something's lurking here.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
137	A mythical beast? Corvus mentioned that one of the creatures was hanging around our base.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
138	Come to think of it... There were signs of animal experiments being conducted in the basement facility of the Holy Order we raided the other day.
139	And one of the guards said something about not having time to deal with us.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
140	Because of the runaway test subjects, perhaps?
141	Hmph. Sounds about right. Then I suppose the creature hanging around here must be the escapee in question.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
142	Oh, what a mess they've left us with! Hee hee.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
143	At any rate—
144	Grrrrrrrrr!	VO_MwolfBig.MwolfBig_battle_0019
145	I say we clear our path of all obstacles.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0001
146	As you command.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
