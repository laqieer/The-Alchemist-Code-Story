001	We're entering the path that climbs the valley. The railway is at the top...Don?
002	You comb head! Do you want me to blow that smug expression off your face?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
003	C'mon. Have you forgotten?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
004	When it comes to past achievements, I'm way ahead of you.
005	You can brag once you've beaten me once.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
006	Shut up! You'd be no match for me if I were to use my right arm.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
007	Heh. What did you call it again? 'Preparation for the coming catastrophe'?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
008	Unfortunately, that day will never come.
009	You'll end up dead with years of wasted Alchemy left in that arm of yours.
010	You...!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0012
011	C-c'mon. Now isn't the time for petty arguments! Tango, say something to them!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0014
012	You idiot! How dare you think Don is inferior to you?!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0011
013	You too, Tango?! Come on...you're friends, right?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0015
014	Friends? You gotta be kidding me!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
015	We've fought as allies before, but more often we've fought as enemies!
016	You're always getting in my way! I've been thinking it's high time we settled this.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
017	Hmph. I just remembered. I once stole a barmaid you were in love with	VO_taras.taras_sys_0004
018	...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
019	She told me you, you know? That you fall short when it matters the most.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
020	Agh...!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0043
021	Now that I recall it, she complained to me that as soon as you encountered trouble you would go crying to your momma.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
022	!!!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
023	How's that scary big momma of yours? After I beat you to a pulp, how about you go running to your momma, eh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
024	I'm gonna kill you!!!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0026
025	Do-Don! Please, calm down! The Hounds are approaching! Now isn't the time for this...Don!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0012
026	Shut up!!!
