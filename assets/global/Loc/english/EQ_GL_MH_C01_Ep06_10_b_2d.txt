001	[ ALERT: DEFENSIVE BARRIERS NEUTRALIZED ]
002	[ SELF DESTRUCT IN THIRTY SECONDS. ]
003	Now's our chance! Soren, we're counting on you!
004	I believe in you Soren. I know you can do it!
005	(Humanity is imperfect, flawed)
006	(We bicker, we fight, at times we can't even agree with what is wrong or right...)
007	(I was a fool to believe that I—in turn, you, would become the end all and be all to humanity's problems.)
008	(The Soren who created you, was just as flawed as his human brethren... a foolish idealist who could not see past the end of his own nose.)
009	(Foolishly he created you in his own flawed image... to perpetuate his flawed ideals.)
010	(I wasn't solving anything. I was simply running away. It was nothing but an exercise in futility. )
011	(The errors of my past shall become my strength. With it, I will carve myself a new path. )
012	(I have my ideals... I possess wisdom... most importantly, I have others who believe in me.)
013	(Together, despite of our flaws and differences, humanity will find an answer!)
014	Goodbye... Atropos.
015	Soren... You did it...
016	So this is how it ends.
017	The carnage above... matched only by this destruction below.
018	How am I to speak of myself as someone who will one day change the world, when I cannot protect even my own people?
019	In pursuit of a better future, I stared into the abyss...
020	My Lord...
021	Even cold machinery can be manipulated to serve selfish whims...
022	... how can the world break free from suffering?
023	Are we just going to let him go like that?
024	I ask that you give him some time alone.
025	I know that this has resulted in disaster, and very nearly a tragedy.
026	We will all take responsibility for this and do our best to make amends.
027	I must also extend my heartfelt thanks to all of you for assisting us during this time.
028	We may have had our differences, but you spared our people and helped us see the error of our ways.
029	We don't want human casualties any more than you do.
030	As it turns out, the Constructs were a terrible mistake...
031	Your lord did not give in to its overwhelming power in the end.
032	That, in itself, is a virtue.
033	Thank you for giving us another chance.
034	Wait, wait. You aren't serious. You're just letting them walk free?
035	Who knows what they'll do in future—
036	Hold up there, Roxanne. They said they would set things right.
037	Besides, I'm not with the Holy Guard any more.
038	There's no need to wave your guns at them.
039	Well, that's just what I want to do... You included!
040	Stupid Sieg!!
041	What'd I do now?!
042	Accompanied by the bickering of Siegfried and Roxanne, they return to the surface.
043	Just follow the markers along that path and you should find your way back to the town.
044	As soon as the situation is under control, my men and I will do a sweep of the forest for any escaped beasts.
045	I hope we've made the right choice to trust you.
046	I never go back on my word.
047	Alright, that settles it. A job well done, everyone...
048	All I want right now is a nice hot bath and... *yawn*... a soft fluffy bed.
049	My thought's exactly. I don't think I'd ever want to explore old ruins again...
050	Zzz... Zzz...
051	Oh my, looks like it's almost bed time for the children.
052	Hehe... it's no wonder you appeared so lively recently.
053	I don't know what you are talking about.
054	Oh look at the time, there is much to be done. Let us hurry along dear sister.
055	This is where we part ways for now. I do hope we will cross paths again in the future.
056	Under more... pleasant... circumstances.
057	Humph... Good riddance I say.
058	You all seem like kind people. I cannot remember the last time seeing Shion genuinely happy.
059	Thank you all so much for being friends with my brother! Farewell!
060	Uh huh... yea don't mention it...
061	Pfft... friends with that minx?
062	Ohoho, I enjoyed the entertainment.
063	Whoo boy. I could really use a big break.
064	Yeah, but SOMEBODY just happily let the big fish off the hook!
065	Aw, come on. Don't be such a party pooper!
066	Oh, I know. How about we take a holiday somewhere?
067	H-Holiday? Us? Together?
068	(Oh my! T-There're so many places I want to go!)
069	(The sea! We've got to go to the sea! The glittering beaches, the rolling waves...)
070	(A perfect bottle of red wine, just the two of us...!)
071	All four of us—you, Teach, Soren and I—away from the hustle and bustle of the city...
072	Maybe go for some wine and cherry blossoms. Oh, Shion mentioned that...
073	SIEG!!!!
074	Look at those two, at it again like siblings. Oh poor Roxanne, having to deal with that blockhead
075	Oh you two... can't you get along better like that pair of siblings. See how caring and sensitive the brother is?
076	...
077	Bro...ther...?
078	Thank you all so much for being friends with my brother! Farewell!
079	What??? Teach! You knew all along??
080	My my, it was but a matter of observation.
081	...
082	I think her face is stuck.
083	I think mine is, too.
084	Soren, my dear. There is something I wish to ask you.
085	Besides the flashbacks you have told us...
086	Have you remembered any more of your past self?
087	I'm afraid not. Just... bits and pieces, here and there.
088	I can... Somewhat grasp what I had wanted to achieve before, but as for the whys and hows...
089	But that's okay. I think everything that's happened in the last few days has given me more clues about my past.
090	With enough time, I'm sure I'll figure it out.
091	Will humans ever achieve peace and harmony?
092	Humans are ever driven by emotions and desire.
093	Without emotion, there is no desire.
094	Without desire, there is no downfall.
095	But without emotion...
096	Humans are but empty husks...
