001	Huff...huff...! You incarnation of destruction...! I will not allow you destroy our future!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_battle_0020
002	No matter how many times you attempt to destroy this world...we will stand up and stop you!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0015
003	Our will to create a better future will stop your destruction!
004	Huzzah!!!	VO_logi.logi_battle_0009
005	Huzzah!!!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0032
006	Logi! Sabareta!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
007	...Grroogh...grooo...!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_a
008	Huff...huff...! Yes! We did it, Sabareta! We...won!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0032
009	I never thought the day would come...when the knights of our two kingdoms would work hand-in-hand.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0009
010	Father...I have a request.	VO_agasa.agasa_favorite_0005
011	I want to propose peace treaty to King Patrick, one between the Kingdom of Wratharis and the Kingdom of Envylia.
012	What did you say...?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0026
013	I want to stop the cycle of despair created by Alchemy!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0004
014	If Envylia can support Wratharis in its recovery, then we should be able to restore peace to this world!
015	Allow me to persuade him! If I can convince him as one born of Wratharis blood...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0041
016	Agatha...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
017	It's true that having fought hand in hand is a big first step.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0042
018	However...it's not that simple.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
019	If it were the words of a mere citizen, I doubt anyone would listen.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
020	However...what if they were the words of one descended from the royal family of Wratharis?
021	...You...!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0025
022	I told you, didn't I?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
023	I know the truth—that you are trying to hide what you have erased from history.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
024	What are you talking about?
025	If you have no ulterior motives for having made this girl your daughter, you should be able to clarify the truth.
026	Or...were you somehow planning on using her lineage to your advantage?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0012
027	Don't speak nonsense!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0013
028	I don't know how you came across that information, but I have no ulterior motives for having taken Agatha in as my daughter!
029	I wanted to protect her from the troubles that would befall one of her lineage...that is all!
030	Her lineage? What does that mean?	VO_logi.logi_sys_0027
031	It appears I can no longer keep it a secret.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
032	Agatha...there is something I must tell you.
033	O-okay...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
034	It's about your origin.
035	I told you that I discovered you at the battlefield of the Dawn of Wrath, where Wratharis was destroyed.
036	However, that is not the truth. Where I really did encounter you was within the royal castle of Wratharis.
037	Within the royal castle?	VO_logi.logi_battle_0020
038	Yes. Agatha...you are the legitimate heir to the Kingdom of Wratharis; you are none other than the princess of Wratharis.
039	What...?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0026
040	A-Agatha...the princess of Wratharis?!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0026
041	The royal lineage of the enemy kingdom must be cut off...	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
042	That was my intention when I headed for the royal castle. However, what I saw there...
043	...was the royal family, already destroyed by the Holy Guard.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0022
044	Is that your excuse?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0017
045	Even if you didn't dirty your own hands, if you were in a position to prevent it but didn't, you're just as guilty.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0013
046	I make no excuses.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0027
047	At that time...seeing the devastation occur before my eyes, I was prepared to shoulder all responsibility.
048	The Holy Order of Babel and its suzerain power is absolute.
049	I discarded my empathy and searched within the castle to see whether there were any of the royal family left alive.
050	It was then that I heard the cries of a baby.
051	Was that...me?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
052	Yes.
053	With his dying breath, your true father, the king of Wratharis...continued to hide you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0022
054	!!!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0022
055	If I did not discard my empathy, the cycle of sorrow would continue. Thus, I resolved myself and pointed my blade towards you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0018
056	However, at that moment...your little fingers clutched my foot.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0019
057	The warmth I could feel from your small hand halted my movement
058	Just as I was about to step into the path of darkness, I was saved by you!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0022
059	Father...	VO_logi.logi_sys_0016
060	Forgive me, Agatha... Forgive me for hiding this from you.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0036
061	Father...!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0019
062	You're right.
063	As Agatha descends from the royal family of Wratharis, the king might listen to her words.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
064	I want you to find a way for our two kingdoms to work hand in hand.
065	Sabareta...will you help these children carry out their dream?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0041
066	Zeke!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0042
067	I'll advise King Patrick to hold a meeting between our two kingdoms.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0010
068	I'll also suggest he consider the establishment of a Wratharis dominion with Agatha as its representative, thus connecting both our kingdoms.
069	Envylia and...Wratharis...?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
070	I-is such a thing possible?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
071	I know it's hard to believe! But, we're not lying to you! Please...believe us!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0041
072	Make one wrong move and, from that moment forth, consider your lives forfeit.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0031
073	Sabareta! Thank you!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0023
074	All right! Now that that is decided, let's hurry on!	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0024
075	There are avoidable conflicts happening even now in various places!
076	Wow! My idealized dreams may actually come to fruition!	VO_logi.logi_sys_0024
077	We might truly embrace a gentle and peaceful future...Dias!
