001	After an unexpected defeat at the hands of a mysterious greatsword-wielding opponent while apprehending child kidnappers...
002	Roxanne finds herself dealing with yet another headache in the form of Shion, who has arrived at her mansion with a message.
003	Well, color me surprised. You actually ARE here on business.
004	As much as your frustration amuses me, the fact that Soren is incapacitated is no laughing matter.
005	In fact, your assailant may very well be the same as the one Lord Zheng Yi encountered in Greed Dike.
006	One of two who made an attempt on his life.
007	What?! So she's a member of this "Projekt Goetia" you mentioned...
008	What exactly are they after?
009	Some time ago, the nobles in Greed Dike had called upon my lord to force the whereabouts of Atropos from him...
010	No, I do not have any plans to do so.
011	The Atropos Project has been shut down definitively. There is no reason to divulge its location.
012	But what of the remains? Are you implying it's simply sitting there, waiting to be found?
013	If it falls into the wrong hands, the consequences could be dire.
014	Far better for it to be recovered than to lie in an abandoned tunnel somewhere.
015	I thank you for your concern, but this is my burden to carry.
016	Now, if you'll excuse me, I must take my leave.
017	This has been a most generous feast.
018	*sigh*
019	I suppose my sins will haunt me for a while yet.
020	As long as we are taking steps in the right direction, it doesn't matter how small they are.
021	And I will be there with you, my lord. Every step of the way.
022	Asuka...
023	Come, let us make for home.
024	True love! How sweet! How positively heart-melting!
025	It seems to me this lovely pair have themselves a romantic little night lined up!
026	Wouldn't you say, Red?
027	...
028	The girl with the immense greatsword merely stares unblinkingly.
029	Oh dear! Not one for words, I suppose.
030	I hope our happy couple will be more eager to talk.
031	Who are you? What do you want?
032	Good questions, but I'll answer them after I'm through with Mister Right.
033	Oh, how I yearn to pry delicious little secrets from your lord over there...
034	I wonder how my name will sound on his lips?
035	Not a step closer.
036	Temper, temper!
037	Very well. If you so wish it, you may grovel for your life as well.
038	Red!
039	Get to work.
040	...Yes, Nesha.
