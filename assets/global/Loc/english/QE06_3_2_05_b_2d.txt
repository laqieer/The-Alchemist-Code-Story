001	Mikaboshi, now!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_battle_0007
002	Got it! Hyaaaaaahhhh!!!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0032
003	Mikaboshi! Sumeragi! Are you all right?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
004	Lady Mitsuha, what's going on?!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
005	......
006	It's spreading like a disease. More and more people keep turning into demons. It's absolute pandemonium.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
007	That's not possible, though!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0020
008	I wouldn't have thought so either, but it's hard to deny what's happening right in front of our eyes.
009	The soldiers you just fought are from one of the regiments that was guarding an afflicted village. If we're to assume this is, in fact, some sort of disease...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
010	Well, then we have to assume that everyone who's come in contact with that village is at risk of transforming, unfortunately.
011	So you do think it's a disease, then?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
012	I do. And as of yet, there's no cure. We're going to have to find one, though, before everyone in Wadatsumi turns into a demon.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
013	This is awful...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0021
014	Could it be mutation? But if so, what's the trigger? It just doesn't add up! None of this makes any sense!
015	......
016	People turning into demons out of the blue...
017	News of this new "disease" spread quickly throughout Wadatsumi, and exaggeration and hearsay only served to heighten the people's fear and dread.
018	As a precaution, Queen Mitsuha had the villages where the infection was confirmed evacuated and burned to ash, in hopes of containing any remaining trace of the disease.
019	It was a necessary precaution, but the end result is that livable space within Wadatsumi was dwindling fast, and nowhere was fully out of the reach of demons anymore.
020	This only amplified the distrust people already felt toward Queen Mitsuha, and the fear they already had toward demonkind in general.
021	And wherever distrust and fear are permitted to grow, corruption is sure to follow.
022	Reports came in that the monument sealing away the Demon Paragon had begun to crack.
023	The seal was weakening, and the Discarnate Power trapped within was at risk of being set free once more. Queen Mitsuha had no choice but to act quickly.
024	I don't have time to second-guess myself. I chose to bear this responsibility. I must now own up to that choice.
025	...!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
026	Please, wait!
027	?!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
028	Why are you standing in my way?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_battle_0010
029	Tell me, Lady Mitsuha, what's inside that syringe you're trying to conceal from my sight?
030	That's no concern of yours.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
031	Is it demon blood, perchance?
032	......
033	Do you mean to sacrifice yourself to strengthen the seal?
034	That is my intent, yes. There is no other way.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0004
035	I told you, you don't need to do this alone. You've always been free to ask for my help, and I insist you do so now!
036	What?!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
037	The weight of this decision is too much to bear for your shoulders, Lady Mitsuha. Yet, if you are prepared to bear it...
038	Then we, your faithful followers, must be equally prepared to give our lives for it.
039	What have you done?! This was my responsibility, not yours!
040	It is Wadatsumi's responsibility. We must be in this together, and this country must live on! The only burden you need to bear... No...
041	The only burden we wish you to bear is that of our gratitude.
042	You...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
043	Let us do what we can for a better tomorrow. I gladly offer my body to this grim fate, as I know my sacrifice will not be in vain.
044	If someone must do this, then...that someone should be me.
045	I'm so sorry for this. Or maybe...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0036
046	It would be more appropriate to say, thank you.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0033
047	Thus, the consciousness of the Demon Paragon was transferred to this new host and suspended within the massive gemstone that comprised the nucleus of the monument.
048	The citizen who'd confronted Mitsuha and taken on the role of Kago had even willingly injected himself with demon blood to give the seal the best possible chance of holding.
049	The one who went through with this ritual was given the unsettlingly poetic name of Kagomurasaki, meaning "caged violet."
050	But with some lingering concerns over the seal weakening, some took it upon themselves to erect a statue as well, in an effort to augment the seal's effects.
051	If one layer of protection isn't enough, it only makes sense to add another, after all. Yet this precautionary measure only served to draw further attention to the Kagomurasaki.
052	The people realized that a sacrifice had taken place, and they were outraged.
053	On top of the panic that was already present from the disease, things had now reached a boiling point. There was no quelling the crowds anymore. They were out for blood.
054	And naturally, much of this outrage was directed squarely at the twins.
055	You're harboring demon children! What kind of message does that send?! You need to kill them!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
056	I don't think our queen even has a human heart anymore. How can she, when she's willing to sacrifice her own people just to keep the Demon Paragon at bay?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
057	It's her fault we're in this mess to begin with! She thinks we can make peace with demons! Look where that's gotten us!
058	Our families were killed and driven from our villages, yet those demon children get to live in luxury! They should be slaughtered like pigs!
059	Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!
060	The queen is just as guilty as the demon children for protecting them! She must accept divine punishment for ruining our lives!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0013
061	Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!
062	......
063	Don't listen to them. This is all on me.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
064	But...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0027
065	I may not be able to protect you outside these walls, but at least let me see to it that you're safe within them.
066	But, Lady Mitsuha, this is...
067	It's natural, is what it is. I want to protect my children. And though the people have seen fit to place much of the blame on you two, those impulses belie their true complaints.
068	It's my countermeasures against the demons they can't accept. Not you.
069	......
070	But I'm prepared. I'm prepared to bear it. The harsh words of my citizens cut me no deeper than your youthful criticisms did. I accept them all, and pledge to make amends.
071	I will fix this. I'm just so sorry you had to get caught up in it. It's so unfair to you. I think...you should just return to your rooms for now.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0035
072	......
073	Halt! Stop right there! You are in the presence of Lady Mitsuha!
074	?!
075	We should have never made peace with demons. It was a mistake from the start! How could you not see that?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
076	If we'd just kept fighting them, we would've wiped them out, and I wouldn't have lost my wife and children!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
077	It's all your fault!!!
078	Be careful, Lady Mitsuha! He has a weapon!
079	!!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
080	Aaaaaarrrgggghhhhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
081	!!!
082	Mikaboshi?!	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0025
083	Mikaboshi? You...protected me...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0026
084	Mikaboshi!!!
085	......
