001	So this is an Alchemic ruin! To think that such a place was left unnoticed in this far land!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0024
002	Lord Gabirond, it appears they are engaging in some kind of excavation.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0004
003	Excavation? It's the same as the Gilrack Ruins.
004	The Gilrack Ruins? You mean to tell me they were excavating while they engaged in military activity there?
005	It can't be...!
006	Have you recalled something relevant?
007	Agatha had deducted that the Lizard Brigade were excavating some sort of ancient weapon!
008	What if that's the Demon?!
009	The Demon?! What are you talking about?!
010	The people from the village told us that the Lizard Brigade was attempting to resurrect the Demon. Do you know what it is?
011	The Demon is said to be an ancient weapon, born in secret using extreme and ancient Alchemy.
012	In the history of the Holy Order of Babel, it is written that it instantaneously reduced the ancient civilization of Babel to ashes.
013	The ancient civilization of Babel?!	VO_bertrand.bertrand_sys_0021
014	Why did you remain silent regarding something so important?!	VO_gabirond..gabirond_sys_0021
015	The Lizard Brigade... They plan to reawaken that cursed spawn!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0017
016	This is bad! We need to stop that excavation!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
