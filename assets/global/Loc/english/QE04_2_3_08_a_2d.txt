001	Uck...!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
002	How is it?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
003	...I feel like the pain has eased a little.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
004	...I see.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
005	Voda, I, Tina, the 45th chief of the Toxotes tribe, have come.
006	Tina...and Fuu as well...what are you doing here?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0025
007	There are those in the village who do not appreciate Tina and the others staying for an extended period of time.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
008	I thought it would be better for me to bring them here myself so that we can talk things over. Don't worry, as you can see, I brought the Fire Matter with me.
009	Voda...what has become of Mocca's blight?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
010	Even with the power of the Water Temple, alleviating the symptoms is the best I can do.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0035
011	In order to remove it from its core, we must find another method.
012	Another method...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
013	I am not certain. Perhaps we may find a cure in another country.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
014	Don't worry about me. It was my own failure that brought about this result.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
015	More importantly, what do you mean that there are those who don't appreciate Tina and the others staying in the village?
016	Hmm. Even if we are to work together, it would be pointless if we cannot manage to convince our people.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
017	Indeed. We must think of a way to unite their feelings.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
018	Furthermore, we must also persuade Tehre. All of this is making my head hurt.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0030
019	Voda...there is one thing I'd like to confirm with you. It's about the identity of the Jam.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1005
020	Did you figure something out, Tina?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
021	This is merely a deduction, but, thanks to Lisbeth, I was able to obtain an incredibly useful clue.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
022	Huh? Me? Did I do something?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
023	Voda... Voda, you also theorized about the identity of the Jam. Shall I share my idea with you?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
024	Please.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
025	First, regarding the location of the Jam's outbreak, it is spread out all across Saga. Furthermore, the rate of growth is exponentially fast.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
026	The Gluttony soldiers do something to the trees that result in an outbreak of the Jam.
027	Having investigated these trees, I found no particular evidence.
028	Tying together this information, I have derived a single hypothesis.
029	Hypothesis...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
030	Yes. First, it's that the source of the Jam outbreak is invisible to the eye.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
031	However, although invisible, there is most certainly something present there.
032	Perhaps a likely explanation would be that the Jam's source is a microorganism that is invisible to the naked eye.
033	Thus, judging by the speed of growth and distribution...I have arrived at one answer.
034	I see... The identity of the Jam...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
035	...is bacteria!
