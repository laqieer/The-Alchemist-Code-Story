001	Is it here...? She really must be a famous fortuneteller if even the thieves know about her.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0006
002	I've snuck in, but I'm sure she'll get suspicious if she finds me. I'm pretty much a thief again at this point.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
003	Maybe I should come back tomorrow...	VO_retzius.retzius_chara_1011
004	Good evening.
005	...! Oh, um, well, I bear you no ill intentions...even though my sneaking into your house makes that pretty questionable, um!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
006	Hehe. You don't need to get so flustered. I knew you would come here.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
007	Huh...why?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
008	The stars told me.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0004
009	The stars...? Wait, you were the girl who was just walking outside.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
010	Yes. The stars were beautiful tonight. That was when the stars told me you were coming.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
011	Um...sorry! I wasn't going to steal anything, I just wanted to meet you as soon as possible!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_1019
012	Oh my. How passionate you are.	VO_deneb.deneb_chara_1001
013	No, that's not what I meant! My name is Retzius, and, um...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_1050
014	My name is Deneb. So...who are you looking for?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0004
015	Huh...how did you know?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
016	The stars see everything.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
017	Wow! You're the real deal!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0046
018	Yes. Please, tell me the purpose of your visit here.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
019	Um...where should I start...oh! I don't know the name of the person I'm looking for...is that still all right?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
020	If the stars guide us it will be all right. But why this person?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0037
021	Well...I'm not sure how to put it, but...or where to start...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_1019
022	The stars will not miss out on even the smallest of details. Please, begin as you'd like.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
023	Um... I was a thief, but I quit. I did it in order to survive.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
024	That's why, well...I never thought about what I really wanted to do...or what I really believed in.
025	Still, there was an obscure part of me that wanted to live a straight and just life. I know that doesn't sound very convincing coming from a former thief.
026	But, when I met that guy, his words, actions...I don't know...they sent shivers down my spine.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0007
027	He was the embodiment of what I envisioned a man should be. He was cool, determined, and strong.
028	That's why I want to be acknowledged by him. This is the first time I've ever felt this way. I want to start there!
029	I see. It sounds like it was the encounter of a lifetime.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0045
030	Yes. Oh...sorry, I've been doing all the talking.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0004
031	No. Thank you for telling me your story.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0033
032	Can you really tell my fortune with just what I said? I was prattling on and...
033	Shhh.
034	Huh...?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
035	Deneb...?
036	...I see.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0045
037	You do?!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0027
038	When stars are drawn to each other, their light grows brighter. Once this happens...they cannot return to their former light.
039	...?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0006
040	A brighter light does not always mean happiness.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
041	Sometimes, it can rush you down the path to death.
042	Do you still wish to meet this man? Have you resolved yourself?
043	... ...
044	Without that resolve, I cannot tell you where he is. And I will have to ask you to leave.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0035
045	I don't understand the details, but I get that you're speaking in earnest, Deneb.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0031
046	Still, I want to me him. Even if you don't tell me where he is, I'll search the entire world until I find him.
047	I mean, for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm walking on my own two feet. I have absolutely no regrets.
048	A newborn star shines radiantly as if basking in its glow. You have certainly shown me how brightly you shine.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
049	...Then!
050	Yes. I'll tell you. The stars will lead you from here. May they protect you in your journey ahead.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
051	Yes! Just you wait, bro! I'm gonna find you!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0024
