001	The Crown's Guard?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
002	Yes. Until the Blue Flame Guard is back in operation again, we, the Scarlet Flame Guard, will pick up the slack.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
003	However, as things stand, both Captain Vettel and Nina bear incredibly heavy responsibilities.
004	This is why I think that we should form the Crown's Guard, and parcel out the duties between us. It is my hope that this will decrease their workloads a little bit.
005	I see. Sounds good to me. What do you think, Vettel? Nina?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
006	I'm all for it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
007	Keep in mind that if you were to hesitate on the battlefield, it could lead to the death of a Crown's Guard. Are you capable of maintaining an unshakable will, as Gerald and Nina have exemplified?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
008	Yes, Captain!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
009	Well, all right, then. We'll present this idea before the king and the captain of the Blue Flame Guard.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
010	Thank you!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0018
011	Wratharis' movements are becoming more and more threatening, so I've been thinking for a while now that we need to take action.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_1050
012	What has become of Wratharis' army?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
013	After you drove back the main troops, the soldiers who were garrisoned at the border also retreated.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
014	Whether it was truly a distraction, or whether it had some other purpose, is unclear at this point.
015	I had Victor investigate, just to be sure. The citizens are still a bit uneasy, and probably will be for a while yet.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
016	I see.
017	I pledge, here and now, to devote myself to the Scarlet Flame Guard and to work to the benefit of the proud nation of Envylia.
018	I will not waver again. I will not lose my sense of justice again. This, I swear.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0014
019	You have a good look in your eyes. What changed?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
020	I remembered the justice that I adhere to.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
021	I leave the matter of the Crown's Guard to you. I'll take my leave now.
022	They just keep growing, don't they? Oh, to be young again.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0008
023	What are you talking like an old man for? You've still got a heck of a lot of work before you! Should I prescribe you some medicine, grandpa?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
024	No, I think I'll get by. That aside... Nina, I've been meaning to ask you...	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0020
025	Yes...? Oh, this? This is my stuffed animal, Fluffy!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
026	Look at how big it's gotten! Eheheh... It's so cute!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
027	Y-yeah. I think it's, uh...unique.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
028	Eheheheheh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0023
029	I'm really happy that Chloe is feeling better. I'll have to work even harder now, to keep up with her.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0034
030	I'm going to keep moving forward, putting one foot in front of the other. That's what Fluffy here is for, to serve as the proof of my determination!
031	It's almost done, I think. I have to make sure not to waste any more fur, so that I can make it the cutest it can possibly be!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0009
032	...
033	Chloe.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
034	What is it, Nina?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
035	Is your heart a little more settled now?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
036	Not yet. Regardless, I must protect the world that she fought for.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
037	If she ever returns to this world, I want it be a peaceful one that will welcome her back.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
038	You really are strong, Chloe. I hope we can continue working together like this!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
039	I didn't mean to worry you. I'm all right now, really. As a fellow member of the Scarlet Flame Guard...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0008
040	I swear that I will support both you and Captain Vettel from now on!
041	Thank you! Let's do our best together, Chloe!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0033
042	Wow! A hug! You're so warm! Eheheheh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
043	Let's work hard together, Nina.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
044	Watch over me, Kanon...and know this:
045	The scarlet flame in my heart will never go out again!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0008
