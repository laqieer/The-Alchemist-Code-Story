001	What a relief. The queen isn't here!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	I wonder why they'd vacate the castle at a time like this.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
003	Anyway, it's our chance. Let get to the roof from here!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
004	Yes! Hmm?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
005	Liz?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0006
006	Look at this photo...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
007	This photo looks really old. Is that her mother next to her? Her face has been burnt off.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
008	Isn't this little girl the queen? Her eyes somehow seem similar.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
009	This is the throne room, so you're probably right. That means...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
010	The person next to her is Mother?! We can't see her face though...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
011	It's hard to imagine that a fire would just burn her face on the photo. Do you think the queen might have done it herself?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
012	How could she do that to such an important photo like this?  It's a picture of her own mother.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
013	As the daughter of Mother, the queen must have had a hard life.
014	In fact, I'm surprised she could even become the queen.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
015	Since her mother was hated throughout the country...I'm sure the queen was not treated well either...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
016	Didn't the queen say before that she was the one who made sure that the witch of sin was taught to be called Mother at school?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
017	She turned her own mother's sin into a symbol to distance us from the Sacred Stone.
018	So that we wouldn't repeat the same sin.
019	Still...we need to get our hands on the Sacred Stone. If we don't take care of this, nothing will change.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
020	Agreed!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
021	We will not let you!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0027
022	!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
023	You've stepped into the throne room over and over again... Are you prepared to pay the consequences?!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_battle_0022
