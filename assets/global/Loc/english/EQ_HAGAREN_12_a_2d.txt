001	The towers in all six nations have ceased operation. Well done, Alphonse. Let's not forget Toritoh and Edgar, either.	VO_roy.roy_sys_0009
002	But there's still one more left to defeat in order to actually stop the transmutation circle.
003	There's a tower-like spire in the shrine where Alphonse and everyone from Amestris were transmuted into being. The place I once considered to be my home.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0031
004	That makes sense. Well...we have to make our way back to Northern Pride anyway, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
005	I heard from Miss Riza that the souls of those who were sacrificed will continue to be absorbed as long as they're within the confines of the transmutation circle.
006	Once all of the souls are completely absorbed, the Dimensional Gate will open.
007	My soul is already on its last legs... I think I was already aware...that I would probably die, wherever I went.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
008	So that's why you seemed sick while we were in Greed Dike...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
009	But there's no reason to give up yet! We can still save you if we bring down that shrine tower!
010	Although, I'm not sure how probable it is that we can accomplish that...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0022
011	There's no time to call any allies to the battlefront. We're just going to have to make do with those already there.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
012	I'm sure everyone is already prepared for battle...but the stakes are higher this time, because we could lose Toritoh! So, don't forget...
013	Wait, Edgar.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
014	Wh-what is it, General? There's no way you're thinking of giving up and sacrificing yourself, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0049
015	No. I won't sacrifice myself for the Holy Order. The Holy Order gave me power and status, but they took everything else.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
016	My people, my friends, my home, my travels... Even good food. Nothing was left for me...not even anger.
017	However, my life and my soul are not for the Order to sacrifice. They are mine to dedicate to standing with all of you.
018	That's what I want. Instead of letting someone else tell me what to do, instead of following along...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
019	I will move forward on a path of my own choosing and live for no one but myself!
020	Toritoh...
021	For the people of Babel, I will unite with those of you from Amestris, and hope that when we say goodbye, we can do it with a smile.
022	Please, lend me your strength and allow me to fight at your side!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0015
