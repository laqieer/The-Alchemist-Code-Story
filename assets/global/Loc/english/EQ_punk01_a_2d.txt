001	Wh-where am I?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0018
002	Oh, that's odd. Your soul...it's separated.
003	Who are you? I'm...Tyrfing. My memory is a little foggy.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
004	Where is this place?
005	I am Ouroboros...the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_favorite_0001
006	This is the Door of Truth.
007	Hmm. I see. Within your body, I can feel your soul glimmer with something that is different from Alchemia. Are you a warrior from another world?
008	Glimmering inside my body...? Are you talking about my Killium?
009	Killium? What is that?
010	Oh, nothing... The word just fell out of my lips.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
011	The name doesn't matter. Its glimmer is the key.
012	My memory is hazy, but I can feel it in my bones: this world isn't mine.
013	What should I do?
014	I can see in your soul the light of a warrior. Perhaps there are things you will understand through fighting?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
015	... ...
016	Oh! I'm Killer Princess. Yes. That's what I thought! I need a commander in order to fight!
017	I guess I should search for a commander...
018	You must find the answer to that yourself. I will observe your glimmering soul.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
