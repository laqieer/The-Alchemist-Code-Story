001	I'm afraid of making another mistake.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0028
002	"I want power for Lost Blue."
003	I want to give you what you desire, but it is only after our wishes are fulfilled that we realize the depth of our hunger.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0021
004	"I understand your disappointment towards humans, but just this one last time..."
005	Humans believe in the gods, but the gods don't believe in humans.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
006	"Can you give Lost Blue a chance? Will you share your strength?"
007	They gamble on victories they cannot hope to achieve.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_battle_0019
008	"Who doesn't love an underdog story?"
009	Vanir.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
010	I will call to you, and grant you power one last time.
011	Because I'm afraid of making another mistake.
012	And I do not wish for you to fail.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0043
013	I'm not so sure about this...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
014	Hold on! Hear me out, okay? This baby responds to all kinda stimuli; voice, touch, you name it! Suitable for both long and short range, defense, offense, heavy infantry...whatever you want!
015	I don't know. Does it even work? It looks kinda crummy.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0029
016	Well, that all depends on who you hook it up to. It responds to the owner's brain waves, you see?
017	Right. That sounds like a convenient way to blame any defects on the customer.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
018	Say what you like. I doubt a skeptical fellow like you would be compatible with it, anyway.
019	...
020	Well, there's no need to rush into making a purchase. Take your time.
021	By the way, do you know this brat?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
022	Oh, she's quite famous in the underworld. Is she a recent acquisition of yours?
023	Hell no. I'm not into that kind of thing.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
024	Well, there's a fresh perspective. These war orphans aren't normally treated like humans.
025	Don't follow me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
026	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
027	I hate brats, women, and animals. A lot. So stay away from me. Got it?
028	Yes.
029	I thought I told you to stop following me!
030	Yes.
031	Seriously! Stop it!	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
032	Yes.
033	If you think I'm going to feed you again, you're dead wrong! I just... had a lot going on that day.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
034	I didn't want to eat alone. That's all it was.
035	Thank you for the meal.
036	Are you hungry?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0006
037	...
038	No.
039	You wanna grab a bite to eat?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
040	Thanks for the meal.
041	So you are hungry!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
042	No.
043	Just say what's on your mind, girl! I don't have time for games.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
044	I'll do my best.
045	Listen. A greedy moneylender used to live here.
046	He left behind his massive safe and everything. But before he scarpered, I got him to tell me how to open it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
047	Now I use it to hide stuff I don't want stolen.
048	*Drool*
049	That's right. Plenty of food in here too.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
050	Umgf...nom...snf...mmgf!
051	...
052	*Slurp* *Slurp* *Gulp* Mmgf...nom...mmf...umgf!
053	You've got quite the appetite.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
054	*Munch* *Munch* *Munch* Omnom...mmm...mmgf!
055	*Gulp*
056	Enjoying yourself, I hope?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
057	Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
058	Yeah? Tasty?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
059	...
060	If you're done, let's get going.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
061	...
062	It's tasty. Much better than blood.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0031
063	Uhh... What?
064	We never had enough food.
065	So you drank blood instead?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
066	My stomach was always empty. My throat was always dry. But the water was too dirty to drink.
067	I was told to drink the blood of corpses if I was hungry or thirsty. But then they laughed at me when I did.
068	Oh.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
069	Back then, Bianca and I were always together. She told me I could drink her blood instead.
070	I said no, at first. I didn't want to hurt her. But Bianca told me it'd be okay.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
071	I really didn't want to drink her blood...but I was so hungry. I couldn't stop myself.
072	She sounds like a good friend.
073	I wish I could thank her, and...tell her how sorry I am.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
074	Shall we go tell her together?
075	They found me crying on the street, and made me a slave. So I stopped crying. I laughed once, in the company of a fellow slave, and was harshly punished. So I stopped laughing.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
076	I flew into a rage, but they only laughed at me. So I stopped getting angry. I tried to reason with them, but nothing I said seemed to matter. So I stopped talking.
077	Even apologies or expressions of gratitude were unwelcome. We weren't worthy of kissing the soles of their boots.
078	Sounds like you got the short end of the stick no matter what you did.
079	I had no choice. If I didn't do what they wanted, Bianca would have ended up in the same situation.
080	And now I'll never get to tell her...anything. Not even goodbye.
081	Unghh... Bianca... I-I just want to say...th-thank you! A-and I... I'm so sorry! Ungh... Waaaaaah!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0019
082	...
083	*Sniffle*
084	What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't wipe your nose on me! I don't want your snot stains on my nice, black coat!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
085	Unghh... *Sniffle*
086	Dammit! You little...!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
087	My name is Amu.
088	What?!
089	My name. It's Amu.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
090	So what?! You're just an annoying little brat in my eyes, squirt!
091	Excuse me... Nihil?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
092	Huh?!
093	Hey. How's Dead Nine?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
094	He hasn't woken up yet. He's barely even stirred. The injuries he incurred while protecting me in Veda were severe, so...it might take a while.	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0019
095	I see.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
096	A m-monster?
097	Huh?
098	Y-yes. Yes.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
099	Oi, squirt! What's—?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
100	"Ladies and gentlemen! It's what you've all been waiting for!"
101	Kill. Must...kill.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
102	"What will happen when man and beast clash? It's the pure of heart versus the wild and wicked! Will we see innocence prevail over the evils of this world?!"
103	Huh?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0006
104	"She's the artificial maiden! The beast of war! That's right, give it up for...AMU!!!"
105	Wh-what?!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
106	Yikes!	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0025
107	"Amu! Amu! Amu! Amu!"
108	Geez! Spill your food everywhere, why don't you!
109	No. Yes. I will do my best.
110	You'd better clean that up. I'm not doing it for you.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
111	"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!"
112	I am a beast of war. Amu...must kill.
113	Oh, heck no. It's like she's been brainwashed or something..	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
114	What happened to this child?
115	Haa... You know what I always say about brats, women, and animals.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
116	That you hate them?
117	That any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
118	Doesn't that make you worse than a dog?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0030
119	Which is exactly why I hate 'em. I'm already enough of a piece of crap, you know? I don't need to get any worse.
120	In this particular situation, at least it's self-defense.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
121	Sure. Let's go with that.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0005
122	...!
123	Sorry about this. It's nothing personal.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0036
124	You got something to say, Amu? Speak up. Call me whatever name you want. Tell me that the food tasted terrible. Tell me you wanted something better.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
125	If you've got a complaint, don't hold back. I wanna hear it.
