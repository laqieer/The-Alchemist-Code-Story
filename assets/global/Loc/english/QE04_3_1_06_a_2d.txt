001	Oh, I'm getting in your way, am I? Well, we never discussed a pincer attack. How do you justify that?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0012
002	What I seek is a fair battle between powerful warriors! Victory cannot be obtained through your schemes!
003	I will do what is best to achieve our ends...I thought that was obvious.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
004	I gave you instructions to remain at Port Nahema. All of this...is to fulfill our purpose.
005	I'm enjoying myself right now! I won't allow even the likes of you, Tehre, to interfere with my pleasure!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0015
006	I see...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
007	Agh...! What are you doing?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
008	And how exactly are you going to stop me?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
009	Now run back to Port Nahema. You haven't forgotten about our little deal, have you?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
010	No...of course I haven't! Once our deal is complete, I wish to fight you...Tehre!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
011	Wait! Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
012	Your lives have been spared. Cherish them while you can.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
013	...What is Tehre doing here?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
014	I'm not sure...but it appears he really has joined forces with the Gluttony army. What "deal" is he referring to...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
015	Please wait, Tehre!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
016	...If you have something to say, say it quickly. I have no time to waste here.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
017	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Tina, the 45th chief of the Toxotes tribe. I am a Wind Shaman.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0005
018	My time is limited. Cut the formalities, and get to the point.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0002
019	Ack...! Tehre, be careful!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
020	Glurrrppppp!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
021	Tehre!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
