001	Gyarr?!
002	That should keep them at bay for a while.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
003	Thank you! I knew we could count on you!
004	Other beasts could come at any moment. Let's hurry.
005	Right, the exit's close!
006	(Would we have a chance even if we do make it to the Liberation Army?)
007	(The Jam are practically immune to standard weapons. We'll need to come up with some sort of countermeasure.)
008	Come to think of it, there was something about that factory that kept the Jam away.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
009	What could it have been?
010	Are we at the outskirts of the city?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
011	We are. This should be far enough to—
012	Grrrrrrr...
013	Eek! The Jam are out here, too?!
014	We have to run away!
015	Ngh!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
016	(I've exhausted myself! I don't know how long I'd be able to hold them off!)
017	Take that!
018	Grrraaarrr?!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0021
019	Is that...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
020	Some of the powdered lime from the factory! I figured it'll at least make a smoke screen!
021	Glurrrrrp?! Grrraaaaagh!
022	I-it's running away.
023	Could it be?
024	The difference in how fast they multiply between here and Saga... The fact that they slow down in the desert... That "Wind" Ouija purifies them...
025	I have it!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0024
026	M-mister?
027	I was a fool! How did I not realize this sooner?!
028	We could be rid of the Jam even without the power of purification!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0008
029	You okay? You didn't hit your head there, did you?
030	I thank you. You've brought us all hope!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0034
031	We must find the Liberation Army, but first...
032	I'll lead you two to a town near by. Follow me.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
033	Thank you so much. Heheh. You finally smiled.
034	What...?
035	I'm saying that you look better with a smile on. I'm glad I was able to help.
036	I know this isn't something you want to hear from someone who has lived peacefully in the capital all this time, but...
037	Please, save this country. I've seen enough tragedy.
038	I will.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0038
