001	An illusion?! Like before?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
002	Once the resurrection ceremony is complete, your duties as the druidic priestess will come to their natural end.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
003	I tried to move up your wedding with Isidore before this happened, but...	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0012
004	I suppose it was all for naught.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0029
005	Are you sure about this, Malta?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
006	Yes, Father. I have already made my decision.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0006
007	My fate was sealed the day Protector Judah passed away.
008	What is this? What are they talking about?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0025
009	I will give my whole self to Sephiron, to protect this land, this village, and...the one I love.
010	So Kamui's really popular, huh? Miss Malta, you must get nervous about that, huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
011	Excuse me?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
012	Heh, I mean, aren't you showing me around because you're hoping to see him?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0011
013	N-no, I was just, you know, checking in with my patient! Doing my due diligence!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
014	Aw, that's disappointing. You know, if you keep making excuses like this, you'll never be more than childhood friends.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
015	...
016	Uh-oh. Are you upset?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
017	Hisham, you little...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
018	Are these...Malta's memories?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
019	Father? You needed to speak to me?
020	Malta...	VO_iakof.iakof_favorite_0002
021	I have given my blessing to Isidore's request for your hand in marriage. I believe he is the right person to entrust the future of this village to.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
022	What?! But—!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0025
023	It has been decided. We cannot let the sacred bloodline die out.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0012
024	Sephiron does not have much longer.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
025	Yet our duty remains. We must do everything in our power to prevent its inevitable end.
026	Just as your mother did before you.
027	But...!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
028	I already know how you feel about Kamui.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
029	However, he is of the Protectors' bloodline. His sephirah is proof that he is destined to bear the burden of the forbidden knowledge.
030	The purity of the blood that runs through your veins, the blood that carries the final, hidden sephirah, cannot mix with his.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0027
031	We must not repeat the mistakes of our ancestors.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0040
032	This is all for Sephiron. Please understand, Malta.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0035
033	I... Yes, Father.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0006
034	It has always been you I wanted to be with.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
035	Malta...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1008
036	I wanted to be with you. I wanted you to want me. I just couldn't be honest about how I felt.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_1004
037	Father would not allow it, because he knew you would eventually become the Protector.
038	Father loved you as he would his own son, but his devotion to Sephiron always came first.
039	I assume Father told you to give up on me.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
040	Malta, that's—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
041	I know, I know. That's why I—	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
042	Malta, no!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
