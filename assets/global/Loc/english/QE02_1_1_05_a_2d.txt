001	Th-that was you?!
002	I'm sorry I disturbed your sleep that day.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0033
003	But...thanks to your younger self, I managed to not get my hands dirty. Would've been a waste anyway.
004	A waste?
005	The man who hired me to attack your old man had already been eradicated.
006	Anyway, I thought it sounded fishy from the start.
007	Wh-what do you mean?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
008	There are rumors that the Holy Guard was behind the destruction of the Kingdom of Envylia.
009	My guess is that they also had something to do with my client.
010	Word is they're desperately searching the continent for any and all Sacred Stones.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
011	Ohh...! So-sorry. You gave me a bit of a fright.
012	Don't worry. Maybe I said too much. More suspicious now?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0035
013	No. You spoke honestly and didn't hide the truth from me.
014	Besides, my father said that you both wanted to save the world.
015	...Right.
016	Alkaroids approaching! Alkaroids approaching! They're headed this way, aye!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0010
017	Tsk! So much for small talk. Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
