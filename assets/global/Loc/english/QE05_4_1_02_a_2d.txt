001	Whoa!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
002	Everyone! Now!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
003	Right! 'Scuse me!
004	Are these all of the merchant caravans from the central desert?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
005	Yeah. These are all of the scheduled deliveries. Let's head back to the oasis for now.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
006	Should we really be doing this?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0031
007	What do you mean, Logi?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
008	As we stand here, Gluttony's army is preparing to invade the desert again.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
009	If we're going to be attacking the royal capital, shouldn't we get our soldiers together and head out already?
010	Instead, we're here, guarding merchant caravans...
011	The soldiers in the oasis won't be coming with us.
012	Huh?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
013	It is those who desire a revolution for their country who will be conducting the attack upon the royal capital. Of course, we will still be needing their help.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
014	Those who have gathered in the desert will draw out Gluttony's main forces and delay them.
015	The Liberation Army, together with those of us who have made contracts with the Door of Truth, will use the time they buy us to launch our surprise assault on the city.
016	I was hoping that we would be able to join up with the Blue Tongues before that...
017	We still haven't heard anything from them.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
018	According to the civilians who escaped the city, they were last seen heading out toward the desert to draw those mysterious attackers away.
019	Gluttony's reinforcements are slowly gathering at the border. They are clearly not ready to invade immediately.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
020	Their army has been routed once, however temporarily. It will take them some time to regroup and regain their morale.
021	According to the information we received from our merchant contacts in Gluttony Foss, it sounds like it's going to take them about a week.
022	In other words, we still have time before they invade the desert again.
023	Considering that, I think that we can spare some people to search for the Blue Tongues while our army in the oasis is getting itself ready.
024	Right. Thanks, Kamui.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0033
025	Don't mention it. We're all in this together.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
026	In any case, we just have to hold tight for a while, and do all we can before the Gluttony army gets here.
027	So then—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
028	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
029	We should clear this area of monsters. That should help facilitate the replenishment of supplies.
