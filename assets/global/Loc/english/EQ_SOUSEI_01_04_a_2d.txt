001	...
002	(The all mother, the great tree, the Tree of Life, Sephiron.)
003	We must...hurry.	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
004	We can't let...the corruption spread...any further.
005	I need to purify it. The corruption...of sin.
006	(She stole my little sister, and makes her suffer, just as the Cursed Beast and the cursed way of this damn world make her suffer.)
007	(I hate it... I despise all of it.)
008	...
009	...
010	You truly are as fickle as the winds.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
011	That blue blade... You forged it using Sephirium, didn't you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
012	It is a difficult material to work with, especially to craft arms.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
013	Yet it is harder than any metal. One would never guess that it is plant resin.
014	A Sephirium blade... Never thought I'd live to see the day.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0044
015	That I was able to obtain such a rare material gives my presence in this land meaning.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
016	Well, that's good to hear.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
017	Tell me why you have blown into my workshop today, little zephyr.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
018	I've brought a friend with me.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
019	A friend? I never even wanted your company to begin with... Must I have two nuisances with whom to contend?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
020	So this is the smithy, huh? It kinda reminds me of my workshop.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
021	...
022	This lad hails from the Acedia Belt Region.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
023	Lad...?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
024	What is your Engineer Soldier made from?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
025	Huh?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
026	Yna... You've heard of it before? The Engineer Soldier?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
027	I saw you fighting it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
028	Now tell me what it's made from.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
029	The base is mainly red metal.	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
030	Red metal, hm? Gleigstene would be better. It's lighter and stronger.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
031	What the hell is that? Clay...gusten...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
032	If you don't have access to that, Glinium should work just as well.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
033	It's a little weightier than Gleigstene, but no less sturdy.
034	That won't work, either. Can't do much mining in the Acedia Belt Region.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0039
035	Actually, wait...	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
036	What about Biligiustene? It's pretty much identical to Glinium.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
037	It is too hard. It would be difficult to work with.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
038	No worries there. Back home, we've got the technology to refine it, no problems. We use it in place of Glinium.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
039	Truly? In that case...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0009
040	Biligiustene, huh? It's so commonplace, I just wasn't seeing it. I might try that.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
041	Heh...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
042	What is it, Nimul?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
043	Well?
044	It's just as I thought. You two get along swimmingly.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
045	...
046	I didn't think we'd end up talking shop right off the bat.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0030
047	I am a blacksmith. Machines are not my area of expertise, but I do know my materials.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
048	I merely expressed my opinion.
049	Come to think of it, the Engineer Soldier could use a weapon.	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
050	What do you say? Will you forge something for me?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0003
051	I forge arms for people. I am a blacksmith, not a weapons dealer.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0040
052	What's the difference?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
053	It's his pride as a craftsman. I get that.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
054	Blacksmiths and weapons dealers are completely different.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
055	I...see.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
056	Told ya. The spirit of a craftsman is a stubborn one.
057	Hey, can I have a look at that sword?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
058	This? This is my blade.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
059	Yeah, that one! I don't know anything about blacksmiths and their swords, but...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
060	Even I can tell that that blade is one of a kind!
061	This sword...
062	Is a fragment of my very soul. I never felt that way about a blade until I held this one.
063	In other words, it's your masterpiece!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
064	No. It is not that.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
065	Huh? Do you have a better sword stashed away somewhere, then?
066	Nor is that the case. I do not believe in the word "perfection."	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
067	There is no such thing as a masterpiece.
068	You know what? I like that attitude!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0024
069	And damn, it's contagious! Now I'm itching to hole up in the workshop on my airship and start improving my Engineer Soldier!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
070	Not to put a damper on your enthusiasm...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
071	Ugh! What is it, Nimul?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
072	I was hoping you wouldn't mind telling us more about the other belt regions you've been to.
073	Again? Jeez, Nimul, you really like hearing about them, don't you?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
074	Just as the two of you are interested in technology and minerals unknown to you, I want to know more about the world in which we all live.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
075	But I've already told you everything I know, Nimul.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
076	I've only been to two regions.
077	The Acedia Belt Region, and the Luxuria Belt Region. That's it.
078	The place where I once lived...was called Avari Village.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
079	It is a place shrouded always in dark clouds, where lightning bolts rain down from the sky, night and day.
080	The trees struck by lightning would catch alight, and their fire would swallow up entire forests, trapping the creatures within in a fiery grave.
081	This was the punishment that was visited upon that land.
082	That is no punishment.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
083	Hm?
084	What do you mean by that?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
085	The pollution of the earth... Quakes, permafrost, lightning storms... These are not punishments. They are calamities, each and every one of them a terrible misfortune suffered by the people.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
086	...
087	Sure, but aren't these calamities still humankind's punishment?	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
088	Adaleigh... You mustn't fall into that trap.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
089	Trap? What trap?
090	You should begin by questioning the so-called "way of the world."
091	For the first step in reshaping this world is to take a critical look at the things which supposedly govern it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
092	H-huh?!
093	I'm sure you'll figure it out.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
094	A critical look, huh...?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
095	...
096	Nimul!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
097	Waginau...?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
098	What are you doing here?! The Godwolf Ceremony is today!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
099	Not only is it an important day for your sister, but for you as well! Today, you will be ordained as chief of the Sephira Village!
100	I am well aware of that fact, thank you, Waginau. But the ladies-in-waiting should have already taken care of the preparations. There is little for me to do.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
101	Is there some reason why I should not be here?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
102	You're a damn fool. Now, come with me!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
103	H-hey! Quit pulling on me, you maniac!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
104	Hey, I thought this ceremony was to renew the connection between the Vessel and the Sephiron.
105	What does the chief have to do with it?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
106	Nimul once told me...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
107	That the role of chief is second only to that of the Vessel herself in its importance to the Sephira people. Apparently, this has something to do with the judgment passed by the Godwolf Asena.
108	Hmm...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
109	Not only that...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
110	Oh?
111	But the Godwolf Ceremony is also a festival; a celebration, to be shared by the entire village.
112	A festival, huh? You gonna go?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0044
113	While Nimul might frequent my forge, the other villagers are not nearly so fond of me.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
114	I am an outsider, you see.
115	Besides, it will be far too noisy for my tastes.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
116	So... You're not gonna go?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
117	...
118	Well, I must admit, I'm curious. I'm gonna go check it out.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
119	...
120	Come, come! The Godwolf Ceremony is today! Why not warm your belly with a cup of sacred sake?
121	A wooden mask for the little lad! Or how about you, pretty lady? Come try one on! Don't be shy, now!
122	Just as I thought. There are far too many people here.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
123	So you say, yet here you are.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0007
124	It is a special day for him. I owe him this much.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
125	I guess... I probably owe Nimul, too, come to think of it. He's been pretty good to me.	VO_adlai.adlai_chara_1018
126	Anyway, you think we'll actually be able to watch this thing? The ceremony, I mean.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
127	An altar will be built among Sephiron's roots.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
128	You can watch from afar, certainly.
129	...
130	Huh? Waginau?! What're you doing here? What about the ceremony?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
131	Me? I am the head of the Sephira Guard. I am here to protect the people in the unlikely event that some accident should occur.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0010
132	Julia and the ladies-in-waiting are the ones who manage this rite.
133	Well, it is almost time.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
134	The ceremony will begin shortly.
135	Please proceed to the altar, Lord Nimul, Lady Emmel. I am afraid that I am unable to follow you past this point.
136	...
137	Thank you, Julia.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0034
138	May the ceremony be concluded safely.
139	Let's go, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
140	Right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
141	...
142	Tree of Life, Sephiron, mother of the Sephira...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0011
143	O Guardian Dragon Nidhogg... May your avatar, the Godwolf Asena, come forth into our midst.
144	The Godwolf...
145	What the—?! Look, a wolf!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
146	It is the Godwolf Asena.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
147	The avatar of Guardian Dragon Nidhogg, the ancient dragon who protects our people.
148	The avatar of an ancient dragon...
149	The Great Nidhogg resides in the heavens above, and restrains for us the powers of the Cursed Beast sleeping beneath our feet.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
150	Can't you communicate with the dragon itself?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
151	It is impossibly colossal. Should the Great Nidhogg descend upon us, we would all be sent flying.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0040
152	Well... That doesn't sound good. It can stay up there.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
153	...
154	Godwolf Asena, as the Vessel of Purification, I beseech you... Bind unto me Sephiron's powers.
155	The land has been ravaged to a more terrible extent than ever before by the Cursed Beasts and their corruption. It is withering, and it is dying.
156	Please, I beg of you... Give me strength.
157	It shall be done.
158	Yes... I can feel it. The great power of the Sephiron... It's warmth...
159	Vessel.
160	Yes, Your Divinity?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
161	With these powers, see thy duty done.
162	...
163	Upon my heart...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
164	O Asena...
165	This child of the Sephiron would be the chief of the Sephira.
166	Please... We humbly ask for your judgment on—
167	Godwolf Asena.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
168	N-Nimul! What're you...?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
169	...
170	I would ask you this: what is the way of the people of this world?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
171	Live alongside the corrupted earth; shoulder thy sins, and perish among them.
172	Then pray allow me another question: why must humankind shoulder their sins? Who is it who punishes us?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
173	Nimul! What are you doing?! Stop this! The ceremony—!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
174	So long as thou roam these lands, thou cannot escape thy sins.
175	Even as none of thy kind can hope to live without bringing misfortune upon others, so sin and punishment are as fundamental as breath and air.
176	For these are the Cursed Beasts.
177	The Cursed Beasts are thy sins made manifest.
178	Wh-what...? The Cursed Beasts are...our sins?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
179	It is so.
180	The seven sins...
181	Seven are the sins committed by humankind.
182	Superbia. Ira. Invidia. Gula. Avaritia.
183	Luxuria. Acedia.
184	There are seven lands in this world in which humankind resides, and each of them is haunted by a beast of sin.
185	The sin of this land is...Gula. And the name of the beast of sin that slumbers beneath our feet...is the Cursed Beast Beelzebub.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
186	What?!
187	Which means that the true name of this land is...the Gula Belt Region.
188	It is as thou say.
189	Godwolf Asena... Can nothing be done about the sins of this world?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
190	...
191	Nimul! Stop...! Please!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
192	You're going to anger the Godwolf Asena!
193	Answer me, Godwolf!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
194	Nimul!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
195	Speak, Godwolf!
196	Stop it! As the Vessel of Purification who serves Sephiron, I command you!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0015
197	Nimul of the Sephira, you will restrain yourself!
198	Ngh... Hrrnghh...! My determination cannot be halted so easily!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
199	Wh-what?! I am ordering you to stop!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0026
200	Please don't, Emmel. You're the one I'm trying to...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
201	Yes?! I'm the one you're trying to...what?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
202	Graaaarrrrrgghhhhh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
203	No! I can't believe it... You resisted my powers, the powers of the Vessel, of Sephiron...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
204	Sorry, Emmel.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0035
205	Godwolf Asena! How can we free ourselves from sin?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
206	Who art thou?
207	Ngh...!
208	My name is Nimul, and I am to be the chief of the Sephira people.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
209	I sense within thou a tremendous strength of will...and a small, yet brilliant, power... Thine might.
210	Distinct from the magics of the great tree... A power set to turn this world on its end.
211	...
212	What wilt thou do with these powers?
213	I'm going to remake this world. The way of the world will be no more.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
214	Wh-what are you talking about?! Nimul...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
215	Vessel. A trial.
216	What the...?! Our...shadows?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
217	O Asena...! Please, stop this! I beseech you to forgive my brother's impudence!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
218	Nay.
219	But...!
220	Best thine shadow. Prove that thine will and thine might are true.
221	Best thine shadow, if thou wouldst alter the way of this world.
