001	Thankfully...
002	The old me no longer exists.
003	After the battle following my escape from the prison, Vier used her Phantom arts to disguise one of the soldier's bodies as my own.
004	A few days later, a small article appeared in the Babel Continental Times quietly announcing that a small riot in Wratharis had been quashed.
005	In other words, the color that was once my identity disappeared as cleanly from the face of this world as if it had never existed.
006	This is Kuro. A Beast Shadow.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
007	Kuro. Say, "Nice to meet you."
008	May I pet her?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
009	No.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0014
010	Why not?
011	Sieba. You should be in bed.
012	It's been days since you received the power from another dimension. Getting used to it takes time.
013	You still look worn out from the whole experience.
014	I could say the same thing to you.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
015	Sol said I needed to rest before I took another mission. Even though I'm completely fine.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
016	Can I see Kuro?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
017	She's very cute, although she can be a bit moody.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0008
018	Kuro... Yes, your name is Kuro. We're the same color, aren't we? You and I.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
019	She's beautiful.
020	Kuro is very strong. So am I.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
021	I know.
022	I want you to remember...just how strong we are.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
023	Soon we'll be gone. I hope you will remember us even after we are no longer here.
024	...
025	He will take on this power after we are done. That clumsy man.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
026	So, if you don't mind, when he comes...remain by his side. Be kind to him.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0041
027	He's just as moody as I am, but I hope you will remain with him.
028	He must be someone very important to you.
029	Now you know what is most important to you.
030	What?
031	Don't forget it. So long as you don't forget it, it's never truly gone. I think.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
032	I...! I think...you're right.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0011
033	Am I...talking too much?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
034	Not at all. I learned a lot from you just now. I almost feel like you're my older sister or something.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0046
035	S-sister...?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
036	Well, I'm number seven of this little family we call the Templars, and you're number two. You came first, so that makes you basically my older sister.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
037	S-sister...? But I think you're more mature than me, Sieba. You know...bigger in some places...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0050
038	Heheh...heheheh...hee hee hee... Oh, please. Do go on! No need to hold back. Lavish me with praise!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
039	It doesn't look like it, but you're even bigger than Füry...in certain places.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
040	I am! It doesn't look like it, but I really, really am!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
041	I wish I could grow...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0024
042	You will! Of course you'll grow, and one day—oh! I...
043	...
044	I-I'm so sorry.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0036
045	I will get bigger.
046	B-but you said—
047	I'm going to be that muscle-brain's strength.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
048	I will never forget you, Zwei. Never.
049	Thank you.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0033
050	Thank you! Like I said, I learned a lot from you.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
051	Oh.
052	Zwei?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0004
053	Sol. No.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0014
054	Wh-what is it? What's wrong?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
055	I have to go.
056	Wait! Don't go! Tell me what happened!
057	We only need three more.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
058	Now that Sieba has joined the fold, we have seven of our ten Templars. It won't be long before we have filled our ranks.
059	Which means that it's only a matter of time before we set out into the world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
060	...
061	Cat got your tongue?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
062	Will you not value life?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0002
063	Huh?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
064	Each of us are blessed with only one. War is a fool's errand that results in such a pitiful loss of life. So many lives would be stolen.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
065	Picking a fight with the world is nothing less than a suicide mission. Even if, by some miracle, we were to succeed, there would hardly be anyone to commend us for our deed...
066	Fair enough, but...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
067	Humans eat other creatures, thus ending those lives to sustain their own.
068	It's human nature to lengthen one's own life by robbing other creatures of theirs.
069	Life itself has no value.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
070	Eating a delicious dish is innocuous enough.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0044
071	Before it gets cold.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
072	However, once eaten, it is gone forever.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0031
073	The completeness of will and faith—the refusal to bend to another's will—is what truly ought to be valued in this world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
074	Hahah...	VO_drei.drei_sys_0007
075	This is why I like you, Sol.
076	Well, I don't like you one bit. You disgust me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0029
077	You wish to overturn that which is deemed right through the power of belief.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
078	Therein lies your mistake. You blunder even as you proceed.
079	A mistake led to me being abandoned. If that can be seen as "right" to some...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
080	Then I am more than happy to be "wrong". I'll make the whole world wrong if I have to.
081	Oho...
082	Have I inspired you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
083	You have inspired something in me, my fellow. Something...that cries for blood.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
084	Zwei...?! What are you doing here?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
085	Won't let you.
086	I knew it. I knew it!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
087	Huh?
088	You're a terrible human being!
089	I don't recall ever having denied that accusation.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
090	Uaaaaaarrghhh!	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0025
091	Sol! Zwei! Drei! What's going on?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
092	Sieba...! Stay...away...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
093	You know...I really want to create a bouquet.
094	Then make one.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
095	I want to arrange the flowers...build them up...and then snap them off myself.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
096	Dote on the seeds, water them, let them sprout. Select those which stand proud among their fellows, prune them, harvest them...devour them.
097	Sol... Just before your beliefs, so strong and true, come to fruition; just when you begin to feel hope for what you perceive as your future and glow more brightly than anything... That is when I will harvest you. I am going to snap you off at the stem while you are still fresh and raw!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
098	Right...now!
099	The organization known as the Templars is but three paces away from completion. The flower that has bloomed under my care is blossoming. Nothing could bring me greater joy than this moment!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
100	That explains the name...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
101	Huh?
102	I didn't think... I mean, who the hell names themselves after the land known for betrayal?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
103	I am honest to a fault. You could say I warned you.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
104	Drei... There are three reasons why I welcomed you into the Templars with little argument.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
105	Firstly, because you provided me with the opportunity to recruit our seventh member.
106	M-me...!
107	Your personage, uncouth as it may have been, took shape before my very eyes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
108	You exposed yourself to danger after danger for such trifles.
109	T-trifles?!
110	Just when I thought you had begun to blossom, your petals began to wither. If your color continues to fade like this, you will be entirely unworthy of appreciation.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0016
111	Wh-what the hell...are you...?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0021
112	I can't stand to look at you anymore.
113	Wh-what?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
114	Sieba!
115	N-no...!
116	You never did learn when to quit.
117	So you...lied to me?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0021
118	There is no lie here. I wanted to see what blossom you would bloom into. I long to see your petals fall at the moment of your death.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
119	For this, I have watered you. Gently...and with care.
120	I-I...!
121	You cannot imagine my disappointment when the moment you obtained absolute power...your spark died out. Fizzled into nothingness.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0022
122	I didn't mean to. I didn't want to! I wanted to keep it, but I threw it all away for you!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0018
123	I wanted to show you my truest self, but I...
124	You are no longer worthy of being an appetizer, let alone a flower.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0016
125	You are lower than a weed.
126	I... I...
127	You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0008
128	Don't throw me away! This is the real me! I'm shining now!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
129	I'm shining for you, right here!
130	Don't go! Please don't go!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0020
131	Kuro.	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0004
132	Huuzzzzaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0007
133	Zwei! That's enough!
134	Haa...haa...! I can't die yet! Don't let him kill me! Not until he is here...!	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0019
135	I will stop him! You can still...!
136	The way you attempt to hold back oblivion even as it crushes your spine... Such strength! I just can't get enough!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
137	I'm not that capable.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
138	You know, I still don't think there's a scrap of value in all that stuff you spouted about the value of life, but that doesn't mean I want to die.
139	And you're wrong. It's not about strength. Only discipline can make one strong enough to carry that weight.
140	I knew you smelled fishy. Ugh, you stink.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
141	I never needed a horoscope to tell me that you're a traitor.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0004
142	You see, Sol?	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
143	As for the second reason why I allowed you to join the Templars...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
144	That would be because Zwei was grateful to you.
145	Ah!
146	Ahh, yes. I believe I have more than compensated for my betrayal on that count.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0004
147	The third reason...
148	I thought you were a decent human being.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
149	Oho? Well, well.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0009
150	There's never been an opportunity for me to use the full range of my powers before now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
151	You're the perfect target for me to see what these powers from the other dimension are capable of.
152	How does it feel to be the one on the other end of an experiment?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
153	Honestly? I can't get enough!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0023
154	Sieba...
155	I...
156	Come on. Let's go!	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0004
157	B-but...
158	That's enough dilly-dallying for now. Let's just get to the fighting!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
159	D-dilly-dallying...?!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0025
160	I-I'm the older sister, right? Well, consider this an order!
161	A-all right. I'm with you!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0037
162	I must cull a few rotten weeds... All so that I may pluck you from their midst, Sol.
163	If there is to be a test, then let us commence it now!	VO_drei.drei_battle_0030
