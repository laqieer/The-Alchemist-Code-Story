001	Wow, what amazing craftsmanship! The sword is changing shape as if it were a living entity!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
002	Geez...<br>Who do you think I am?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
003	Alright, we've prepared the groundwork. Now comes the moment of truth.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
004	You'll be releasing the darkness energy from Guren Blade, right?
005	Exactly. Are you ready?<br>I'll be counting on your power of light.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
006	I'm ready!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
007	Here it comes!<br>Kanon, suppress it with your power of light!!!
008	Lord Zain! Captain Cadanova!<br>Please lend me your strength! Here it goes!
009	Whoaaaa!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
010	Ugh! Urghhhhhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
011	Alright!<br>Father, lend me your strength!<br>Whoaaaaaa!!!
012	Kanon, just a little more! Keep on going!!!
013	Uuurghhhhh!!!
014	Oh no, this is bad!<br>The darkness's counter-reaction is stronger than I anticipated!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0027
015	Ughh!<br>C-come onnn!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
016	Ugh! Don't falter, Kanon!!! Zain and Cadanova entrusted the future to you! They believe in you!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
017	Don't let their dying wish go to waste!
018	Uuurghhhhh!!!
019	Whah?!<br>Kanon!!!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0019
020	Uuaaaahhh!!!
021	Huh?<br>What's this tremor?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
022	The restoration process must be reaching its climax!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
023	Spica! I don't truly understand what you're trying to achieve here!
024	But... whatever your intention may be, I cannot allow you near Kanon!
025	I will stop you right here!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0013
026	...!
027	Ugh! She's fast!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
028	You could never defeat me.<br>Please don't involve yourself in futilities.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0016
029	No, I will definitely defeat you!
030	Would that be for the sake of her, or could it be...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
031	For both!
032	...!
033	I will protect Kanon and help to save Kagura!
034	And also... I'll make it back safely to Lord Vettel!
035	Your intent is very powerful.
036	You adored Zahar, didn't you?
037	...!
038	We didn't have another choice in that situation. If we wouldn't have banished him to the other side of the Door of Truth, our regiment would have...
039	I don't need your excuses.<br>I have accepted reality.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0040
040	But...
041	...?!
042	I'm really sorry... for taking away such a precious person from you...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0035
043	Are you... crying?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
044	It couldn't be helped because we believed in different things... And I know that as long as there's war, this sorrow will keep on repeating itself!
045	But if I put myself in your shoes... If Lord Vettel were to be taken from me... As much as I'd want to hate the one responsible, I probably wouldn't truly be able to!
046	I cannot step aside now due to the circumstances... But I can understand your sorrow agonizingly well!
047	Kanon...
048	And Kanon is just the same! Ever since she became the Lord Commander...
049	she's been genuinely praying for the end of this spiral of sorrow!
050	And that's also why she's so desperate now to restore Excalibur!
051	...!
052	I also want to aim for Kanon's ideals!
053	So I'm sorry, but I cannot let you pass! ...Crystal Break!!!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
054	What?!<br>My full-out attack didn't even...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
055	I suppose...
056	that even if this Vettel were to fall into darkness, you would be able to stop him, if you had the willpower for it.
057	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
058	Thank you, Chloe.<br>I'm glad I got to talk to you.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0018
059	!!!
