001	Urgh...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
002	Well, well, well. Not bad. I suppose I should have expected that a Phantom could take so much damage.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
003	Wh...at...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
004	You were transmuted into a Phantom with the last of Sephiron's power.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
005	A Phantom?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0021
006	No human body could withstand the power of the Truth.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
007	Honestly, such a frail vessel only limits how one can use the power from that place.
008	Rejoice, Kamui! The Alchemy Source itself had a hand in making you the way you are now!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
009	Why, Lord Waginau?! Do you truly crave power so badly? Are you not the one who taught me that excessive power is what destroys people?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0018
010	Such words mean nothing to me. They are just wasted air in the face of the Truth.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
011	Rise and face me, Kamui! Or are you just as weak as the others?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
012	Have you lost your fighting spirit? Where is your conviction?
013	Speak, Kamui! Answer me! Have you resigned yourself to death in this absurd world?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
014	Are you willing to allow all the blood spilled the day that Sephiron withered and died to have been spilled in vain?!
015	...!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
016	Lord Waginau...I don't think I can understand what you're trying to say.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
017	However, I know that you are wrong! At least I know that much!
018	Ouroboros once told me that I would be able to call forth the forgotten legacies of warriors.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
019	So many have fallen; so many hearts and hopes were lost... Yet I cannot believe that it was all for nothing!
020	It was not for nothing that they risked their very lives following the paths they chose!
021	I beseech the supreme...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0032
022	O Sephiron, I call forth! Grant me the strength to resist, the will to protect!
023	No, that light...!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0019
024	Finally! Kept me waiting, didn't you, Kamui?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
025	T-Teona?! Is it really you?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
026	Yeah, it's me! I've been on the edge of my seat this whole time, waiting for this moment to come!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
027	Finally...? Hmph. Foolish disciple.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
028	Show me your strength! Prove yourself to me!
