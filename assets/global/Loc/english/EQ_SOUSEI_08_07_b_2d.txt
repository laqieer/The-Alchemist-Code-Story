001	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_lucifer.lucifer_battle_0020
002	Ghh! Is this still not enough?!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
003	No, it's plenty. Lucifer's shielding is weakened, and the protection around his core is gone. We're almost there.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
004	Anti-Curse, reload!
005	Now's the time, Zavijava. It's time for you to show just what you can do!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0032
006	...What?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
007	Excellent aim...my son...	VO_chahele.chahele_battle_0022
008	But, why...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
009	This body of mine is the true Vessel of Lucifer's core.
010	You were far too knowledgeable of Emmel's condition.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0006
011	I started wondering if maybe both of you were in the same boat.
012	You mean...you've been sealing all of the corruption in this land away within your own body?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
013	I have. Fortunately, I have no heart for the sins to affect. I was the perfect Vessel.
014	Father...	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0018
015	If... If you have any parting words, we will listen.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
016	Live. That's all I wish of you.
017	Yes, Father.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0037
018	...
019	I'll take the core now.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
020	Do be careful. It is the lynchpin that binds the Shell of the World with the seven Belt Regions.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
021	No matter what path you choose, if the core is lost, then the path shall be as well.
022	I understand.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
023	You okay? Still conscious?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
024	I'm...fine.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
025	I'll be...all...right...
026	...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
027	Hey, what are you doing?!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
028	I've temporarily frozen her in time. This way, she won't have to suffer the corruption spreading within her...or anything else.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
029	It was the plan all along. I intend to let her slumber peacefully until Nimul arrives.
030	I see.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0016
031	Now the question is, what do you plan to do, Serpent Priest? What will become of the Infinite Serpent now?	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0001
032	Your beloved master is no more.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
033	...
034	Priest?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
035	In the end, Lord Shahel entrusted the sacred core to the girl.
036	Whosoever bears the Cursed Beast Lucifer shall be regarded as the rightful heir to this region.
037	The Serpent shall follow her command.
038	You all certainly do change your tune at the drop of a hat. Though...I guess maybe it's kind of the opposite. No matter how fast the ship you're on is sinking, you're all too happy to go down with it.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
039	We are devoted solely to maintaining the order of this world, and we walk whatever path will lead us to that end...no matter the travails we may encounter along the way.
040	...
041	I never imagined things would wind up like this...	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
042	Bit late for regrets now. And kind of rude to Emmel, too.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
043	...
044	She's a strong one, I'll tell you that much.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0008
045	It's easy to imagine all the saints described in old folk tales and religious writings as people just like her—all stubborn and full of self-determination.
046	Meanwhile, I'm always just getting caught up in their messes. Short end of the stick, same as ever...	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0011
047	It would seem that I've been defeated, though this form is still operational. No abnormalities detected.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
048	It is problematic, however. It's hard to believe the right to control Lucifer would be transferred at such a crucial juncture.
049	Will the Ceremony of Creation fail again, then?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
050	It should not, given that you have already found the chosen one.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0039
051	Nimul...meaning "Child of God" in the old dragon tongue. Heh. Rather harsh of Nidhogg.
052	I can't imagine he'll listen to what I have to say, though.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0014
053	I doubt it as well. But that should be fine.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
054	To him, we are but a wall he must scale—an evil to be conquered.
055	After all, the birth of a new era can only be ushered in through the destruction of the old.
056	Of course. There can be no other way.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
057	That is what we settled upon on that day, as well. We will simply have to uphold our roles as troublemakers to the bitter end.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0011
058	Isn't that right, Zafeiris?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
