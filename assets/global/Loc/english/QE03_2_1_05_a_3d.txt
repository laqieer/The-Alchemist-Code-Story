001	Huff...huff... I can't win...not when it comes to Alchemy!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0042
002	This power has saved numerous lives. It's saved the life of an infant, of Rebecca, and countless insects as well.
003	Professor, I cannot bring myself to think of this power as a bad thing.
004	My injuries...they're healing!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0029
005	This is my power. It allows me to help many people.
006	And I will continue to do so! That will also lead to the suspicion being lifted from me.
007	So...please tell me, Professor!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
008	...?
009	I want to use this power to help everyone in this country!
010	In order to do so, I want to do something about the Sacred Stone Asmodeus' curse that is hurting everybody!
011	Wh-what did you say?!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0029
012	This power is special. I'm sure I can do something with it! Something that wasn't possible with magic!
013	Please, tell me how to remove the curse of Asmodeus!
014	I have no idea how to do it either!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0039
015	N-no...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
016	Stop thinking silly things, and run away right now...while I remain immobile.
017	Professor!
018	It's unfortunate, but let's take advantage of her words and run somewhere!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
019	No... I'm going to try speaking with the Headmistress!
020	What?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
021	You gotta be kidding me!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
022	There she is! Restrain, Lisbeth!
