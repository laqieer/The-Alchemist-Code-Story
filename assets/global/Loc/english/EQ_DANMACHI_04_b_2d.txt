001	I missed you so, so, so much!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0003
002	I'm glad you're not hurt, Goddess.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
003	I may not be hurt, but I'm not okay, either—I still reek of those beasts!
004	I think there's some water nearby you could use to clean up a little.
005	Hold up. Is this girl really the goddess you were talking about?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
006	How rude! Can't you see my divinity just by looking at me?!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0025
007	Well, this isn't Orario, so maybe you can't...
008	Huh? Goddess, do you know this world?	VO_bell.bell_sys_0001
009	Know it? As if! All I did was chase after you.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0005
010	It was a different sensation than when you go down into the dungeon. Your presence felt really distant, so I wanted to make sure you were okay.
011	I went looking for you all stealthy-like, and found this weird portal right by the dungeon entrance. So I did what any sensible goddess would do: I jumped in!
012	That sounds really dangerous, and like a generally bad idea.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0030
013	No more dangerous than it was for you, though, right? And no more dangerous than it always is, whenever you're involved! But I couldn't very well say no.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0001
014	Anyway, after that, there was this girl talking about the Door of Truth or something. She seemed like she was just trying to use you, and it kind of ticked me off!
015	She was pretty full of herself, too, so I thought I'd take her down a peg with a few choice words.
016	But then before I knew it, I was in the middle of this forest!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0030
017	...
018	Oh, hello! If it isn't Ais Wallen-something-or-other.	VO_hestia.hestia_battle_0025
019	So you're the other person sent to help Bell, huh?
020	You haven't done anything...improper with my Bell, have you? Have you?!	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0016
021	Excuse me?
022	Don't play dumb with me, missy!
023	Ah, hahaha...	VO_bell.bell_sys_0011
024	Rrg! You other ladies had best back off, you hear?!
025	H-hey! Don't look at me. Trust me, I'm not interested.	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
026	Mm-hmm. That's what they all say. I'll be keeping a close eye on you, though, just to be sure!
027	What's your problem?! Stop staring at me!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
