001	There we are. All better.
002	...
003	Mommy! Why are you helping that man?!
004	He tried to hit the critters and got bit! He got what he deserved! They're like family to us!
005	I know, sweetie. He might have deserved it, but our darlings have a very strong bite.
006	It hurts very badly, and if the wound was left untreated, he would have died. I wasn't going to let that happen, sweetie.
007	Not even to a bad man who tried to hurt our family?
008	No, sweetie.
009	Listen to me, Lotiyah. You must treat those around you equally and with kindness.
010	So long as you do, then surely...
011	I wanted to heed my mother's words and be kind.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
012	However...
013	Hold it right there! Why did you feel the need to hurt these poor creatures so?!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0013
014	Why shouldn't I? It's not like they're human or nothin'. Besides, I had to get 'em before they got me.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
015	And you don't complain about injuries sustained in the Colosseum. It's one of the rules.
016	I-I know that, but still...you went too far!	VO_lotia.lotia_battle_0019
017	These creatures are trained to not cause grievous injuries.
018	They do their best to put on a good show for the spectators! That's why—
019	Quit yer yappin'! I hate those damn creatures.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
020	The stars of the Colosseum are the gladiators! Get it? I'm a star! I don't have time to stand around listenin' to yer bellyachin'!
021	...
022	How dare he! How dare he hurt my poor darlings like that!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0017
023	It cannot be helped. The heroes of the Colosseum have always been the humans.
024	I realize that, but still...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
025	What about Zeno? He had already left by the time I came here, though.
026	Oh, he was wonderful. A truly remarkable person, that Zeno.
027	He was a perfect gentleman to men and women, gladiators, trainers, and beasts alike.
028	Not only that, but his swordsmanship was incredible to behold. It never failed to captivate the audience. He truly left us too soon...
029	He sounds so wonderful—nothing at all like the rabble we have around here now!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0044
030	Gladiators these days don't show any respect to the beasts and turn their noses up at us trainers. They think everybody else is beneath them!	VO_lotia.lotia_battle_0019
031	Now, now...
032	Look! He didn't even apologize for hurting my family like this!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
033	Your...family? Lotiyah, you mustn't get too attached to these creatures. You're the one who will end up hurt if you do.
034	...
035	Now, why don't we go have some cake to cheer ourselves up, hm? I heard a new shop opened up near here recently.
036	Oooh! Cake!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
037	I mean... Um, never mind. I don't really like cakes or sweets.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0018
038	Mmm...cake... I wish I'd asked where that new shop is...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
039	I really hope no one's figured out that I'm a sweet tooth. I hide it as best I can...
040	I don't want people thinking I'm soft. It's a male-dominated world out there, and people already underestimate me just because I'm a woman.
041	Zeno, though... He treated everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of gender. He must've been a really great person...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
042	He was even polite to the trainers... It's hard to believe someone so wonderful could really exist.
043	I wish I could've met him.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0007
044	Oh! Come to think of it, didn't Zeno's little sister become a gladiator recently? I wonder...
045	Oi! Lotiyah!
046	Look what your mangy beasts have done to me! I'm gonna have to opt out of the next match!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0013
047	You again? Stop blaming my darlings for your inadequacies!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0030
048	The referee upheld the match, didn't they? Grraw didn't do anything wrong!
049	Shut up! That mongrel made a fool of me and I'm really ticked off!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
050	Give 'er here! I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget!
051	No! Never!	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0040
052	You're the one who needs a lesson, you selfish pig!	VO_lotia.lotia_battle_0019
053	You...! How dare you insult me! You're nothing but a lowly trainer!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
054	Enough!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0001
055	T-Teona?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
056	I was present at the match from beginning to end. Not once did the creature use excessive force in its attacks.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
057	The proud beasts of the Colosseum fight fairly and with honor, in accordance with the rules.
058	Your anger is misplaced; Lotiyah is not deserving of it.
059	Wha—?! Well, if you ask me...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0026
060	A troubled little girl who became a gladiator by riding her brother's glorified coattails should keep her ignorant opinions to herself!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
