001	Dad! The rebels surrendered information! Their leader is a man called Sabareta, of the Lizard Brigade!
002	Under his orders, rebels from across the land are said to be heading for Gilrack Hill!
003	Sabareta? I'm not familiar with that name. What would a rebel army of that scale mean?	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
004	Zeke ponders on this deeply, awakening a nervous energy within those around him. Finally, he speaks.
005	...And you say this rebel army will gather at Gilrack Hill?
006	That's within Old Wratharis territory. It seems they're telling the truth. We'll stop the rebels headed for Gilrack Hill!
007	There, we should also be able to gather information on this man Sabareta!
008	Captain! The Wratharis rebel army marches on both sides of us! They have separated themselves into two groups!
009	I'll go!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
010	Wait, Dias! I'll go too! Let's split up and fight!
