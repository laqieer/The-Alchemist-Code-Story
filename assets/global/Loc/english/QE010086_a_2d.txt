001	In front of deactivated Demon, Sabareta grips a Philosopher's Stone and smiles...
002	The time has come!
003	We will use these crystals of wrath, created with the blood of our people...and this time we will resurrect the Demon completely!
004	Hmph. Boy...is that you again?
005	I'm a little too old to be referred to as a boy.
006	Zeke!
007	Resurrecting the Demon... That's a heavy sin, Sabareta.
008	Sin? That's rich coming from the man who slaughtered the royal family of Wratharis!
009	Whatever you might say of me...I'm here to put a stop to your ambitions. Come, Sabareta!
010	Are you going to play the role of a pure knight now? There is no bending the fact that you are a great sinner!
011	Taste the Wrath of our royal family that is inscribed within our blood!
012	Ack... What strength! Men, do not let your guard down!	VO_zeke.zeke_battle_0023
013	The time has come! To begin our world of chaos, we'll offer your blood as a sacrifice!	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0008
