001	I thought of the sky as I walked in my dreams.
002	I looked up at an unseen sky, always wanting freedom.
003	My days were filled with pain, cruelty, and shame.
004	When I got knocked down and all I would see is a disgusting world with disgusting people.
005	I would close my eyes and cover my ears to drown out those sights and sounds.
006	They say that curiosity killed the cat.
007	If I were allowed to choose, I would have preferred curiosity to be what killed me.
008	Plundering within the boundaries of the rules. Nothin' could be more fun.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0008
009	Are you...going to kill me?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
010	Eat.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
011	Food? For me?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
012	There was a huge stockpile. Your owners were making a killing back there, huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
013	Am I allowed to have so much? And all this water...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0009
014	I've had my fill.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
015	Why did you save me?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
016	I didn't. I looted you.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0014
017	Looted...?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
018	Where are we?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
019	I'm not stupid. I heard you the first time. We're in...Lost Blue.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0010
020	You still don't know anything, though.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
021	They made me study. Enough so I wouldn't be a burden if I was ever sold.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0030
022	But they rarely let me go outside.
023	This place is a cesspool full of punks like them.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
024	The more you know of this place, the less you would care to be "outside."
025	Cesspool...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
026	Where they keep the poop.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
027	Well, yeah. I knew that.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0025
028	Poop.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
029	I know! I do it, too!	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0019
030	You do?
031	Y-you don't?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
032	The country of apathy, Slothstein. Under its streets is a giant hollow that supposedly doesn't exist.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
033	Criminals on the run, orphans of war, and anybody else without a home...
034	Who knows when it started, but this place became a commune for those whose places in this world were taken from them.
035	At some point, it was coined as Lost Blue, the sunken city light doesn't reach.
036	The last resort for those who have nowhere else to go.
037	Therian Care Center, eh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
038	I-I want to leave this place.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
039	Sorry, but a job's a job.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
040	A...mercenary...job?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
041	Scoundrels and villains aren't the only ones who populate Lost Blue, you know?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
042	Some people were chased out of their countries for having frighteningly exceptional talent. Scholars, mages, political prisoners... Even former leaders of nations.
043	The doctor I always go to was something like that.
044	You get sick, too?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
045	No, just something for muscle pain.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0014
046	For muscle pain?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0014
047	Let me tell you something about muscles. You gotta repair them after working out, with proper rest and nutrition.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
048	For starters, there are slow muscles and fast muscles. These need two different training methods to develop.
049	Either way, they both need ample rest afterwards, and nutrition to repair any damages.
050	It's just that nutrition is scarce down here, so I have to use supplements to give them what they need. Another thing about muscles—
051	That's...enough about muscles.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
052	Muscles will never betray you.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
053	Uh-huh.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0044
054	Unfortunately, muscles alone won't get you steady pay to survive down here.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
055	Finally, you're back on topic.
056	Greed Dike takes an interest in people like us.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
057	Some of us in Lost Blue take secret jobs from Greed Dike in exchange for food and money.
058	Secret...jobs?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
059	Dirty jobs. Mercenaries like me are valued, and so are "researchers" like your former owners.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
060	Wha—?!
061	This place is perfect if you wanted to conduct experiments that require inhumane methods society would never tolerate.
062	A nice little hide-out.
063	That "Therian Care Center" was opened with Greed Dike's aid.
064	I'm guessing they wanted to find a way to exploit therians for their military.
065	That's...not how it was.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0020
066	Huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
067	They called them experiments...but we were basically slaves, and when they got bored or needed money, they would sell us off.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
068	All of my friends were slaves and received harsh treatment.
069	Even I was... Almost every day, they—	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
070	That's probably why I got this job. That place just became nothing more than a liability for a country to be invested in.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0017
071	I...
072	Not to mention, the controlled transformation of therians into a beast form, which that place was studying...	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
073	Greed Dike probably figured it was too much for them to handle. They don't want a military asset going berserk on them one day.
074	That's just how things are. Those with too much are cast away, just like those who are wanting.
075	They'll eventually find some new thing to experiment on until they dump that out into Lost Blue.
076	Am I going to be thrown away, too?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
077	What do you think bastards like me do when we're not happy with a low-paying job?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0003
078	Uh... Negotiate?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
079	That...actually didn't cross my mind.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0011
080	We embezzle what we can. We take some of the loot for ourselves.
081	Is that what I am?	VO_zwei.zwei_chara_1009
082	You're one of the last successful specimens of beast transformation. Even a major country would be threatened by loot like you.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
083	I went around and checked, but there don't seem to be any other therians in the facility.
084	I just have to report that all of the specimens have been destroyed, while keeping you to myself.
085	I get to choose whether you live or die.
086	You're a monster.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0021
087	Say what you will. Anything goes, when it comes to survival.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
088	Heh. We barely set foot outside of the facility, and look at what we find. Darn buzzards.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
089	Hey, Dead Nine... What you got there? You don't mind sharin' do ya?
090	I got a huge tab to pay off. Come on. Spare me some money.
091	Go make your own money.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
092	What's with the little girlie?
093	Nn?!
094	Hehehehehehe... A girl? She's just my type!
095	Hey, little missy. Come with me! Let's go somewhere nice!
096	She's not interested in going with someone as ugly as you! She's obviously interested in me!
097	That's what you said about the last girl, and look what happened! Haven't seen her since! Hahahahahaha!
098	Bahahahaha! All of you can stand back. Lady, I promise to be nice!
099	N-no...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
100	Oi...
101	You no longer have a collar on.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
102	I...!
103	If you can handle this world—
104	Why are we arguing? Just kill Dead Nine and take her, eh?
105	That's not a bad idea!
106	Power is everything.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
107	Power is...everything.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
108	You won't lose.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
109	Dead Nine.
110	If you can handle this world... If you are willing to survive here...	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
111	Then your life is in my hands, but it's your choice to walk out of here.
112	A life of fighting ain't that bad.
113	...!
114	Ngh! Wh-what is going on?!
115	I could do with another round... Let's go play with them!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0009
116	I don't need help. Stay out of my way.	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0018
117	Oh, really? Heh...	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0045
118	I'm not some pet. Not anymore.	VO_zwei_transfur.zwei_transfur_battle_0004
