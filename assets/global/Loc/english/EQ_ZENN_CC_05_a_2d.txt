001	Papa! You're back!
002	Huh? You're not papa... Whoops! Sorry! I thought you were my papa. You kinda walk the same.
003	...
004	So, who're you? I've never seen you before!
005	I always end up clinging to people who want nothing to do with me.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0001
006	I'm Emperor Orion's younger brother.
007	I've never been able to say that freely... But, oh, how I've wanted to.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0005
008	See, I'm the youngest of the dozen or so bastards born to the old king's concubines. I was conceived at the very end of his rule.
009	Orion was born to a different concubine, so we're half-brothers, technically. He was conceived at the beginning of the old king's rule, which is why there's such a significant age difference between us.
010	My father forgot I even existed.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0010
011	He didn't bother to remember his many concubines' names, much less all the children of his they'd brought into this world.
012	Not even Orion remembers me. He doesn't realize I'm his brother. I suppose I'm too far down the line of succession to be memorable.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
013	After all, it's not like lions remember the faces of the zebra on which they feast.
014	My physical wants, at least, were never neglected. I was well fed and clothed, whether I wanted to be or not.
015	But I was always starved of familial affection.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0029
016	I do not weep to hear the shriek of cattle.
017	The old king didn't bat an eye when my mother was killed by the members of an opposing faction.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0018
018	That's when I realized that the weak are doomed to be forgotten. It only makes sense. And, back then, I was nothing but a hunk of zebra, slowly passing through the lion's intestines. Why should he think of me?
019	So I spent my days trying to come up with a way to become someone worthy of recognition.
020	Until, one day, I had a great idea.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0008
021	...
022	...
023	Are you asleep?
024	Wha...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
025	A-Aya? Aya?! Aya! Wake up, Aya, please!
026	Ngh...	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
027	Y-you're bleeding...but it's going to be all right. Mama's going to heal you up, right as rain.
028	N-no...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
029	Are you... Can you bring people back from the dead?
030	See? All better! Aya? Aya...? What's wrong, my darling? Why aren't you smiling?
031	There is no remedy for death, I'm afraid.
032	Come on! Wake up!
033	Hrk! Ack... Hrgh!
034	I am able to heal others by projecting their wounds onto my spirit.
035	N-no... I can keep going! I'm fine, my darling daughter, so please... Please wake up! Hrk... Ngh... Ack! Hrgh!
036	Y-you're being brave, aren't you? Don't hold back, Aya. Tell me where it hurts, and I'll make it better. Please... Please say something. Anything. Please...
037	I can't do that with death.
038	Haa...haa...haa! Wh-why isn't it working?! Why aren't you getting better?! Why won't you heal?! P-please don't go! Don't die! Don't leave me, my Aya!
039	———
040	Aaaaaaaahhh! Th-this can't be real... This can't be happening... This is just a nightmare, isn't it? Isn't it, Zehn?
041	I... Ungh...	VO_zen.zen_battle_0022
042	O-our lives together had...h-have only just begun!
043	Wake up, Aya! Please wake up! Open your eyes!
044	Oh, Aya... I'm so sorry. This is all our fault.
045	Th-this must be our punishment for all the d-death we've caused. Wh-why did we think we could live on without a c-care in the world?
046	B-b-but Aya doesn't deserve to pay for our mistakes! P-please...don't take her away from us! Bring her back! I beg you! I-I'll do anything!
047	Aya! Oh, Aya... Not my Aya! Ayaaaaaaa!
048	Ungh...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0043
049	...
050	A-Aya... Ngh...
051	Excuse me, sir... Commander Na Zhu?
052	What is it.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0004
053	We've disposed of the majority of the villagers, but our target yet eludes us.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
054	Kill the shrine maiden, then. Her ilk poses the greatest threat to our invasion.
055	Yes, sir!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0005
056	Besides...
057	Do that, and I'm sure he'll come running.
058	Sir?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0006
059	Commander Na Zhu! Someone is approaching from the village!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0042
060	What?!
061	He's here.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0010
062	Come, rise and fight, brethren!
063	H-he's alone?! Doesn't he realize he's outnumbered a dozen to one?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0025
064	Like a sword without a blade to bear, ever do I arrive a day after the fair.
065	M-my word! He's so fast! A-and that look in his eyes... He's like a demon out for blood!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0027
066	Where there is a will, they say, yet I have all but lost my way.
067	Wh-who are you?! Identify yourself!
068	Cry for peace in the depths of hell, yet only demons will heed thine yell.
069	I-it's our target! Prepare yourselves! He's almost upon us. Engage! Engage!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0026
070	Yet in this world, effort reaps reward. Some would yet restore your lost horde.
071	I-it's him! The former head of Imperial Security! It's...!
072	A life marked by him will not survive the day. One sweep of metal, and their lifeblood will drain away.
073	Aaaaaaarghhh!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0043
074	His name is a whisper on the lips of the dead.
075	Wait—don't tell me he's...?!
076	You dare ask my name?!
077	Yet even in death they invoke his name with dread.
078	You brutes are not worthy of addressing me!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
079	Aaaaaarghhh!
080	Again the curtains rise, it's time for the second act! Down in hell, fire crackles under the sinners' vat!
081	Die!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0043
082	The would-be samurai has come to cut a swathe through all in his path!
083	Well, well.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0030
084	Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
085	Huzzaaaaahhh!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
086	Was it you?! Were you the one who took her from me?!
087	This isn't personal. I'm just here to fulfill my duty.
088	You monsters!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0013
089	You reap what you sow.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0016
090	This is exactly why I left!
091	Oh? You abandoned your country, your emperor, your ideals, your duty...all because you were sick of spilling blood?
092	Because I wanted to distance myself from death! How does murder serve a country? Killing innocents achieves nothing!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
093	But you distanced yourself from me, as well. You left me behind!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
094	Hrgh!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
095	Come on. Let's go home.
