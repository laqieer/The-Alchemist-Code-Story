001	Dragon Slayer!!!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0008
002	Aghhhhhh!!!
003	Hm! So...he wasn't all talk then?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
004	...Hehe...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
005	Huff...huff! Wh-why...? Why do you protect us?	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
006	One thing I'm certain about...is that you're my prey.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0010
007	I don't intend to allow Greed Dike to harm a single hair on your head.
008	Ack...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
009	My flames will burn away that immortal one. That should give you time to finish off the remaining soldiers.
010	I don't take orders from you! Hyaaaahhh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
011	Hear the wailing of my people...and let it destroy you!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0005
012	Zangetsu, wasn't it? You said that I meaninglessly destroyed Wadatsumi in order to fulfill my own greed, didn't you?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
013	Hmph! Are you getting frightened now that you've witnessed my powers? However...none of your excuses will work on me.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0017
014	Heheh. Excuses, huh? You really don't understand anything.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
015	The destruction of Wadatsumi is what the laws of this world wished for.
016	The "laws of this world"?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_sys_0025
017	Well, I doubt it's something you'd understand.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
018	You speak brazenly, but you are and will always be just another random soldier...who couldn't even protect his own comrades.
019	My comrades...?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_chara_1015
020	Kid, behind you!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0020
021	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
022	Say goodbye to this world. Now is your final moment.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
023	Oh no!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
024	...!
025	What...?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
026	Ugh...gfff...aghhhhh!!!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0026
027	Agh! His stomach has been slashed, yet he continues to hold onto his strength	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
028	Wh-why?! Why are you going to such lengths in order protect me?	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
029	It's not for you... It's for the people of Wadatsumi...for letting them down.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0021
030	The people of Wadatsumi...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
031	I-I've decided...that'll I'll do whatever it takes to protect you	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0019
032	If I cannot protect you then it'll just be the same as when I couldn't protect the people of Wadatsumi.
033	I-if...I repeat the same mistake...I won't be able to face the dead lost lives of Wadatsumi.
034	Zangetsu...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
035	Wh-who would've thought the day would come...when I would protect you Paladins?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0024
036	What an ironic way to go out...aghhh...!
037	How long are you going to hang about here? You're not planning to wait until the sun goes down, are you?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
038	I'm well aware of the circumstances.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
039	Ack...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
040	...Go.	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0023
041	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
042	It's better than letting them take you down...or do you prefer to die here?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0021
043	...!
044	Thank you. I will never...forget you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
045	Y-you seem to be misunderstanding something...	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0017
046	I am going to reign...victorious here. Then I'll go and finish you off myself. I'm merely...letting you live a little longer for now.
047	...Let's go, Almira.	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
048	...I will not allow it.
049	Agh...! Hyaaaahhhh!!!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0023
050	What are you doing?! Is it the best you can do to cling on for dear life?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
051	Wh-where do you think you're going...you scum? Did you think you got rid of me?	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0019
052	Of course, I did.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
053	Uggfff...! Go!!!	VO_zangetsu.zangetsu_battle_0027
054	Hmph... Let's go.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
055	But they...!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0027
056	What can such insignificant individuals accomplish? I will not have it said that the march of the Lion Monarch stopped here.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
057	The moment of fate is approaching!
058	Saga region. Near the Water Temple.
059	Captain Othima!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
060	Sorry, I'm late. I made you suffer quite a bit.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
061	Th-that was sudden...ack...well played. Your abilities are on another level to the scum around here.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
062	I never suspected that the man I crossed paths with in Wratharis was the leader of the Templars.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
063	Owww.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
064	But...it's like a dream to be able to fight you here...the hero of Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
065	Yeah...that's pretty important. If I am your senior then shouldn't you be a little more respectful?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
066	I'm not used to respecting others, but...I can give it a try.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0029
067	You're the leader of the Templars, aren't you?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
068	Can I convince you to ask them to back down just so that I can save some face?
069	Do you really think I'd agree to that? This whole respect thing isn't really working.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
070	Right. Well, in a sense I'm relieved.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
071	Relived...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
072	What is this?! A magic defense...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
073	If you'd agreed to back down...I wouldn't have anywhere to direct my anger.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
074	Captain Othima...
075	It seems like you've been going around doing whatever you please.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
076	I heard...you killed Captain Yauras. Is that correct?
077	Agh...Ye-yeah...that captain with the double blades, right?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
078	I was avenging Sieba's death, so I made her suffer a little.
079	...!
080	Ultimately, I'm pretty sure she died meaninglessly trying to protect this redhead. Hehe. I wish I could've shown it to you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
081	Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
082	Agh! Ughhh!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
083	There's a limit to how much I can turn a blind eye to...even when it comes to the actions of my naive junior.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0017
084	I'll have you endure an appropriate amount of pain in order to atone for your sins!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0013
085	Ughh! Aghhh!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
086	Ye-yes...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0024
087	Huff...huff...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
088	...Ack...owwww...	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
089	...!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
090	Seriously...that's an incredible amount of power, but...aren't you overdoing it a little for our first encounter?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
091	Ack! Piercing Light!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
092	Growing up, I was told your story over and over again.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
093	It was the story of this amazing person from Lost Blue who climbed his way to becoming a captain of the Holy Guard.
094	?! Absolute Darkness!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
095	The truth is, in the past, I followed in your shadow.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
096	It could be said that I have you to thank for having mastered this technique.
097	It can't be...a magic defense...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
098	Seriously. I'm getting really worked up! I can exchange blows with someone I've admired for so long!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0023
099	Is he going to use magic?! Captain Othima!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
100	...Ex Atmosphere!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
101	Ack! Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
102	I-is that...my technique?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
103	It is the pioneers who pave the path ahead, but it is those who follow that expand the path even further.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
104	Unfortunately, you're not the one who has expanded on your own technique...we did.
105	Agh...!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
106	Captain Othima!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
107	Ug...ghh! Th...this isn't a one-handed technique!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0042
108	Impossible... Is he using a combined physical and magical attack?!
109	To be honest, I enjoyed this very much...my hero. I should really finish you off, but...as a way of paying my respects, I'll let you live.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
110	?! Aghh!!! Ackk!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
111	!!!
112	If you ever feel like joining our ranks, we'll welcome you with open arms.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
113	Well then. We've got one more to go. Come on, redhead.
114	N-no...! Captain Othima!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
115	Ar-are you okay? Hey!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0021
116	The ultimate warrior who can launch a combined attack of both the physical and magical?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0021
117	Wh-who can win against such an individual?
