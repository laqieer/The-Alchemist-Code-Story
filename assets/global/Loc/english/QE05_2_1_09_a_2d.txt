001	Shadow...Excelsior?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
002	This is the true reason those Paladins were snooping around in Gluttony.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0005
003	After countless sacrifices and diligent experimentation, we finally managed to produce this stone!
004	Was it not odd to you that the Bishop of the Holy Order himself would come all the way out here for a simple scouting mission?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0001
005	W-well...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
006	This is what they were after. I had a connection within the Holy Guard steal a secret document from their treasury.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
007	I took the honor upon myself to continue their blasphemous studies: the replication of the Sacred Stones.
008	Impossible! The Sacred Stones are miraculous relics of unknowable origins! There is no way that anyone living today could replicate them!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0026
009	As you say, the Holy Guard's studies were incomplete.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
010	We were lucky to even get this one successful sample after significant effort spent decoding complicated transmutations, collecting rare resources, and countless sacrifices.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0022
011	However...this stone is empty. It has a capacity for power that can rival even the Sacred Stones, but as it is now, it is merely a vessel.
012	Then I realized. If this stone holds no power of its own, then I could simply take it from somewhere else!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
013	From somewhere else...?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
014	At first my plan was to take Beelzebub's power, but King Narol hid its existence from me until the very end.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0037
015	The end...? You didn't!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
016	He's dead. It was a fair trial by the people, so I'm sure he has no complaints.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
017	No! His Majesty...!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
018	Sadly, the problem with the stone is that it can increase its power by devouring Alchemia, but it must be fed constantly.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0022
019	Luckily for us, we had this perfect solution sitting right under our noses this whole time! Sephiron, the Tree of Life! A tree with power comparable to that of the mythical Tower of Babel!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0007
020	A mysterious manifestation of untold strength that makes even Waginau devote himself to its protection! If I could imbue the stone with its energy...
021	Beelzebub itself would pale in comparison!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
022	It is as if Sephiron herself was created to be nothing more than a vessel for my ascension!
023	This...?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
024	Hm... I know this creature. I have seen it appear on  extermination missions out in the countryside.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0037
025	The Jam, was it? They are capable of complicated maneuvers, but are predictable enough because all of them are rooted in the most basic instincts.
026	Hunger, reproduction, survival...fear of death. I believe it is also said that they have some sort of relation to Beelzebub.
027	In other words, if exposed to the awesome purification power of Sephiron, they will panic and run berserk, like...this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
028	Wha—?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
029	Yearrrgh!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0032
030	Do not allow yourself to be overwhelmed, K-Kamui! If they are just the Jam...then they should be no problem for us!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0012
031	Isidore... I'm sorry. You're right.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
032	Remember what Lord Waginau said! Nngh... We must...destroy that...stone!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
033	Got it! Let us clear out the Jam blocking our path!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
