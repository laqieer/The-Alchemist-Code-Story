001	...
002	All right. Quiet, students! I have an announcement.
003	Heide, your classmate, has officially joined the Holy Order.
004	What?! When did that happen?!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0016
005	He didn't even say goodbye!	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0018
006	I'm...going to miss him.	VO_jogakusei.jogakusei_sys_0021
007	We're all going to miss him, but we ought to be happy for him. It's a real honor to be part of the Holy Order, you know.
008	I hope you all follow in his footsteps and become someone who will contribute to the prosperity of the Holy Order and Babel as a whole.
009	Time for class!
010	Awwwww!
011	...
012	Woody, he wasn't there today either.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
013	Heide lost his parents in the war, just like me.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
014	Woody are you trying to cheer me up? You're so sweet. Hehehe.	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
015	But I'm totally okay.	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
016	Cause I've got you and Mr. Bunny! I don't feel lonely at all!
017	Tehe! What should we play today? House? Or should we read a story? Playing Detective's fun, too!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
018	Everyone's on their way home, so how about we play Detective!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
019	Normally the hallways and classrooms are bustling with sound during the day, but now they're so quiet I could hear a pin drop.
020	What's weirder, though, is that I feel more at home now than I do during the day.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
021	I don't feel as lonely... I bet it's because I have you guys for company!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
022	Did you hear that? Maybe someone's still around. I think it came from here...	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
023	Huh? Was this door always here?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
024	I wonder if I'm allowed to open it... Mmm... Hmm... I'm gonna open it.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
025	I'll be safe since I've got you guys with me, right? All right, I'm going to open it.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0032
026	Gaaah! Dang it! Why can't I beat you, Corvus?!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0014
027	Huff... He really is freakishly strong.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0030
028	What do you expect? He was the vice-captain of the Knights of Wratharis, but who would've thought that even the three of us couldn't take him down?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
029	Ngh... Hmm. I'd better stick to caramel jaegar. It's the only booze for me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0008
030	He's drinking, too! All right! I'm giving it another shot!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
031	Good luck! I'm going to take a breather.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0005
032	...
033	Hm? What's wrong, Spica?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
034	It's been so long since I've seen Lord Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
035	Long...? I know you didn't see him yesterday, and he was in the war council the day before, but didn't you say hello this morning?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0016
036	It's different... When he was in the Knights of Wratharis, I was always by his side.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
037	You didn't complain at all when we were living in the forest, though.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
038	That was different, too. Now we're here in the same place...but we never get to meet.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
039	I desperately want to see him...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
040	Your love for him is so awe-inspiring!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0046
041	Lord Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
042	What about me, Spica?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
043	L-Lord Zahar!!!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
044	How fares your training with Corvus?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
045	I-it's going well! I'll become stronger so I can be of more assistance to you, Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
046	I have no doubt that you will. Continue striving to do your utmost. That's right... Letitia, give them one each.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
047	Certainly. One for Spica...and one for Silma.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
048	Is this...?
049	What is this?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0005
050	It's Shadow Messiah's insignia. Ila, go get yours from Corvus.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
051	L-Lord Zahar! I will do my utmost to live up to this insignia!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0046
052	Good.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
053	...
054	Is something wrong? Heheh.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0022
055	Oh... N-no...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1002
056	Off you go, then.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
057	...
058	I never know what Letitia is thinking.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
059	What is her relationship with Lord Zahar?
060	Silma...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0012
061	Oh! Sorry, Spica!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
062	I'm going back to train with Corvus. I have to get stronger, no matter what!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0010
063	Spica, w-wait up! I'm coming, too!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0026
064	Tsk, tsk...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
065	What is it?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0006
066	Nothing new. Spica really doesn't like me.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0010
067	...
068	Don't you go telling her off, now. It's good for her. She needs this fire in her.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
069	Her fire may seem to burn dim and weak like fading embers...but it's stronger than you might think.
070	I must say, I never expected you to actually make an insignia of your own.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
071	The article in itself is meaningless, but given form, it can become a medium to convey one's will.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
072	Just like the wooden necklace I gave you?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
073	Exactly. Spica is weak and fragile. She...will break once she reaches her capacity.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
074	Yet before that happens...you mean to let her go.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0016
075	It's almost like giving away a porcelain vase you couldn't bear to break. How sweet.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
076	I would rather have her become a vessel to inherit my ambitions and my will.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
077	Let's hope that never becomes necessary.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
078	The same applies to Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
079	We are laying the foundations for them, then.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
080	Indeed. They are the ideal group to whom we can leave our new world order.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
081	As you will it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
082	Report for Lord Zahar! We have discovered the hiding place of the researcher.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
083	Continue.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
084	He is staying at the Wratharis Institute of Sorcery.
085	Heh heh... Well done. Letitia, summon everyone.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
086	As you command.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
087	How far does this stairway go?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0018
088	Woody, it's going to be okay...probably.	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
089	I see a light...	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
090	If I could have some more time! I'm so close! I guarantee you'll be satisfied with the finished product—	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0020
091	You make the same excuse time and time again! How long do you expect me to wait?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
092	(I can hear people talking.)	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
093	I swear, I just need more time! If you'd just look at the results of my resear—	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
094	We've been through this before. You stall by showing me your worthless results.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
095	I beg to differ...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
096	(That's the alchemy professor...but who's he with?)	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
097	(Research? Results? What could they be talking about?)	VO_mea.mea_sys_0031
098	Truthfully speaking, I need more test subjects.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0029
099	You have enough for this experiment, don't you? Hmm... More test subjects, huh? We are running out of students.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
100	I will not forgive any further delays.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
101	Y-yes! Our experiment on alchemical resistance was a success! Please, have a look at the results!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
102	Uh... Urgk...
103	Th-that's Heide!	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
104	Oh no!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
105	Who's there?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
106	Um... It's me, Professor.	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
107	Oh, well if it isn't...Mia...from the Phantom Arts class. What are you doing in a place like this?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
108	I-I...didn't see...anything.	VO_mea.mea_sys_0027
109	She's seen us. What are you going to do about her?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
110	Rest assured. I'm well aware of the limits of her alchemy.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
111	In fact, I was always planning to use her for one of my experiments.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
112	Ex...?!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
113	You really have no morals. To use a girl as young as her for one of your experiments...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
114	What are you insinuating? This is for science. My research will be invaluable to breaking new ground in the field of alchemy!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0011
115	N-no!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0025
116	Mia, you've no need to be afraid... Your sacrifice will be beneficial to the world.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
117	(Someone help! Woody!)	VO_mea.mea_battle_0020
118	You should feel privileged!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
119	So you say a survivor of the Wratharis Research Laboratory resides here?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
120	Yes! He's been receiving compensation from the Holy Order and built a laboratory underground.
121	Tch. He, too, must be as malignant as the accursed Holy Order if he requires their support.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
122	According to our intel, this entire establishment is in the pocket of the Holy Order.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0005
123	Could it be the Corpse again?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
124	I don't know all the details, but I bet this research is pretty important to them.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0044
125	Getting ahold of their research would work in favor of our goals, and once the public finds out, trust in the Holy Order will certainly plummet.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
126	The researcher in question appears to have been using war orphans at this institute as test subjects to continue his work.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
127	War orphans?!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
128	What kind of research are we talking about?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_1011
129	While he was in Wratharis, he wanted to conduct human experiments... If he's still continuing his past research, then—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
130	He's using the alchemy that he extracts from human flesh to refine his Philosopher's Stones. He charges the stones with alchemy to amplify their power.
131	The test subjects...don't survive the process.
132	Dang them all to hell! What do they think we humans are?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
133	They lie, they deceive, and they distort everything for their own personal gain. The Holy Order is the blight that rots this world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
134	Lord Zahar, shall we interrupt them?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
135	We shall.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0010
136	No! Noooo!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0028
137	Quiet, brat!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
138	What the—?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
139	We're being attacked! We can't let what we're doing here get out!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
140	Take the girl and your research with you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
141	B-by myself?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
142	Isn't that obvious?! We'll handle the rest!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
143	Come for me once you're done!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
144	Let go! Someone help!!!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0022
145	Shut up, brat! You're coming with me! I'll make you into one of my lab rats!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
146	Eeek!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0027
147	Yaaaargh!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0009
148	Aaaaaaaaargh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
149	Which way to your underground lab?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
150	You won't get any further! Aaaahh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0005
151	Haargh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0002
152	Take this!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0007
153	Gaaah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
154	Lord Zahar, there's a hidden doorway here.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
155	Well-spotted.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
156	...
157	The place has been stripped clean. They've taken all of their research with them.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
158	What in the world?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
159	Ngh... Ugh... Aaah...
160	What did they do to him?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0018
161	How pitiful...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
162	Huff...
163	Lord...Zahar?	VO_spica.spica_sys_1021
164	Forgive me, boy. Your flesh and blood will aid us on our path.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0035
165	We've found a secret passage.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
166	After him! We must acquire his research.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
167	...
168	Spica? Let's go!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
169	R-right...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
170	Huff... Huff... Huff...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
171	Hic... Hic...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0019
172	Hurry up! They're going to catch up to us!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
173	I hear whispers from the shadows within me... Telling me to eradicate those wallowing in evil ambitions.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
174	What...?
175	Long time no see. Do you remember me?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0001
176	Y-you were the vice captain of the Knights of Wratharis.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
177	Well, well... I'm pleased you remember me. Unfortunately, I can't say I remember your name.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0012
178	Wh-what are you doing here?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
179	My lord desires your research. Won't you give me what you've got wrapped in your arms?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
180	No! It's mine!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
181	Research gained from the lives of children...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
182	Ga...haha... Any good research requires sacrifice!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
183	You're right...but your approach is shortsighted.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
184	Worry not, we'll make better use of your research than you ever did. The world shall see the fruits of your labor in time.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
185	I'm not giving you a scrap of my research! Have you forgotten? I'm an alchemist as well!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
186	You!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
187	Eeek!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0027
188	Give me your alchemy! I'm going to kill him!
189	Noooo!	VO_mea.mea_battle_0025
190	Let go of her, you slimeball!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0001
191	Uuuurrrrrgh!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0028
192	Huff... Huff...	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
193	Ila, you did well fending him off.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0012
194	Save your praises! I'm telling you, waiting for an opening isn't my style!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
195	Bah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
196	Uh...	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
197	Girl, you don't need to fear us. We have no intention of hurting you. Get out of—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
198	I think not.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
199	What...?
200	The Corpse...
201	Corvus, we're surrounded!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
202	You won't be getting away with our research, and the girl won't be leaving here alive. Only death awaits those who have witnessed our dark side.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
203	As my lord would say... I'd expect nothing less from the accursed Holy Order.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
204	Foolish words from a has-been assassin.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
205	...
206	Corvus, we've been sent here to eliminate you. This is where you die!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
207	Corvus! There're too many of them!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
208	Tch... Evil Eye, unleash your gaze!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
209	Raaaaaarrrrrrgggh!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0032
210	What...?
211	W-whoa!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0046
212	Ngh! Who knew you were this powerful!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
213	I can't have you looking down on me. I didn't stand side by side with him all those years just for show.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
214	How rude of me... I apologize for underestimating you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
215	However, that doesn't change the fact that you're surrounded and outnumbered... We can't have you underestimating us, either.
216	Corvus, what do we do?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
217	Ila, trust the darkness.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
218	Huh? What are you saying at a time like this?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
219	Our lord is the King of Darkness, savior of the shadows, and a god among us.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
220	Diiiie!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0032
221	Corvus!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0019
222	...
223	I forbid you from killing one of my men.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
224	He...!
225	What...?!
226	...!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
227	Lord Zahar!
228	We have been awaiting your presence, my lord.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0011
229	As to be expected.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
230	Ila, are you all right?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
231	I'm just peachy!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
232	What about you...squirt?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
233	I-I'm okay.	VO_mea.mea_battle_1018
234	Poor thing. You've been through a lot, but everything will be fine now.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
235	Wh-who are you all?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0002
236	We are those who have answered the summons. We are the King of Darkness' Shadow Army.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
237	Shadow...Army?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
238	Zahar! You are nothing but a ghost from Wratharis' past! How long do you intend to be a thorn in our side?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0017
239	Pfft, a ghost of Wratharis? Foolish mortals! I am the King of Darkness!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
240	Zahar, the Shadow Messiah!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
241	Today, we will finally rid ourselves of you!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0007
242	I'm afraid that won't be happening on this occasion.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
243	We're out of here!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
