001	We're close.
002	Their base should be just a bit further ahead.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0002
003	All right, we're almost there! Let's do this!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_chara_1018
004	Right!
005	Already buddies with everyone...
006	All this almost feels like back when we were trainees, huh?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
007	I was always terrible at finding hidden enemies and tracking training... You always saved my skin!
008	I don't remember it like that...
009	It's true! You were always so reliable, I would've been no good without you!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
010	We were always together, weren't we? The fact we were both therians made it super easy to get along.
011	Yes... I was glad to have you with me then.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0007
012	It was unusual for therians to want to be a knight, though it's becoming more common now.
013	Why did you two join up, anyways?
014	Huh? W-well, I wanted to...learn how best to use my strength.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
015	I thought that joining the knights would be the best way to do that. What about you, D'Artagnan?
016	That's easy! Because I love Envylia!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
017	Same as always.
018	Eheheh. Envylia recognizes me for who I am!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0008
019	I was born and raised here, but my mom and dad were immigrants.
020	Everyone around me except for my family were humans. It was a little scary at first.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0022
021	I never thought you'd ever been afraid of humans...
022	Yeah. There were times when people would be mean just 'cause I was a therian, but the other residents were always kind.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
023	They didn't view me as a therian, but as a neighbor. Even as a friend.
024	That made me so happy!	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0007
025	...
026	When I was kidnapped, the knights worked so hard to save me. One of them told me something.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
027	They said that the knights of Envylia protect all citizens of Envylia, no matter if they're human or therian.
028	I remember thinking then about how much I loved Envylia and how much I wanted to be a knight.
029	Especially a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard, where knights don't care about where you're from.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0004
030	Nothing changed when they saw my power as a therian.
031	They didn't see me as a human or a therian. They saw me as me. That's why I want to protect Envylia in any way I can.
032	...
033	I thought that I'd like to join the Scarlet Flame Guard if I was going to be a knight anyway.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0031
034	The Scarlet Flame Guard goes on a lot of missions, so I thought it would be the best use of my power.
035	And now I get to go to lots of different places, meet lots of people, and learn a lot!
036	I see. So that's why you wanted to be a knight... To you, all of Envylia is worth protecting.	VO_yura.yura_battle_0019
037	I think that's really cool.
038	...
039	(D'Artagnan found a way to use her powers for good. She doesn't doubt herself.)	VO_yura.yura_sys_0030
040	(I have to work harder. I won't let anyone else face unnecessary danger again.)
041	...Huh?
042	What's wrong, Yura?	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0005
043	The trail's gone cold... I'm positive it was leading just ahead.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0031
044	But I don't see anything it could be leading to...
045	We know it's nearby, right? If the trail disappeared all of a sudden, maybe they're using magic to hide.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0001
046	Even if that were the case, I should be able to feel the Alchemia, but there's nothing here.
047	Then that must mean that something is hindering your senses.	VO_dartaniun.dartaniun_sys_0016
048	Something powerful enough to not only hide their base, but also mess with a therian's senses... That's pretty big.
049	...
050	D'Artagnan?	VO_yura.yura_sys_0001
051	I'm gonna go run to the barracks real quick! You all wait here!
052	W-wait, D'Artagnan?! ...There she goes.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0025
053	Wh-what do we do?
054	Hmm...
055	It seems we're stuck here for a bit. Let's take a break.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0003
056	Understood. Will you be joining—
057	I'm going to take a look around. I've got quite a bit of stamina, so I don't need a rest yet.
058	...	VO_yura.yura_sys_0030
059	There must be something here, I just have to find it. I won't let anyone else get hurt.
060	Now's the time to show what I can do. I'm going to protect everyone!
061	The Alchemia trail really does disappear suddenly here.	VO_yura.yura_sys_0016
062	If D'Artagnan is right and this is their doing, then it should be around...here.
063	Quite the perceptive one, aren't we?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
064	!!! You!
