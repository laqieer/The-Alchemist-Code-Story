001	Why are you just standing there, staring into space? What's going through that empty old demon head of yours?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
002	Shut. Up.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
003	You actually look a little human when you're like this, wallowing in your own regrets.
004	Why won't you shut up?!
005	Look, I get it! You can be a human or a demon and still share in the pain of losing Kaede. Your regrets from that day still haunt you, right?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
006	You have no idea what you're talking about.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
007	You don't have to be bound by what's expected of your species. You're free to follow your own path. All that matters is what you want to be.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0015
008	I'm not bound by anything!
009	Then why are you working toward destroying humanity?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
010	Because I must.
011	But that's not what you want, is it? Ipso facto, you're bound by what's expected of you.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
012	Kaede was in the same boat, but she got over it. She achieved happiness by casting off those chains and just being who she wanted to be. And yeah, in the end, you weren't able to protect her.
013	...	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
014	You think that somehow means it's your duty now to kill all humans?!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0002
015	I do.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0004
016	Nah, I don't buy it. I mean, if you were that committed, then why would we still be here having this conversation with me? You're clearly hesitating.
017	I know that humans have caused you harm before, just for being a demon. But there was a time in your life when you forgave them for that. Remember?
018	You accepted Koga into your heart.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
019	...!
020	So seriously, just ask yourself: What is it you actually want?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0001
021	...
022	Demon or human... It doesn't matter.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
023	Something to...protect.
024	Like I said, our time here is limited.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0002
025	We'll have to return to these sacred vessels soon. But before we do, we wanted to make sure to deliver our message to you:	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0002
026	Don't forget, there are people here who sincerely wish for your happiness.
027	I... I want to protect...
028	Are you forgetting what the humans did to your brethren?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
029	A-ah...!
030	Oh, I knew you wouldn't forget that so easily, now, would you? You know just how cruel, backhanded, destructive, and wretched those humans are.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
031	Th-that's...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
032	Koga lied to you, don't forget. He hid that he was once a demon hunter.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
033	Can there be any doubt he would've lied again, given the chance? Kaede's future with him would've only ended in tears.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
034	He blinded you with a facade of happiness while he slowly prepared to lower you into the pits of despair. You know it's true!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
035	...
036	I... I hate...
037	Is that all the ferocity you have in you? After everything those humans have done? What of all the resentment that's pooled up over the years?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
038	I hate...hate...hate...!
039	There you go! More. Let your hatred flow. Allow your unfettered enmity to swallow you whole.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
040	HateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHate...
041	Yes, that's it! Good, Tamba! Good!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
042	Rraaaaaaghh!
043	Aaah! What the heck?!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0042
044	Hate... Hate...!
045	HateHateHateHateHateHate!
046	Gah!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
047	Rraaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0032
048	He's gone berserk! This isn't just Tamba anymore. There's something else influencing him!
049	And whatever it is, it's been gnawing at his mind for a long, long time now.
050	So this is what's kept you bound for so long... And I couldn't do anything about it. I'm so sorry, Tamba.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0030
051	I'm sure the Blade Fox has some way to counter this, though. I hope. Right... Amane?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
052	(The only thing I can do for now is...)
053	Fingers crossed!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
