001	The monsters have been eliminated, but the witches at the heart of the plot have escaped.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_1030
002	That's the true use of Battalion. It's a form of magic that was originally designed to act as a decoy so that the caster may escape.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
003	They cast it so smoothly. It was so masterful... Could it be...?
004	Ugh...gh...	VO_alma.alma_battle_0026
005	Alma! What's wrong? Where are you hurt?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
006	Ugh... I...I screwed up. There were so many of them.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0028
007	Hold still and let me take a look. I'll cast some healing magic!	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0020
008	Aaaaargh! At this rate, I'm going to get fat tomorrow!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0019
009	That's why I didn't want to use it! I hate it! I hate it so much!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0018
010	Get...fat? Wh-what are you talking about?	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0025
011	W-wait, you didn't use the magic that...? Then you're not actually hurt? Or...?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
012	I can't find any injury. What magic are you talking about?	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0039
013	I don't really know either. It's a magic that only Alma can use, but apparently it magically boosts her physical abilities.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
014	If she doesn't use it all up though, it'll turn into calories and she'll put on weight, so...
015	Magic...that turns into calories?	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0026
016	That all aside, don't scare us like that! You really haven't been harmed, then?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
017	Well, for a young lady, suddenly getting fat is a major enough problem, don't you think?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0016
018	I'm sympathetic, really, but...you worried me!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
019	Haha... Sorry, sorry. Anyway, what was with those witches before?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
020	Do you know what they were after?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
021	Of course I don't... Uh... Ahaha...ha... Um... Of course not?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0039
022	So...you do.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
023	I mean... I may have accidentally caught a prominent witch...um...cheating.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
024	Is that really something they'd come after me for, though?
025	What do you mean you caught them accidentally? You're the one who went looking for trouble, aren't you?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
026	Lustburg is just so scandalous right now!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
027	Spring is in full swing! There're hot happenings everywhere! I just have to be the first to gather the gossip!
028	That's what got you attacked! One of these days, you're really going to get yourself hurt!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
029	Yeah, I recently realized that maybe it's kind of dangerous to stick my nose where it's unwanted, so...I've started training.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
030	Training?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
031	That's right! Come with me, Rebecca!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
032	I gotta use up all this magical energy today anyway, and my master has been wanting to meet you!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
033	Your...master? I'll admit I'm curious, but today I need to talk with the headmistress.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
034	Oh, well...with the invasion and all the damage I need to assess and report on to the palace...	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_1030
035	Could we maybe talk another time, Rebecca?
036	Oh, of course. I suppose it can't really be helped.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
037	Oh, wow. Now that you mention it, the hall is a mess.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
038	We just finished fixing all the damage the Bugmail caused... Do you have any idea how much these repairs cost us? Glass windows don't just appear out of thin air, you know!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
039	Perhaps, but these windows are surely fated to be broken! I mean, Liz sometimes misses during practice and breaks the glass, too.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
040	Come to think of it, our windows do tend to break more than those of any other building, don't they?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
041	Wait a moment, this time it's half your fault! Don't just gloss over it!
042	Ahem... Moving on. Since your plans fell through, will you come meet my master?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
043	As if you're not the one who ruined those plans. Hmph. Just what kind of person is this master of yours, anyway?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
044	That's for me to know, and look forward to your finding out! Frankly, you'll really be helping me out by coming along, Rebecca.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
045	Getting up all the way up into the sky by myself is really rough.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
046	The...sky?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
047	I'm used to it, but if you're worried about the cold we can stop by Liz's and get some caramel jaeger.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
048	Excuse me?! Do you think I would overlook a student flying under the influence?	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_1030
049	Uh, I forgot you were there.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
050	The clouds that Asmodeus summoned are gone and the atmospheric temperature is warmer than before. There's no reason for us to drink.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
051	But why are we going into the sky, exactly?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
052	Because the hermit has always been up there! Come on!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
053	This is it! This is where the reclusive sage our country is so proud of—and my ogre of a coach—
054	Who are you calling an ogre? If you're going to call me names, you should up the ante a little. I recommend: demonic coach. Besides, you're the one who came here pleading for my expertise.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0012
055	Melvy!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0026
056	Oh! Rebecca! I was wanting to see you. Are you okay? Venus isn't picking on you?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
057	O-oh, yes, I'm fine. Should you be saying things like that about Her Majesty? What if she heard about it?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
058	Hahaha! We've been best friends forever, so it's fine. We're old classmates.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0008
059	What?! That's the first I've heard of this!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
060	If you were classmates with Her Majesty, then... You'd be over 200 years old! You don't look it at all!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
061	I spend a great deal of time up here in the air, so I've been directly exposed to Asmodeus' influence.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0004
062	That's why I age slower than other people.
063	It's not just me, though. Thanks to that influence, all the air defense mages are a bunch of beauties!	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
064	The selling point for joining us used to be the promise of eternal youth, but now...	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0030
065	Well...Asmodeus is gone, so...	VO_alma.alma_event_1007
066	Even with the benefits, it was never that popular of an assignment to begin with. Now, it's almost impossible to get anyone to join! I hope you'll take responsibility and join us, Alma!	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0020
067	No way! Not right now! I mean, I don't plan on being a reporter for the rest of my life though, so... Someday?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0012
068	I'm sure a day will come when this country will finally settle down...and maybe then I can join you.
069	In the hopes of that fabled someday you speak of, I'm doing you this favor.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0022
070	Competent adults don't spare any effort.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
071	R-right...
072	Of course, since you're always chasing after the next big scoop, you're always getting yourself into trouble.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0031
073	Furthermore, there're a lot of weird types of magic around, and a lot of people with crazy tough defenses.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0030
074	So, in the end, my teaching you the basics of this classical type of martial art is an effort to counter that danger.
075	Honestly, being a reporter seems pretty exciting, too.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
076	(Melvy and Alma really are cut from the same cloth.)	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
077	So, Alma—who may someday join the Air Defense Mages—I'm guessing that you want to practice aerial battling today?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0002
078	Gah! I don't have enough lives to battle you without the help of Liz's magic, Melvy!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0020
079	I-I'm going back to the ground to wait!
080	Heh, heh. You really can't take your eyes off her for a minute, can you? Rebecca, you come along too.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0022
081	Huh? Me, too?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
082	You're going to get all stiff doing only desk work. You need to get out and push your body to the limit on occasion.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0004
083	Push my body...? What do you mean? What are we going to do?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
084	Nothing too hard. You're just going to spar with me.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
085	That doesn't qualify as a work-out! Last time we fought, I was prepared for death!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
086	Oh? I thought I was holding back.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0031
087	That's...terrifying. It makes me wonder, though... Why are you always going so far out of your way to train us?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0020
088	Do you have some hidden reason?
089	Why do you think that?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0002
090	Well...when I asked Her Majesty to allow me to be her apprentice, she accepted.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
091	With her being how she is, I was sure she'd refuse, but she agreed so easily.
092	I thought perhaps she had some ulterior motive, but now I don't believe so.
093	She seems to genuinely want to prepare the next generation, just as you do, Melvy... It seems strange.
094	We have our reasons.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0010
095	How about we use this as a learning opportunity! Land a hit on me and I'll tell you the gist of it!
096	Wh-what?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
