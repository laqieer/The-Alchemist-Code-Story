001	You better watch your back!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
002	Thank you so much. My name is Hawk. Um, and you are?
003	Kamui.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
004	This place is far from the eyes of the court. It is not wise to wander around in such extravagant attire.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
005	You're not wrong. It was careless of me. I don't know what would have happened to me if not for you.
006	It was nothing. It's like they say, the good you do for others, is good you do for yourself.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
007	Anyway, you should go on ahead. I'm sure she's waiting for you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
008	She...? Uh, who, sir?
009	That fruit you have. It does not keep for long, and it is wrapped carefully. Is it not a gift for someone?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
010	Oh, this? No, it's...
011	I asked a merchant a few questions, and I just felt like it would be rude not to buy something from his shop.
012	I see. This is...more difficult than I thought it would be. Maybe it would have been better if Hisham did this...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	Oh, by the way! Would you happen to know anything about the Sephira?
014	Nnnn-no.
015	Oh, too bad... I've searched for so long. Maybe they really don't exist...
016	What do you plan to do if you find them?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
017	I wish to ask them for help in saving this country.
018	That's quite a bold request.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
019	I'm serious about it. This country retains financial stability through the export of the Alchemia found in the sands here.
020	However, everybody knows it will only work for so long.
021	We will need the wisdom of the Sephira and their powers of Spiritbonding to create a more sustainable solution.
