001	Edgar! Look out!
002	Argh!
003	Good riddance to you!
004	We did it!
005	Yes, but...without Alchemia... We have so few Alchemia Capsules left. If the battle drags on too long, we'll be left with nothing!
006	Tch! We'll just have to finish this quickly, then!
007	If we could only get the Alchemia to come back...even just a little bit more...!
008	Come on, Lisbeth!
009	Aah!
010	Waaaah!
011	Oh, no!
012	Are you all right? Are you hurt?
013	N-no... Waaaaaah!
014	Aah! Run! Quickly!
015	Grooooooooooooooghhh!
016	Aaaaaaahh!
017	Get down!
018	Kasumi! Are you all right?
019	What the hell are you doing?! Get out of here!
020	L-Liz...! Edgar!
021	Leave the fighting to us, all right? You've got to get to the shelter! Hurry!
022	Halt.
023	Huh...?
024	Wha...?!
025	S-Setsuna?! Mira?! Nyx!
026	Zain! What's with that getup?
027	...
028	Unless... Did the Darkness get to them? Is this the Destrolurk's doing?!
029	It is not darkness.
030	It is Void.
031	It will unmake the world.
032	Tch! What the hell are you talking about?!
