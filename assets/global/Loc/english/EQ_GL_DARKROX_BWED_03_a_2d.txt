001	Looks like this is it.
002	The date on the label is an exact match.
003	Documents... Several samples...
004	Personal effects, even.
005	What would Goetia want with these things?
006	It's more likely they filched the entire lot from the town's investigators, then tossed it unceremoniously into a bag.
007	Hmm. A leather journal.
008	Oh. It's a diary of some sort.
009	Let's have a look...
010	Wait-
011	...Sieg and I went to visit Teacher today.
012	As usual, though, no one answered the door.
013	Sieg and I even took the time to line up our breaks so we could come!
014	No one's home. She must have gone out somewhere again...
015	Or gotten lost.
016	Let's get the spare key.
017	There we go.
018	Of course you would know where it is. You're the one getting locked out all the time, after all.
019	That's because YOU lock me out in the first place!
020	Nobody's going to stay up past midnight to wait for you to drag your grubby behind home, Sieggy.
021	Hey, I was out training and lost track of time...
022	Entry XXX.
023	Stupid Sieg... Every time I look for him he's never around!
024	I had to enlist Soren's help in rounding up those droids...
025	We almost got into big trouble, too. Thankfully it all worked out with Blair.
026	Still, seeing her so happy in that snappy new suit was worth all that hassle.
027	Just thinking about it brings such warm fuzzy feelings to my heart...
028	...
029	When was the last time Sieg was around to receive the gifts I made for him?
030	Chocolate doesn't last long!
031	Especially if it's homemade...
032	I know he cares for me, deep inside. I can't be the only one who feels this way...
033	After knowing each other for so long and going through so much, surely he...
034	...
035	Ehehe. It would be nice to be in a beautiful white dress of my own someday.
036	To have and to hold...
037	For better, for worse.
038	In sickness and in health...
039	Stop.
040	That's...enough.
041	If it makes you feel any better, I don't find myself suddenly flooded by lost memories...
042	Although I have a vague recollection of some of these...I think.
043	What about this, then?
044	What's this... 'Casualty report'?
045	Adult female body recovered from premises...
046	Hair: pink. Eyes: blue. Facial features-
047	...!
048	Blue eyes?
049	(Where am I...?)
050	(It's cold...and it's hard to breathe.)
051	(Some kind of tube...?)
052	Biologically stable...good, good.
053	Ah. Awake already, I see.
054	Let's have a look, shall we?
055	Almost a perfect likeness... Her will is astounding, astounding indeed.
056	(Is that- Me?!)
057	(But... How? I'm here, but my body is-)
058	The Doktor turned away for a moment, and there, I saw her.
059	Off to the side, lit by a cold, sterile light...
060	Her.
061	The real Roxanne.
062	Then...
063	Who... What am I?
064	I felt something off when we first met...
065	But never did I think it would be something so heinous.
066	Roxanne...
067	STOP SAYING THAT NAME!
068	I know. I'll silence you forever.
069	No one would ever know. This is all a lie.
070	Forgive me, Roxanne.
