001	What were you thinking, Creto? Letting that assassin walk free...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
002	It never hurts to spare a life.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0004
003	I'll tell you what really hurts: a dagger in the bloody back! I won't be able to sleep tonight, not while knowing someone out there wants me dead!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0013
004	It's necesary to live and let live, don't you think?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
005	How can you say that?! What good is mercy at a time like this? None, I tell you!
006	I'll find myself another bodyguard, but I won't be calling upon the Sosenko's services ever again! You can count on that!
007	W-wait! Perhaps we can...! And there he goes.
008	Oh dear. I suppose this means I've lost another job.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
009	This is no good. Our disciples grow fewer by the day. I must do what I can to gather sufficient funds, or else...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0050
010	Yet killing that assassin would have meant betraying everything I stand for...
011	...
012	The sword need not be an instrument of death.
013	It can be a tool to save lives or spare them. That is the way of the Sosenko: our swords must never become assassin blades.
014	We of the Sosenko are proud of that fact, and must believe that it is what guides us to cast light upon this world.
015	You're leaving? Your family has been with us for generations...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0001
016	I am sorry.
017	I admire the Sosenko's ideology, I do, but...
018	I can't be like you, Creto.
019	I cannot bring myself to ignore the fact that I could use my strength to avenge my friend. I can't just...suppress that desire.
020	Do you know what everyone calls you behind your back, Creto?
021	A coward. A weakling who can't bring himself to kill.
022	...
023	A blade that doesn't kill can't save anyone either.
024	A blade that doesn't kill can't save anyone either... Gah! I'll never forget those words, but...simply dwelling on them isn't going to solve anything.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
025	I still have one other job today. I've got to pull myself together.
026	...
027	I-I'm so...hungry.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0021
028	This isn't going to work. A few small dumplings aren't enough to get me through the day. If anything, they just made me hungrier. I'm starving...
029	I suppose I should have carried out that job earlier, but...
030	No... No, I shouldn't have. I did the right thing.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
031	The way of the Sosenko is mine to keep. I must never bring it dishonor.
032	If only I wasn't so very hungry, though...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0022
033	I can't handle this life of poverty. I'm not like you, Creto.
034	I understand. Of course I do. It's only natural to get fed up with this miserable lifestyle.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
035	All righty, here we are!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0005
036	The legendary flavor brought to you by a business that's been going for a century. A big bowl of our special sweet bean dessert, topped generously with homemade brown sugar syrup made according to our secret recipe.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0007
037	Mm... Thanks.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0033
038	Hm?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
039	...
040	...
041	Hey.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
042	Huh?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
043	Do you need something? You've been fixing that harsh glare of yours on me for some time now.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
044	Wh-what?! I... No!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0025
045	M-my apologies. I meant no offense.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0036
046	Then what the hell is your problem?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
047	...
048	...
049	You want some?
050	N-no, not...exactly.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0039
051	Ahah...hahaha.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0011
052	Jeez. Hey, miss? Can I get another one of these? Give it to this man here.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
053	Certainly! Another big bowl of our special sweet bean dessert, topped generously with our homemade brown sugar syrup, coming right up!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0005
054	A-are you sure?!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0024
055	I can't really enjoy this while you're looking at me like that, so yeah.
056	Wow...umgf...this is so good! So sweet, but with that hint of salt and spice. I can feel it seeping into my very being!	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0023
057	And this syrup! It's so thick and rich, without being too much... It's absolute perfection.
058	What the hell do you normally eat? Straw?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0023
059	I'm not sure... I think lately I've been eating mostly just rice, soaking it in hot water to bulk it up a little.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0039
060	It was getting a bit much, even for me, so I've been taking on some jobs as a bodyguard, but...
061	But?
062	Well... If they turn out to be jobs that require me to kill somebody, I end up turning them down. So I'm stuck being stone broke...	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0010
063	And so hungry I could eat a horse. Or two.
064	Why do you turn them down? Looks to me like you're hungry enough to stomach spilling a bit of blood, even if it makes you squeamish.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
065	I will not kill people for money.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0016
066	Huh.
067	Well...I do not want to.	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0010
068	Alas, as you can see, I might not have a choice. My disciples cannot handle this life of poverty, and it's only a matter of time before I become too desperate and flee from it as well, just as they have.
069	Hm.
070	What's...?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0006
071	You're Reimei, aren't you?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
072	So what if I am?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
073	Aaaahhh!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0028
074	You're dead!
075	What the...?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
076	Drawing your sword in a place like this... Are you out of your mind?	VO_kureto.kureto_sys_0002
077	You a friend of Reimei's? Then you'll meet the same fate.
078	There's no need for you to interfere.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0013
079	I owe you for that delicious meal. I will aid you in this fight!
