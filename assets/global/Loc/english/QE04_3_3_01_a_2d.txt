001	Another...Wind Shaman...?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0026
002	Indeed. That means that a Wind Shaman has been born to each faction: Voda, Fuu, and Tehre.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
003	Is that even possible?!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0021
004	The result speaks for itself. Why this has happened, I do not know. However...in order to respond to Saga's crisis, three Wind Shamans were born.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
005	It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore the Wind Matter, to return the land of Saga to its people.
006	All my strategies are rooted in that cause.
007	Wait. Is this all part of some plan that you've been preparing ever since Alia died...?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0003
008	People claim to co-exist with nature while simply exhausting its resources. In order to halt this wheel of destruction, we must adopt the technology of other countries.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
009	That was the purpose of trade. In order for humans to survive independently, we need tools, technology, and information.
010	However, that alone is not enough. The people themselves must also change.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
011	Yet, as if in proportion to the exhaustion of our natural resources, the rift between our tribes continues to grow.
012	I wanted an opportunity for all the people of Saga to change. The conclusion I arrived at was for a crisis to occur.
013	There are things that people can only learn to appreciate through suffering. Not that I approve of the sacrifices that have been made. However, if eventual casualties were inevitable anyway...
014	It is the leader's role to keep such sacrifices to the minimum...that was my thinking behind everything.
015	Don't you think you went a little too far? There must've been other measures you could've taken without resorting to such violence.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
016	And allow Saga to perish in the meantime? Time is of the essence. We must move forward with efficiency.	VO_terre.terre_battle_0016
017	The key elements have been gathered. All that remains is to act. The ultimate plan has been set in motion. We shall see what the results are. This is all...for the glory of Saga.
018	I had no idea you'd thought so hard about this, Tehre boy. You could've shared some of this with me before.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
019	Would you have listened? You are here now only because of the resulting crisis. Would you have held such an open mind during times of peace?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
020	...Touché.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
021	This crisis all began with Alia's death.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
022	Ever since Alia was purged according to the law.
023	What is the point of the law? Granted, it exists to protect us. However, that is not its essence.
024	If we allow ourselves to be blindly tied down by our laws, we risk repeating the same tragedy that befell Alia!
025	So...you are attempting to change the very essence of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
026	A keen observation. However, I question whether the obstinate Fuu would be able to understand.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
027	I mean, protecting Saga without relying on nature... Methods aside, there's a point to your argument.
028	Well, well. Who would've thought I'd live long enough to be educated by you, Tehre boy?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0011
029	You and Fuu are caught up in the past. Moving forward, I will shoulder the responsibility for everything.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
030	How reassuring. I look forward to the Sprite Trio Discourse.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
031	It's still not guaranteed that those two will return.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
032	They will return...with the token!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
