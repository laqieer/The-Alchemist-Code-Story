001	Wow, this place is amazing! There's so many people--so much cool stuff!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0044
002	Yep, it's the holiday market all right. Even just looking around is a lot of fun. I love it too.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
003	...This is great! There's so much here. Now I'll definitely be able to find the perfect present for Ishi.
004	Huh? You're gift shopping?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
005	Last winter holiday Ishi got me a gift, but I didn't get anything for her.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
006	Ishi's a special girl. And my special pillow!
007	She really helped me out this year. She's always been there for me.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
008	(But I left her all alone...)
009	...
010	Rochelle?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
011	...It's nothing.
012	Anyway, Ishi loves the holidays, so I've got to get her the perfect present this year!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
013	The perfect present... *sigh*
014	W-what's wrong?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0005
015	...But what is it!? I have no idea what the perfect present would be!
016	Huh!?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0026
017	You never even asked her what she wanted?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
018	I was so wrapped up with everything else that I never got around to it...
019	I wonder what kind of present she'd like. Do you have any ideas?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
020	H-huh? Why ask me?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0004
021	Well you were with her the other day when you came to get us.
022	We hadn't seen each other in quite a while, so I thought you might know more about her than me.
023	I don't think I do, but... Hmm, I really don't know what she'd like...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
024	But I bet she'd like anything, as long as you picked it out for her.
025	Maybe... But what should I pick...?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
026	Hmm...
027	HMMM...
028	I...have no idea. Let's just go look for those decorations for now...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0022
029	Good idea. Maybe you'll stumble upon a good present while we're searching.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
030	Oh, I bet you're right! You're good at this, Ravi!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0044
031	Ehehe... Come on, let's go.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
032	Decorations for a snow sculpture? Sorry, nothing like that arrived here.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
033	Oh, I see... Now what, Rochelle?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0022
034	We can't give up that easily. Black and white bears always find their prey!
035	Where could they have gone? Maybe they got lost somewhere along the way? I'm gonna keep looking.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
036	Wow, black and white bears are something else...
037	Hmm, now that you mention it... I heard the goods from the craftsman in the forest were never actually delivered.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0025
038	Huh? Why not?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0025
039	It sounds like the person delivering those packages was attacked by a monster along their route and had everything stolen.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0004
040	What!?
041	They weren't hurt, though. It sounds like the monster was only after the packages.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0031
042	After that, some guards were sent out to patrol the woods, but there hasn't been any sign of the packages.
043	This is worse than we thought! We need to go back and tell the others!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
044	Yeah, let's hurry.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
045	(This whole winter holiday thing is harder than I thought...)
