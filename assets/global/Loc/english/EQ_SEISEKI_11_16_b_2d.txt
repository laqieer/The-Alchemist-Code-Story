001	Nngh... Neun...is right! We cannot stop here!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
002	We are the only ones who can bring hope to those who are oppressed!
003	Here they come! Kagura!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
004	Right!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
005	Neun... Acht... J-just watch. I will lead you both...into our n-new era!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
006	Huzzaaaaahh!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
007	Plasma Burst!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
008	Haaa... Haaa... Heh, too bad.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
009	Are you okay?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
010	Somehow.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
011	You...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
012	Pathetic. You're nowhere near as threatening as you were earlier. Looks like you're headed to the afterlife, not the future.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
013	Urgh! Shut your mouth! You think I'm done?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
014	Yeah, I do. I'm putting an end to this myself.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
015	Captain Kudan, wait!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
016	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
017	There's an ominous dark wind circling around him! You shouldn't get too close!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
018	Sol's body is glowing? What is he about to do?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
019	You have all been nuisances for long enough! Die!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
020	Whoa! Everybody, get ready to defend yourselves!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
021	Wrong, Basheeny. This is exactly when we should attack.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
022	What?! D-do you have a plan?! Not only do physical attacks not harm him, but he can break himself out of your spells!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
023	I might. As we've already seen, a simple attack is not enough to damage him.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
024	However, there is no way a person can bulk up the protection they have inside.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
025	In...side?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
026	Yep. I call it: The Lightning Rod Strategy!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
027	You plan to funnel magic directly into his internal organs?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
028	You are a sharp one, Captain Vettel.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
029	How do you intend to accomplish this?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
030	Right, so...that's the biggest problem.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
031	For this to work, someone is going to have to thrust a weapon of some sort into his flesh.
032	While dodging his powerful swings, of course.
033	What are you all prattling on about?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0013
034	It doesn't matter what your plan is! I will rend you all into bloody, dripping shreds and glory in it!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0015
035	Whoa, that was...visceral. That guy is super scary! I didn't know I could still get goosebumps like this as a Phantom!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0027
036	Th-there is no time to be scared! How are we going to put this plan into action?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0016
037	The plan? The key agent for this mission is already on the move.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
038	The key agent?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
039	Yes. He took action before I even explained the details to him. I envy you for having such an excellent retainer.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
040	Who...? Oh!
041	I am going to tear into your body and shred your flesh to strips! Let me see your blood!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
042	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
043	What the—?!
044	Urgh! Why, you little...!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
045	I did it! Captain Vettel! Look, I stabbed him! You shouldn't have underestimated the Scarlet Flame Guard, you gorilla!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0046
046	Tch! You little brat!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0027
047	Huzzzaahhh!!!
048	Urgh?! Why, you—! Huh?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0043
049	I shouldn't have expected any less from the famed Scarlet Flame Guard. You did well too, Basheeny.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
050	You've made your teacher proud. I can leave the future in your hands with confidence.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
051	Y-you...?	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
052	I can understand what you and your friends are going through, but the beliefs you hold dear will never be compatible with this world. I'm sorry.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
053	You've caused too much trouble among the living. You will be able to riot to your heart's content in the world of the dead.
054	Neun! Get out of there!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
055	Absolute Zero!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
056	Grraaagh!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0025
057	Neun!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
058	Nng! Ugff! You...bastards...always making us into...outcasts.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0043
059	Are we not...e-even allowed to...pursue...the sky we dreamed of?
060	S-Sol, please... K-kill these bastards... Set...L-Lost Blue...free. Grrraaaaaahh!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0025
061	...!
062	No...
063	We did it! B-but...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
064	This...doesn't feel...right.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
065	If you think of all the casualties he caused and victims he left behind, his actions were irredeemable, and yet...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
066	He was acting on his own ideas of justice. That's no small thing. We shouldn't just let it fade away. Do you understand?
067	Yes, sir.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
068	Unforgivable...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
069	Huh?
070	Those who hurt one of our own must be annihilated. That is our code!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
071	I am going to kill you all! I will slaughter every single one of you, no matter what!
072	The dark wind within Sol is surging even stronger than before!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
073	No! Sol, you can't!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
074	Love can be a strength, but in the same vein, it can also become a weakness. The person I yearn for taught me that.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
075	What?
076	Allowing love to be your priority will interfere with your concentration. I was once told that it is better to discard affection if it becomes blind love.
077	Lord Zahar, I now know that you were expressing your concern for me with those words.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0007
078	Grk!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0007
079	Acht!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
080	Nn...ngh! T-take it back! You dare...s-say my affection...for S-Sol is my...weakness?!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
081	I-if you intend...to ridicule my feelings—!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
082	No, please understand. I am envious.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
083	En...vious?	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
084	Yes, I am. I envy you for being able to blindly devote yourself to the one you care for.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
085	I can never again meet the person I wish to devote myself to.
086	Wha—?!
087	Those left alive must accept the death of those who are gone, but there is no feat more agonizing.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0018
088	There are times I wish I had followed him to the other side, but I cannot muster the courage to make that choice.
089	You...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
090	To be honest, I don't know what the right thing to do is anymore. I am so lost.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
091	The honesty of your devotion will surely reach his heart, unlike mine.
092	That precious soul of yours will surely accompany his to the end.
093	Agh!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
094	Acht!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
095	The...s-sky we chased after...f-for so long... I-it's fading...but...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0018
096	My soul...will n-never stop...following you. P-please keep me b-by your side.
097	Of course I will.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
098	Nng! I...am s-so glad to...have been...w-with you.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
099	Acht!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
100	I am glad to have been allowed to bear witness to your passion.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
101	Spica...
102	You're the only one left.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
103	Even you cannot defeat us all.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
104	We will stop you before you do something that can't be undone. That's the least I can do as someone who shares the same hometown.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
105	What do you mean "before"?! He's already caused so much damage!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
106	You'll atone for everything you've done!
107	You've brought terror into the lives of the people of Babel, and caused substantial harm.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
108	As the Lord Commander, the keeper of the peace, I cannot forgive you!
109	What do have you to say for yourself?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
110	...
111	Hmph. You don't even have the strength to talk back, do you?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
112	No...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
113	Huh?
114	Vier... Füry...
115	What is he...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
116	Sieba... Zehn... Neun... Acht...
117	No... The dark wind within Sol is getting stronger!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
118	Huh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
119	This is an unexpected turn of events. I don't think our dreams are going to come true on this day.       	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
120	But I can fulfill one last promise to you. These bastards who took your lives... I will slaughter every single one of them!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
121	Here he comes!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
122	Agh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
123	Hrgh...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
124	Ugh!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
125	I will end it all here. Beg for forgiveness from those friends of mine who you have condemned to the afterlife.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
126	He's...so fast! I-I can't see him!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0042
127	Th-there's not even time for me to try to sense his presence!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
128	This is a bit of a pickle. We need to think of something, quick!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0028
129	There is nothing you can do! The next strike will be the end of you!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
130	Seriously?! Can't you give me a little time to think?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
131	Haha...hahahaha... I forgot to mention how I hate being alone. I'll have you all follow me to hell!	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
132	Y-you have to be kidding me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
133	He's... He's going to use all of his remaining power in this one moment!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
134	You mean...self-destruct?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
135	Kudan, can you still fight?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
136	What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
137	If that man intends to self-destruct, then we have to take him out with one swift blow.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
138	You and Kanon, the two with the most remarkable offensive capabilities, are the only ones we can trust with this task.
139	I agree that this is the most pragmatic option. Do you think you're up for it, Kanon?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
140	Of course! I can't just stand around and do nothing!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
141	I guess that would be the only option. Can you do it, Captain Kudan?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
142	...
143	Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
144	All right, then! Let's go out with a bang!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
145	Oh no! His energy is rising at an incredible rate!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
146	I'll draw his attention! Seida, can you pinpoint the source of his dark wind?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
147	Yes... We'll have to aim for the core of his energy! Let's go, Kanon!
148	Got it!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
149	Wow, they make a great team! Well, I guess this leaves me with only one job left to do. Hey, Kagura?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
150	I know what you're thinking! Kudan, we're counting on you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
151	...
152	Captain Vettel! What can we do?	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
153	Their teamwork is flawless. If we were to try anything, we'd just be getting in their way.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
154	Tch! So we can only stand by and watch?!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
155	Kanon, you've got this!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
156	Hmph! No matter what you may be plotting, it is too late!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
157	Isn't that right, Captain Yauras?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
158	He figured out our plan?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
159	You just don't learn, do you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
160	What?! Where did she go?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
161	It would be wise to remember that there is not a single captain of the Holy Guard that does not know how to learn from their past experiences!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
162	Immortal Rose!!!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0032
163	Agh! Nngh! Y-you...	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
164	Seida!
165	I see it! The source of his dark wind... The core of it is in his solar plexus!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1016
166	You're all dead!	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
167	H-his energy... It's surging through him!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
168	Everybody, get down!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
169	Burn! All of you!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
170	Whoa!
171	What? Why did nothing happen?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
172	H-hurry!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
173	What?!
174	I-I can't hold it...for long!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
175	Redhead! Tch! Dang you for using your phoenix to suppress the blast! Again!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
176	Heartbreaking Arrow!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
177	Nngh?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
178	Got him! That one definitely pierced his core!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
179	Urgh! Y-you lot think this...will kill me?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
180	Not yet, of course. Seida, thanks for getting the lightning rod where it needs to be!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
181	What are you—?!
182	I'm sorry to inform you, but we'll be draining off some more of your power... Ill Atmosphere!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0032
183	Gh... Argh!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
184	The turbulent wind within him stopped! It's frozen!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
185	Kanon!
186	...?!
187	Thank you, everybody. I will not let this chance go to waste!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
188	N-no!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
189	Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
190	Agh!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
191	We got him!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0046
192	Wait! No, not yet!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
193	Huh?
194	Ug...ugff...! I-I am...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
195	I am...the light. The sun...of Lost Blue... I... I cannot go down...like this!
196	H-how?! His dark wind is billowing again?! Kanon! Hit him again!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
197	...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
198	I'll s-say it again. I am the sun...that will lead...this world into a...n-new era. It doesn't matter how many of you there may be!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
199	I have no intention of parroting this lot's holier-than-thou ideals, let alone joining their little mob...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
200	Wha—?!
201	However, there is one thing I must say on their behalf.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
202	Wh-wha...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
203	Don't you dare look down on us!
204	Don't you dare look down on the justice of our continent!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
205	Aghh!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0025
