001	Are you okay, Reimei?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0027
002	Perhaps we were the ones that led them here.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
003	Do you think there's a chance that this shop and this village might be attacked?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
004	I doubt it.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
005	Since they have sweet bean desserts in this shop, I'll come here every day. If they come again, I'll chase them off.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
006	Sweet beans?	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0025
007	Ah, it's nothing.	VO_reimay.reimay_chara_1003
008	Do you like sweet beans? I didn't know that.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0045
009	I realize it doesn't suit me.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
010	That's not true. Sweet beans taste delicious. Although, it is a little surprising. Hehe.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0047
011	So that's what you sound like when you laugh.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0011
012	I feel safe with my sweet bean knight here to protect me.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0007
013	H-hey...stop teasing me.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0021
014	Ultimately, though, Wadatsumi needs to be restored to a place where people can live peacefully—a place where I won't need you to always protect me, Reimei.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
015	... ...
016	I won't give up until all of Wadatsumi is safe to live in again.
017	But, I can't do it on my own. I'm going to restore this country with the help of all those around me.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
018	...I see.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
019	Yes. That's why I'm going to need your help, Reimei.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
020	Mine?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
021	Yes. Of course.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0005
022	But...I...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_1047
023	I'm sorry about what happened between us. I've been wanting to apologize for quite some time.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0002
024	...?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
025	My words caused you to suffer.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
026	I said that I wanted to thank you for your help earlier, right?
027	It would be a double-standard to thank you only when you save me from the hands of bandits.
028	Ah, well...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0047
029	You must have thought it strange that I only rebuked you when it was individuals from Wadatsumi.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0012
030	I got emotional, and I showered you with contradictory words.
031	I'm truly sorry.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0035
032	No. Please, raise your head. I only did what I had to do.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_1047
033	That's it. That day...all you did was what you had to do, Reimei.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0020
034	But...I...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_battle_0020
035	Raise your head, Chihaya.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
036	... ...
037	That day, I didn't have the right words to tell you.
038	But now you've given me my answer. Thank you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0034
039	Reimei, I'm the one who should be thanking you...	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0022
040	The sweet bean sweets are ready!
041	Oh, it looks good!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0009
042	Thank you, Reimei. Please, eat a lot.	VO_chihaya.chihaya_sys_0033
043	Yeah, I'll do that. Gratefully.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0038
