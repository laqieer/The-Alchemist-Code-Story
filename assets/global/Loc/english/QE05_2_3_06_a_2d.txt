001	Grow crops in the desert?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
002	Yeah, have you not heard? There's a band of mercenaries called the Sand Hawks working on it.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
003	They're saying plants can grow in the desert if done right. We all thought that was just some fantasy talk.
004	But hot-dang, they finally got some crops to sprout! It's the talk of the dunes!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
005	Then Hawk's will lives on...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
006	Hey, you... You knew Hawk?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0002
007	Speak of the devil, eh? Mister, you're in luck. This person here is the leader of the Sand Hawks.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
008	Ah, yes. I have heard of you, though this is our first meeting.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
009	My name is Kamui. I am the head of a guild known as the Fruit Peddlers.
010	The courier guild working with Ryle, right? Hmph... I have been impressed by how your people always make deliveries on time, rain or shine.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
011	Well, that is our motto. Sandstorms are a different story, though, as you might expect.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
012	Ha! You're funny!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0008
013	Now, tell me, good sir. What brings you to our little town? Peddling some fruit?
014	Fruit, yes...but I have also been asked to deal with some monsters spotted in this area.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
015	Just you? You gonna be okay on your own?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
016	Why don't we lend you a helping hand? I'd like to hear a few more details about how you know Hawk, too.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0007
017	I...appreciate the offer, but...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
018	(Wait... Perhaps...)
019	Well... If it is not too much to ask, the help would be welcome.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
020	Yeah, sure! I just gotta check in with Balt... Ah, rats. He's out on some kind of errand. I forgot.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0037
021	Recently, the number of bandits targeting merchants from Envylia has increased, and so the number of wannabe mercenaries is way up. It's really inconvenient.
022	The world has indeed become a harsh place.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
023	Seriously. Anyway, we'd better get this done before the sun goes down!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0030
024	Hey, dude, you seriously set a brutal pace. I guess I should've expected that kind of energy from someone who works as a courier in the desert.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0031
025	My work does require a certain amount of fitness, yes.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
026	Grrrrrr...
027	Here they come!	VO_karla.karla_chara_1001
