001	I feel uneasy.
002	About what? I'm not entirely sure, but a vague, indistinct unease lingers at the back of my mind.
003	Ahh, that's it!
004	I feel uneasy because I am unsure. I am flustered because of all that I don't know.
005	Being so shaken makes me feel incredibly small.
006	Where do all of these feelings come from?
007	Even as I ask myself that question, the answer rises to the forefront of my mind, taking a most familiar form.
008	His.
009	So bright it hurts to look at it.
010	Forgetting about what I ought to protect...
011	What is it that I want to protect?
012	Gerald? Gerald! Are you even listening to me?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
013	What is it?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
014	Urgh! As I was saying, we're here! At the ruins? Where the bandits from the request are based? Is any of this ringing any bells?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
015	Yes... Right.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
016	Gerald! This is the first request we've gotten in a long while, so pull yourself together! You're not acting like yourself.
017	I know what I need to do. Everybody ready? Then it's time. We're going in!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0005
018	There are fewer here than we expected. Are the rest hiding somewhere?
019	It doesn't matter. Our plan doesn't change.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
020	We will shortly be entering the bandits' base to eradicate them, as per the request we received. I will draw them out to give you the chance you need to crush every last one of them.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
021	G-Gerald! Why?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
022	Here I go! Together, we will complete this request, and what's more...	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0015
023	We will make the name of our Scarlet Legion known throughout the entirety of Envylia!
024	Gerald...
