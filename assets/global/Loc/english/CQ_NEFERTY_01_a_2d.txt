001	This place is just like it was... Just as we are.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
002	The court is still full of infighting and power struggles, unable to solve even the newest problems.
003	The fact that desert people are being kidnapped and sold as slaves is a problem that we, as desert people, should not overlook.
004	I want to unite the people of the desert to protect this desert, you said.	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
005	That dream you had is still a dream. You said you would leave it to me. I'm sorry...Hawk.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0035
006	I didn't think you'd come all the way out here.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
007	My my, I could say the same about you, Ryle.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
008	This is the place Hawk passed away. It would be unlike you to forget that, wouldn't it?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
009	...
010	Why are you here, Ryle?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0002
011	I had something to do nearby, that's all. What about you? What are you doing here?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
012	I've been reminiscing about him a little bit.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
013	Hmm...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0044
014	Protecting the desert, huh? Do you regret what happened?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
015	Regret? Hm. I don't know.
016	Sometimes it doesn't feel like it's really something that's in the past.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
017	How curious. That almost exactly describes how I feel about you.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
018	Wow. You haven't changed.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
019	Hawk's ideals were too big for us.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
020	His dreams may not have been wrong, but people don't operate on emotion alone.
021	People only act when there's profit. There has to be a common goal shared by everyone in order for them to work together.
022	We couldn't find it, so we failed to become a unified country...as you well know.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
023	I remember well indeed, because I had quite the struggle with the conservatives.
024	Ultimately, we tried to keep the power structure the same, so we ended up with a lot of trouble with the conservatives and reformists within the aristocracy, not to mention the factional strife within each faction.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
025	You always seem to make enemies wherever you go.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
026	What a terrible thing to say. I'm only doing what I feel I should be doing.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
027	There will always be those who are disappointed with what I choose to do. I can't help that.
028	The court never changes. Always a pain.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
029	Hehe. You might be surprised to hear it, but it can be surprisingly fun.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
030	It's a place that requires a lot of improvisation and effort in order to get where you want to be, where things rarely go your way and you often have to think on your feet just to survive.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
031	That is why Hawk was determined to leave the court.
032	In the time he had left to live, he wanted to do whatever he could to make his dream a reality, no matter what it took. Even if there wasn't much he really could do.
033	And as a result, he lost his life.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
034	Yes, unfortunately.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
035	That man's will was not allowed to reach its full potential. In the end, the pros and cons of that choice remain unknown...
036	The whole "we're all in this together" thing was always just a pie-in-the-sky ideal. It didn't fit the reality, so no one wanted to put the effort into it.
037	However, it doesn't mean his desperate wish to try and bring change to this place didn't mean anything. The truth of it still exists, even now.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
038	That desire to change things... I'm sure it wasn't a bad thing.
039	Things won't change unless there's someone willing to bring change. It's easiest to maintain the status quo.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
040	The status quo will eventually reach its limit.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
041	Yes. And when that happens...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
042	...this land will perish.
043	I'm so...disappointed.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0022
044	You! You must be Ryle of the Desert Wings!
045	I don't know why you're here, but you're gonna pay for what you did!
046	You guys... Oh, I knew it...	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_1030
047	Oh, acquaintances of yours?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
048	Of course not.
049	They seem to recognize you, though. More importantly, now that they've pointed weapons at us, we have no choice but to deal with them.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
