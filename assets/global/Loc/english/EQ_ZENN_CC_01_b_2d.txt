001	Too proud to be worked as cattle. Too blunt to be serviceable as a tool. I suppose your only worth to me would be as a lapdog.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
002	Tch... Sh...shu...shut up!	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0042
003	Didn't your parents ever teach you the way of this world? It's survival of the fittest, whelp.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
004	All the beasts, bugs, and plants of this world follow it, so don't go thinking you're exempt. It is the folly of humankind to reject the natural way of things, simply because of a lacking strength of spirit.
005	A weak mind breeds laziness and self-indulgence. Why do so few seek to surmount their weaknesses and hone their strengths?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
006	I alone stand as an embodiment of strength. You could not wound me, even if you had every last Intelligencer fight alongside you.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
007	Tch!
008	I know not hesitation. My enemies will be invaded, slaughtered, obliterated.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
009	For I have a right to wield the powers I have obtained through training, and growing in strength. Do I not, whelp?
010	Y-yes... It is...as you say.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0016
011	P-please, my lord, have mercy! These are the fiercest warriors in our nation! We cannot afford to lose anoth—!
012	I only have need of quality tools. Defects must be disposed of.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
013	B-but...!
014	You are no fool, Na Zhu. You must have known how pointless it would be to turn against me.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
015	And yet...you do not seem displeased with this outcome.
016	What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
017	You're enjoying yourself...aren't you?	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0007
018	Hah... Ahahahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0009
019	See? You're welcome...for the laughs.
020	Hah! You're something, Na Zhu, I'll give you that. I knew I liked your gumption.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
021	Thank you.	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0034
022	So, what is it you seek from the paws of this lion?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0037
023	I will do whatever you wish of me, my lord, if you will only remember my name. As for what I desire, well...how about...	VO_nazhu.nazhu_sys_0031
024	The position of head of Imperial Security?
025	Greed Dike, Imperial Hinterlands - Anti-Imperialist Outpost
026	...
027	Oh, my. Look at all this blood!
028	...
029	Tut-tut. Do you know how difficult it is to get bloodstains out of white fabric like that? One would have thought you'd be more careful.
030	I heard...that they had stolen something bound for Wadatsumi from a Greed Dike trade ship.	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
031	Indeed. That "something" was myself.
032	I am a sacrifice meant for the lion. You had better bring me up to the castle quickly, before he begins to roar.
033	A...sacrifice?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0029
034	Yes, exactly. I can only hope I prove a satisfying one.
035	Why...don't you run?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0001
036	That's not my duty.
037	Hmph.
038	My name is Mitsu.
039	Why are you telling me this?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_battle_0016
040	To hurt you.
041	What?	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0006
042	Now, I may not have a fancy katana, but there are many more ways to hurt someone than with the sting of a blade.
043	Indeed.
044	Doesn't it pain you, to know that this humble sacrifice has a name?
045	I...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0025
046	'Tis the emblem of ten.
047	Or have you forgotten what pain feels like?
048	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0031
049	Come, rise and fight, brethren!
050	I would expect you'd have to do away with sympathy altogether, to fulfill a role like yours.
051	Blood-red winds blow dry and cold, sweeping me into the numbered fold.
052	Unlike you, I have no means of changing my course. I am but a sacrifice, a good to be traded.
053	Like a surrendered blade, I have no will of my own. I am fated only to be carried from place to place.
054	Eternity awaits.
055	Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?
056	...	VO_zen_zen-b.zen_sys_0022
057	My apologies. I tend to run my mouth a bit when I'm afraid.
058	Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me?
059	The empty vessel rings when hit; its sound fills the world around it.
060	Or, if I am to be reborn, do you think I will find love?
061	When you hear the melody of a perfect bull's-eye, that's the signal to hoist the curtains high!
062	Yet don't you sometimes find thrilling plays a bore? Aren't poetic monologues enough to make you snore?
063	Hark, impetuous youth, your audience I crave! You mustn't miss the parting phrase of the evil knave!
064	"Fools! You will regret this!" Doesn't it always end the same?
