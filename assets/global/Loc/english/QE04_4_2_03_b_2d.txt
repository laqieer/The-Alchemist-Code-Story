001	Eat steel!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
002	Guh!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0019
003	Georgios!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
004	Hmph. I'm not in such a pathetic state that I need you to worry about me!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0042
005	Georgios! You're in no condition to stand!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
006	The tentacle is after Beelzebub. If it intends to interfere with my life's work, then my duty is to eliminate it!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0018
007	In this condition?! Are you insane?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0022
008	I swore to safeguard it. No matter what comes at me, I will follow through with my oath. That is what it means to have resolve.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
009	Why would you go so far...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
010	There is no future for those unable to overcome the present. That is the truth of the world. Those who don't want to die must fight!
011	My clan was slaughtered in an invasion! The way I see it, this too, is an invasion. You must fight back!
012	You were an invader! I haven't forgotten! You killed Asena and my father!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
013	But right now...you're one of us—a human standing against nature for the sake of Saga. That's why I wanted to understand you, even a little.
014	A fellow human, huh? Perhaps that may be true, but unlike you, I fight for myself. Out of my way, Wind Shaman!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
015	No! You shall not have this!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
016	Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
017	Wind Shaman, what are you doing?! Return Beelzebub to me!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0027
018	You took something precious from me. Now I've returned the favor. That's all this is.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
019	If you die here, I'll never be able to avenge Father. So...don't you dare die until I can get my vengeance!
020	Tina, get back!!!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
021	...!
022	Hyaaaaaahhhhh!!!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0007
023	Georgios?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
