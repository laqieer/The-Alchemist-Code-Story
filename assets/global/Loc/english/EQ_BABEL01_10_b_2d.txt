001	Ha! You've improved since the last time we did this, Victor!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0046
002	I know, right?! I feel like I'm finally catching up to you, Captain! I'll show you that I can even surpass you!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
003	Victor, who do you even think you're talking to? That's Captain Vettel, not some random guy on the street, holding a sword! He's just being nice!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0010
004	Wanna try your sword against me? I promise that I won't be nice at all! I mean, it's okay if I murder you a little, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
005	...Victor, don't. You saw how I could barely hold my own against him earlier, didn't you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
006	Yep! I saw that! I'll be just fine without trying it! Sorry! I will never overstep my bounds ever again! I will never say anything ever again!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
007	Oh no! Ah... I'm so sorry...	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
008	Nina, you're so strong for someone your age! Your future holds a lot of promise...and your idea for the dress uniforms was wonderful, as well! I can't wait to see them!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
009	Thank you! I'll show you that I can be just as good as Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0033
010	So... I don't want to overstay my welcome. I'm gonna bounce. See ya, Vettel.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
011	Ren... Where will you go?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
012	Eh... I kinda got that Gerald guy on my mind. Kinda thought I'd go where he'd want me to.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
013	What do you mean by that?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
014	Well... Now that you're integrating therians into the Scarlet Flame Guard, it gets me thinking... How might Wratharis react to this? What are they going to do next?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
015	All that typical info you can get by sneaking around and torturing people here and there.
016	Don't worry, I'll be back to get my fill of fun from you all again. Bye!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
017	He's gone...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
018	Gerald...had quite an impact on him.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
019	Yeah... Who would've thought?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
020	Hm? What's that? Hey, Nina!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
021	Huh? Oh!!!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
022	The therians are...helping with the town's reconstruction?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
023	Even the village chief?! This is...amazing. The future that I dreamed of... It seems like it's coming into reach!	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
024	Let's go help as well. We'd better get started if we want to contribute enough to make up for Gerald's absence!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
025	Okay!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
026	Scarlet Flame Guard! Listen up! We hit a rough patch, but we must move forward. From here on out, we have a new mission! We will build a path for the humans and therians to live side-by-side!
027	We will not forget our fallen comrade, Gerald! We shall honor his iron will and become the sun that protects the people of Envylia!
028	Here and now, we swear again! We will defend the setting Scarlet!
029	We will hold in our hearts the Flames to manifest our iron will!
030	We are the wielders of the Scarlet Flame!
031	We swear that our iron will shall stand indomitable in the face of hardship, in order to ensure the joy and laughter of the people!
