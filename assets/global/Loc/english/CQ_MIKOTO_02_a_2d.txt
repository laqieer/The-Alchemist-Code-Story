001	It looks like we were able to chase away all the beasts! What a relief! Thank you for helping, Mikoto!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0023
002	I'm the one who should be thanking you. I've never done anything like this before...heheh. Today, I'm experiencing a lot of firsts.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0033
003	But that's strange. The bad feeling within the grounds still hasn't dissipated. I wonder if something happened to the barrier.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0031
004	It smells like something big is going on! Hey, Mikoto, you and I, let's solve this puzzle together.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0045
005	Just you and me...? But I can't leave this place...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
006	What?! Why can't you leave here?!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0025
007	I've been told by everyone in this shrine that if I leave this place something bad will happen. Huh? What do you mean, Gods?	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
008	Um. The Gods are telling me to step outside the shrine. They're saying that as long as I remain within the grounds it's okay.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0039
009	So they gave you their permission? Eheheh. All right then. We're the Tama-Miko expedition. Let's go!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0006
010	Th-the Tama-Miko expedition?!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0011
011	I-I'm outside the shrine...and without even asking for permission. I've been outside a few times, but this is the first time I've snuck out.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
012	Wasn't today one of experiencing a lot of firsts? In that case, let's do a lot of things for the first time!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0007
013	Heheh. You're right. When I'm with you, Tamamo, for some reason I feel like I can do everything!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0007
014	You can do everything! You can go to lots of different places with me...for example, a festival!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0037
015	A festival? You're talking about a ritual, right?	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
016	Not something so rigid and formal. The grounds here are filled with shops selling delicious things to eat! It's a lot of fun!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0040
017	I didn't know there were festivals like that! The festivals that I know about are also a lot of fun, and you can talk with a lot of interesting people. Hehe.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0045
018	Talking is fun! But outside of the grounds is filled with a lot more fun!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0038
019	More fun...outside the grounds... But I...huh? So-someone is coming from that direction. We need to hide.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0031
020	It's hard to believe that beasts would emerge here! We must quickly determine the reason behind the barrier's instability!	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0042
021	According to the report, the village has also suffered damage. It looks like we'll have to ask the Shrine Maiden Mikoto for her help.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0042
022	That should be our last resort. We cannot have her shoulder the burden of everything.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0039
023	You're right. She is so kind and generous, and...huh?! I hear the voice of beasts coming from that direction! Let's go!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
024	Phew. It looks like they're gone. What's the matter, Mikoto?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0021
025	I wonder if everyone is safe in the village...my father...my mother... Tamamo, we need to quickly solve this incident!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
026	Yes, you're right. I wouldn't want anyone to suffer! Hm? What's that?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0004
027	That? Oh, that's the barrier around the shrine. Hey, the barrier's seal has been damaged! It's almost as if it were bitten by something...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_chara_1010
028	Does it look like damage inflicted by a fang like this...?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0002
029	Huh? Yes, exactly...eeek! A pack of wolves?! They must be the cause!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
030	I guess we'll have to send these guys back where they came from!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0024
031	Ye-yes!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_battle_0019
