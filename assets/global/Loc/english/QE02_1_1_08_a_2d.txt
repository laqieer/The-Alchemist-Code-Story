001	Where are you going, aye? You're not gonna save Fiona?!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0025
002	The little lady isn't at the Beckrams' mansion. No point in sneaking in.
003	Where is Fiona, aye?!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0013
004	That's what we're going to find out. Wait...is it just me or is the air around here exceptionally bad?
005	Aye, this is one of their leading factories. This, right here, is a huge plant that runs on a steam engine.
006	You've got smoke and fire blowing out of that chimney. No wonder everyone's wearing masks.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
007	Actually, it's pretty cold. Another side effect?
008	Aye, the pollution surrounding this area is terrible. The black clouds prevent the sunlight from shining through.
009	Jeez. It's pretty serious. By the way, what're those small things I keep seeing?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
010	They're diligently move about carrying materials. Are they Alkaroids too?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
011	Those are Demons, aye.
012	Demons? Are you talking about Demons created from ancient Alchemy? Well, well. What adorable little weapons of destruction.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
013	It's true, aye! Alvarez found them from somewhere!
014	The Beckrams spread them and they now assist the lives of the people here. Their existence has become a threat to us, aye!
015	Alvarez? That sounds really shady. Why isn't the Holy Guard doing anything about it?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
016	Demons can't be activated outside of their country, aye. That's why even we Alkemonos are stronger than them.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0014
017	Guess they're leaving them be as long as they're working inside Slothstein.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0045
018	I don't know how, but there's a high possibility the Beckrams are using Alchemy.
019	The Demons do dangerous work that humans can't.
020	That's why the Demons and Alkaroids have become popular, aye.
021	But, because of that, there's been a lack of jobs for people.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0015
022	I guess you can call it the price of convenience. How ironic.
023	Anyway, we should focus on finding where Fiona is. Is there a bar around here?
024	You're going to drink during this crisis, aye? Unbelievable!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_favorite_0016
025	It's to gain information. News accumulates in bars. It's been that way since the old days.
