001	"That which lies hidden in my blade, turn all impurity before me to ash!"	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
002	"O time! Infinite shall be your being!" Let's add to the festivities and shake up Space-Time!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0032
003	Wow! Mira and Waginau are amazing! They're using techniques I've never seen the likes of before!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0024
004	Hmm? Pretty neat, huh? This is the power of Space-Time Manipulation!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
005	Don't let your guard down! They're still coming!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
006	Ugh, there are still more? I'm running out of gas!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
007	That's enough. Both of you, fall back.
008	You have some kind of plan, I expect.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
009	Mira, hurry.
010	Huh? Oh, got it!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
011	(There is no more need for the usual casting. The door in my heart has already opened... Therefore—)
012	"O winds! From beyond the Gate of Gluttony, come!!"	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
013	Argh?!
014	Phew...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
015	That was...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
016	Huh? What just happened?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
017	That...wasn't the power of purification... The voices of all the spirits around us were tinted their own color...
018	Huh? The voices of the spirits?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
019	That is the power that Eulalia possesses. It seems likely that it may be magil, but essentially she is able to interpret the power inherent in all creation as voices.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
020	Does that mean that she has a strong reaction to magil? Whoa, I bet she'd be a super witch!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
021	But, um? Does that mean that you guys don't need me anymore?
022	It means that from now on we likely won't have to rely on you so much for matters of magil. I thought you would be more pleased about that, Mira.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
023	Hm... I feel kind of...complicated about it...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
024	Please explain, Nimul. That wasn't purification that you just performed.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
025	What you just saw was Alchemy. It is a technique I have been working on for a long time and I finally finished building its foundations.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
026	Alchemy is a technique which allows one to capture magil, the origin of everything in the universe, and manipulate it with their will.
027	If proficient enough in its use, even without powers of purification... Even without the protection of Sephiron, it should be possible to turn corruption into something else.
028	In other words, anyone who learns that technique can protect themselves from corruption?
043	I am not sure if we can rely on a result like what we just saw...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
044	Still, very precise control of magil is needed to perform this.
045	Even now, it is all too easy to completely lose control of it if my focus fails even a little.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
046	It must be simplified somehow. As of now, it is too difficult to use it when it is needed.
029	What I just did requires the preparation of a sufficient amount of magil.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
030	You've got big dreams, huh... I have a strange feeling like...this story wasn't the genre I thought it was.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
031	This will be how Alchemy develops. But for now, let's remove ourselves from this dangerous area.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
032	I wish to go and save Emmel immediately, but first I want to deliver these rations to those taking refuge in the desert...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
033	Nimul! Watch out!	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0029
034	What?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
035	Huh?!
036	Nimul!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
037	It's quite a shame. I thought I had you, but...
038	Nnngh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
039	No, it can't be... Why...	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0027
040	Just as I'd thought. Not enough experience. How frustrating... If only there had been more time...
041	Julia?! Why would you aim your weapon at Nimul?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0014
042	What a question. One kills their enemies, do they not? Is that not what the warriors of the Sephira do?
