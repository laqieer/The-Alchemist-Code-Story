001	Figs, humans. Pepper, mushrooms. Burdock, corpses.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
002	Burdock, corpses. Spring herbs, toadstools. Cucumber, winter melon.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
003	Count to one hundred, and get a demon!
004	It's time for the demon parade.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
005	The demons are attacking?!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0006
006	Yes. That's what the scouts reported. There's an army. Approximately one hundred demons.
007	I've never heard of demons forming an army before!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
008	A being that can reign over that many demons... Could it be?!
009	The Discarnate Power. I have no doubt in my mind.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
010	But how?! We gave it such grave wounds and yet it can already—?!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
011	There's no point discussing that now. We need to deal with the issue at hand. Where is Ugachi?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
012	Just a little late.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
013	Can I expect something worth the time you've taken with your tardiness?
014	We've got this, Commander Celis!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
015	All right then. We will lay down a defensive formation around this castle! No matter what, we will defend our castle!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
016	But dang, didn't think they'd come for us so soon.
017	Something's going on.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0016
018	I thought there was no point in dwelling on things you know nothing about?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
019	Hahaha, you've got me there. So then, what's our move?	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0007
020	First, we will march in full company out of the castle town. We need to avoid fighting within the populated areas.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0016
021	Third Squad will then set up a force field. That should prevent the average demon from entering the castle town.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
022	At the same time, other members of the Third Squad will evacuate the civilians. First Squad and Second Squad, excluding Ugachi and me, will be positioned outside of the force field to repel the demons.
023	What will you be doing, Commander Celis?
024	To account for the possibility that the Discarnate Power will not be hindered by the force field, I will stand by in front of the headquarters within the force field.
025	What?! That's too dangerous!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0025
026	I understand your perspective, but this is an emergency. If I have to make a decision—	VO_celis.celis_sys_0004
027	I will always choose the option that saves the most lives.
028	Understood!
029	Just leave it all to me.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
030	...
031	What about me? What should I do?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
032	I need you to follow Tanosuke's orders. There is a chance the Discarnate Power will come for you. Tanosuke, keep her safe.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
033	I'll do what I can.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
034	We cannot let them take our headquarters. This is where we either do or die.
035	Reporting! The demons' vanguard units are nearing the town!
036	Here they come. All units, listen to me! Now is the time to fulfill your duties!
037	There is no need to fear the demon rabble! We are foxes, bred to tear through their flesh! With your claws and fangs, vanquish the demons!
038	This is not a fight to exterminate demons, but a fight to defend Wadatsumi! Drive them back with all that you have!!!
