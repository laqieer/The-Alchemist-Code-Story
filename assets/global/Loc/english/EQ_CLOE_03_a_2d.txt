001	Is this true?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
002	Yes. I've since sent Nina to scout things out. There hasn't been any major commotion yet, but unease is spreading across the country.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
003	Ugh! What could the Wratharis army be planning?!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
004	Are the garrisoned troops on the border merely an attempt to rile us up, or are they a diversion for something bigger?
005	We're all still on edge after the Lion Monarch's Charge... We could very well be overthinking this.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
006	Still, there might be some meaning behind their presence, whether it be a provocation or a diversion.
007	Not knowing their true aim is rather ominous, isn't it?
008	There's not much to say at this point. Let's wait for Nina's report.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
009	Is she all right? Work has really piled up on her since she became vice-captain.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
010	You're looking pretty tired, too, Vettel.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0001
011	Yes, but with the Blue Flame Guard practically out of commission, we have to pick up the slack.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
012	It's hard, but we have to do all that we can for Envylia.
013	We're back! It doesn't look like they're moving.
014	We can't afford to start anything, but for the sake of our people's peace of mind, we can't just leave them be, either.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
015	I'm moving out. We will observe the Wratharis army, and keep them in check.
016	Should you really be the one to go? If something should happen elsewhere...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
017	That's right! What are we supposed to do if it was just a distraction?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
018	If my presence can help calm the tension, then I must go. Besides, you'll be fine without me. You have Nina here.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
019	If it turns out to be a distraction, then Vice-Captain Nina will take the lead. I know that can trust her to take care of things while I am gone.
020	Isn't that right, Nina?
021	O-of course!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0038
022	The rest is up to you. See you soon.
023	I'll do my best! Oof...
024	Hey! Are you okay?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0003
025	Eek!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
026	Quiet, Victor. You're going to scare her. Are you all right, Nina?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
027	S-sorry. I'm fine. I just got a little dizzy, that's all.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0036
028	Don't overdo it. Haven't you been pushing yourself too hard of late? All that work you've been doing on top of training...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0039
029	Your body is your most important asset. Don't destroy it by being reckless.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0004
030	You're wrong! If I collapse after this amount of work, that's just proof that my determination wasn't strong enough!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0020
031	I have to keep going! I have to try harder!
032	This stubbornness... You really are turning into him—which means that it's pointless for me to argue with you. Here, drink this.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
033	What is it?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
034	I told you, didn't I? I will do my part by healing your wounds, just as I used to do for Gerald.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
035	Not that you're injured, but here... He used to drink this a lot.
036	This drink restores stamina, you see. It should help you push on.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
037	Wow! Thank you!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0033
038	Heheh... I've continued to improve upon it, over and over and over again, and now the effects are simply outstanding! Heheheheheh.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
039	Is this what a mad scientist looks like?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
040	Report! An army other than the garrisoned Wratharis army appears to be marching on Envylia!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
041	According to our information, it appears to be a detached force from the Wratharis army! Awaiting your command!
042	Wh-what?!
043	Which direction are they approaching from?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
044	They're not coming from the west where Captain Vettel is! They're advancing through the Desert Zone to our northern border!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
045	There are a lot of therian villages out that way! They're going to get caught up in this if we don't hurry.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
046	So the stationed troops were a decoy!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
047	Those jerks! They're using our ongoing restoration as an opportunity to invade!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
048	Nina!
049	I understand. We're going to mobilize our remaining knights and move out!
050	Natalie, secure a supply route. Victor, ready the troops.	VO_neena.neena_battle_0015
051	Leave it to me!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
052	Sound judgment, and delivered so quickly... We're counting on you, Vice-Captain.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0005
053	Nina, what should I...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
054	I need you to stay here, Chloe. Please. For me.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
055	Stay...? Why?! I can fight!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0026
056	There's doubt in your sword arm right now. We can't afford to take someone with so much doubt along with us.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0031
057	That's not true!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
058	I've noticed, Chloe. As Vice-Captain, I watch everyone carefully.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0039
059	Respect none who wield the sword without heart. I think that you would have a hard time standing on the battlefield right now.
060	No, that's... That's not true! I have no doubts!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
061	If that's the case, then show me here and now!
062	N-Nina...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
063	Sorry for requesting this so suddenly, but I think it's something Sir Gerald would have done.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0036
064	If you are truly free of doubts, then as one who bears the scarlet flame, I want you to prove it to me.
065	If you can't do that, then you're staying here.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
066	In this state...you would just be putting yourself and everyone else in danger.
067	I-I...!
068	Fine! I'll show you!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0024
