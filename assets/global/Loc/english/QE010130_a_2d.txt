001	Agh. Who would've thought they'd take this route!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
002	We must do everything we can to prevent them from reaching Spandau Castle.
003	The Blue Flame Guard's advancement must be stopped!
004	I'm well aware of that; you don't have to tell me. I'll stop them!
005	Wait!!!
006	Stop, Dias! I won't let you go!
007	Logi?! You idiot...!
008	Why don't you stop father? He's even put Agatha at risk!
009	You're the idiot! I heard you drew your sword against dad! Why don't you believe him?!
010	How much longer are you going to be his puppet?!
011	What are you doing?! We must pursue Zeke and the Blue Flame Guard! Hurry!
012	Nope. That's not happening.
013	Sabareta!
014	We, the Lizard Brigade, are your opponents. You better prepare yourselves before attacking. If you underestimate us, we may teach you a lesson or two.
015	Argh! Attack!!!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0017
