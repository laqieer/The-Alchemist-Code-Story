001	Please...help. Um... I think...	VO_rena.rena_sys_0002
002	Surely you...
003	(I wake up only to find myself in unfamiliar surroundings. There are three little girls standing next to me.)
004	...Where am I? Why am I here?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
005	Huh...?
006	(Who are these girls?)
007	Hey...what's going on?! Am I dreaming...ouch! No, it's not a dream!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
008	What...happened? Where...am I?
009	Hey, you over there! Do you know where we are?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0001
010	Oh, sorry! I'm Sakura. What's your name?
011	I'm <p_name>. Yeah...where are we?
012	I guess you don't know either. Anyway, nice to meet you, <p_name>!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
013	Hey! What about you two over there?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0001
014	I'm Tyrfing.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0004
015	I'm Chloe, Captain of the Crown's Guard that serves within Envylia's Blue Flame Guard.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
016	Crown...Guard...Env...? Um, Chloe and Tyr...do you mind if I just call you Tyr?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
017	I don't. Sakura, Chloe, and <p_name>.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0037
018	The problem seems to be that none of us knows where we are right now.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
019	So...I'm guessing none of you know...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0031
020	...how to get back, do you?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0022
021	Hey, didn't something just move over there?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
022	I saw it too! Let's peruse it! Everyone, follow me—	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
023	Wait! You rogue!	VO_sakura.sakura_battle_0001
024	Sakura! It's dangerous to go on your own!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
025	We have you cornered! You'd better come quietly!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0009
026	Is that...a girl? It doesn't seem like she's the enemy.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0031
027	I'm Chloe. I'm a knight of Envylia. Please don't worry. You're safe now.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
028	We have no intention of harming you. Would it possible for you to tell us what happened?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
029	You're not gonna hurt me?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0029
030	Sorry for chasing you just now. Did you also unexpectedly find yourself here?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0035
031	We want you to tell us what happened. Can you come out of there?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0001
032	Okay. As long as you don't hurt me, but...can you step a little back?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0037
033	Who are you people? What are you doing here?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0002
034	Oh... I guess you're in the same boat as us. I'm Sakura! Nice to meet you!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
035	I'm Rena...
036	I'm Tyrfing. Rena, do you know where we are?
037	...I don't.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0030
038	Rena is lost here as well. She seems to be alone.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0044
039	I'm Chloe. Rena, would you like to join us?
040	I'm not lost. But I don't know where here is. After all, here is here.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0012
041	Hmm... What's that supposed to mean?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
042	You all want to go back to your own world, right? I think I know how you can do that.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0002
043	Really? How...?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
044	But I don't know right now. My memory is foggy, and...I can't seem to remember properly.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0031
045	What's that supposed to mean? Try to remember! Please!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0014
046	I...want to. If only there was something that would trigger my memory.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0035
047	Oh, that's right...the doors.	VO_rena.rena_battle_0022
048	The doors? Are there doors here somewhere?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
049	Look. They're right there.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0006
050	Oh, it's Zipangu!
051	There's Ragna...	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
052	And Babel too.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
053	I feel like the key for me to my memory lies beyond these doors.
054	What do you mean "feel like"...?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0030
055	Well, which should we go through? I wanna go to Zipangu.
056	I'm not sure...which door will lead us.	VO_rena.rena_sys_0031
057	I see. Rena doesn't say much, but her words hold weight.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0020
058	I think it might be worth going.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
059	If we don't know which door will open, let's all go together! ...Um, which door should we touch?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0001
060	Good idea. Don't worry. I will protect you all on my honor.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
061	Well, I'm a kunoichi, so I can at least protect myself. Let's do this!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0014
062	Well then...one, two, three!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0004
063	Did we arrive already? So which world is this?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0025
064	Hmm. From the look of it...it's not Zipangu.	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0031
065	I can't see Yggdrasil. It doesn't look like this is Ragna.	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0031
066	I can see the Tower of Babel! It seems like this is...Babel.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0009
067	Aww, man. So it's not Zipangu. Oh well...	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0044
068	Huh? What's this black stuff? Mist? Is this world's mist black?	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0020
069	No, it shouldn't be. What's going on?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
070	Black...mist?	VO_rena.rena_sys_0025
071	Step back! Don't touch it!	VO_rena.rena_sys_0042
072	Huh? Why?	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0025
073	What's that sound?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
074	A monster assault...?!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0043
075	Hwahhhhhh!
076	Oh! Someone is fighting over there!
077	That's...!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0027
078	Let's go!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
079	Hyaahhhh!	VO_shekina.shekina_battle_0001
080	Groooowl!
081	Ack. They don't stop coming! What is with these monsters?!	VO_shekina.shekina_battle_0019
082	Whoa! Some fancy lady is fighting!
083	Shekinah!
084	Tyrfing? What are you doing here?	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0025
085	Be careful... There's more coming!
086	Growwwwl!
087	Shekinah! Let's talk later!	VO_tyrufing.tyrufing_sys_0042
088	You're right! First, let's take out the monsters!	VO_shekina.shekina_sys_0004
089	I'll fight on my honor as an knight as well!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0038
090	All right! I'll display my power as a kunoichi!	VO_sakura.sakura_sys_0009
