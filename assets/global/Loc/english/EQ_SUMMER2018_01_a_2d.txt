001	Yay! The sea! Hey, Alma! Rebecca! Look! It's the sea!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
002	Ah, get a lungful of that salty, sea breeze!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
003	Liz, you are getting way too excited about this.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
004	Huh? Aren't you excited, Rebecca? You couldn't wait to get here!	VO_alma.alma_chara_1024
005	A-as if! I've come to the beach with my family more times than I can count.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_event_1005
006	Huh... You've been on tenterhooks ever since we found out about the Seaside Class, but you just can't be honest about that, can you?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
007	Wha—?! D-don't act like you're any different! You even practiced swimming in preparation for today!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
008	W-well, I was looking forward to it! But then I lost too much fat on my diet, and now I can't float anymore.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
009	I'm not good at swimming to begin with, and just when I was starting to get the hang of it... I should have known that stupid diet would backfire.
010	I-I'll teach you how to swim, if it comes to that.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
011	Hey, come on, you two! Hurry up and get in the water already!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
012	Oh, Liz... Wait, when did she inflate the floaties and the beach ball? That was fast!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
013	Liz isn't the only one getting excited. The other girls are getting into it, too!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
014	We don't get the chance to go to the beach much in Lustburg, so come on, let's—!
015	Girls! What are you frolicking about for?! The Seaside Class is not a vacation!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
016	What?! It isn't?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
017	Of course not! The Seaside Class is simply an extension of your regular lessons!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
018	Now, let us begin our exercise for today and practice vanquishing monsters!
019	What?!
020	No way! That's what we always do!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
021	That's right! I agree with Liz!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
022	It is by proving that you are capable of exercising your powers in an unfamiliar environment that you will come to be recognized as a first rate witch. This is a traditional extracurricular activity of the Venus School of Magic.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
023	I mean, that's probably true, but...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
024	The team that scores the lowest will have one item removed from their barbecue dinner tonight! Am I clear?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
025	Whaaaaat?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
026	Haaaa... I thought this might happen.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
027	You knew about this, Alma?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
028	Kinda.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
029	I've heard that monsters used to appear here a lot—especially in the summer. At one point, tourists stopped coming here altogether.
030	Someone from the school had their eye on this place, and offered to clear out the monsters in exchange for being able to reserve the whole beach for cheap.
031	By calling it an "extracurricular activity," she can make the students work extra hard. Our Headmistress sure is a crafty one.
032	What?! I can't believe that they arranged this Seaside Class for such a stupid reason as that!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
033	I thought we'd be able to relax today, so I brought my own parasol and everything!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
034	Well...Liz looks like she's into it, at least.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
035	N-no way! I can't believe she'd deprive us of food! Alma! Rebecca! What should we do?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
036	What should we do? Liz, she's only going to take one item of food. You can't really call that depriving us.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
037	You're one to talk. You were so excited about a barbecue dinner that you marked that page of the guidebook with a sticky note.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
038	H-hey! You should know it's terrible manners to look at people's things without their permission!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0003
039	It's my first time ever having a barbecue with my friends! I don't want to miss out on a single piece!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0017
040	Oh, Liz...
041	Friendship and gluttony... What a wonderful combination.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0044
042	This barbecue will be something that I remember for the rest of my life! I can't let even a single piece slip through my clutches! So we have to win, no matter what...but...
043	Everyone looks so fired up!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
044	Well, everybody wants to enjoy all the fresh seafood. At this rate, we might end up in last place.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
045	Nnnngghhh... Not my precious barbecue!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
046	...
047	Come on! Don't make that face! No team that I am a part of could ever finish last!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_chara_1011
048	Let's do this!
049	All right!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
050	I'll never get sick of watching those two.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
051	Having said that...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
052	Gwwwaaaaarrrrrggghhhhh!
053	Unnngghhh... It's too hot. I'm not at my best. How come the monsters have so much energy?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
054	I'm sure that any monsters inhabiting this area have built up some resistance to heat.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
055	My brain's gonna overheat!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_2007
056	Whereas, we were born and raised in the wintry land of Lustburg. This might be more difficult than we thought.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
057	All we can do is our best. I'm not sure Liz will recover if we lose.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0030
058	We must use our heads. Yes... Let's aim for the monsters closest to the sea! They seem to gather there in number, and we can cut off their escape route!
059	Um, Rebecca? Like I said before, I can't float right now, so the shore is kinda dangerous for me.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
060	Ah! Over there!
061	Let's take down the monsters by the beach! Quickly!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0001
062	I'm not letting you take away my food!	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0004
063	Oh dear, this isn't going well.	VO_alma.alma_event_1009
064	Not going well?! It's going terribly! We're headed straight for last place!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
065	L-last place?! No way! Not my precious seafood! All right, now that it's come to this...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
066	Please! I need some beach bodies! Someone, anyone! Help us! Lend us your strength!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0041
067	Huh. They're not really what I expected. I mean, they're wearing swimsuits, but...	VO_alma.alma_chara_1024
068	I know what you mean. I thought someone more, er, mermaid-like would appear.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
069	I'm not sure if there are any mermaid-like Phantoms.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
070	W-well! You never know! They might be super great swimmers! Right, guys?! We need your help taking down the—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
071	No.	VO_dorothea.dorothea_sys_0040
072	Thanks! I'm counting on—wait, what?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0018
073	Hmmm... Sorry, I don't really feel like getting wet right now.	VO_aisya.aisya_chara_1008
074	I would prefer to avoid strenuous exercise in this heat. I may be a Phantom, but my body was never particularly strong to begin with, you see.	VO_reidow.reidow_sys_0002
075	Th-they're not gonna help us! What should we do?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
076	You're asking me? You're the one who summoned them!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
077	I can't believe it! I've never been turned down like this before.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
078	It is a bit strange. You said that you wanted someone who is good at swimming to lend us their strength. Since this lot showed up, I would've thought they'd be happy to help us.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
079	Th-that's right! Why did you come here, anyway?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
080	Is it even possible for Phantoms to disobey the person who summoned them?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
081	Grrrraaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!
082	Eeeeeek! A monster! It's coming this way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
083	It looks like our plan to trap them up against the sea got turned around on us! Let's show them who's boss!	VO_alma.alma_event_1009
