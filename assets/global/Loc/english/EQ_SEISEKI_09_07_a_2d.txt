001	Ug-ughh...! Aghh...!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
002	Kanooon...!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
003	My...leg!!! My...arm...!!! Eeeeeekk!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0027
004	N-no...! I can't even sense the bombardment... How is that possible?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
005	I can't sense the bullets? I can't even hear the onslaught, let alone the vibration of it buzzing through the air?!
006	No...! This is all wrong!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
007	Wha-wahh! Whaaa!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
008	Uck! Kanon, pull yourself together!
009	Ugh...! Se...Seida...I can't do this...anymore! I can't stand...or hold my...sword...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
010	No...! We're hallucinating!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
011	Ha...lucinating...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
012	Yes! ...No, Kanon! Pull yourself together!
013	If you lose spirit, it'll really be over!!!
014	Ugh! B-but...it hurts so bad...! Aghh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
015	Kanon!
016	Huff...huff...I...I...ca...can't...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
017	No! Your mind is taking over your body! At this rate, your life really is in danger!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
018	No...it's not just Kanon. Soon a large number of the soldiers will lose consciousness. There's no time!
019	In order to remedy this situation, I need to attack the conjurer and stop this hallucination!
020	But...amongst these thousands of enemy soldiers, how am I supposed to find...
021	Agh...!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
022	Kanon...!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
023	No...calm down...it's going to be okay. You're just hallucinating. I'm going to find the conjurer.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0028
024	This violent flaming wind...and the constant hail of bullets...is all intended to distract me from thinking clearly.
025	I cannot give in. I need to hold on to my mental strength.
026	Ugh!!! Oh...my leg! M-my leg!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0019
027	Se...Seida...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
028	...Gulp!
029	N-no...this is all a hallucination! You can't stop thinking! If you let it mislead you...it'll all be over!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
030	Huff...huff...haa!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	Kanon...I promise to protect you...even if I have to do it on my own. I'll protect everyone...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
032	We survived just now. If we'd been trying to make it on our own, we would've been dragged into the bottom of the valley by now.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
033	I told you before. As knights, protecting each other is a given.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
034	...!
035	Besides...thanks to that, I've gotten much closer to the 4th Regiment. Um...how do you say...? You did well.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0011
036	...! That's rare for you to give me such an honest compliment, isn't it?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
037	Do-don't misunderstand me! It's not that I'm admitting you were right. I'm just exchanging niceties. That's basic chivalry.
038	Honestly...you're such a stubborn person.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
039	What did you say?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
040	It's a joke. I was the one who was stubborn. I'm the one that should thank you.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
041	At that time...I was truly happy to have been accepted.
042	Because of those words from the captain, I was able to believe in myself.
043	Yes...I need to have confidence in myself! Captain Monzein accepted me as a knight!
044	I have it in me to find the conjurer at all costs!
045	Ack...! For one second...if only the wind would stop for one second!
046	?! Projectiles, too?! Ack...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
047	It doesn't work! ...Ack! You've gotta be kidding me!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
048	I cannot die without helping my friends!
049	I can't afford to go out like this!!!
050	Lightning...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
051	Cap...tain?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
052	The wind stopped! ...Ack!
053	Where?! Where are you...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
054	...!
055	There! I found you!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
056	...!
057	Blaster Shot!!!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
058	?! ...Agh!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0027
059	Ugh! Im-impossible...at this distance?!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0022
060	He was always lecturing me, but...when it comes to this, I've gotta thank him.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0016
061	What...?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0029
062	No... I finally found you. You're one of the Templars, aren't you?
063	Very impressive, Captain Seida. I am one of the Veda Templars...Füry, the Gatling Curse...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_battle_0019
064	I'm here to take Northern Pride.
065	...!
