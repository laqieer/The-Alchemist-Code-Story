001	Ugh! Wh-what do you think you're doing? Hurry up and kill him!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
002	B-but...
003	Haaaaaah!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0032
004	Graaahh!
005	Is that all you've got? You all seem to have lost your edge!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
006	There's no way any of you will ever succeed in executing the leader of the Desert Wings if that's the best you can do.
007	Ack!
008	Inciting betrayal of our creed is a rather serious offense, Dahab. You will need to answer for it.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
009	I'm impressed, Najam. I had no idea you were quite so devoted to our doctrines.
010	...
011	But I do what I do for the sake of the order. I'm not like you; I will not dogmatically follow our creed into a hopeless future.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
012	I won't either. The creed isn't the issue here.
013	What?
014	The only thing I care about is Zalam Gaim...my home!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
015	Strict adherence to that creed is what makes us stand apart from any old gang of ne'er-do-wells. It's the one thing that's made us so strong all this time.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
016	So like it or not, if I'm to prevent the fall of Zalam Gaim, then I'm going to make sure that creed is honored!
017	Our home... You're fighting for our home?
018	Focus, you fool! She's just trying to confuse you!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
019	B-but, Lord Dahab—
020	Now is not the time to worry about following rules! I understand the Great Leader's illness has sparked great uncertainty, but that's why you need to listen to me!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
021	It's time we carve a new future for ourselves! We will pursue the profit we need to maintain our order. Now come! Take the first step toward a better tomorrow! Kill the mark!
022	Oh, that's rich. Do you think anyone will honestly believe that you're doing this for the order, and not for yourself?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
023	H-how dare—!
024	An astute member of my guild discovered that you've been getting rather cozy with several Wratharis noblemen.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0037
025	Seems ending my life isn't just set to pay the bills, but also score you some renewed noble status of your own.
026	So if anyone gets the how-dare treatment, I'm thinking it's gonna be you. You're willing to sell yourself out—and bring Zalam Gaim down with you—in order to get what you want.
027	Urk...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
028	Dahab. Is this true? Are you merely using the trust and honor of Zalam Gaim for your own selfish ends?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
029	I see now why you'd regard our creed as a hindrance.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
030	Lord Dahab? Have you been deceiving us this whole time?
031	Deceiving you?! Of course not! If something should happen to the order, you'd all be in dire straits. I'm merely looking out for you!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
032	You're but pitiful orphans who know nothing of the world but death, and have sold your souls to a baseless creed in its name. You have nowhere else to go, so I'm leading you into a new era!
033	You ought to be thankful that someone like me would even give you miserable street rats the time of day.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
034	...!
035	You're right about one thing, Dahab. We have nowhere else to go.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
036	We're all abandoned. We're all orphans. We've escaped domination, exploitation, and even death only through the good graces of the order, and have ended countless lives in its name.
037	The only alternative we had to dying in the streets was bloodying our hands in unquestioned servitude to our creed.
038	...
039	This is the only place for us. One day, we will all face retribution. One day, we will succumb to death ourselves, and know first-hand the judgment we've dealt upon so many others.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
040	But for now, this is our home, and our livelihood...so Zalam Gaim must stay strong. It must survive.
041	And if we need to follow a "twisted doctrine" to ensure our survival, then so be it.
042	Eek! N-Najam! I'm sorry! I was wrong, okay? P-please—!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
043	The only equality in life is death. It is eternal and absolute. We must never forget that.
044	As a member of Zalam Gaim, you must submit yourself to these stringent doctrines, which include a respect for and acceptance of the sanctity and immutability of death.
045	If you choose to accept our creed, you must also accept the reckoning of death when it inevitably comes for you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
046	Master Ryle, will you get up already?! It's time for work!	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0003
047	Mrrrng... Just another few minutes. I have a condition. If I don't nap, I can't move. And I've done a looooot of moving already this week.
048	Well, there are stacks of documents that have been on your desk since last week! What's your excuse there?	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0030
049	I seem to recall you promising to have them finished by today, unless my memory deceives me.
050	...Fiiiiine.
051	I do understand your desire to sleep, though. We finally have a moment of peace! An actual end in sight to all the work we've had to do, with no further assassination attempts on the horizon.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0031
052	Warding off the Najam of Zalam Gaim seems to have worked like a charm.
053	Mmm, I don't know about that.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
054	Another assassin could show up before you know it, and they might be even more of a pain to deal with.
055	Guess that would at least be a chance to see some more action, though.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
056	Hmm. You might be right! I should make some preparations, just to be safe. You never can be too careful, after all.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0007
057	Ghanav! I've got a treat for you!
058	Heh, slow down, now. Nobody's going to take it!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0008
059	You've learned how to fly, but you still stick right by my side, huh? Probably a poor decision on your part.
060	Lady Najam, I have the next mission assignment for you.
061	Thank you.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
062	Um, err...
063	What's the matter?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0004
064	This client said that they wanted the job done quickly, like with Dahab.
065	In accordance with our creed, I refused this request. The client was, shall we say, not pleased.
066	I see. Well, there's no need to worry about that. You made the right decision.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
067	We must honor the order in which our assignments are received. There are to be no exceptions to this founding tenet of Zalam Gaim.
068	It pleases me to hear that. Thank you.
069	There's the Lady Najam I know!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
070	We all have things we can learn from you. You truly are a star.
071	Star... It still feels a bit off-putting to be called that.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
072	None of that matters, though. I'll be a star if that's what I have to be to protect our home.
073	That sounds perfect, Lady Najam!
074	You finished up, Ghanav? It's about time we get moving.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0005
075	The star of Zalam Gaim's got some twinkling to do tonight.
