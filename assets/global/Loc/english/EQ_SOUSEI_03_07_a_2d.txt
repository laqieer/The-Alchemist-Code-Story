001	There are too many of them!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
002	And that's not all! The corruption is growing stronger!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
003	No... Belphegor...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
004	Bingo! This magil that I'm sensing is the same as with Asmodeus—the magil of a Cursed Beast!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0005
005	If this continues, we'll be enveloped in Belphegor's domain!	VO_nix.nix_sys_0018
006	Before you get any ideas, I have to tell you that we can't transport this many people above! Our limit is two!
007	Then we have no choice but to run!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
008	You've got to be kidding me!
009	I guess this is it for now.
010	Icona!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
011	I've still got a lot to prepare, so it's not the best time for a run-in with a Cursed Beast.
012	I'll be taking my leave!
013	Nimul, we have to go as well!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_chara_1006
014	Right! We have to cut through the crowds of Fallen and get to the exit! Everyone, make haste!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
