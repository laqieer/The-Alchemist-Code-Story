001	H-how's this?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
002	It's...!
003	It's actually really good.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
004	You mean it?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
005	Really?! No way! Let me try some!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
006	Umgf! Mmff... Umgf... Whoa!
007	This is good! Really, really good!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0046
008	Hey! Save some for me! Umgf! Mmff... Umgf... Hrmpf!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
009	Mm-mmm! This is great!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0009
010	I finally did it...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0011
011	What's going on here?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
012	L-Lord Zahar!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
013	You've been gone for quite a while.
014	Don't worry, I didn't forget you. I come bearing gifts.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
015	What's that you're making, Spica? Have you been cooking?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
016	Not... exactly.
017	Hm...
018	Did you make this, Spica?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
019	Y-yes, my lord.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
020	Mind if I try some? It's been a long day, and I'm hungry.
021	P-please do!
022	...
023	Lord Zahar—	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
024	I never expected to find Spica cooking—but I suppose this, too, is a form of change.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
025	Is it a bad thing?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
026	There's no need to consider that right now.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
027	Spica is finally ready to carry our will into the new world.
028	Good, or bad—that is not for us to determine. Everything will be decided under the new order.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
029	As you say.
030	Nonetheless, this is good progress. Oh, and Corvus?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
031	Yes?
032	You've done well in my absence. I trust I can count on you again if a similar situation arises in the future?
033	Of course, my lord.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
034	Lord Zahar? The preparations—	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
035	Right.
036	Are you happy with your decision to leave Corvus in charge of the Shadow Messiah?
037	I am. He did very well.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
038	Truly? I'm glad to hear it.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
039	As members of the Shadow Messiah, Corvus and Spica will be the ones to guide us into the new world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
040	Yes, well—as I was saying, the preparations are complete. You'd better eat up before your darling prodigy's cooking gets cold.
041	Right.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0005
042	I'm starving.
043	Eep!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0016
044	There's nothing to worry about, Spica! You trained so hard for this!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0006
045	I-I know, but... I can't help feeling nervous.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0037
046	Hm...
047	How is it?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0002
048	It's delicious.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
049	R-really?! I'm so glad to hear that!	VO_spica.spica_event_1005
050	Spica.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
051	Yes, my lord?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
052	I look forward to trying more of your cooking.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
053	Thank you! I won't let you down!	VO_spica.spica_event_1005
054	Phew...	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
055	Huh? Why were you all tensed up, Corvus?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
056	I wasn't—
057	I mean... It's only natural for a teacher to be concerned about the results of his pupils' training, isn't it?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
058	Oh. Uh... I guess?
059	Psst! Isn't Corvus acting kind of weird?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
060	Yeah! Something's definitely up with him.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
061	By the way, Lord Zahar...
062	Isn't it about time you told us where you went and what you were doing?
063	Take a look at this.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
064	Isn't this... that stone we found in the Holy Order facility?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
065	There's something... not quite right about it.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
066	This is an Obsidian Star. It's a mutated variant of Sephirium.
067	Sephirium?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
068	Huh? What's that?	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
069	It's a legendary ore—well, actually, it would be more accurate to call it resin. In other words, hardened sap—and taken from the great tree, Sephiron, no less.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
070	It's supposed to be harder than any metal smelted from common ore.
071	While Obsidian Stars aren't as hard as pure Sephirium, they're the next best thing.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
072	I used these Obsidian Stars to forge each of us a unique suit of armor of the highest quality.
073	A-armor?
074	With this done, we will have in our hands one of the immense powers that will enable us to annihilate the Holy Guard.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
075	Go on. Take them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
076	Thank you, my lord!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0004
077	Huh?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
078	Wh-what's going on?!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0025
079	Lord Zahar! What is the meaning of—?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
080	This is corruption.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
081	Corruption?! Ugh! It's all over me! Get it off!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
082	You must endure! Swallow the corruption before it swallows you! Claim our greatest weapon, the Final Battle Armaments, for your own!
083	You want us to... take in the corruption?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0006
084	Yes! You must! Show me the strength of your wills!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
085	I-I...!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
086	Overcome it! Overcome yourselves!
