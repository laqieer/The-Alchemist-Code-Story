001	It's been a while since the three of us have met together in person...Tehre, Fuu. What's with the serious faces? Come now. We're here to talk about Saga's future.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0009
002	...I'm well aware of that.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
003	There's something I must speak to you about...no...not just to you, but to all the people of Saga. It is the truth about Alia's death!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0020
004	Right then. Let us commence the Sprite Trio Discourse, beginning with this matter!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
005	Wow...look at all these people! When everyone gathers together like this, you realize just how many people there are living in Saga.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0009
006	It's pretty much a country after all.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
007	It's difficult to realize when we're divided into tribes, but...this kind of gathering really wakes you up to the fact!
008	Yes. It is our job to protect the future of these people.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
009	Everyone is listening intently to the Sprite Trio speak...but, they're talking all the way from the distant Wind Temple... How can we hear their voices so well?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0044
010	The Wind Temple is said to be the place where wind from across the world gathers.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
011	Combining the location with the power of the wind, it shouldn't be much of task to create a magnifying effect.
012	Wow... Who knew there was such a way to use one's power?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0022
013	We still have a lot to learn. We have to discover exactly what it is that we must do. Tehre is right.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
014	Don't get so downhearted, Tina! It's all thanks to you two that the Sprite Trio Discourse became a reality!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_1048
015	Isn't that right, Mocca?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
016	...Yes. Lisbeth is right.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
017	We must gain more power...and find a way to restore the Wind Matter.
018	However, we managed to succeed in making the Sprite Trio Discourse happen. We should be proud of that, Tina.
019	Exactly! Look how attentively the people of Saga are listening to the discussion. I'm sure it'll work out well.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0037
020	...Yes, you're right!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
021	Well then, let's summarize the discourse.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
022	Going forward, we will move beyond factions, and allow all tribes to travel around as they please.
023	In order to rid ourselves of the Gluttony army...
024	The Tehre faction will break off ties with Gluttony and will work together with the Voda and Fuu factions to form a Saga coalition force.
025	Having reached a consensus regarding the aforementioned terms, all of Saga will unite against the crisis that we now face. Do you agree to this?
026	...I am not completely satisfied with what you've said, Fuu. However, it is in our best interest to work together. I accept.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
027	I don't expect to convince you right away. With time, I wish to slowly make you understand.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
028	People of Saga, it is as we have now proclaimed. Let all of Saga unite together and overcome this crisis!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0007
029	...Right. That's if we can overcome it at all.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0045
030	What do you mean, Tehre boy? Isn't that what we just talked about? The key lies in the restoration of the Wind Matter.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0025
031	All that's left is to find a path that will lead to its resurrection. Isn't that correct?
032	Correct indeed. I have already laid out a plan to achieve this. It relies on killing Asena.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
033	...?!
034	What...are you talking about?! How can you say that is the path to restoring the Wind Matter?!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0012
035	You'll see when the results come in. There is no deceit to what we have decided here at the Sprite Trio Discourse. Now is the time for all of Saga to unite...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
036	...And who of Saga do you suggest will carry out something so outrageous as the assassination of Asena? You're being absurd.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0013
037	You're right. Even I couldn't do something so outrageous... That's why I've left it in the hands of someone worthy of the task.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0045
038	Gluttony Foss' Georgios, the Flame-Armed General!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
039	Tina...Mocca!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
040	Argh! Who would've thought our premonition would take shape in the worst way possible?! So, the Sprite Trio Discourse was nothing more than a way to blindside us!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
041	In any case, we need to hurry to Asena! Before it's too late...! We can't allow this to happen!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
