001	Oh, look! Look! The ocean!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0024
002	Oh... This is my first time seeing it with my own eyes. It's so...blue. It's beautiful.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0046
003	But we don't have time to appreciate the view. Mei Fang, we must strike qui...?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
004	I heard from Vivi that you have come to embrace this more dangerous path. Such youthful foolishness. It's...cute.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0007
005	Still, stay calm. Roy and Riza have yet to give the signal. Rushing in will only result in failure.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0002
006	As a transmuted Phantom, I understand the urge for haste, but...	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0030
007	That's not for a Phantom like yourself to... Ugh... Ohhh. I just had something like a...dizzy spell...just now.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
008	What was that? Are you okay? Do you feel sick?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_battle_0022
009	No, I'm fine. Thank you, Alphonse. You're a sweet kid.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
010	I'm someone who stands in opposition to your home—to your world. Well...not just to yours, but to this one as well.
011	You should forget about me, and focus on getting yourselves home.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
012	General... Now you're just being small-minded.	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1004
013	Edgar? What are you talking about? Did I say something wrong again?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0025
014	You've now been all over this world and met so many different people... Weren't they all good people?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
015	Don't you see? Only the Holy Order stands in opposition to you. The rest of Babel stands with you. We're your people.
016	Ah, youth... Toritoh, do not forget that Vivi and I are also your allies.	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0044
017	Same here! And the rest of the gang from Amestris too! If you came to our world, Ed and I would welcome you with open arms!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0004
018	The ocean seems calm...but a whirlpool could appear and disrupt it at any moment. Emotions...are no different.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0022
019	Thank you, everyone—really. I always thought my soul existed for the purpose of being sacrificed, and then disappearing forever.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0034
020	It never occurred to me that there might be more to life than that. If I have people like you waiting for me, then there's still a reason to live, and to return home.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0010
021	Well, then. It looks like they're ready to go. I hope that homunculus, Greed, is ready for us!	VO_meifan.meifan_sys_0008
022	Go forth! Complete your mission! When you're finished, we shall be waiting for you.	VO_meifan.meifan_battle_1030
