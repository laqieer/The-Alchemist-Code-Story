001	Worst day ever...
002	Waking up in a pile of garbage, having food like garbage...
003	Clean, then take the trash out, but only to have to clean again...
004	Sleeping on a mountain of trash just makes you a piece of trash...
005	Fighting is necessary. Money isn't. Betrayal is more of a normal occurance than eating. It's just easier to be alone now.
006	That's my everyday life now. It's a terrible world to be in.
007	I wish I could trade places...
008	Othima would be my first choice.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
009	He's just a myth!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
010	The legendary Othima of Lost Blue, ascended the Mystic Tower Veda and returned to tell about it. Isn't that the story?
011	It's different now. Veda has more floors now so it's taller than before.
012	So, Othima wouldn't even be a record holder?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
013	It's just a legend, kid.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
014	Whatever. It doesn't matter if it is.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
015	If you think you have what it takes, you should come with me to climb the Tower Veda.
016	The hell's the point? Are you so bored here that you want to go hiking or something?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
017	Don't you know? At the top of the Tower Veda, you'll find...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
018	Ha! Now that's a legend of questionable credibility.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
019	You're wasting your time.
020	Well, someone who did climb the tower is top dog right now.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
021	And who would that be?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
022	Uh, what was his name?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
023	Don't tell me you can't remember.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
024	He was always so far ahead, I could never keep up.
025	I think his name was...Vanilla? No, wait... Varney?
026	You would do well to remember.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0002
027	My name is Vanir.
028	You will soon be burned to ash. I don't need to remember your name.
029	How cold-hearted of you.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
030	Though you may surpass me in skill with the blade...
031	I am the Flame Dragon King. None have surpassed me when it comes to the vanquishing of evil.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
032	Then know this, hero—	VO_eins.eins_sys_0001
033	How many pointless things do you expect me to remember?
034	The first only. The second is the natural order of this world.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0039
035	There is always some form of reprisal.
036	Just as the hunter will come for the beast, the commandments will come forth to reform the world wherever vengeance is called for.
037	Especially if an evildoer is allowed to go free.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0007
038	I said I will vanquish you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0013
039	I'm actually quite used to losing.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
040	...Excuse me?
