001	It's getting cold. Are you okay? You must be hungry. Here, eat this.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
002	It's good chocolate.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
003	...Thank you.
004	(I thought I would be able to meet up with the ladies...but it seems like it'll be difficult.)	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
005	This is so delicious! Can I take half home? I want my sister to eat some too...
006	Yes, of course! How about we rest a little...huh?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0037
007	Aah, monsters!
008	Oh no... We're surrounded! Don't get separated from me!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
009	Oooh! It's Santa!
010	What?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
011	Hohoho! Are you okay?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
012	Santa! I have a request! I want my sister to...!
013	Okay, calm down, son. Tell me slowly.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0045
014	Mich...?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
015	Lofia...shhh!
016	............
017	There's no way I would miss the house of a child who's been behaving. Don't worry now. Go to sleep.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
018	Thank you...Santa...
019	Yes. That's a good boy.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
020	He's fallen asleep. He must have been nervous all this time.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
021	Yes. He's a good boy who cares about his sister. I'll carry him back home.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
022	That said...I never expected you to be Santa, Michael.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
023	I never thought you'd find out, Lofia.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0047
024	Hey...how long has Santa been part of Lustburg's culture?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
025	An intuitive question.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0005
026	Santa Claus wasn't part of Lustburg's history until recent years. I researched that once in the Royal Library.
027	Hm. Very impressive, Lofia. Well then, have you considered that Santa Claus may be from a different world?	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
028	Yes. On rare instances, a castaway from another world can enter into Babel through the Door of Truth.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
029	I learned about Santa Claus from such an individual from a different world.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0045
030	I began playing the part to make my granddaughter Alyu smile after her parents had just died.
031	So you really are the founder of Santa then, Michael.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0044
032	After that, I began to deliver presents to underprivileged children throughout the land.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
033	Even after I became a phantom, my will was carried on by the Holy Order and they continued to summon me as Santa.
034	Why go to that extent?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
035	For an old man like me, nothing is more important than bringing smiles to the faces of promising youths and children.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
036	(Wow, Michael.)	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
037	Hoho... Keep this a secret between the two of us, Lofia.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
038	Okay.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0037
039	Ah, monsters again. Do your best for the boy, Santa Claus.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
040	Hohoho. Very well then.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0011
