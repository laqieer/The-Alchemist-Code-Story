001	I think there was something that I wasn't willing to face.
002	About the code. About my sister.
003	I still think about it now. If I had been able to face everything...
004	Maybe things would have been different.
005	...
006	Please leave Lady Natsume's care to me. You shouldn't have to be bothered with things like—
007	It's fine. We should change the bandages on her hands.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
008	Ren...
009	Stop bothering the servant. I can get by fine on my own.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
010	Natsume! You need to lie down.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
011	I don't like that I'm making you make that face. I know that it can't be helped, but...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
012	Also, as long as I'm laid up, your training is being delayed.
013	Who cares about that right now? Your health is—	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
014	You think you can tell me what to do even though you can't beat me?
015	If you have time to worry about my health, you have time to train.
016	Urgh... Natsume, are you sure you're not a demon?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0028
017	You're fine if you can make jokes like that. Let's start your training.
018	But...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
019	What is it, Ren?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
020	...
021	(Were Natsume's arms always this thin?)	VO_ren.ren_battle_0019
022	(I thought there was no way my sister would die. That she would train me hard just like always.)
023	(But...)
024	(My sister continues to bear the weight of our code even with her arms so thin and her life so limited.)	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
025	(If only I was strong enough to bear some of the weight...)
026	(Maybe I could extend my sister's life, even just a little bit.)	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
027	(A year... An hour... Even a minute.)
028	Natsume, I...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
029	Terrible news! There are reports that demons are approaching the village!
030	What?!
031	I'll be there. You rest, Natsume.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
032	I won't. Killing demons is part of the code.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0039
033	Natsume!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
034	I've rested plenty. You don't need to worry about me.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
035	Natsume!
036	...
