001	Aghh...!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
002	Hmm. The darkness seems to be eroding your right arm. It looks incredibly painful.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0045
003	Ack... It's nothing.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
004	There is one way to suppress the pain.
005	What? How...?
006	It's simple; take complete control of the darkness that is causing the pain.
007	Control the darkness?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
008	Indeed.
009	Because of your hesitation, you are still being swayed by the darkness.
010	Hesitation? That's absurd. I have no hesitation! I've sworn to use this power to change the world!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
011	I see... In that case, will you be able to cut down the man you call your father?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0044
012	M-my father...?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
013	In order to change the world, a considerable price must be paid.
014	Do you think you can change it while you're still afraid of losing what's important to you?
015	That fear is your weakness—the source of your pain.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0007
