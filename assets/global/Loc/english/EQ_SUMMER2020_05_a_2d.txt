001	Oh! What's going on?! What did we do?
002	What did you do? You know what you did! You sent those Alkaroid to attack the beach!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
003	Huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
004	Your actions are threatening the peace of the beach! What with sending the Alkaroids to attack it, all the illegal dumping...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
005	W-wait a second! What are you talking about?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
006	We commanded them to not attack people and we have been throwing away garbage on the beach!
007	We're just having them collect the materials we need!
008	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
009	Our ship got damaged in the storm the other day.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
010	It was run-down to begin with, so it couldn't be helped. And then we ran aground on this shore.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
011	If we can't fix our boat, we can't return to the sea. So, we started gathering materials on this beach to try to fix it.
012	You mean the boat at the mouth of the cave? I agree it's very beat up... Wait, you want to fix that?! It's like swiss cheese!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
013	She's been well used, I'll give you that. That ship's full of our memories. That's why we want to fix it up and head out on the seas with it again.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
014	Which is why we had them collect the materials we need.
015	Then...why are they...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
016	...
017	It seems it's true that you gave them orders, but something's causing an error.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
018	An error?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0006
019	That's what caused them to not follow orders correctly. Where did you get those Alkaroids?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
020	Huh? We pulled them out of the water from a beached shipwreck.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
021	Th-they were in water? Isn't that, you know, bad?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
022	That's definitely the cause of the malfunction.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
023	You commanded them to pick up materials while avoiding people as much as possible so as to not bother them.
024	However, those conditions were erased by the error so that their goal only became collection.
025	I see. That's why they started picking up anything from the beach and attacking people out of nowhere in order to do so.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0031
026	They're needlessly sturdy, they'll continue to move as normal despite having errors.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0045
027	I had no idea they were bothering people. That's terrible! Oh, but...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
028	But?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
029	But we didn't throw out any trash! We've been piling our trash here. We were going to throw it away later—	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
030	It's gone!
031	Oh! Look! That octopus is carrying something away!
032	Hey! Cut it out! That's important booty—bleck!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
033	A-are you okay? That octopus is really mad for some reason.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
034	It's probably mad because you all moved in here without asking.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0030
035	So that's why they started coming outside.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
036	Maybe they're throwing out the things the pirates have brought in into the sea in protest for stealing their home?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
037	What a disaster. Which means the trash is your fault in the end!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
038	Th-that may be true but if we can't fix our ship, we'll lose our home, too.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
039	You can't get yourselves a new boat? There's tons of better boats out there.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
040	It's gotta be this ship. This ship is full of our memories.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0039
041	It's really important to you, isn't it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0006
042	Ooo, ooo! I've got an idea! Albea should fix up their ship!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
043	Then they won't have to collect materials, they'll leave the cave, and the octopuses will get their home back.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
044	Y-you will?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
045	If it's this kind of mechanism, I can probably fix it. But in return, you have to stop the Alkaroids and return the things that got stolen.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
046	Oh yeah! And the comb, her comb!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
047	Of course we'll give that back, too! Comb... Comb... I don't see it.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
048	Really? Did you check everything?! An Alkaroid did take off with it, you know!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
049	It's all right if they can't find it. If they just return the other things that got stolen...
050	No. We will find it. Does it have any other characteristics?
051	Other characteristics... There is another one but I don't think you'd understand it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
052	Huh?
053	My brother put a mechanism in it. But only I know of it.
054	It's just something really small. And not that big of a deal, I think.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0011
055	But...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
056	I'm going to fix the boat, so I'll leave the rest to you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
057	(You don't really think that, Albea, do you?)
058	(I've got to roll up my sleeves and find it! But I need a clue... Hmm...)	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
059	(Glows white... White... Didn't Bertha and Sharon say that the octopuses like collecting white things?)
060	Hmm, but where would they take it? Huh?
061	Is that—	VO_mela.mela_sys_0025
062	A power unit failure... This I can do something about.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
063	Everyone! Things have taken a turn!	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
064	What's wrong?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
065	A lot of octopuses came to the beach and things have gotten out of hand! We can't handle them by ourselves!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0029
066	We've received a request for aid! We're going back to the beach, so please come with us!
067	Oh no! We must return and defend the beach—
068	Sorry, but I can't leave this right now.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0035
069	What?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0026
070	I took on this ship repair job as the proprietor of the repair shop Magbea.
071	If I fix this ship, the pirates will leave here and the octopuses will return to their home. That's why my priority has to be repairing this ship right now.
072	I-I see. You're right.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
073	But we can't just leave you here by yourself.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
074	You'll be so focused on repairing it that you'll be defenseless. That's not safe!
075	N-Noah! Calm down!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
076	Our job was supposed to be guarding the beach. And I understand where you're coming from, but the octopuses are really swarming the beach.
077	The Alkaroids are malfunctioning, octopuses are swarming, and your comb's missing... What should we do?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0029
078	I-Is this a silver spoon situation? I don't have one on me!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
079	Noah! I guess this will do. Noah, take this—	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0001
080	Hold down! I'll keep myself calm!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
081	Ssssss!
082	With my abdomen expanded...breathe out... Deep breathing... Haa...
083	...
084	I'm good!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0004
085	Oh! Noah! You've got the deep breathing technique down perfectly!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0044
086	Whew, that's good! Now then, let's stay calm. We'll divide and conquer!
087	Suzuka and Noah, head to the beach! Albea will be fixing the ship! And I'll stick around here!
088	This way there's no problems, right?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0001
089	I see... This way everything's covered. Understood!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0045
090	Now then, I'm interested in what's going on in this cave. I'll just go take a look.
