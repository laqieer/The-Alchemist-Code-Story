001	What the…	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
002	With bad aim like that, you'll never hit me between my brows.
003	You're strong. I can't bother aiming like that.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0003
004	So I'm waiting for you to become exhausted. Once you're weakened, then I'll kill you.
005	So your plan is to not even fight?
006	It's like hunting. The plan is the same whether the target is weak or strong.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
007	Follow it to its death. Let it run. And finally, off with its head.
008	…!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0019
009	You haven't had enough? There's more where that came from!
010	Aedith!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_battle_0019
011	…
012	Is this what you want? By being pushed back, there's no way to negotiate.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
013	Are you willing to lose everything including your dragon power?
014	Ugh…
015	There is no need. Schmeier was injured during the escape.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
016	At this point, it's impossible for her to turn into a dragon.
017	…
018	(Dammit! I can't bluff my way out of this one!)	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0030
019	This is…turning out worse than I imagined…!
020	We should retreat!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
021	I was thinking the same thing.
022	You think I'll let you?
023	Our opponents are only human. This should do it...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0044
024	Hm? What's this round…
025	…!
026	Oof... I didn't see that coming...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0016
027	Alright! The finger's off the trigger!
028	Right, we shall retreat!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
029	Apologies. We'll meet again, Aedith.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
030	H-hey, wait! Urgh…
031	Aedith, are you alright?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0001
032	Yeah. Got hit in the hip but I'm alright. But you… After those two…
033	We can't. They got away.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0040
034	Dammit…
035	Although that beautiful looking one…	VO_karne.karne_battle_0019
036	Hm? Oh, the high elf. Don't worry. He's just a terminal.
037	A terminal?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0039
038	He has multiple body forms to choose and use.
039	So he was being "controlled?"	VO_karne.karne_sys_0022
040	Ugh… We'll take that down that woman, that Schmeier with our own hands!
041	Otherwise, the dragon army will wipe out the Sloth Layer...
042	And that Matia… Always bringing trouble.
043	…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0031
044	Hm? What is it?
045	Looks like you're enjoying this, Aedith.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0007
046	Stop it, my angel. Everything that I put so much work into is about to fall apart.
047	Yup… I'm done with ridiculous journeys.
048	I decided to spend the rest of my life relaxing in this city.
049	Yes. Well, though it is no concern for me.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0016
050	That's fine. An assassin wanting to show his skills to someone will inevitably lead to the other's death.
051	Yes…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
052	So, about those two that escaped. We'll follow their trail.
053	So… where do we run to next?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
054	Now that Aedith has turned against us, there is no safe place in this city.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
055	Even the friendly innkeeper would report us.
056	Then… We must leave the city.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0045
057	But that would mean staying in the fields or in the few forests.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
058	Continuously hiding and escaping will be difficult.
059	Then, where…?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0039
060	Of course, if we can't stay above the ground, then there is the option for below…
