001	W-wow! You just took those Greed Dike soldiers out with one blow! Who are you?!
002	It doesn't matter. More importantly...how can you be sure those aren't the words of the king?
003	Huh...?
004	You said they are making the king say those words, right? What proof do you have of that?
005	I am currently serving by the king's side in order to protect him.
006	Yeah...I heard from Dilga.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
007	The king was the kind of person who would make conversation with me even when was I still an apprentice.
008	Even to the likes of me he would say, 'Always try to live up to your title as a knight.'
009	...What?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0025
010	He meant that peace is not always brought about by force.
011	When people come together...and use their power to protect that bond...peace becomes a possibility for the first time.
012	Greed Dike's military strength will bring about peace in this country?
013	The king I know would never say something like that!
014	Ah! I see...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0045
015	Honestly. I'm completely amazed by your actions...although you did complicate matters.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
016	Huh? Argh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
017	Ug...ughhh! Ba...Basheeny...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
018	You...!
019	You better not move. I can pierce him this very moment.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
020	Emperor Orion!
021	It was quite a hassle...but I managed to apprehend the Holy Guard's Captain Monzein of the 2nd Regiment!
022	It's been a while, Lord Waginau.
023	Captain Monzein the Great Thunder Axe...who would've thought I would run into you here.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0024
024	Monzein...?! You?!
025	Tsk! What're you playing at?!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
026	It should be pretty obvious.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
027	Unfortunately...I do not plan on being annihilated alongside you.
028	Wait, did you betray us again?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
029	What is going on? Didn't you turn on us?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
030	Turn on you? Heheh. Did I manage to deceive you as well Lord Waginau? That is the highest honor.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
031	I have gained access to all the captains of the Holy Guard beginning with the Lord Commander himself. I am now in a position to lure them to wherever you please.
032	You brat...there'll be no forgiveness for you now!!! Huzzaaahh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0010
033	Oops! Honestly, your actions are completely futile.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
034	This is why you're always being used as a pawn.
035	As a pawn...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
036	Don't you understand?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
037	Because of your brash personality, people take advantage of you...both your enemies and your friends.
038	...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
039	You're wasting my time. At least put on a good show.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
040	Lord Waginau, reinforcements will soon arrive.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
041	It would be best to handle this man before they arrive. It can be troublesome if they were to rendezvous.
042	Reinforcements? Well...there's no need for us to reveal our hand.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
043	Are you sure you're not betraying us?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
044	That's exactly what I am telling you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
045	They were truly a bunch of honest fools. It hardly took much effort to infiltrate their ranks.
046	You scum...!!! Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
047	Hmph. Where are you even aiming at? Honestly...his rage has made him go crazy...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
048	...! Please escape! The stairway is going to collapse!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
049	What...?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
050	...Good job.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0034
051	Agh...! Y-you...Basheeny!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0022
052	My apologies...but let me correct what I just said.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0036
053	I did not turn on you. Instead, I found something to believe in.
054	Hmph. Honestly, kid...using me as a pawn.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
055	I'm sorry. That was the only move I could think of.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
056	I didn't come all the way here to choose the path of complete annihilation...
057	Tighten the defenses. They're after the King of Envylia.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
058	Are you sure about that?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
059	What...?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
060	Ack...?! Why me...?!
061	There's no point in playing dumb. Ever since I heard that the king was being controlled, I've been searching my surroundings.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
062	You were the only one, weren't you? When the king was talking, you had your eyes facing downward with your head bowed.
063	Wh-what about that...?!
064	Moreover, you were murmuring something with your lips. They were the king's words, weren't they?
065	I'm not that easily deceived. After all, I was pretty much forced to learn how to resist the Phantom Arts when I served under Lord Waginau!
066	Ack!!! I-I heard nothing about there being another who knew the arts!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
067	Huh?! He disappeared?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
068	Furthermore, you definitely didn't say anything about him being such a cute young man. Aren't these things you should be informing me of?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
069	A girl?! Ack...! You...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
070	Unfortunately...I'm no longer there. I am one of the Veda Templars...Vier, wielder of the Phantom Scent.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
071	Young man...are you a little more interested now?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
072	The Veda Templars?! Wh-what are they?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
073	Hehe. Women are mysterious creatures. You must suppress your desire to know everything.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
074	Oh no...we're surrounded!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
075	Ack! Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
076	Run! Let's regroup...this way!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
077	G-got it!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
078	Run...? Aren't you talking about yourself?	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
079	What...?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
080	Heheh. So you're using a countermeasure for the Phantom Arts. I wonder if your little countermeasure can work against my craft?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
081	Wh-what the...my arm!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
082	?!
083	Aghh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
084	Captain Monzein!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
085	Is he being manipulated by the Phantom Arts?!
086	Heheh. Even the world-renowned Monzein cannot do much against an attack he can't see...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
087	It appears so. Vier...take out Basheeny. It'll be troublesome if we leave him be.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
088	Hmph. Can you stop making me do everything? Just use your own soldiers that you're so proud of.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0010
089	You cheeky little... Immortals, advance!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
090	There are so many immortal soldiers!
091	Agh! R-run!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
092	My...my body...! Ack! Captain! Fall back immediately!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
093	What...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
094	Reinforcements will arrive soon. You must do whatever you can to rendezvous with Captain Yauras!
095	By doing so...it'll give the king a chance to recapture the country!
096	Tsk...! What about you?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
097	Don't worry about me! This is my "atonement." I have already made my decision!	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
098	Atonement?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
099	My atonement for having underestimated that woman!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
100	More importantly...this is my atonement to myself for my actions against the Holy Guard in the past...!
101	Ever since I decided to join Commander Kanon...I've prepared myself for this!
102	Basheeny...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
103	Do it!!!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
104	Come on. Hurry up and go!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
105	Ack! Don't be stupid! I can't leave my men to die...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
106	Honestly. You're so stubborn.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
107	Perfect. Let me use this final opportunity to tell you this.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
108	I hate you...you're an emotional, stubborn piece of work.
109	What...?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
110	Haha. You should at least try and fix that blockheaded nature of yours.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0011
111	...Goodbye.
112	...!
113	Ack...! Huzzzaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_1017
114	What the...?! What are you doing?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
115	...That's odd.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
116	Huh...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
117	I hate you as well. Do you think I'd actually follow your instructions?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0020
118	Don't be stupid! No...! Stay back!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
119	Get them!!!
120	Ack! You little brat! Take this! Grit your teeth, Basheeny!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
121	?! Agh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
122	All right...!
123	Ughh...!!! Ack...ckk...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
124	Captain!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
