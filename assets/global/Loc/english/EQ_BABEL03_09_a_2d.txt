001	I will not allow any further transgressions!	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0029
002	Nefertiti!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
003	What are you doing here?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
004	You did not come greet me as you usually do, so I thought I had better check in. Prepare yourself for punishment later.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
005	I-I...understand, beloved sister.
006	What is going on here, Nefertiti?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
007	Rashba, members of the Corpse, please withdraw.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
008	I cannot do that. I will not leave without that Sephiran girl.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0040
009	We will not harm anybody if she is given to us, and we will then gladly withdraw. You have been warned.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
010	My oh my, then this is quite a troubling turn of events. We simply cannot allow any of you to have Carla.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
011	...!
012	Wait, me?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
013	If you plan to take her by force, I will not stand idly by.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0010
014	Let us see if you have the strength to face me.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0013
015	A Sephira? Me?!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
016	Your parents must have kept it secret from you for your protection. I'm sorry, Carla.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0035
017	That you have become a target is the fault of the nobility. That is why I must...
018	...protect you at all costs. Such is my burden to bear.	VO_neferty.neferty_battle_0004
019	Balt, I'm... Did you...know?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0027
020	It never mattered to me who you are. I promised Hawk that I'd protect you.	VO_balt.balt_event_1013
021	I will protect you and this desert with my life.
022	May I...ask of you one thing?
023	Yes, though I will not accept any excuses.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0006
024	Nothing of the sort. Please, allow me to shoulder some of your burden. I wish to be of some help to you!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
025	My, you used to be such a disappointing little brother, but look at you now. So grown up.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0030
026	I've always regretted turning my back on Hawk.
027	Back then, my hands were full with my own problems.
028	However, things are different now. I stand here now, having protected the same things Hawk dedicated his life to protecting.
029	That is why I am here. This is my atonement, my burden to bear. I cannot possibly let you—!
030	I am no longer the little boy you still see me as! Do you still believe I cannot be of any use to you?!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
031	...?!
032	We are family! Is it not natural for us to share the weight of what must be borne?!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0018
033	Ramses...!
034	So this is what you meant... Hawk, the seeds you sowed in this desert are finally bearing fruit.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0020
035	Are you seeing this, Hawk? It's just as you said. It may take time for seeds to sprout, but time is one thing the world will give us!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0007
036	The seeds you planted are sprouting right now!
037	Well, gosh darnit, I knew Hawk was right all along!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0046
038	I'm sorry, Nefertiti. I may have misjudged you. No, I probably just didn't believe in you from the bottom of my heart.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0035
039	There is no need for you to be alone in this. Though we may be different in many ways, we both call this desert our home.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
040	We may not be family, but we work together. Is that not right, Nefertiti?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
041	That's right! I mean, I'm still a little wigged out, but you didn't have to keep it a secret from me! Quit acting so standoffish and distant!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
042	I would have gladly shared this burden with you!
043	How can you think like that?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0001
044	I once knew a guy who passed away because he was determined to shoulder all the weight of the world alone. I just can't let that happen again.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0018
045	I...understand.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
046	Let us help you! We'll start by getting through this fight together!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
047	Are you finished yet? Have you prepared to die, desert-dwellers?	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0002
048	We won't be dying on this day! Hey, Zofia!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
049	Hm? Ya?	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0006
050	You were born in this desert, right? I want you to know I want to protect you too!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0003
051	What are you talking about? She's mine! You're speaking out of place, fool!	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_sys_0012
052	You're out of place! I'm talking to Zofia, not you! Zofia, let's make a bet.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
053	If you win, well, that's the end of that, but if we win? You live as you please.
054	The way, Zofia...want? Live?	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0025
055	Yeah, and come home to the desert someday. We'll have made this place a good home for you by then.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
056	Home?	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0006
057	It can be far in the future. It can be when you're an old lady. Just come home.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
058	This is what it means to protect the desert. What do you think, Zofia?
059	Okay! Yes!	VO_zophy.zophy_sys_0004
060	Zofia! Don't be making any stupid promises! Actually, forget it. We'll be annihilating them anyway.	VO_lasiuba.lasiuba_battle_0019
061	We won't lose to the likes of them. Will we, Carla?	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0010
062	Of course we'll win! For the first time, the Sand Hawks will fight along with the nobility! Let's do this, Balt!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
063	You can count on me! The desert is our home!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0006
