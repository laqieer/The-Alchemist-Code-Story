001	Hyah!	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0032
002	(On the battlefield, one must focus on one's own battle.)
003	(I am the blade the fulfills its mission. No other thoughts are required.)
004	Haaah! Take that!	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0004
005	(That kid... He's still alive.)	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0030
006	(Not good. At that rate, he'll be overwhelmed.)
007	(Just stand down. You're gonna end up conveniently crying for help again anyway...)
008	Argh! I can't afford to be beaten by you guys!	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0019
009	Until Lucian acknowledges my skills, there's no way I'm going down without a fight!
010	Lucian wouldn't start whining and complaining if he was up against the likes of you guys!
011	... ...
012	(I too...was just like him before.)
013	(I caused a lot of trouble for that man.)
014	(I remember he told me that, in the beginning, we all start the same.)
015	(Oh well... I guess this is part of my job.)	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0030
016	So, you're still alive.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0001
017	Lucian bro...! Y-you're not a mirage, are you?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0020
018	Enough with your nonsense. Hurry up and stand up.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0002
019	Thank you so much! I can't believe you'd do that for me...	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0011
020	Grit your teeth.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0007
021	Huh?	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
022	Owwwww! B-bro, your iron fist is so painful!	VO_retzius.retzius_battle_0026
023	If you cannot follow orders nor value your own life, you're nothing but a nuisance to me. I don't need such individuals in my faction.
024	M-my apologies! I...I...just wanted to prove myself to you, bro!	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0029
025	...No excuses are necessary.
026	Huh? Wait, hold on.	VO_retzius.retzius_sys_0025
027	Does that mean that if I follow your orders and value my own life...
028	...Let's head back now.	VO_rusia.rusia_sys_0002
029	Oh! He-hey, wait up! Lucian bro!
