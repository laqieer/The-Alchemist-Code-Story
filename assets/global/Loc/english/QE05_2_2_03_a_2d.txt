001	Ceclidis! No!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
002	Malta?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
003	Uh-oh... It looks like you won't be able to hold up much longer. We'd better get you somewhere safe, quick!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
004	No, it is not the time for that. The situation here has not yet been settled.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0018
005	Not yet...? What do you mean by that?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
006	What is this?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
007	Ahhhhhhh!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0025
008	Isidore?! Are you okay?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
009	My body is burning... Sephiron is trying to burn away the darkness inside of me—urgh!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0019
010	These are the death throes of Sephiron.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
011	What?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
012	The resurrection ceremony is a last resort to extend Sephiron's life.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
013	Its intent is to spark new life in the aging Sephiron to give her the energy to usher in a new era.
014	However, the little energy the resurrection ceremony managed to transfer has been lost with the arrival of Ceclidis.
015	Then what is this light?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
016	You know what it is.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
017	I... Wait. Yes, it is the Door!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
018	Sephiron is already losing her ability to function as the Door. Unfortunately, that does not mean the Door will remain closed.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
019	The power that sleeps beyond it, that which we call Truth, that which carries the will of the world... It now scrabbles to burst forth into our world.
020	If that happens, then this country...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0018
021	Yes. Gluttony would be obliterated in the face of the absolute power of that energy, the source of all Alchemia, which even the Sacred Stones cannot stand against.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
022	Hmph. It is a cruel irony that a man like Ceclidis, who cannot even sense this power, would be the instigator of our destruction.
023	Then we must close the Door! "I beseech the supreme—"	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
