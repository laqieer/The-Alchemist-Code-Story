001	Enough!
002	Heh...heheh. I must say, you are dreadfully strong, even with perplexity ailing your mind.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0011
003	I've been trained as such.
004	Bear in mind, though, that perplexity—that uncertainty—will inevitably bring you harm if left unchecked.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0004
005	...
006	So, once again, I ask: What do you want to do? What do you fight for? If you can't find your answer to these questions—	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0002
007	I will protect Lil. No matter what, till the end of this journey. That's all there is to it. There is no uncertainty there.
008	All right. For now, I'm perfectly willing to accept that. Thank you.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0022
009	Your dear daughter is at my mansion. Go to her.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0007
010	She's...not actually my daughter. You know this, right?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0042
011	...
012	The minutest release of my powers, and this is the result... I may be closer to the end of my own journey than I initially thought.	VO_clabul.clabul_sys_0030
013	Zafeiris. There's little I can do for you with the time I have left.
014	I pray you find your reason to save the world, while I'm still around to help guide you on the right path.
015	Lil! Are you here?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0006
016	Zafeiris!
017	Are you all right? Did anyone hurt you?
018	I'm fine! Sia and Quence have been very nice to me!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0004
019	Who?	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0005
020	Oh, hello. My name is Ambrosia. I'm a witch in training. It's nice to meet you.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0001
021	I'm Quence. So you're this little lady's guardian?	VO_kvense_kvense-b.kvense_sys_0044
022	Gotta say, you don't look the part.
023	Thank you for taking care of Lil.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0034
024	Not a problem! Please, there's no need to bow! It sort of just...happened. I absolutely didn't do anything worthy of receiving a dragon's gratitude.	VO_ambrosia_ambrosia-b.ambrosia_sys_0025
025	Sia's my friend now!
026	I see.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_voice_0017
027	(Friends, huh? Could a dragon and human truly share that sense of companionship?)
028	(Or perhaps it's because she can, that Lil is to be our hope...)
029	Zafeiris?	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0001
030	Ah, it's nothing, Lil.
031	Okay?
032	You are to set out on a journey from here. You must see the many lands of this world, and come to know the lives and livelihoods of humans and dragons alike.	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0002
033	Then, you must make a choice regarding this world's future.
034	Uh, okay. I'll do my best!	VO_uroboros-f.uroboros-f_sys_0038
035	(I can't help but wonder, am I asking something cruel of her? This world is by no means an amicable place.)	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0031
036	(Both humans and dragons have flaws that run deep.)
037	(Is this world truly worth saving, such as it is?)
038	(I'm not so sure.)	VO_zafilys.zafilys_sys_0030
039	...
040	That which you just saw is but a fragment of what made me who I am now. They were memories of a past long since lost to the sands of time.
041	I could feel the sensation of your dragon power, surging through my body... The instinctive logic of motion in combat... There was much in there for me to learn.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
042	...
043	So this was the beginning of your travels with that girl?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0002
044	Yes. Though, everything beyond that beginning has been a journey of perpetual loss.
045	From the many encounters and bonds formed, to the very moment they all became meaningless...
046	To me, these memories are nothing more than a retracing of the first moments of an unspeakable tragedy.
047	But for you, there may be some important new discoveries to unearth.
048	You must dive deeper. Further within my memories, you will find the power you seek.
049	Right. I suppose there's no time to hesitate, then.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0022
050	Show me, Zafeiris. Show me your past despair. I will do what I can to give it meaning and purpose.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0041
051	Surely there is something within it that can help me save Nimul!
052	Very well. I shall open another gate of memories.
