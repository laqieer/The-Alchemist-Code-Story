003	...! Is this corrupt presence...converging?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
004	Tina! Stand back!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
005	Mocca?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
006	It's going to appear! Don't get caught up in it!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029

009	Glurrrpp...! Glurrrrrrppp...!!! Gloooaaarrrr!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
010	!!!
011	I-it's so massive! Is this really...the Jam?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
012	Ack! If it gets any larger, it'll be out of our control! I'll take it out now before it's too late!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
013	B-but...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
014	Don't worry. Just find the Gluttony troops at all costs!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
015	If they unleash anymore, it'll all be over!
016	But this forest is too large! That's the reason why they chose this place! This is way too much for just you and I to...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
017	What's that? Something's coming this way!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
018	Tina! Mocca! Are you okay?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
019	Liz...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
020	Behind her...are they the merchants?! What?! Why aren't they being evacuated?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
021	You gotta be kidding me! Why do we need to be evacuated?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
022	What do you mean "why"? Don't you understand the situation?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
023	Stop mumbling, and just tell us how we can help!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
024	...Huh?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
025	I said tell us how we can help! Come on...tell us!!!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
026	What are you talking about...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
027	They're saying that they want to help!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
028	The Fuu faction is also saying that they can't just leave everything to us.
029	The Fuu faction too...?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
030	Tsk! Have you forgotten what you said in the village?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
031	We've put aside our petty bickering and are here to help!!!
032	...!
033	You gave us a piece of your mind, didn't you? You told us that we've forgotten our life principles...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
034	You gotta be kidding me! We know what it feels like to want to protect our children!
035	...! Everyone...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
036	Make no mistake, our priority is to protect our village.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
037	I just don't want to get taken out by the blasted Jam.
038	Just tell us what to do! We didn't come here to stand around talking!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
039	No way. Have we gone beyond the confines of the tribe boundaries?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0022
040	Hmph. In any case, we have reinforcements now. I'll leave that rest to you and Liz.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
041	I need to stop him at all costs! Good luck over here!
042	Tina...!
043	It's fine, Liz! Let's focus on this!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
044	Everyone, please help us look for the Gluttony soldiers.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
045	Huh? Gluttony soldiers...? Are we not gonna fight that big fellow?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
046	It's the Gluttony soldiers that are growing the Jam.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
047	Unless we stop them, it'll continue to expand. Please!
