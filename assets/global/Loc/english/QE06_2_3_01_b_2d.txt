001	Before the two had realized it, food became the bridge that connected humans and demons.
002	They both realized, even if subconsciously, that their futures were intertwined.
003	And they set about changing the minds of their respective races--in alignment with their cause.
004	The human expressed his resolve to his queen.
005	It would have been simple enough to appeal to her emotions, but he did not.
006	"A path exists in which we don't need to fight demons."
007	"If we provide food that demons can eat, they won't need to attack humans anymore. And I've developed such food."
008	The queen stated, "I need to see it with my own eyes before I believe you."
009	So the human spoke again, choosing his words carefully.
010	"I'll show you proof."
011	"If I'm lying, you can have my head."
012	The demon declared her resolve to her brother, in addition to recounting everything that had taken place until that point.
013	Facts alone weren't enough to convince him, so she appealed to his emotions.
014	"I've discovered food that I can eat."
015	"You can finally be relieved of the burden you've carried."
016	"And I can live the 'normal' life I've been hoping for."
017	The demon chief posed a question:
018	"Of what food do you speak, exactly?"
019	The demon steeled herself and choose her words carefully:
020	"We can survive without devouring humans--no one need starve. We can finally live in peace."
021	"And what if peace never comes to pass?"
022	"Then I will gladly offer my head."
023	"Is there some form of proof you can show me?"
024	The brother asked his sister:
025	"Why should demons join forces with humans when they show us nothing but contempt?"
026	The demon asserted to her brother.
027	"There are some humans who show us compassion."
028	Her brother spoke deliberately, making the demon second-guess herself.
029	"Devouring humans is what demons do."
030	The demon chose her words carefully, in the hopes of reaching her brother.
031	"If so, then I don't need to be a demon. I have faith in a better future."
032	And so, for the first time, humans and demons…
033	Communicated without violence.
034	…
035	…
036	We've never done this before…without weapons.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
037	I trust you'll exercise restraint.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
038	I'm not here to fight.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
039	Nor am I.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
040	…It's an honor to have you both join us on this occasion. I hope you'll listen to what we have to say…
041	Let's cut the formalities and lay it all out--plain and simple!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
042	Wha--Koga!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
043	No point using flowery language if it doesn't strike a chord! The point is, let's end the fighting. That's it.
044	…
045	…You must be Koga. Your reputation precedes you.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
046	Surely you didn't invite us here to make such a ludicrous demand?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
047	I sure did! I believe food can change the world! Eliminate hunger and we can bring about world peace!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
048	My brethren cannot survive without devouring humans. Given that fact, how can we take you seriously?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
049	Of course I know that! I'm sure there will be naysayers and skeptics--all that jazz. But first…
050	Just try my food and then we'll talk!	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0002
051	…I am a demon that can't devour humans…but thanks to Koga's dishes--
052	...I finally have an alternative.
053	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
054	When you think about it, humans and demons fight because demons need to devour humans to survive, right?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
055	Therefore--
056	All we need to do to prevent more fighting is provide an alternate nutrition source!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
057	…Do you have any proof that other demons can eat this new cuisine you've created?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
058	I'm gonna have them taste test right after this--Bada bing bada boom--Instant results!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
059	…Hmm.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0009
060	Intriguing...	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
061	…You can't be serious…	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
062	Nevertheless, a simple taste test can't erase generations' worth of enmity.
063	…How will you address those concerns?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
064	All that's water under the bridge!
065	Wha--?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
066	Both sides are sick and tired of the endless violence. Let's use this chance to put an end to it all.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
067	Humans and demons can meet each other halfway! Me and Kaede did it! So, why not?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
068	I cannot commit to any agreement without proof. I have a duty to uphold as leader.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
069	I must admit, I agree with her.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
070	…
071	Kaede…?	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0004
072	Humans, demons--What does it matter who joins you at the dinner table, as long as you're enjoying it?
073	…
074	…Right. So, in that vein…
075	…!
076	What--! Do you have any idea what you're doing!?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
077	…Kaede!?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
078	From now on, I will live my life as a human. These broken horns symbolize my commitment.
079	You would forsake your life as a demon?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
080	Yes. Because of what Koga has taught me--not about bringing together demons and humans, but about living together.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
081	His resolve has compelled me to match his. I want to place my bets on the future of Wadatsumi that he envisions…!
082	"If so, then I don't need to be a demon. I have faith in a better future."
083	…Kaede!!	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
084	But I don't think I can do it with willpower alone…Still, I know I've got to show something.
085	I hope, somehow, you'll be able to see my resolve.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0041
086	…
087	Well said Kaede! I guess I should prove my resolve by becoming a demon--Wait, is that even possible?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
088	Should I…grow horns?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
089	Pff--Hahahaha!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0008
090	It's alright, Koga. Kaede's gesture is enough for me.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
091	Mitsuha…!	VO_kouga.kouga_favorite_0005
092	Demon chief, I have verily accepted this gesture of goodwill. We humans must offer something in kind… Therefore--	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
093	In response to Kaede, I will disband the Phoenix Brigade under my command and dissolve the Phoenix Covenant.
094	Our art, namely the arcane art of Kagutsuchi, is henceforth forbidden. What say you?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
095	…Is that so?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
096	It's only human nature to want to reciprocate a gesture made in good faith.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0010
097	What use do we have of our art if demons no longer pose a threat?
098	I hereby forbid the use of the arcane art, Kagutsuchi--inherited from my forefathers-- provided that our reconciliation remains intact.
099	How does that sit with you? There is nothing more I can offer.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0031
100	…Hmm. You'd do away with the your demon-slaying arts? Quite a handsome proposal, indeed.
101	But words alone aren't enough for me to trust you.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
102	Then, allow me to prove myself.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
103	I, having entered a covenant with thee--based on the blood pact of the Aquila Rubrum--hereby nullify all covenants.
104	In order to enter a new covenant, the blood of the royal family must be spilled. Without it, there will be nothing. All is in the name of Aquila Rubrum.
105	...Huzzaaaaah!!!	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0032
106	Let us show proof. Someone step forward.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0002
107	As you can see, Kagutsuchi cannot be wielded any longer. Henceforth…	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0003
108	My blood will be necessary to enact the Phoenix Covenant. So long as there is no cause for bloodshed…
109	…The seal will not be broken. I see. Your actions are compelling. All that remains is…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
110	Whether or not this man's "food" is up to snuff. Can we demons consume it and be satisfied…?
111	There's still room for improvement, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by his skills.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
112	Alright, let's save the details for later! We're all equal in the eyes of chow…	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
113	If you can't stomach it, I'm ready to lay my life on the line. Just try it first and then we'll talk!
114	For the first time in Wadatsumi history, humans and demons will dine together. Let the feast begin!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
