001	Grk!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
002	What's the matter? Did you not come here to stop me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
003	Urk! His defense is stronger than any I've ever encountered!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
004	Each one of the Sacred Stones has the power to topple an empire. You should be aware of this, Lord Commander of the Holy Guard.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
005	I carry the Sacred Stones within me. I am the Vessel of Reincarnation. You ordinary folk cannot even dream of reaching my level.
006	Nngh! A-another earthquake?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
007	Ha-haaa!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0046
008	Look! The Tower of Babel glows ever brighter!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
009	You shouldn't have turned your back to us! Kanon, now!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
010	On it!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0015
011	Drop dead! Dead the End!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
012	This is a chance we cannot afford to miss! Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
013	Huzzzaaaaahh!!!
014	D-did we get him?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
015	Haaa... Haaa... He was completely unguarded. If this doesn't work, then—!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
016	The light! Can you not see? It is near! The time of Nimul's manifestation approaches!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
017	What?! Not even a scratch?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
018	B-but how?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
019	There is nothing you can do to change what is to come. I congratulate you for being fortunate enough to witness this moment!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
020	A new challenge for humans will begin from this moment on!
021	A...new challenge?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
022	Right... You mentioned something about overthrowing the gods and their rule, didn't you?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
023	Indeed. The resurrection of Nimul is a declaration of war against the gods.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
024	It is the first step humankind must take to ascend to a new state of existence.
025	A declaration of war against the gods...?! You can't be serious!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
026	How can I not be? Even if I were to rule over mankind, none can oppose their ultimate fate.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
027	No matter how far civilization advances, mankind can do nothing against natural disasters.
028	Who do you think decides when and where fate takes us?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
029	The...gods?
030	Exactly. Without the power to match the gods, mankind will never achieve true peace themselves.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
031	How can you say that?! The gods are the creators of this world!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
032	This may all sound like the ramblings of a madman to you, but I am not the first to try this.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
033	You don't mean..?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
034	We remember them almost as though they themselves were gods; the founders of Alchemy, Nimul and Emmel.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
035	Wha—?!
036	In their time, people regularly suffered from the devastation caused by natural disasters. Death was a constant occurrence.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
037	No matter how often they prayed, no matter what they sacrificed, the gods did not heed them.
038	Ultimately they chose to resist the merciless fate forced upon them by the gods.
039	They created Alchemy to become gods themselves.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
040	Their actions enraged the gods and everything came to an end with the destruction of the Tower of Babel.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
041	I see this as proof that the gods felt threatened by mankind.
042	Then your ideal world is...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
043	With Alchemy perfected, mankind will no longer have to submit to the gods and can achieve true freedom!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
044	The world I strive for is one where people can protect themselves with the wisdom of Alchemy created by human hands!
045	I wish to rid the world of the gods, using the power of Alchemy!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
046	That's crazy!
047	How can you not understand? I have no time to waste on petty squabbles among humans. I aim to confront the gods directly!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
048	A time will come when mankind can stand as equals among the gods!
049	You're all the same.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
050	What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
051	If the weak must suffer for your ambitions, then you're no different from the gods with their natural disasters!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
052	You'll just be replacing the gods with yourself! That won't bring peace to anybody!
053	There will always be casualties if one wishes to accomplish great things. This is a necessary culling of mankind via natural selection for the sake of the next stage of evolution.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
054	Only the chosen survivors of the coming catastrophe will be worthy of the peace I envision. Surely Nimul pictured the same future as I do.
055	History has already given its answer to the idea of such a world, since it was never realized!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
056	And yet, the future Nimul imagined was righteous.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
057	Had Emmel not interfered, his ideals would have become reality.
058	Can't you see that if you follow in the footsteps of Nimul's ideology, then you are doomed to repeat his mistakes?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
059	What?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
060	If you are the Vessel of Reincarnation for Nimul, then there is bound to be a Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
061	You are destined to be defeated by someone who inherited the power of Emmel!
062	The Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel? Ha...haha... Hahahahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
063	Wh-what's so funny?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0012
064	Why do you think I destroyed Wadatsumi? You do not think it was simply for expansion of territory or for the Mikaboshi, do you?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0002
065	What do you mean? What other reason could there be?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
066	Hmph. The only reason I attacked Wadatsumi was to eliminate Emmel's Vessel of Reincarnation.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
067	Wh-what?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
068	You weren't informed, were you?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
069	Captain Kagura's mother, the queen of Wadatsumi, carried the Mikaboshi within her.
070	Wh-what?
071	Eliminating her from the equation was the sole purpose of my invasion into Wadatsumi.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
072	I needed to keep the world in the dark, so my other superficial motives served as a convenient diversion.
073	Y-you mean...K-Kagura's mother was the Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
074	Yes. Unfortunately, I had not expected her to seal the Mikaboshi away somewhere, moments before her death.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
075	Not that it matters in the end. With her death, I obtained my objective.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
076	So...there is no longer a Vessel of Reincarnation for Emmel?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
077	Oh, good. Finally, you are coming to grasp the gravity of the situation. This attack has been planned for longer than you think.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
078	The gears leading to this moment have been turning for over ten years, ever since Wadatsumi fell.
079	Th-then if Nimul's soul returns now...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
080	There is no one capable of standing in the way.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
081	N-no!
082	The power of the Mikaboshi and the Matter have been neutralized; powers said to be comparable to that of the Sacred Stones.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
083	Wratharis, Gluttony Foss, and Slothstein have yet to manifest the powers of their Sacred Stones.
084	The Sacred Stone of Lustburg is positioned high above in the sky, making it impossible to reach...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
085	Leviathan of Envylia has been neutralized...
086	And the Sacred Stone Lucifer is now in my hand.
087	I am now the only one in this world who wields any of the Sacred Stones.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
088	The Sacred Stone Mammon, within me, is the only place Nimul can return to.
089	Wha—?!
090	Can you feel it? It's Nimul's heartbeat. The soul of Nimul, the founder of Alchemy, has begun to take root!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
091	I've already won, and there is nothing you can do to change that fact! Hahahahahaha!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0008
092	No! How can this be?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
093	There is no one left who can stop me! It is time... I will allow you to see this glorious moment!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
094	The world is ascending to a new plane of existence! Under my guidance, this world will leverage its new position to give us all a fighting chance against the gods!
095	This is...wrong!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
096	Excuse me?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
097	That is why you have cut down those who did not have the strength to defend themselves? All for this future that you have imagined for us?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
098	What kind of future is that for anyone? None of us asked for this! This is wrong!
099	Pathetic. The fact that you cannot accept reality even after it has been presented to you with a little bow is the embodiment of the weakness of humankind.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
100	You're wrong! Kindness, generosity, empathy, and support... You may call those things weak, but they're our greatest strength!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
101	There is no acceptable, sustainable future which can be built by sacrificing other people! That is not the path that we should take!
102	As the Lord Commander, whose task it is to protect this world, I can never accept your way of thinking!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
103	I will stop you, Lion Monarch Orion! Your ambitions can never be fulfilled!
104	I will protect humankind from your cruelty. Humans deserve to have the dignity of being treated as human!
105	How many times must I repeat myself? Why can't you get it into your thick skulls that this world is doomed? That your attempts to stop me are pointless?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
106	For those who lay claim to the seats of power in this world to be so dense is practically a sin in itself.
107	Fine, then! Let us test whether fate stands with you or I! We shall settle this dispute with our swords!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0045
108	The victor of this clash is the person who fate truly favors—the person who will lead us all into the future!
109	This Excalibur that I hold in my hand is the sword that will bring light to this world!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
110	Its swing will clear the path forward for the people of this world! Excalibur, please lend me your strength!
111	I was destined to guide humankind to greatness! Every step forward I take is a step for humankind!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
112	No sword wielded by such short-sighted fools could ever stand up to me!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0032
113	I will answer all of our prayers with one swing! Eternal Glow!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
114	The flow of history is on my side! Chaotic Genesis!!!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0007
115	Urk...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
116	This can't be... This strength...!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
117	I-if I were to fight alone...I might lose...but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
118	I am not alone! I have been entrusted with something I carry with me always! I cannot lose with it on my side!
119	Entrusted? Ha! With what?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0006
120	The hopes of the comrades and friends that have fallen before me!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
121	All of them strongly believed that you must be stopped! All of them are counting on me to do that in their stead!
122	My sword carries their wish for the fighting to stop! My heart carries the lamentations of those who have lost or been lost!
123	Kanon is getting stronger?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
124	The true source of power is in the heart and soul. So long as I have the strength to believe in what I am doing, I can never lose to you!
125	Huuuzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
126	Unexpectedly, we are not entirely dissimilar. Your strength simply comes from a different source: the empathy you have for others.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0044
127	Huh?!
128	Wh-what is this strength?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
129	Think of it this way... If your strength comes from the pain of this era, my strength draws on the unfulfilled needs of this era...and the last...and the one before that...all the way to the dawn of time.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
130	It is the strength built on the buried lamentations of the nameless masses who were crushed beneath the cruelty of fate since the beginning of time!
131	The force of their voices, suppressed for too long, is what makes me so powerful!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0009
132	Nnrk!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
133	Kanon!
134	The scale of the burdens we are carrying is completely different!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
135	Until the lot of you get that through your heads, you'll never be able to win against me!
136	U-urk...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
137	Gnh... Don't think you can just push me down!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
138	C-Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
139	Fool! We have no choice but to destroy this man now, before he can destroy those who are vulnerable!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
140	If we must die, we should do it here! We must fight with everything we have, until we have nothing more to give!
141	You're right!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
142	Finally... Nimul's soul has come to settle within my body!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0046
143	There is nothing that you can do to stop me! This is the end for you!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
144	Hold nothing back!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
145	I know! We have to put everything on the line here or there will be nothing to save, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
146	Lord Commander! Embodiment of the world's so-called absolute justice!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
147	You, who represent the weaklings of the world... Destroying you is the first step to creating my new world!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0032
