001	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
002	Ngh...! Argh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
003	Grk... I didn't think...you'd...be able to...wear me down...so much.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
004	Haaa... Haaa... It doesn't matter...how strong you are! I'm not going to lose!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
005	So, you want more, huh? Fine...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
006	If you keep pushing yourself...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
007	If I lose this battle, it will mean that my justice has been defeated... That is no future I can bear to live in!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
008	It is only right that I stake my life on the outcome of this battle!
009	U-urgh... Gaaaaaaaah!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
010	Kudan!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
011	Urk...! Argh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
012	K-Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
013	Are they trying to burn everything to the ground?! What's with the power behind these attacks?!
014	Kudan! Have you lost your mind?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
015	Argh... Arghhhh! All...right... Here...I go! Ngh...! Hrrgh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
016	Captain Kudan...
017	Is your justice so important to you that you'll go this far just to defend it in battle?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
018	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
019	Look out! Kagura, run!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
020	Oh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
021	Ngh! Huzzah!!!
022	L-look out!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
023	Captain Kagura, are you alright?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
024	Y-yes... Thank you, everyone!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
025	Haaa... Haaa... It's not cool if I'm always the one being protected, y'know! Still...
026	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
027	Has he lost it?! He's even attacking you now! Does he intend to just cut down everything he sees?
028	Kudan... No, Kudan...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1008
029	Has he really fallen so far?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
030	No. Captain Kudan is a good man.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	Kanon!
032	For the future of all humankind, he is sacrificing himself and stepping into darkness.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
033	What you see before you is the result of his paying the price. Kagura, I want you to burn this image of him into your memory.
034	O-okay!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
035	Huzzaahhhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
036	Nnrk...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
037	Captain Kudan.... I swear that I will stop you, no matter what.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
038	Ngh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
039	You chose a different path than I did, and now you've followed it to its conclusion.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
040	All you have ever done has been with the future of Babel in mind, pure and simple. So, really...
041	Argh...! Nnrghhh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
042	If things had been different, I might have ended up where you are now.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
043	Grraaaaaaahh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
044	That's why I'm going to stop you! I have to stop you at any cost!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
045	I have to, because there's no one else... I'm the only one who can save you now! Huzzzaaaahhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
046	Ngh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
047	Please, let this reach you! Shining Holy Judgment!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
048	Ngh?! Argh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
049	I-is it over?!
050	Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
051	Haaa... Haaa... N-not yet... He's just lost consciousness.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
052	Still... Kudan has completely lost himself to the darkness, hasn't he?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
053	Yes...though I'm sorry to say it. Basheeny, what's the situation like over there?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
054	Reinforcements have arrived and the battle is turning in our favor.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
055	News of Orion's defeat is circulating, spreading unrest among the Greed Dike soldiers, so it's just a matter of time.
056	I see... Good.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
057	What's going to happen to Captain Kudan?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
058	He's already given himself over to the darkness. When he wakes, he will probably start attacking everything he sees again.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
059	No!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0016
060	I don't think Kudan ever wanted...this. Kanon, please... Put him to rest.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
061	No. I have absolutely no intention of killing Captain Kudan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
062	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
063	If I did that... I couldn't save his soul. I'm sure it would just wander the darkness forever.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
064	Then what do you intend to do?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
065	Kagura, do you remember what Chihaya told you?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
066	Chihaya...? You mean, the Chihaya we tried to save on that rescue mission?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
067	Yes. She told us that we must value our friends, right? That they're the ones who'll save us when we're in danger of being consumed by darkness?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
068	So I won't rest until I save Captain Kudan.
069	Save...?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
070	Yes. I will soothe his troubled soul.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
071	You don't mean...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
072	Yes. I will take him to the Door of Truth. Just as Captain Cadanova sealed Zahar.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
073	Wha—?! But if you do that...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
074	Even if I take him there, there's only a very slim chance that my plan will work.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
075	Regardless, I want to save Kudan... Kudan, who saved the world. This will be my final task as Lord Commander.
076	But...	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
077	Besides...I don't have much time left.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
078	What?! What do you mean?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
079	You can't mean...the Burning Seal?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
080	I do.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
081	Wha—?!
082	The power that Captain Monzein used?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
083	No way!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
084	It's all right. I have all of you. Friends who can fight on equal footing with the Greed Dike soldiers.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
085	Thanks to you, I can go and save Kudan without any regrets.
086	P-please, hold on! Isn't there a possibility that you can come back alive?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
087	There is, but...there is only a very slim chance of that.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
088	No!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
089	Basheeny... You have to be the one who supports the Holy Guard from here on out. Be strong.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
090	Huh?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
091	Kagura, Chloe... I need a favor. Basheeny is still young. I want you to help him rebuild the Holy Guard with him at the center.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0041
092	What?! W-wait a minute! What do you mean?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
093	Take this.
094	What? Excalibur...? Why?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
095	Basheeny... I, the 11th Lord Commander, appoint you as the 12th Lord Commander.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
096	What?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
097	There are no Captains left.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
098	Except for Kagura, whose duty is to devote her life to sealing the Mikaboshi away if it appears again.
099	I can't make her Lord Commander.
100	But why me?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
101	Well, I just kind of felt like you were the right person for the job.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
102	You're young, but you also know all too well how terrifying the power of darkness is.
103	Terrifying...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
104	Yes. So long as the true nature of Corpse remains unclear...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
105	I believe that it is necessary for the person who leads the Holy Guard to have a strong awareness of the power of darkness.
106	Corpse...!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
107	They are a dangerous entity. If we leave them be, they will eventually cause corruption in the Holy Guard again, and possibly even bring about its destruction.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
108	I think it would be best for us to expose the true nature of their existence as soon as possible.
109	All right. I'll do my best.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0038
110	Is this really the only way?	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
111	Yes... I'm sorry to put all of this on your shoulders.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
112	What are you talking about? No one can accuse the hero who saved the world of being selfish!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
113	Besides, you're doing all this to save Kudan. I'm the last person who can complain about it.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
114	Heheh... Kagura, you must live, so that you can pass on the history of what happened here to the next generation. You're the only one who can.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
115	I know. I will not let the significance of this battle fade, no matter what.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
116	Yup. That's why you have to get married.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
117	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
118	If you're passing something on to the next generation, it's easiest to start with your own children, don't you think?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
119	Well, you might have a hard time with that if you don't work on your feminine appeal a little more, though.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
120	Wha—?! What are you saying?! I don't want to hear that from you, airhead!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
121	C-come on... This isn't the time for this.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
122	Chloe, you need to try your best, too, okay?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
123	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
124	If you don't keep an eye on Captain Vettel, he'll be snatched up by someone else!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
125	Wh-what are you talking about?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0028
126	Heheh.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
127	Nnrgh...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
128	H-hey! He's waking up!
129	The darkness works faster than I thought. I guess...this is goodbye.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
130	Kanon!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
131	I want the two of you to live happily ever after, okay?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
132	What?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
133	Kanon...
134	Good luck, everyone! I wish you all the best!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0041
135	A-all...right.
136	Lord Commander Kanon!
137	Dangit! Is there nothing else we can do?!
138	Don't make that face. With this, I can save the world...and Captain Kudan. I'm counting on you guys.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
139	No matter what...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
140	Huh?
141	Someday, I will save you, Kanon! You have to live on, you airhead!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
142	I know you will. I'm counting on it.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0010
143	Nnrgh... Arrggghhhhhhhh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0019
144	Crap! He's awake!
145	Don't worry, Captain Kudan.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
146	Urgh... Nrghhh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
147	We have so many determined friends. I'm sure they will protect the peace of this world for us.
148	Nrgh...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
149	Huh?
150	Urgh... Nrrrghh...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
151	Captain Kudan is...crying?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
152	Kudan!
153	Oh... Captain Kudan must know that we'll never let him down!
154	All right, let's go!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
155	Lord Commander Kanon!
156	Goodbye, everyone. Goodbye, beloved world.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
157	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
158	No, Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
159	Kanon!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
160	Ngh! Wh-what was that light?!
161	No... This can't be happening.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
162	Kanon...
163	Lord Commander Kanon!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
164	That's...!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
165	The light of the Tower of Babel is...gone?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
166	Reporting! Reinforcements have arrived at the border of Lustburg and Gluttony Foss!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
167	Th-they will be here...any moment now! Thank...the gods.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
168	Suzuka! Are you all right?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
169	It's...the end of the battle. I can't afford to rest!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0024
170	Argh! Retreat! Retreat!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
171	Don't let them escape! Charge!!!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
172	They're retreating. Does this mean we won?	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
173	Seems like it. Whoa!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
174	Captain Vettel!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
175	It's fine. I'm just a little tired. Let's go eat something sweet when we get back, shall we?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
176	Yes!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0046
177	Gerald... It's over. It's finally over.	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
178	The light of the Tower of Babel has vanished?! What's going on over there?!
179	I don't know... It's a world beyond our wildest imagination.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
180	I suspect that everything was swallowed up by the world on the other side of the Door of Truth.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
181	Lord Commander Kanon... She's really...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
182	...
183	That can't be true, can it?!
184	That airhead... She became a fine Lord Commander right under our noses.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
185	No! Kanon! N-no... Nngh.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
186	So the Lion Monarch's Charge, which shook the people of Babel to their core and ensnared an entire continent, came to an end.
187	Having lost their true king, the Greed Dike soldiers submitted to Northern Pride and the other countries.
188	They swore to restore their home nation and then disappeared from history.
189	The Lion Monarch's Charge, which came at a very dear price, came to represent the absolute justice of the Holy Guard across Babel.
190	Faith in the Holy Guard was heightened, and for a while, the world enjoyed a time of peace.
191	This is the story of the knights who defined a certain era.
192	History recounts the stories of those fiery souls who overcame the greatest threat that the world has ever known, and became legends.
193	Hey! Go and tell them to send people over here, too!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
194	What?! No! The palace is in need of more workers! Send some this way!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
195	Nngh...	VO_orione.orione_battle_0021
196	Urgh! N-not yet... I am not finished! I-I can...still—!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0024
197	Sadly, you are mistaken. The curtain has already fallen.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
198	What?!
199	I am somewhat surprised you were not able to succeed in resurrecting Nimul.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
200	W-Waginau! What...are you doing? J-just standing there?! C-come here and...heal me!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0027
201	No, it is too late for you. You are no longer able to house Nimul's soul within you.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0039
202	Wh-what?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0025
203	No matter. Another Vessel of Reincarnation will be born soon enough. It's only a matter of a few decades.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
204	Decades are nothing compared to the millennia I've waited. It will be nothing more than the blink of an eye to me.
205	M-millennia?! Wh-what are you talking about?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0025
206	Your end is near. Let this be a parting gift.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
207	My name is Waginau Cradle. I lived among Nimul and Emmel at the time of Alchemy's creation.
208	C-Cradle?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0026
209	I-I've heard...of... Y-you can't be!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0042
210	The founder and first Lord Commander of the Holy Guard?!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0003
211	You are well educated. Indeed, I am he.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
212	I-it can't be! How can this be?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0020
213	In all of history, none have come as close to resurrecting Nimul as you have. Sadly, you chose to kill Emmel's Vessel of Reincarnation.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
214	Unfortunately, that was the nail in the coffin for you. Had you not done that, Nimul would not have rejected you.
215	N-Nimul...rejected me?!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0022
216	The two of them wish to be reunited. As do I. At least you have served well as a fine example of one possible outcome.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
217	I will remember your deeds; particularly which ones to avoid. Well done.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
218	Urgh...! Grk... Huzzaaaah!!!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0026
219	!!!
220	I am the Lion Monarch! If I am to go down, I will take you with me!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0042
221	Agh!	VO_waginao.waginao_battle_0024
222	Gh! Nngh! S-so...this is how...it ends. Waginau...you're coming with me!	VO_orione.orione_battle_0024
223	I'm sorry to say that you'll be dying alone today. I must bear witness to the reunion of Nimul and Emmel.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
224	Nng...Urgh... Y-you...!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0019
225	Farewell, Lion Monarch.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
226	H-how...disappointing.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0043
227	Hmph. This presence... So those with true grit still exist.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
228	Nimul, Emmel, sleep for now. We shall meet again soon enough.
229	I will prepare the appropriate vessels for you before then. Heh. Haha... Hahaha!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
230	Captain Kagura! We've confirmed that all Greed Dike forces have withdrawn from Northern Pride!
231	Are our forces pursuing them?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
232	As you've commanded, the soldiers are avoiding excessive pursuit.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
233	Thank you. We should focus for now on restoring our chain of command. Everything else can wait until the Emperor's condition recovers. Got it, Basheeny?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0033
234	Huh?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
235	Don't "Huh?" me, Basheeny. You're the Lord Commander now. You're supposed to be the one calling the shots.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
236	Oh! Right. Uh...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
237	The damage here is far more devastating than what our country suffered.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
238	Yeah... Who knows how long it will take and what it will cost them to rebuild.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
239	I don't think there's really anything to worry about.	VO_spica.spica_sys_1011
240	Huh?
241	It looks like Kanon's willpower was inherited by everyone here.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
242	Of course we have! If we don't take it on, then who will?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0037
243	Glad to hear you're so pumped up about this, but have you considered doing something a little more effective than talking? Like...actually working?
244	Hey! You're still just a squire! You can't tell me what to do!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
245	Uh, so... Could I maybe borrow you two for a second?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
246	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
247	Um... As the new Lord Commander, there's something I feel like I must do.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0047
248	Well? You're Lord Commander now, so you don't need our permission to do anything.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_2017
249	Oh! Right! Okay, then... Bud! Victor! Draw your swords!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
250	What?!
251	You trying to start a fight? Here? Now?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
252	No, no, no. Lord Commander Kanon entrusted the future to us, the younger generation.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
253	I was thinking we ought to make a vow to solidify our will.
254	A vow?
255	We should set our captains' minds at ease by showing them how earnest we are about building a peaceful future. Besides, the timing seems right.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
256	A bit of a romantic, aren't you? All right, let's do it!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0009
257	Ugh... Do you have to be so excited about everything all the time?
258	Well...the future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.
259	Hey! I was about to say that! I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
260	It's our duty to build the peaceful future our captains hoped for!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
261	Don't worry. We will tend to the flames you've lit within us.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0011
262	Kanon, Kudan... I hope you're seeing this. This is how your justice will be passed on to future generations.
