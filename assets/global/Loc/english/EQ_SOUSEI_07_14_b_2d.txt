001	Hah...hah... Superb!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0011
002	Was there really no other way, Lord Kubera?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
003	No way to mix our ideals into your path of becoming the strongest?
004	This was enough. I finally feel good for the first time in my life.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0037
005	How long has it been since I lost this badly? Or, perhaps... Heh.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
006	Nimul. In my final moments, heed my warning.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0003
007	Of course.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
008	The priestess of Ouroboros, Bianca, is not an ally to humans.
009	She is only taking the measure of we foreign entities on this world of ours.
010	Her power will be needed to save this world. However, you cannot entrust everything to her.
011	Head to the land of pride... There, you will find the key to the reaching the gods.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
012	Oh, the greed within my heart. It is truly...truly...	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0007
013	.........
014	I will remember this well, Lord Kubera.
015	Lord Kubera...
016	He lived his life to the fullest. And met his end without regrets as a person of Avaritia does.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
017	I know...but... But...!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0018
018	So, Kubera passed?
019	Master Roh Ku?
020	I am now just Roh. The leader of our region has died. We must hold a funeral worthy of him.
021	Allow me to assist you.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
022	Please.
023	Honestly... You fool. I never thought you would die before me.
024	Master...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0018
025	Heh. The older I get, the more prone to tears I become.
026	We knew each other for quite some time.
027	I would craft better gear and he would cut down the appropriate enemies. That was the extent of our relationship, and yet...
028	Forgive me... I cannot say more.
029	If you would, leave us alone for a moment.
030	All right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
031	Another life has slipped through my fingers.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
032	But that was the end he hoped for. We have no right to say anything against it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
033	I suppose you're right...
034	By the way, how are you doing? Ambrosia treated you, right?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
035	About that...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0005
036	I can't fix you.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0039
037	What did you just say?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
038	I said, I can't fix you. This isn't your body from the future.
039	It seems it was left in the snare of time, outside the Shell of the World.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
040	Then...I died?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
041	I don't know. It is an area even I still don't know much about.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
042	Although, it hasn't affected the present you.
043	You have some of your memories from the future, and that's not all.
044	I'd say you got a pretty good deal.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
045	No, the future will change...or, rather, it already has changed, hasn't it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
046	Ambrosia, what will become of this world?
047	Nothing will change.
048	Nothing?
049	I am the dawn of Space-Time Manipulators. Do really you think I haven't thought about this? It is forbidden to rewrite the past.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0039
050	That's...
051	I've performed countless experiments. I've tried my hand at changing things many times.
052	The member of the Infinite Serpent who planned to change the past, that Space-Time Manipulator was Quence, huh?
053	Hmph, that idiot was probably blinded by some far-off goal and neglected his foothold.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0020
054	You can tell just by running some tests and going back into the past just a little bit.
055	You cannot change the history of the regions because the events observed by the gods of this world are fixed at their times.
056	The gods of this world are surprisingly diligent on this point.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0039
057	They are always watching what we do. The tragedy, the despair, the joy, the fighting... All tangible memories with recollections.
058	Because humans without the right to access the laws of world can't disrupt or destroy anything.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
059	So long as the gods who set those laws linger, the past will never change.
060	Except for the Avaritia Belt, which the gods turned a blind eye to long before it was destroyed.
061	They turned a blind eye to it?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
062	That's if you believe that Fallen Zafeiris's story. If you want to know more, you should ask him.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
063	And that's all that I can say for now.
064	Long story short, stop worry about things. Whatever happens here, you'll leave here and be reunited with them eventually.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
065	Does this mean that I did die in the future?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0027
066	As I said before, I don't know. But my apprentices make it back safely.
067	I suppose you might be able to call it "back" if you use that whippersnapper Nimul's technique, maybe.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
068	You are too nonchalant about this!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0019
069	Ambrosia, that's...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0022
070	My body may be dead already.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
071	No.
072	I feel you on the other side. It's all right; you are alive.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
073	R-really?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
074	If we return to our time, I'll bring you back. Along with that girl, Benika.
075	Nimul...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
076	Oh! Brother! And you're here, too, Nimul!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0003
077	Skree!
078	Benika?! If you run so much, you might—	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
079	Geez, you're such a worrywart.	VO_benika.benika_sys_0012
080	My body feels so much better thanks to Luke.
081	So, I can do a bit more.
082	I see.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
083	Oh! And I'm getting things ready for the celebration!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
084	What celebration?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
085	A lot of people died and the town is pretty battered, but...	VO_benika.benika_sys_0031
086	We can't stay down in the dumps forever, and that time would go to waste.
087	That is true... Is there something we can do to help out?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
088	Time...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
089	She doesn't have long to live. She was born a Fallen and her sire, Mammon, has been destroyed.
090	But there is still time. Even if we cannot foresee the future before us...
091	We still have time to dream about tomorrow.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
092	(I still wish Benika was able to have a longer and happier life.)
093	(This is sin... A wish gone too far, something that was meant to be lost...)
094	(Something that you should just be glad endured until now.)
226	The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.
227	The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.
095	And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0019
096	They were not born into this region.
097	That is what has led to this ending.	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0002
098	Lord Kubera's parting words may have been right.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
099	The greed within my heart...
100	No matter how much I may try to restrain myself, I am still a descendant of this region and the people of Avaritia.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
101	Hey, you, over there! This is an Avaritian specialty!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0007
102	Skree!
103	Whoa! That looks good!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0046
228	Oh, allow me to help you as well, Benika.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
229	Thank you!	VO_benika.benika_sys_0033
104	You came back pretty quick, Mira. Did you actually wash your hands?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
105	Quit acting like I'm a kid when I'm older than you! What do you take me for?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
106	My younger twin.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0006
107	You know I'm older than you! What, are you going through a rebellious phase?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0013
108	Sheesh, you two never change.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
109	Heheh, really?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0008
110	That wasn't a compliment.
111	Oh, um... Sorry, Ambrosia.	VO_mela.mela_sys_0036
112	That came out of nowhere. What's the deal?
113	Mmm... I just am.
114	.........
115	If you're talking about Libra, it's all right.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
116	I always knew you two would break it eventually.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
117	What?! How rude! That's what you think of us, Ambrosia?!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0012
118	But you did, didn't you?
119	Well, we can't deny that. I'm sorry, Ambrosia.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0007
120	Oh, Nyx! You're such a good boy, properly apologizing! You, on the other hand...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0006
121	Ugghhh! So I'm the bad one, again?!
122	They look like they are having fun.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
123	Are you all right? You took on all that corruption...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
124	The corruption actually wasn't that strong. It was within the scope that Spiritbonding could purify.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0039
125	Naturally. My technique is that of a dragon's. I can control corruption more perfectly than any human could.
126	Well, that is a very interesting point.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
127	Why exactly are you helping us?
128	It was the will of my princess, the being you call a God.
129	As one who set the laws of this world... Is this really all right with you? One day, we will have to—
130	I do not know... I no longer know.
131	What?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
132	My princess will soon fall to sin, and the corruption of the human world has seeped into the laws of the world.
133	What lies at the far side of that is the same outcome as that of the Cursed Beasts.
134	Law will be driven to madness by sin.
135	And if that occurs, her will will be no more. Before that happens, I would like to...
136	I want to allow her to sleep quietly, just as she did for us when she attended the final moments of my dragonkin.
137	That is my sole wish.
138	.........
139	(This man is the enemy. He caused the Gula Belt Region to fall into sin, and he hurt my comrades from my hometown. And yet, I...)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
140	Her power will be needed to save this world. However, you cannot entrust everything to her.
141	(I'm sorry, Zafeiris, but I am going to use your feelings...)
142	(To save the world...and Emmel.)
143	Well, that was one crazy adventure! Not that it's over yet, but still.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
144	Is there a way to return us to our proper time?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
145	Spending ten years here like this is a little... I have been thinking about this a bit.
146	The townspeople have been very kind, but...
147	It kinda feels like they're depressed. I heard they were obsessed with the pursuit of strength, but now they're...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
148	They've lost their purpose in life. They spent decades battling in order to defeat the Cursed Beast, so it makes sense, right?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
149	It's kinda like a type of occupational burnout, huh?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0031
150	They're a spirited bunch, so give them some time and they'll find a new purpose and move towards it all on their own.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0010
151	I hope you're right.
152	Oh, yeah. Nimul, Ambrosia said she had something she wanted to talk with you about.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0002
153	Ambrosia did?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
154	Adaleigh, are you actually Ambrosia's apprentice or something?	VO_minario.minario_sys_0003
155	Nah, letting her think so makes her happy. See, she even gave me a piece of candy just a second ago.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
156	You've...gotten craftier.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0011
157	What?! It's not like I'm doing something wrong!
158	What did Ambrosia want to talk about?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
159	We can return to our time whenever you want to.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
160	That's wonderful news!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
161	That said, I don't know what the future will be like now that we've changed the past here.
162	Did I...make a mistake?
163	Don't ask me, greenhorn.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0005
164	Listen, boy. Right or wrong is just a scale humans have made.
165	What others think of your actions just reflects their own opinion.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
166	Now let me ask you, do you regret your actions?
167	No.
168	Then, that's the answer.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
169	Thank you, Ambrosia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
170	Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. I just despise depressing conversations.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
171	More importantly! Have you decided on a name?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
172	Huh? A name for what?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
173	A name for your group, of course! The bad guys are called the Infinite Serpent, right? So, we need a name as well!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0003
174	I don't see why it's necessary...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0011
175	Stingy. I work myself to the bone to help you. You don't feel the slightest bit embarrassed?
176	Um...
177	Nimuuul? Ambrosia's a little drunk at the moment, so don't listen to anything she says!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
178	So, how about it? What's a good name for us?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
179	Hmmm, maybe...
180	The compassion that triumphs over envy. The tolerance that repels rage. The control that resists gluttony.
181	The innocence untainted by lust. The diligence to traverse over sloth. The loyalty to surpass pride.
182	And the prudence not to be swayed by greed. And yet... And yet...!	VO_mammon.mammon_battle_0019
183	Babel.
184	What do you think about the Seven Knights of Babel?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
185	We're battling the seven sins. There's seven virtues... That not bad, buuut...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
186	There's my two apprentices, plus the machine one.... Our blacksmith, our knight... The other cutie knight... The priestess, You...and your sister...
187	Aren't there nine of us?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
188	Please don't count my sister in this.
189	Besides...you said there are seven virtues, right?
190	I am not one who bears any of those traits.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
191	The people who carry the Gears of Judgment and fight the Cursed Beasts in the regions we've visited up until now are.
192	Those who have mastered the seven virtues... I think they're the ones who should call themselves the Seven Knights.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
193	So that's your reasoning, huh?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0045
194	Did you just remove me from the group without a second thought?	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
195	Oops, sorry, sorry! See, you're more like the type that would do best as rear support, so...	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0036
196	I am still a commander, I'll have you know!
197	Now, now. It's because you must take care of Sephira Village after all this is over.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
198	What are you talking about, Nimul? You are the chief of the village.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0006
199	Well, that is true... Haha.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0007
200	Oh, honestly. Pull yourself together.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0030
201	(I've had the feeling in the back of my mind that I will eventually no longer be able to exist in this loop.)
202	(If the goal of the Infinite Serpent, the Ceremony of Creation, leads to their unhappiness...)
203	(If we cannot stop it, I will give my life for a tomorrow where Emmel and the others can spend their days smiling.)
204	(Am I that unreliable? Recently, I've been unable to tell what you are thinking, Nimul.)	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_1018
205	(It feels as if you might go somewhere far away at any moment...)
206	Well then, what about your sister?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
207	I can't find her.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
208	Emmel might be trapped in the snare of time Mira and Nyx ended up in.
209	Could you find her the same way you did us?
210	I'll give it a try. Where is...?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0004
211	There. Now everything is ready.
212	All that's left is for you to choose something.
213	But we all know what the answer will be. Right, Emmel?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0007
214	Haaa...haaa...	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0018
215	Who...are you?
216	It's truly surprising how similar you both look.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0044
217	What?
218	A child lost in Space-Time. You are a Space-Time Manipulator, are you not? Then leave. This is not a place you wish to be.
219	That is certainly true.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
220	But my new boss just had to meet you.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
221	What?	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_battle_0022
222	Nice to meet you. Or maybe I should say it's nice to see you again?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
223	You... I see. So you have finally made it here.
224	I'm sorry that I have to do this when you so kindly shouldered my burden.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0036
225	But I need all the Cursed Beast cores that you stole, Ouroboros.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
