001	Just two more.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
002	...
003	One's true worth is measured at the twilight of their life.
004	Come, Dead Nine.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
005	The Veda Templars... Will they be useful?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0001
006	That is precisely what we shall see.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0004
007	The Sun of Lost Blue, and a fallen king. Let us see who will win.
008	What fool would challenge the Sun?	VO_orione.orione_sys_0010
009	One who would be burned.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
010	The outcome is obvious.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
011	That may be true...if he truly is the Sun.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
012	Whichever way it falls, we will benefit.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
013	A sun found underground... Hmph.
014	Nothing for a Lion above ground to fear.
015	My ninth failure. I figured I wouldn't have another chance.
016	I'm going to climb Veda. No one will come with me. I can't even make it to the hundredth floor again.
017	Everything just returned to how it used to be. Alone in this cesspool, taking on dirty jobs...
018	Power is everything. I am the law. Nothing has changed about my strength.
019	I would have figured I'd be hated by now.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0002
020	By whom?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
021	By the people of Lost Blue, you lot from Greed Dike...and that cat.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
022	The Veda Templars... They have been undertaking all the dirty jobs we have to offer. The higher ups in Greed Dike are beginning to value them greatly.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
023	They haven't missed a single assassination target. Not to mention their efficiency. Not a single trace of them can be found from infiltration to retreat.
024	It has something to do with their dimensional powers, I believe.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0037
025	Our payments seem to be providing for Lost Blue pretty well.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0045
026	Heh. I'm losing business, thanks to them.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
027	Unfortunately, we have ourselves a situation.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
028	You seem to be doing well from where I stand.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0006
029	Those Templars... We believe that each time they work a job on the surface, they are gathering Philosopher's Stones and bringing them back down here.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
030	They've even started demanding that we provide Philosopher's Stones, Sacred Stones, or some treasure of equal standing as payment for their jobs.
031	We have no idea what they are planning, but some have begun seeing them as a threat.
032	...
033	We have plenty of other mercenaries to call upon in their place. Like you, for example.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
034	And I assume I'm just as expendable as they are?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0030
035	The annihilation of the Veda Templars before they become a threat against Greed Dike... That is your mission.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
036	Are you serious?
037	Aren't you the king of Lost Blue?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
038	...
039	I'm no king.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0016
040	The ninth seat is still open.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
041	I thought I won that fight over this.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
042	That's why I'm practically begging you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
043	That hard to gather ten members, huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
044	I can't ask just anybody. I secured up to eight members just recently, however.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
045	Why me?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
046	I told you, I like you.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
047	...
048	I want you to be the ninth.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
049	Sol.
050	Welcome back, Zwei.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
051	Will you praise her, Sol? She eliminated the most hostiles on the last mission.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
052	Fabulous work, Zwei!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0024
053	Oh, um... Thanks, Acht.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
054	Your efforts will not be in vain.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
055	Sol, won't you praise me, as well? It's just so hard, taking care of so many of your people all at once.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
056	V-Vier...! Do you have to press against him like that?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
057	Hm? Why not? Do you want to join in?	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
058	I... Uh... No, I'm still sweaty from the mission... So...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
059	That's fine. Let's get sweaty together.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0016
060	Wha—?! P-please, Vier! Stop that!	VO_acht.acht_sys_0015
061	Um...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
062	W-will you please at least get off of him?! S-Sol seems inconvenienced.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0043
063	Oh? He looks happy enough to me.	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
064	Um... I-I did my... Uh, best...too.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
065	You weren't elegant at all though.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
066	W-well I do curses... So, elegance really isn't... Y-you know...?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
067	Well, I was watching you, Füry. Your skills were dazzling, though not as dazzling as mine.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
068	Dazzling? But... I curse people. I-I don't think I should be...	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0047
069	...
070	Don't get the wrong idea. There are guys too. They're just not here right now. You think I'm just building a harem?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
071	I know how women are treated here in Lost Blue.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0004
072	It's rare to see young girls like them smiling the way they are.
073	I can tell you're doing right by them.
074	Yeah.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
075	Dead Nine...
076	I figure this line-up is in consideration for how that one still has issues with men, right?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0007
077	Dead Nine... Will you—?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
078	No. I won't be your ninth.	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0010
079	Dead Nine...!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0029
080	Yeah?
081	Um... I-I...	VO_zwei.zwei_battle_0019
082	Don't worry. You chose this of your own will, right?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0011
083	It's not that.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0018
084	I'm almost there.
085	I'll almost be strong enough to help you.
086	Huh?	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_1017
087	So...
088	I'm sorry, for now.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0036
089	Nngh?! Aaaaaaah!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
090	What?!
091	Blurgck! Blarglarglarglargh...! Gehck! Ah... Blaaaaaghck!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0028
092	Hey! Rat-Killer?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0022
093	I-I'm...okay! Gahck! Nng! Blegh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0022
094	How did it come to this?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0026
095	Ah...
096	Zwei.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
097	Blarglarglarglargh! Gah! Bleckh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0019
098	I need you to get ready for your next mission.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
099	What?!
100	Hurry.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
101	Nnnf...! Blgh! Bleeeeegh!	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
102	Let's go.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0007
103	Hold it!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0015
104	Would you mind?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
105	Gauntlets.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
106	You...!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
107	Sword.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0004
108	Axe.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0001
109	Get out of my way!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0018
110	I'll hold him.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0014
111	Go.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
112	You don't mind?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
113	Then, please, take care.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
114	So that's how it is, huh?! You nihilist freak! You just order them around from above, while they get hurt in your stead?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0013
115	Haa... Haa... Huff... Huff...	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0043
116	Dead Nine...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
117	We won't let anybody own us again, remember?! Rat-Killer!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0001
118	...
119	Do you intend to kill her?! You're just gonna use her until she's dead?! Are we all just tools to you?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0021
120	How dare you claim to be the sun!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
121	Have you no rules to live by?!
122	Rat-Killer!
123	What's with all of you?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0013
124	We're comrades.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
125	Then how can you stand around and let this happen?!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0017
126	I will kill those who hurt my friends by any means necessary! That's my rule!
127	Do none of you feel the same?!
128	I'm sorry.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
129	I never had anybody I could call a true comrade until I met her!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0018
130	She puked up nine beers worth of blood!
131	I have to help her! I have to be there for her!
132	We promised to see the blue sky together!
133	She was the one who made me understand! Meeting her helped me realize...!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_battle_0019
134	There's no point to anything if you're alone!	VO_neun_neun-b.neun_sys_0032
