001	Hey there, Toritoh—and Toritoh's lovely friends! I'm Patty!	VO_patty.patty_chara_1001
002	Oh, hello! I'm Alphonse. You're quite cheerful for a Phantom.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0007
003	Patty is a Phantom I transmuted when I was still a child... After becoming General, I never thought we would meet again.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
004	I called on her because she's originally from Envylia, but also...
005	I'm here to help refresh your spirits with one of the Envylia Troupe's performances!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0005
006	A show that features alchemy? Interesting! This seems kind of incompatible with your personality, though, Toritoh. Are you really okay with it?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0046
007	Patty protected me when I was just a child and under attack by some adults who wanted me gone.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
008	Then, she showed me a really fun performance.
009	I had forgotten...but those memories have been coming back to me recently.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
010	My soul is meant for something more than just disappearing forever.
011	Oh, how wonderful! I'm so pleased you remembered! I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much this time!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0023
012	Envylia, a country named after the sin of Envy. The homunculus protecting this place must be...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0016
013	Hello, little brother. Haven't you gotten your body back yet?	VO_edo.edo_sys_0007
014	Could you not? Even if you look like him, no one really believes that you're Ed.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0022
015	Heh. You know me too well. I suppose it doesn't matter what form I'm in.	VO_envy.envy_sys_0010
016	You know... If I destroy you, there won't be anyone left in this world who knows who I really am. I better bring my A-game.	VO_envy.envy_sys_0031
017	He can transform?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
018	Wow! I've always wanted someone like that in my troupe!	VO_patty.patty_sys_0046
019	Ugh, shut up! If you get in my way, I'll just destroy you, too!	VO_envy.envy_battle_0019
