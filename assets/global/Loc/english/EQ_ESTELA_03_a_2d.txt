001	Hyaaaah!	VO_amis.amis_battle_0010
002	Urgh… Dammit…
003	Whew… We took care of that one.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
004	Yes. You saved me.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0005
005	Thank you very much. How are you feeling now, Amis?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0033
006	Good. Feeling better. I woke up soonafter.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
007	Then I heard you came back here to do a reading, so I came and checked on you.
008	…
009	Amis…?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0003
010	Hey, Estella. Was the reading you were trying to do a little risky?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0001
011	As in…having a risk of harming yourself?
012	Why…do you think that?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0026
013	If you're accustomed to attacks, you should normally be able to easily take down thugs like this one.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0031
014	But something seemed wrong. Like you couldn't move freely or something.
015	…
016	Your power for fortune telling is amazing. That's why I wanted to rely on that power, to do whatever I could.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0011
017	But if there's a risk of injuring yourself... I can't ask you to do this. I shouldn't rely on you completely.
054	Even though you're worried about the outcome of the ceremony?
018	I know… But this is something I need to do for myself.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0005
019	You really are an amazing person.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0007
020	You're right. The fortune telling I tried to do just now sharpened my senses. And by doing so, I gained the power to perceive things that normal people can't.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0005
021	And now, I'm going to use this power. Because you helped me look at fortune telling in a positive light.
028	…!
055	I want to see a brighter future. I want to support that cause.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0008
058	You made me remember. Why I wanted to become a fortune teller.
029	But…for you to possibly get injured…	VO_amis.amis_sys_0031
030	You were also going a little too far, all for your dreams, right?	VO_estella.estella_sys_0002
031	I want to do my best, just like you. For my dreams.
032	Estella…
033	Thank you for having my dreams return to me.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0033
034	…
035	I think I should be the one saying thanks. I can't let you go too far.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0001
036	Hm. Going too far for work sounds like you're talking about yourself!	VO_estella.estella_sys_0025
037	Fine… I get what you're saying.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0007
038	I want tomorrow's ceremony to be a success. For mechanical engineering... No. For the future of mankind.
039	That's what I need your help with.
040	Hold it right there!
041	…?!
042	Drinking tea in plain sight as a bureau worker. How pathetic.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0010
056	I didn't expect a traitor to just be wandering around the bureau.	VO_megistus.megistus_sys_0007
043	We were focused on security for the train that he almost got away.	VO_amis.amis_sys_0012
044	Grr…
045	You did all this… Why did you try to disrupt the whole ceremony?	VO_amis.amis_sys_0016
046	Why…?
047	It should be obvious. Because it was supposed to be a grand stage for you.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
048	…!	VO_amis.amis_sys_0020
049	I wanted to have the whole thing cancelled, but that would've caused a lot of problems. As I am also part of the Central Technology Bureau.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0004
057	You were nervous about the ceremony. If something bad had happened, you'd have a complete breakdown.
050	But even though there was a sabotage, you made quick recoveries.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
051	On top of that, they didn't expect fortune teller to help.	VO_estella.estella_sys_0010
052	…! Dammit…Well then…	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
053	I'll have to make sure that you'll never see the ceremony come to fruition!
