001	Amazing! These are the sacred tools used by the legendary blacksmith!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0046
002	With these, you can start the restoration of Excalibur, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0024
003	No, I'll need something else too.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0031
004	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
005	The damage done to Excalibur is so great, that this Philosopher's Stone won't do to completely restore it.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
006	What? Then what are we supposed to do? Kagura is in grave danger. We don't have any time left!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
007	Calm down. Do you think we'd have come here if there was no hope?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
008	...!<br>Do we have an alternative then?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0020
009	Yes. Rather than making up for the lack of Philosopher's Stone, we'll use the ultimate resource, which is overflowing with it.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
010	If we combine this with Excalibur, we should be able to give birth to the ultimate version of the Holy Sword.
011	Umm, what do you mean with the ultimate resource?
012	That one.<br>The Guren Blade which Cadanova entrusted to you.
013	Huh?<br>Captain Cadanova's sword?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
014	Guren Blade possesses an overwhelming energy which far surpasses this Philosopher's Stone.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
015	If we were able to merge it with Excalibur...
016	it would most definitely bring forth the most powerful sword in the whole world.
017	It's just that this does involve a big risk.
018	A risk?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
019	The essence of Guren Blade's overwhelming energy is a power of darkness.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0005
020	If this power of darkness were to suppress Excalibur's power of light...
021	in the worst case, it could erase Excalibur from existence.
022	What?!<br>Is that really possible?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0021
023	There is hope though.<br>It all depends on your ability.
024	My ability?
025	Right. If you were able to suppress the chaotic power of darkness...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
026	we should be able to merge these two blades.
027	...!
028	In other words...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0030
029	the faith of the Holy Sword Excalibur rests completely on your shoulders.
030	Let me warn you though.<br>Even if things go well, there are no guarantees.
031	If all conditions are met, our chances of restoring Excalibur would be about fifty-fifty.
032	...
033	When you say that Kanon could suppress the power of darkness, I suppose that in the worst case, the opposite could happen too, right?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
034	What would happen if Kanon were to get overwhelmed by the power of darkness?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
035	I suppose you're aware how that Kudanstein guy had changed.
036	...!
037	Captain Cadanova...
038	I would like to use the sword you entrusted to me, in order to restore the Holy Sword Excalibur.
039	In order to save Kagura, my comrade. You wouldn't mind, would you?
040	Kanon...
041	I will do it.
042	If we want to save Kagura, and in order to create a future for all of us, we don't have any other option!
043	Well said. But be assured. These swords we're about to merge are Zain's and Cadanova's.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0007
044	Their mutual friendship will definitely bind these swords together. Come on, let's get this once-in-a-lifetime gamble started!
045	Yes!
046	Huh?!<br>W-what?!
047	...!
048	Hey... what's happening outside? Did the monsters come to bring us some water?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
049	Well... there's not too many of them though.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0004
050	Tsk! Why now at this crucial time?! Let's go, Chloe!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
051	No, you have a task to fulfill, don't you? This is a job for me.
052	Huh? Do you really intend to fight those monsters alone?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
053	Hey, who do you think I am? I am Chloe, a knight of the Scarlet Flame Guard. Do you really think those monsters could possibly take me out?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0010
054	But...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
055	Come on, don't get in my way now! This is a great opportunity for me to shine, and to earn plenty of Lord Vettel's praise!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0015
056	You need to save as much of your energy as you can.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
057	You should accept her offer.
058	Alright then.<br>Good luck, Chloe.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
059	This is a serious situation after all. Isn't your task way more important than mine?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
060	Please just don't mess this up in some clumsy fashion, alright?
061	Chloe...
062	Come on, let's get things started here too.
063	Okay!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
064	Huh?! W-what's up with these numbers?! There's much more of them than I anticipated!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0028
065	A-and there's still more coming?! I could really be getting myself in trouble here!
066	Let's do this!<br>Show some spirit!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0032
067	I'm ready!
068	...Right.<br>Kanon is putting herself on the line as well!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
069	I can't possibly run away either! Please, Lord Vettel! Lend me your strength!!!
070	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
071	Huh?! The monsters just got blown away?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
072	That's where they're restoring Excalibur, right?
073	Spica?! W-wait!<br>What about Seida and Captain Monzein?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
074	My apologies, but I didn't have time for idle talk.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
075	Oh man...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0013
076	I will never let you get past me!<br>I will stop you right here!
077	Chloe of the Scarlet Flame Guard... You also had a part in killing Lord Zahar.
078	Tsk! Is it us you're after? Or are you after Excalibur?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
079	I came here for you two.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
080	As long as I don't get to know more about you two, I cannot judge whether I should steal Excalibur or not.
081	Huh? What do you mean by that?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
082	“If Excalibur is left in the Holy Guard's hands, the world will be ruled by chaos.”
083	That's what Lord Zahar said.<br>Whether that statement is true or not...
084	also in order to make that judgment, I want to get to know you two.
085	You want to get to know us? You didn't come here to exact revenge?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0042
086	Vettel...
087	Huh?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
088	You called out this name to ask for strength.
089	That Vettel... would that be Captain Vettel from the Scarlet Flame Guard, who opposed Lord Zahar at every single turn?
090	Exactly. Whenever I'm facing a tough situation, I always try to imagine what Lord Vettel would do. I highly respect him.
091	You don't mind that I called his name, do you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0010
092	You respect him?<br>I can feel some other feelings in your words.
093	Huh?
094	Could it be that you are in love with Vettel?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
095	What?! W-why would that concern you?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0028
096	We must be quite similar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
097	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0021
098	I'm the same as you.
099	I also always find myself wondering what Lord Zahar would have done.
100	It's true that your relation to Zahar may be similar to my relation to Lord Vettel.
101	But even though we're similar, you managed to succeed where I failed.
102	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
103	I was unable to stop Lord Zahar, but you succeeded in that.
104	I wonder why that is.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0002
105	Why I was able to stop him?
106	I want to know the reason for that.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0038
107	Tsk...<br>At any rate, I will not allow you to approach Kanon.	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
