001	Agh...?!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0024
002	Where...am I?
003	Looks like you're yourself again.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
004	You're Seida of the Alize people! What am I doing here?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0027
005	It seems like you were under some kind of curse. You don't remember?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0031
006	A curse?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0025
007	Heh... It seems like you're right. I'm ashamed of myself.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
008	Did you remember something?
009	It's the opposite. I don't remember anything after I ran into that man.
010	That man. You can't be talking about...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
011	I don't know his name, but he was a strange one. He was dressed completely in black.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0031
012	I knew it!
013	His name is Waginau and he's a really bad guy!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
014	As the Holy Guard, we are on a mission to defeat Waginau and those who pull the strings behind him.
015	Hm. I see. I can sort of agree with you. He obviously didn't seem like a good person.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0005
016	Then why did you let him cast a spell on you?! You should've run away immediately!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0016
017	Of course, I had no intention to indulge him. However, he told me that knew the location of the Godwolf Asena's nest.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0004
018	The Godwolf Asena?
019	It's a legendary wolf that originates here in Saga. It is said to be the beast that is closest to the gods.
020	It's the prey that I've dedicated my life to. That man showed me the Godwolf's fur that glistened with the colors of the rain. He told me that he knew where its nest was.
021	And he asks you to defeat us in exchange for the location of the nest?
022	It appears so.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0011
023	I had no intention of listening to him, but he took advantage of my wavering heart. I am quite ashamed of myself.	VO_merda.merda_sys_0034
024	If that's the case, we're done here. I told you earlier, but we're in a hurry.
025	No, I can't let you go.
026	Why?	VO_almira.almira_sys_0025
027	It doesn't sit well with me to let you continue on after my discourteous actions against you. If there's something I can do, I'd like to assist you.
028	What an inefficient offer. We take no offense by your earlier actions.	VO_caida.caida_battle_0010
029	It's a matter of my own conscience. Perhaps all I can do is offer my services as a bodyguard, but please let me make up for it.
030	A bodyguard? Ohh, Seida! The people of Alize...!
031	Is there something I can do? Please, do not hesitate to ask. This will also stand as proof of the friendship between my people and yours.
032	You're right. Well then, would you go to the clinic that is further up ahead from here?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
033	There you should find those from my people of Alize sheltered there. I want you to take them somewhere far away.
034	Hmm. So your people are at the clinic. Understood. Leave it to me!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0006
035	She's gone. All things said she was a good person.
036	Yes. Although somewhat simple-minded. Let's hurry on as well.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0037
037	There's nowhere left for you to hide. Show us your identity.
038	Welcome, knights of the Holy Guard, Captain of the 4th...and Demonic Spearman Kudanstein.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0004
039	So...it wasn't a trick of the eye after all.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0022
040	What are you doing here?! Emperor of Greed Dike...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
041	Lion Monarch Orion!
