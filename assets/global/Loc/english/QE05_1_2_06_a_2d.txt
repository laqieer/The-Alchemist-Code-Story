001	And then...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
002	There's...nothing left.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
003	Not quite. Ashes and burned ruins remain. There is no question that this was once a village.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
004	...
005	W-wait! Hisham, where are you going?	VO_ishido.ishido_favorite_0005
006	My house used to be here!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
007	Next to it was my best friend's house! The elders of the village were incredibly kind, and we all looked forward to the few times merchants would stop in the village!
008	Every day was a struggle, but everyone always took the time to laugh and enjoy life, too! And yet...
009	Hisham...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_favorite_1007
010	Wh-why....? Nnngh... Why...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
011	――――
012	What...? I hear...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
013	What is it? You've gone pale, Hisham.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
014	I hear it again. That...voice... The one from the great tree! Someone's...crying?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
015	What?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
016	Kamui, you must sense it.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0001
017	Yes. The Jam.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
018	Jam...s?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
019	The curse of our country's Sacred Stone, Beelzebub.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
020	Kyaaa, kyaaaaakkkk!!!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_c
021	I-I know what these are! They are the monsters that do bad things in the desert at night!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
022	We have to run! Whenever the villagers were attacked by these, they fell sick!
023	Don't worry.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
024	Huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
025	You could say that we're specialists in this field. We know how to purify these kinds of creatures.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0010
026	The Jam cannot be taken down with normal weapons, but Spiritbonding is a whole different story!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
027	Leave it to us, Hisham! We'll show you the true power of our village's warriors!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0038
