001	Well done, Captain Vettel. You were truly an unstoppable force.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0046
002	I'm relived that my worries were groundless.
003	I am the one who is relieved to have such dependable allies.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
004	My apologies, Captain Vettel, but you seem to have an insect on your shoulder.
005	Huh?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0027
006	Excuse me. I seem to have squished it. What a useless death.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0035
007	E-eek!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0019
008	Huh? Captain Vettel?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0025
009	Pl-please, take this clothes off of me! No, wait, not here. Someone might see!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0028
010	That's why I didn't want to fight in a place like this!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
011	What is the matter...?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0027
012	I...I absolutely and truly hate bugs!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
013	Have you calmed down now?
014	My apologies for showing such an embarrassing side of me.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
015	Yes, the things is I truly dislike insects. It's to the point that I don't even like to look at them.
016	That's why, when the large bee was flying around inside the castle village...
017	Or when the children gave me a bug-shaped charm...I ran away.
018	Ah, I understand now.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0016
019	I was okay when I was a child, but somehow...no, when I saw them in a nightmare...I found myself unable to stand them anymore.	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
020	I think it's the numerous legs and unreadable eyes that I can't stand.
021	Hmm.
022	Laugh, Dilga. The so-called brave hero has such an embarrassing weakness.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
023	No, I won't laugh. Everyone has weaknesses.
024	As for me, I can't stand sweets.
025	Dilga...is that one of those things where you say something you like in order to have people tempt you with it?
026	Gwahahaha! In any case, it's nothing for you to worry over.	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0023
027	More importantly, the job of a warrior is to polish oneself is that we are prepared to face any adversary.
028	You said so yourself.
029	Whether we are surrounded by insects or fed sweets, we must remain calm and exert our full power.
030	You're right. It's dangerous to have my weakness so easily read like this. I still lack enough training.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
031	Exactly! Would you like to join my dojo in order to train both your body and soul?	VO_dhiruga.dhiruga_sys_0037
032	Sounds good! Thanks! Let's work on fixing this together!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
