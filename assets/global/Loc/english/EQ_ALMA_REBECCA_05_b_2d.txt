001	Well? Did you talk to Eleonora?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0044
002	I did. I was able to learn some very interesting and important things from her, although it had to wait a few days.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0037
003	Why did Matthew become the janitor?	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0025
004	Yes. I thought it was a bit odd. If you're going to run the school together as a married couple, shouldn't he be in management instead?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
005	Right man...for the job.	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0004
006	He was the one who turned it down, saying, "Why would I manage a magic school when I can't use magic?"	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0007
007	But isn't being a janitor a bit rough?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
008	I've got stamina...and I don't get sick easily. I'm best. For the job.	VO_matthew.matthew_sys_0005
009	We compromise and do the things we're best suited for. That way, we have mutual respect and can raise each other up.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0004
010	I think that is definitely the secret to our happy marriage.	VO_eleonora.eleonora_sys_0007
011	That's truly beautiful.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0046
012	Magic has always been at the heart of this country...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
013	But there are things witches are good at and things that men are good at.
014	I believe now that the key to compromise between men and women is mutual respect.
015	So men could be educated on things other than magic, such as incantations and architecture...and other important skills needed for work. I believe that we need a school like this where they can be cared for and nurtured.
016	A school for men? Then you intend to separate the men and women?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0031
017	No, my intention is for the two schools to someday integrate so that our people may be educated together.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0039
018	Co-education? Won't that simply bring back competition between the sexes?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0025
019	Competition itself is not a bad thing. In reality, the feelings of not wanting to lose can become wonderful motivation.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0039
020	What is important is to create an environment where men and women can bring out the best in each other.
021	Going forward, I'm sure that we will see witches who are more interested in incantations and physical labor, and men who are interested in magic.
022	There, they will be able to find rivals that will set their hearts on fire. That simmering heat is just what this country needs!
023	By sharing the load, working together, and even clashing swords sometimes, everyone can come to show each other the respect that is needed.
024	We have to do away with this archaic concept of stereotyping what men and women are suited for, and move on together into a world where everyone can help each other.
025	That's what I believe the new regime needs.
026	What...do you think?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
027	It's not bad, but to start a school and teach incantations, you need qualified staff.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0007
028	I have someone in mind! After this, I've got plans to discuss terms with him over lunch.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
029	I will definitely get him to agree!
030	Do as you will.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0031
031	Th-thank you! I'm off!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
032	A school, huh? Seems like she's started thinking like you now.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0044
033	What are you talking about, Melvy?	VO_venus.venus_sys_0005
034	How I remember it, you had pretty similar ideals when you made this school.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0007
035	Hm... It has been a century. You cannot expect me to remember such matters of little import.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
036	Little early to be going senile, isn't it?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0002
037	Quite the opposite. From now on, I suppose I will be taking on more of a supervisory role.	VO_venus.venus_sys_0030
038	Could be. At last, we can look forward to the rise of a new queen.	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0008
039	(Liz... This would have been impossible for the person I was before. From now on, I'll do my best to learn how to better understand people.)
040	(Feeling other's pain as if it is your own is your specialty...)
041	(But when I learn how to do that, I know I can become a queen who fights not only for herself, but for everyone else as well.)
042	Next time...I won't lose to you, Liz!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
