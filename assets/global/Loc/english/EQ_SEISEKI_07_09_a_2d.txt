001	Tsk. What are those idiots doing? They're spread out so widely...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
002	It's been a year, hasn't it? Finally, I get to see you.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0004
003	?!
004	It's been a while. I've been looking all over for you.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
005	Monzein! Seida!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
006	Captain Kudan...I'll ask you directly. What exactly is your intention for being here?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
007	I've come here to protect Kagura. I won't allow you lot to use her for your own means.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
008	I see. You don't seem to be under the threat of the Mikaboshi after all.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
009	How dangerous it would be to leave it unchecked...
010	Zain was trying to use that threat for himself.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
011	How can you not realize that you are being taken advantage of...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0021
012	How dare you!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
013	Lord Commander Zain's goal was to destroy the Mikaboshi! It was never to obtain it!
014	Even if that were the case...how can you forgive him?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
015	Zain brought Kagura from Wadatsumi for the sole purpose of using her to achieve his own end!
016	I will never forgive him for trying to take advantage of her!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
017	That's nonsense! Lord Commander Zain would never think in that way!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
018	Please wait, Captain Monzein!
019	Captain Kudan, so there is no way you could trust Lord Commander Zain now?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
020	Of course not. That's why I was willing to sacrifice my life and my honor to stop him.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
021	So...you can't trust us now either?
022	What do you mean?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
023	Lord Commander Zain is already dead.
024	In other words...the object of your suspicion no longer exists within the Holy Guard.
025	Can you not see eye-to-eye with us now?
026	Eye-to-eye with you...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
027	Yes. At the very least, we have no intention of obtaining the Mikaboshi.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
028	Our honest aim is simply to destroy it.
029	Ultimately, that's the same thing.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
030	...Why?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
031	The Mikaboshi is a Phantom Stone that harbors a similar power to that which resides in a Sacred Stone.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
032	In other words, its existence is responsible for providing equilibrium to this world.
033	If you were to destroy it, it would cause this balance to collapse.
034	Ultimately, it would result in exposing this world to danger.
035	The equilibrium of this world...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
036	This world was created by Nimul and Emmel using the Alchemy Source. Its equilibrium is maintained using a precise balance of power.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
037	If you destroy the Mikaboshi, it would lead to the destruction of this equilibrium.
038	It will be the same thing as leading this world to destruction.
039	So you mean that the destruction of the Mikaboshi will have an effect on the power in this world.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
040	Have you been brainwashed with garbage that the people from Greed Dike have been feeding you?!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
041	It's all nonsense! Can't you see why they're trying to use you?!
042	You know that I've made contact with them...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
043	I don't know what kind of misunderstanding you've made, but they haven't talked me into anything.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
044	In fact, I'm the one that's using them for information.
045	Shut up! In any case, there's no way we're letting you meet with Kagura in your current state!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0013
046	Captain Monzein! Please wait!	VO_caida.caida_chara_1011
047	You two haven't seen what's going on behind the surface.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
048	Without even realizing it, you're going to repeat the tragedy that occurred to Wadatsumi!
049	That's nonsense! Allowing the Mikaboshi to remain in this world is clearly a much greater threat!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
050	As long as you are trapped by that way of thinking, I cannot allow Kagura to remain with you.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
051	I'm taking her with me. If you still insist on standing in my way, regardless of everything I've told you...
052	I'll be left with no choice but to direct my spear against you...in order to protect this world from the threat of the Mikaboshi!
053	Do you have no intention of returning to the Holy Guard?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
054	What...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
055	All this time, Captain Monzein has been waiting for you to return. He's spent both time and effort in coming up with a way to bring you back.
056	Enough with that. You've caused enough harm already.	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0012
057	You have a duty to the Holy Guard to return and make amends for your actions.
058	You are yet to grasp the reality behind the Holy Guard.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0011
059	What do you mean?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0026
060	Right now, the Holy Guard is being utilized by a small elite faction within the Holy Order called the Corpse.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
061	I have no intention of returning to the Holy Guard.
062	The Corpse...?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
063	It's about time you faced the reality of your circumstances! The Holy Guard has been transformed into a weapon of destruction that threatens this world!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0015
064	Why...? Why have you become so distorted in your thinking?	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
065	Tsk. I knew you wouldn't have the ears to listen!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
066	If you insist on passing us...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0010
067	Then you'll have to defeat me first.
068	I have no choice then. I'll have to put you two to sleep for a while.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
069	His power of darkness is even stronger than before!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
070	Huzzaaahhhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
071	...! He blocked it?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
072	It's useless. You cannot stop...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_1002
073	...Ugh! Hwwoooohh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
074	What...?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
075	Ughh...! Im-impossible!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
076	Come back to us, Kudan...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
077	...What?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
078	It's still not too late! Come back to us, Kudan!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
079	I...can't stand by and watch my friend fall anymore!!!
080	...Captain Monzein!
081	I can feel your thoughts etched deeply in my heart. But...I am a knight who serves to protect this world!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
082	In order to protect this world...sometimes it requires a sacrifice of innocent blood!
083	...! No...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
084	...Ack...! Huzzaahhh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
085	...! No! I'll aid you!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
086	Forgive me, my beloved friends! The world of peace that we once sought together...with my own hands...I will make it come to fruition!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
087	The End!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0012
088	?! ...Agh...ghh!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
089	Ack...hahhh!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0018
090	Huff...huff... Try not to think too badly of me. Sleep here for a while.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
091	Ugh... It...it's not over yet...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0042
092	...! You...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
093	I-I won't let you go! This is a battle...to stop my fallen friend!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
094	Stop... If you continue any further...I won't be able hold back...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
095	Se-Seida...use your bow to stop Kudan's movements! I'll use that opening to...	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0018
096	...Huh...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
097	...?! Wh-what is this?! I can't move my body...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0027
098	Shadow Blend.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0005
099	?!
100	You won't be able to move for awhile. I won't have you getting in his way.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
101	Captain Kudan, you're not alone...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
102	If...you...insist...on...standing...in...my...way...I...won't...hold...back...!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0013
103	...! Have you lost your sanity?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
104	Die!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_1014
105	Ack?! N-no...!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
106	Ug-ughh...!!!	VO_monzein.!monzein_sys_0027
107	Well, you're quite the handful, aren't you?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0017
108	...?!
109	...!
110	An eye for an eye... I guess you can say darkness for darkness.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
111	We have the same power of darkness. The effects of darkness won't work on me.
112	Y-you...!	VO_monzein.monzein_sys_0029
113	Basheeny!
114	Who are you...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
115	Nice to meet you. I'm Basheeny. I am an assassin hired by Lord Waginau to acquire the Holy Sword Excalibur.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
116	What...?!
