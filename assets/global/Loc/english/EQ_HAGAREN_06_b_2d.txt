001	Hmm.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0031
002	Did we win? Did we...beat the Führer? Don't tell me he's a fake...just like my brother was...	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
003	He was really tough. Alphonse...it sounded like you knew him.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
004	He's the supreme leader of Amestris, and also the ultimate warrior—no, homunculus—among our enemies.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0016
005	Hmm. How peculiar that a homunculus formed of several beings should then be further transmuted into another world, like so.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0010
006	I think I almost would have preferred that my existence be completely erased, instead.
007	Perhaps it is this world, or the fault of the summoner...but my body feels sluggish and does not move as I expect.
008	Are you serious?! Are you saying you'd be even stronger in your original body?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0029
009	What a dull way to have to fight.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0007
010	Still, I am...pleased, in a way, to meet you again, Alphonse Elric.
011	You're...the real Wrath. How can you be here?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0016
012	I was called forth as a Phantom, the soul of one who has lost their body. I do not favor this form, but I do appreciate the unique strength it allows me.
013	Once he understood the potential these forms have here, he immediately called for me.
014	He...? No, it can't be!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0025
015	Pride! Or, Selim, as he is known within the Holy Order. He is rather well-regarded.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0004
016	...!
017	It happened several decades ago, according to the timeline of this world.
018	During an experiment, the Holy Order accidentally transmuted a small Dimensional Gate that was connected to our world for just a moment.
019	It was then that Pride entered this world for the first time and gained the power of this bodily form.
020	Selim... I've heard that name. You can't mean...he's not from this world?!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0009
021	Ah... So you are one of the sacrifices Selim prepared. The special child strengthened with homunculus powers...	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0044
022	...!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_battle_0019
023	How could you... How could Selim...?	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0029
024	This pisses me off. You outsiders are the ones messing up our world?! You can't just treat us as disposable!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
025	Anger? That's good. Very good... That's a pure, righteous anger.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0013
026	A...righteous anger?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0016
027	Alphonse, when we were in Amestris, I was able to use my position to oppose you.	VO_bradley.bradley_sys_0003
028	I won't apologize for it. I do not even regret it. However, in this world, that option is not available to me.
029	In this world, every person, king or peasant, must act on their own accord. I will admit...I find this more interesting.
030	It seems that towers like this one have been built in the other countries as well. Will we go destroy those as well, Edgar?	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0002
031	What do you think? As a person of this world... No. As a man, I can't forgive this cruel plan of the homunculi. How dare they take advantage of Toritoh?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
032	There's no need to be concerned for me. However... Thank you for getting angry on my behalf.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
033	Vivi, Alphonse... I think I'll go with Edgar to take down all the towers. There's this feeling in my chest and I just... I feel like I need to...
034	I think that's anger. It's normal to feel that in response to the realization that someone has been toying with your life.	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0004
035	That's...kind of a relief to hear. Thank you, Alphonse, Edgar. I couldn't do this without you.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
036	Vivi, could you stay here and act as a liaison between us and Colonel Mustang? I trust you.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0003
037	Well! I feel very used! I suppose...if I must...I shall. Leave it to me.	VO_vivi.vivi_sys_0012
038	The closest country is Envylia. Let's show the Holy Order what happens when you challenge the will of the people!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
