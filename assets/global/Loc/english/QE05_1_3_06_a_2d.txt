001	There are a lot more beasts than I had expected. No wonder a bodyguard is necessary for you to get to the altar.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
002	...
003	Malta?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
004	Do you remember, Kamui? We were attacked by beasts like this when we were just kids.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
005	I remember selfishly demanding that we go to the orchard at the base of the tree to gather fruit at night.
006	Ah, I remember that now.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
007	I managed to fend off the beasts, but I was too exhausted to move afterward.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
008	Hehe, Protector Judah came and found us just in the nick of time. He gave us such an earful!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0008
009	He sure did. Why tell this story now?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
010	You protected me with your life. That was probably the first time.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
011	The first...?
012	I wonder how many times I've come to this altar.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0031
013	My entire adolescence was spent praying here.
014	Malta?
015	You were here too, remember? When Protector Judah was alive, you spent your time here, learning about Spiritbonding.	VO_malta.malta_favorite_1004
016	So, you could say we grew up together.
017	What's going on, Malta? Is now really the time to be reminiscing about the past?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
018	Yes. This is the only time we have left to do this.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
019	What do you mean?
020	After that, you gradually began leaving the village for your duties more and more often.
021	You brought me so many gifts from outside.
022	I really loved the way you smiled when talking about the outside world.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
023	...
024	To tell you the truth, I was always envious of you. It seemed like you had a choice about how to live your future.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
025	Yes... Thinking back on it, I realize you never had that same freedom.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
026	I was born with a natural affinity for becoming the druidic priestess, and my obligations as the Chief's daughter sealed my fate.
027	M-Malta?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
028	Th-this is the same darkness that had enveloped Hisham! A corrupting energy!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0012
