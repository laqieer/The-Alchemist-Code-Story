001	They're too much for us. We need to fall back!
002	Curses! They're getting away!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0042
003	These ruins are in a terrible state, but there is a well-worn path here leading deeper in. I think that's where they were headed.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0031
004	I don't sense any minotaurs. Nor is there any sign of the ne'er-do-wells from earlier.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0031
005	But there are some beasts down here, along with something very similar to a golem.
006	Forget about them. We have bigger fish to fry.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
007	And we need to be ready. Those guys'll be particularly dangerous when cornered, I think.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
008	Mwahaha! You've done well to survive this long. You'll make great material for our Philosopher's Stones!
009	Waaaah!
010	Rrrg...
011	Don't you dare lay a hand on them!	VO_ila.ila_battle_0022
012	Not so fast.
013	Curse you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
014	Raaaaagh!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0032
015	Bell, you—!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0003
016	Sorry, sorry! But the children should be okay now.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0035
017	Th-that's not what I was going to say.
018	This is just the kind of person Bell is. He always dives in head-first when there's somebody to rescue.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0005
019	That side of him definitely makes me worry sometimes, but Bell wouldn't be Bell any other way.	VO_hestia.hestia_sys_0007
020	These seem to be the only children down here.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0001
021	Ais? You already went and searched the whole area?
022	I did.	VO_eyes.eyes_sys_0004
023	Wow! Thank you!	VO_bell.bell_sys_0033
024	Also, I believe the minotaur went through here.
025	Deeper in the ruins, huh? Where they had their base set up earlier, I guess. It's probably crawling with demons, too.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
026	So this is where we make our stand, then.
027	Seems like it. Let's go get this mess cleaned up!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
028	I'll help get these kids somewhere safe.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0004
029	Good idea. While you're doing that, then, we'll—	VO_bell.bell_sys_0005
030	No. I'll do this first, then we go. We fight together, Bell.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0001
031	Ila...! All right. We'll wait for you.	VO_bell.bell_sys_0037
