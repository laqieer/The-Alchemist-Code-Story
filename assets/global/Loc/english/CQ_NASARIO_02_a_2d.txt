001	It seems that the demons have fled—for the time being, at least..	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0022
002	Are you hurt, Leon? Were any of your instruments damaged?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0002
003	The only thing that will get in the way of my performance is you talking.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0030
004	Why, I...!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0016
005	I see that you can't even manage a thank you. I really ought not to mingle with your kind.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0030
006	Moreover, your very presence disturbs the noble timbre of this forest.
007	Is that what my performances sound like to a high-elf?	VO_lion.lion_sys_0044
008	What?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0005
009	You ought to determine whether my music ruins the peace of this forest with your own ears.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0001
010	Hmm...
011	Such sweet music! Look how all of the spirits of the forest come together, the better to lend their delicate ears to it!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0046
012	This is the beauty of the elf blood within you!
013	That you can soothe the forest even after a sudden battle is...remarkable!
014	Half of me was left unscathed during that battle—my physical half, that is.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0030
015	However, I wonder about my other half... My heart, so to speak.
016	Pardon?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0025
017	Didn't think of that, did you?	VO_lion.lion_sys_0016
018	...
019	What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? Or perhaps the lowly words of a mere human cannot reach you.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0001
020	D-don't be absurd! That was... I...	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0029
021	There are still demons close by, so I was simply distracted by their presence.
022	You need not stop playing. I will handle them.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0010
023	So that's a pure high-elf, huh? They truly are bound hand and foot by their pride.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0045
024	I pity that half-elf, and so my intention was to help him, as well as to praise his performance.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0018
025	However, I did not praise him, did I? No, I praised the elf blood inside of him.
026	That makes me no better than foolish mankind, who persecute others for their appearance or the manner of their birth, and other such things that are not the fault of the individual.
027	I wonder if he will ever come to this forest again?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0022
