001	Hah! Found you!
002	Oh crap! We're done for!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
003	Wait... Just one? You're all alone?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
004	Capturing one little bandit chief isn't going to be difficult for me.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0012
005	Hahahahah! Never would've expected one of you Legion dogs to have the guts to come in here alone.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
006	Without your troublesome captain around, none of you scare me.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
007	I am nothing like Gerald or Vettel, but I chose to walk alongside them all the same.
008	Which means that sometimes I'm going to go all out!
009	Quit your babbling! Lads, get her!
010	Damn it! What am I doing?	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
011	I know Natalie better than anyone. It should have been obvious to me what she would do!
012	Surround her! She's a tough one.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0030
013	Of course I am. I'm a member of the Scarlet Legion.
014	(Still, I suppose I have to admit that my plan failed. I was hoping to nab their leader and run back to Gerald, but now I'm outnumbered and surrounded.)
015	No backing out now. Not unless you beg. Heheh.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
016	Not going to happen. I'm not a quitter. I wouldn't be caught dead pleading with the likes of you.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0040
017	Heh. Keep running your mouth, see where it gets you. I think you'll be changing your tone before long. Try to leave her mostly intact, lads! We want her in working order. Heheh...
018	Huzzaaaahhhh!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0032
019	Huh?! G-Gerald!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
020	You idiot! What possessed you to charge in here alone?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
021	You're not the only one who can be reckless, you know! But...thanks. I'm glad you're here.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
022	You... Hmph.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
023	Curses! Why'd that monster of a captain have to show up?! But...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0023
024	We still outnumber you! Nothing's changed! Hahahah!
025	Hmph. I can take all of you on myself without breaking a sweat.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
026	And that's how it should be.
