001	What do you think you're doing?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
002	You are quite the swordswoman. I was planning to deal with you quickly if you bored me, but I should have expected more of a Black Star.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
003	I was told to kill any who would interfere with Greed Dike, but... I'll just pretend I didn't see you.
004	So you are connected to them.
005	Yes. I have my own obligations. Though I'm sick of watching so much corruption.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
006	...You're one of the Shiba Senko?
007	You must have noticed from my bladework. In that case, I don't need to explain.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
008	I can't allow someone from Wadatsumi to have dealings with Greed Dike.
009	Wadatsumi cannot endure any more corruption.
010	I agree.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0037
011	What?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0025
012	With the demon threat under control, the greed of the Shiba Senko runs wild. They don't even to listen to me, the head of their clan.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0031
013	I didn't expect that from someone of the clan itself.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
014	Even as one of the great houses of Wadatsumi, they rot to their core the more they refuse to listen to reason. It's only natural for corruption to accumulate.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
015	However, as clan head, what I can do is limited. I can only impede the corruption, I cannot stop it.
016	That is why I accepted this mission.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
017	You're contradicting yourself.
018	Say what you will. I choose to lead the Shiba Senko in a way that I wouldn't be ashamed of.
019	No matter how many lives I have to take.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
020	...
021	Illogical things like clans and codes exist in all ages. That's why it is up to the individual to choose their own path.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
022	Their own path to honor the responsibility they were given.
023	I don't have that choice.
024	Oh? Even though you fight with such passion?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
025	I may have passion, but I am not free. That doesn't change what I have to do.
026	And you're willing to die for it?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
027	That's right. Whatever it takes, whoever must die for it, whether be myself or another by my hand.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
028	For the sake of those I will leave behind.
029	And so you resist within your restrictions... I've taken a liking to you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
030	Should I care?
031	Maybe. Have you heard this?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0039
032	...
033	I can't imagine this is completely out of range of your interests. I have no reason to give you this information, but it is credible.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0003
034	Credible? You expect me to believe that?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
035	I've taken an interest in seeing where that passion of yours takes you.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
036	...
037	It's up to you if you want to believe me or not. However...
038	I hope I get to see you use all of your strength the next time we meet.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
039	...
040	I suppose I have much to learn if you were able to tell I'm not at my best. That said...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
041	I'm surprised the Shiba Senko has decayed to such a point.
042	Even as one of the great houses of Wadatsumi, they rot to their core the more they refuse to listen to reason. It's only natural for corruption to accumulate.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
043	However, as clan head, what I can do is limited. I can only impede the corruption, I cannot stop it.
044	That is why I accepted this mission.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
045	It seems we are both clumsy fools held down by the duties that have been placed upon our shoulders.
046	My own path...	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
047	(I wonder if my body will last long enough that I can make my dream a reality.)
048	...
049	This doesn't change what I have to do. I will do what I must for myself.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
050	And for my...code...
051	So this is where you were. I killed all the others! Does that mean I win this time?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
052	Yeah... You win.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
053	Yes!!! I've never won against you before! ...Natsume?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0009
054	Natsume?! Wh-what's wrong? Natsume!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
055	...
056	I'll get you to a doctor. Just... Just hold on!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
057	My time is limited, and yet I still have much left to do.
058	But more than anything, I want Ren to be free.
