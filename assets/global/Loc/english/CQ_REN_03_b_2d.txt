001	Piece of cake.
002	*Giggle* You didn't even break a sweat.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
003	That was nothing.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
004	Argh!
005	Watch out!
006	Oof…	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
007	I could've handled him by myself. You worry too much, Chloe.
008	This is how the Scarlet Flame Guard operates. We fight together… Huh?
009	What? Don't tell me he got you?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
010	It's just a scratch.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
011	That blade was poisoned! Dammit. Hurry to Natalie's!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0040
012	But what about you?
013	I can handle it from here. Go!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0013
014	A-Alright. I'm counting on you…
015	Unbelievable… That was such a cheap trick.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
016	Huh? Did I just say that? I must've eaten something weird.
017	Vettel and Gerald and Chloe, they're all such good people. Maybe they've rubbed off on me?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
018	Whatever. Who wants to die first?
019	I'm not in the mood to mess around, so if you're the last one standing consider yourself lucky.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
020	Bubbles, carried on the wind, danced in rays of sunlight.
021	That's what they get for playing dirty--Oh!
022	You defeated them all by yourself!
023	Chloe, you're back! Did you get the poison antidote from Natalie?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
024	Yep--made it just in time.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0037
025	Once it was over, she gave a weird smile and tried to shoot me up with more meds. I barely made it out of there!
026	Sounds like Natalie, alright. I'll have to report to her later and thank her.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
027	Thank you for taking care of everything. I'm grateful you used your sword to protect us.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0033
028	I used my sword to kill. That's all.
029	Come on. I can tell you were protecting us.
030	Give me a break…	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
031	You dispatched the assassins despite them not meeting your standards and you got angry when they used poison, right?
032	I'm just looking forward to the day I kill Captain Vettel and Gerald. I don't operate under any moral code like they do, okay?
033	Besides, I'm curious to see how Captain Vettel leads the Scarlet Flame Guard.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0031
034	My moral code is all thanks to Captain Vettel.
035	I know there are always people I can rely on. My faith in that will never die.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
036	I dunno. I guess sometimes it's good to make sure.
037	Make sure of what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
038	Of where we belong.
039	(I wonder if my sis thought so too.)
040	People die pretty easily, actually--Even if it doesn't always look that way.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
041	Are you afraid of dying?
042	Not really. I'm looking forward to when that day comes.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
043	You don't want to get kicked out, right?
044	If I get kicked out, I won't be able to kill the people I want to kill.
045	You're a terrible liar, Renny.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0023
046	Huh?
047	I want to protect the Scarlet Flame--its shining light--together with you.
048	Would you believe me if I said, "Me too?"	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
049	Of course.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0006
050	But you know I'm a liar, right?
051	Hey, those bubbles look fun. Can I join in?
052	You want to join?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
053	I do.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
054	Maybe there was more to it, after all…
055	More to what?
056	Can you teach me the knight's code, sometime?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
057	Bubbles, dancing in the wind, sparkled in rays of sunlight.
058	Don't believe me when I say I don't belong in the Scarlet Flame Guard. That'll be the last lie I ever tell.
