001	Ack...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
002	S-so fast!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
003	My, my, but we're just getting started! Why don't we just have a little fun?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
004	Neun, Acht...I appreciate you lending a hand, but I would prefer if you didn't interfere with my battle with Zahar.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
005	Tsk. Our job isn't to settle petty feuds, but to destroy everyone on site, not just that one guy.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0014
006	She disappeared?! Lord Zahar, watch out!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
007	What...? Look out behind you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
008	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
009	The one here with the highest fighting ability is that silver-haired man. I shall destroy the girl, the one he cares for, in order to distract him.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
010	I suspect that will be the most effective method of destruction.
011	Wow! How unusual for the two of us to agree on something! Let's just get right to it then!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
012	I don't need you to tell me what I already know.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0032
013	Oh no! Spica! Run!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
014	Wh-what?!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
015	Umph!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
016	L-Lord Zahar...? No... Noooooooo!!!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
017	Well. I had not expected my plan to go this well. It falls outside of my projections that you would use your own body to protect the girl.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0044
018	This saves me some time.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
019	Urgh... This mindless, faithless violence that swarms upon any that it comes across...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
020	Hmph. This is exactly the kind of thing a fool like you would resort to.
021	This isn't how I was hoping this would end.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0022
022	However, this only came about because of your own choice to save that girl. Clearly, you are not nearly as cold-hearted as you pretend to be.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
023	Ha! Is that what you saw with your pitiful eyes? That I saved a simple girl?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
024	What...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
025	I did not save a mere girl. I saved someone who will inherit the future, who will carry what I have taught her forward and carve it into the world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
026	Someone like you who cannot see past the surface of things could never understand.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
027	Lord Zahar!
028	Spica... You must revive the Shadow Messiah, not just for those who need it, but to rid the world of destructive fools like these!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
029	Excuse me?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0012
030	Spica, no! After all you've been through, don't waste it all by falling into old patterns now!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
031	Urgh! You, girl... You must...learn to discern what true justice is. The empty justice of the Holy Guard cannot be allowed to prevail over all.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0022
032	That is exactly what has brought this world to ruin! You, Lord Commander... You have no right to preside over what justice can truly be!
033	Our justice isn't empty.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
034	Fools, all of you... Y-you must have realized by now... The justice you espouse, it doesn't take into account the capacity for darkness each person carries...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
035	It's just pretty words with no room for reality.
036	The capacity for darkness...people carry?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
037	Where there is light, there is darkness... The hearts of people are the same way.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
038	By eliminating that darkness from your ideas of justice, you act as if it doesn't exist.
039	As a result, you fail to take into account the full range of human experience...
040	Y-you who cannot believe in people have no right to determine the justice that they live by.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
041	We don't...believe in people?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
042	It's because you seek to suppress it that the power of darkness grows... I believe in a different system. One which makes use of the power of darkness...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
043	One in which the darkness in all of our hearts...can be seen and understood... That is the only way to achieve true peace!
044	That is the true justice that the Shadow Messiah strives for!
045	...!
046	Ugh. Talkative for a dead man, isn't he? How long are you going to let him run his mouth?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0013
047	I never had any intention of "letting" him do anything...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
048	Whatever. Do you mind if we take care of this girl now?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
049	Fine.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0037
050	...!
051	Oh no!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
052	Where do you think you're going? Did you not hear me when I said I was here for you?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
053	Ack!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
054	Don't you feel special? I'll make it quick and painless, just for you.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
055	Agh...ahhh!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0021
056	Hrrrgh...!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
057	Oh. You're still alive?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0027
058	I told you...fools like you...could never...defeat me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
059	You must have known that to come to this girl's aid would be tantamount to suicide, and yet you did so regardless... There is something to be said for that.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
060	Ha...haha... This body is just the temporary form...that I need to exist in this world... What is one life...in comparison to the greater good?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
061	Even if my body dies...my beliefs will not! I suppose fools such as you—who value nothing—could not understand such a thing.
062	...!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
063	Do not forget this... There will come a day...when you will find yourselves...crushed...beneath the heel...of fate, and...it will be at the hand...of one who carries my beliefs...in their heart.
064	I'll wait in anticipation of that day. Now... Goodbye, Zahar!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0020
065	Lord Zahar!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0025
066	Dragon Pyromancer!!!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0001
067	Ack...!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
068	He was attacked...?! Who—?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
069	This presence...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
070	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
071	Who are you? Your aura seems somehow similar to Zahar's darkness...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
072	I didn't plan to interfere, but it's a little too much for me to just stand by and watch as someone turns their weapons against defenseless women.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
073	So...it is you...after all!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
074	You thought you got away from me, didn't you, Zahar? Hm... What is this?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
075	For you to protect that girl...
076	C-Captain Cadanova! Is that you?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
077	Ah, Kanon. Have you become the Lord Commander after all? You've come a long way from the scrappy underdog of a knight that you once were. I am proud of you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0045
078	Captain Cadanova...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
079	Argh... H-how did you...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0022
080	How do you think? The same way you did, of course. I slipped back into this world just before the bridge between worlds closed.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
081	What? Did you think I would simply let someone as dangerous as you into the world without supervision?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0012
082	Urgh! Will you never leave me be?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
083	Leave you be...? You don't seem to understand the situation.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
084	I am not here to get in your way. I am here to end you, once and for all.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0001
085	Urgh... You...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0022
086	C-Captain Cadanova, please! Wait!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
087	Stay back, Kanon! He may be injured, but Zahar is still a very dangerous individual!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
088	Captain, please listen! That man... That man is not our enemy right now!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
089	What are you saying, Kanon?! Zahar is the one who has turned against this world. Don't tell me that even you...?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0026
090	Hmph. There is no end to the surprises today, is there? Cadanova, the Flame Dragon King... You are the last person I thought I would encounter.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
091	And, of all things, we share the same goal! Perhaps, in this case, the enemy of my enemy can be my friend.
092	Excuse me?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
093	My comrades and I are here to take the life of Zahar and that girl over there. As long as you don't have a problem with that, we don't have a problem with you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
094	Hm... And who are you?
095	We are the Veda Templars. Our mission is to ensure that justice is served in this world.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
096	I'm sure you have questions, but should your first priority not be Zahar? After all, he is the reason you have so painstakingly made your way here, is he not?
097	Wha—?! Captain Cadanova!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
098	Indeed. Zahar gained unimaginable strength in that world of darkness, strength which I cannot allow to exist in this world...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
099	Wait! Please, wait!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
100	It's too late... Cadanova would never...let a chance like this go. Haha... The chance of a lifetime...right, Cadanova?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
101	Hmph. It seems you've made your peace with the situation. Cadanova, I can take care of this if you simply stay out of my way.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
102	S-Spica... Go...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
103	What are you saying?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
104	H-how many times will you force me to say it...? You are the future...of the Shadow Messiah...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
105	Are you...disobeying my...direct...order?
106	B-but...	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
107	Haha... Just thinking about it...makes me laugh...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
108	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
109	The image of these fools being sent to hell, thanks to a battalion led by you, Spica!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
110	Lord...Zahar...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
111	Will you take that...from me now? In my...last moments?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
112	Go, Spica! Live, so that...you...can show them...the meaning of death!
113	Are your last words finally coming to an end, Zahar? It's time for you to return to hell, old friend!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0032
114	Lord Zahar! No!!!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0020
115	Wha...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
116	Captain Cadanova?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
117	What do you think you're doing?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
118	I think I must have said something along the lines of this to Kanon...but I believe that there's a kind of heart that determines victory and defeat on the battlefield.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
119	And...?
120	It's difficult to understand... Honestly, even I cannot explain myself. I cannot explain it, except that seeing Zahar like this has forced me to reconsider where I stand in this moment.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
121	We share the same goal, supposedly... Yet I find myself unable to bear witness to this.
122	...!
123	Captain Cadanova!
124	I see...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0020
125	In other words, our temporary alliance has been cut short.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
126	That cold intent in your eyes... It seems I made the correct choice.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0030
127	Cadanova... You...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
128	Hmph. Don't read too much into this. It seems that we have a greater enemy, one whom we need to face together.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
129	You are the enemy of my enemy. That means that we are allies...for now.
130	Y-you...! How dare you...steal...what I was going to say? I only hope that you...do not slow me down.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
140	Hmph... This day has been...full of unexpected twists.
