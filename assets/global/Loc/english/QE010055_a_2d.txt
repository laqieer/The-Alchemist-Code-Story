001	Gilrack Ruins? That's impossible! Didn't Sabareta destroy it with gunpowder?
002	It's safe to assume he robbed it of every single Philosopher's Stone before doing so.
003	There's a reason. There, I encountered a formidable enemy similar in strength to that black knight.
004	A formidable enemy?
005	General Caesar the Demon Flame. Originally one of Wratharis's Deadly Trio, he was summoned by Sabareta.
006	Surprisingly, even after his conjuror Sabareta left the Ruins, he still continued to fight a fierce battle against me.
007	His power showed absolutely no sign of weakening.
008	He continued to fight even without his conjuror present?
009	The fact that Caesar bore an extremely deep seated grudge may have been the reason it was possible.
010	However, if there is a Philosopher's Stone that has enough power to allow independent activities...
011	They would return to the Gilrack Ruins to recover that Philosopher's Stone.
012	We've combed the vicinity but there appears to be no sign of troops transporting the Demon.
013	With the captives of the Lizard Brigade remaining firm in their silence, remaining here will be—
014	Very well. We head to the Gilrack Ruins. Kill the captives.
015	I refuse.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
016	What...?	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0016
017	While we spend time here, the rebirth of the Demon draws closer and closer.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
018	We don't have any time to waste; let's go.
019	Tsk!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
