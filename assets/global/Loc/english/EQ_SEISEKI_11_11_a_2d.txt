001	Captain Cadanova! I-I'm sorry, I failed to fulfill my duties again!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
002	Nngh... As if I could...let things end...this way! I will...never...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
003	Justice will reign! As long...as Excalibur holds!
004	O-Orion... I... I will never...let you accomplish your goals!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
005	Uhn...uhh...
006	Y-Your Majesty?! Nngh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
007	The Emperor still...lives! S-somebody, please! Medic!
008	What is this? What happened here?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
009	To have brought such a large force, Greed Dike must be serious about taking Northern Pride down today!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0027
010	Even so, how can Northern Pride be so overwhelmed?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
011	Our homeland is defended by the elite among the Holy Guard.
012	Our forces should be able to match Greed Dike's army, no matter their number!
013	Would you like to know why your situation is so dire?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
014	Huh...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
015	Get back!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
016	Urgh!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0019
017	Northern Pride wasn't the one that hired us, that's the difference! Gwahahah!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0007
018	You're one of Sol's...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
019	Who is this guy?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
020	He's one of the Templars, a mercenary hired by Greed Dike!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
021	Templars?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
022	Hey, samurai. It's impressive you can parry my attack, but...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
023	Wha—?!
024	He's gone?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
025	Agh! Ughh!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0022
026	Reimei!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
027	Ha, idiot. If you hadn't awkwardly tried to dodge, you could have died without writhing in pain like this.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
028	Urgh, he's...so fast!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0024
029	So, you're Kagura, right? I've been looking for you.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0001
030	For me? Why?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
031	I haven't done anything worthwhile in this fight yet.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0005
032	I can't let Sol have all the fun!
033	Fun...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
034	I need to kill at least one captain to satisfy my bloodlust!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0010
035	I don't care which one, but...you seem to be the only one left.
036	I'll get to be the one with the last major kill!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0008
037	Wh-what?! This isn't a game!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
038	I'm not playing around! Aren't you the one who ruined the Matter for us? That was supposed to be our payment!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
039	We were gonna seek you out and kill you no matter what!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
040	I'd like to see you try!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1017
041	R-run...	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0021
042	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
043	H-he's on...a whole other level... He'll...k-kill you!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
044	Your warning comes a little too late.	VO_neun.neun_battle_0001
045	Wha—?!
046	Your death will make a nice souvenir.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
047	Wh-wha—?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
048	Huzzzaaaaahh!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0004
049	What the—?!
050	Tch! He's caught up already?!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
051	Captain Kagura! Are you all right?! Who is this guy?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
052	Basheeny! This is Reimei. He kept me safe while I was travelling from the Desert Zone to come here.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
053	Uh...okay. Anyway, you should go on ahead. I have fought this man before and I know how to handle him.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
054	Leave him to me, and head to the castle!
055	The castle?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
056	Orion was seen marching in alone!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
057	The Sacred Stone Lucifer and the Emperor are in danger! Please hurry!
058	Got it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
059	You brat! Get back here!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
060	Flying Gear Assault!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0001
061	Gnh! You?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0043
062	You're gonna have to go through me first!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
063	Captain Kagura! Before you go, I have to know one thing.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0014
064	Huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
065	I've heard that Captain Othima and Seida have...passed away. Is this true?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
066	It is.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
067	I...see.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
068	You should hurry! Reimei, was it? Please look after Captain Kagura!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
069	Tch! There's no turning back now! We've gotta go!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
070	Basheeny! You'd better survive this!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0041
071	As if I'd let you escape!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
072	Grnh?! Why you little...!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
073	We meet again... This won't be like the last time we fought. I've found the key to defeating you.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0007
074	You may be imperceptibly fast, but I can still catch the moment you take action.
075	Urgh...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0025
076	I'm counting on you, Captain Kagura! Huzzaaahh!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
077	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
078	Sh-she's...?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
079	She's too strong!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
080	Tell me. Has Captain Kagura of the 5th Regiment not yet returned?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
081	Captain Kagura?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
082	What do you want with her?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
083	She is the one who destroyed what we were owed... The Matter.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
084	Ha! So Captain Kagura was able to prevent you from plundering the Matter!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0007
085	Whoa!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0025
086	Perhaps this is amusing to you, but this is no laughing matter for us.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0012
087	Obtaining the Matter was Sol's primary objective.
088	We were at the brink of accomplishing that objective, and Kagura took it away from us. I will never forgive her.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0013
089	This Sol... He is dear to you, isn't he?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0001
090	He is. When I was orphaned by war, I had lost all purpose in life. Sol was the one who gave me hope for the future.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
091	Sol is my sunshine. He is the reason I live. I'm sure you wouldn't understand.
092	I do understand. Wanting to dedicate yourself to the person that gave you meaning in life? That is a feeling I truly understand.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0039
093	You are the first person to say so. I am...pleased... However...	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
094	I cannot waste any time here. You will now die.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0012
095	Uh-oh! Here she comes!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0020
096	Wha—?!
097	That's a cold weapon you've got there.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0029
098	There's no way such a heartless weapon can beat mine! I made this weapon with my blood and soul!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
099	Miuna!
100	As a weaponsmith, it's my duty to make you understand that weapons are made to protect people!	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0012
101	Finally.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
102	How many years has it been since I began this quest? How many have I slain along the way?
103	Hmph. None of that matters now that I stand here on this ground.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
104	Halt, Orion, you degenerate usurper! You are surrounded! Give yourself up!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
105	The Leviathan of Envylia, the Matter of Saga, and the Mikaboshi of Wadatsumi have each been disabled.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0031
106	Mammon of Greed Dike is mine, and now...
107	Now Lucifer of Northern Pride is within my grasp!
108	Surely the balance of power in this world cannot be any more destabilized than it is at this point!
109	Tch! Did you not hear me?! Lay down your weapon or else—	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
110	Enough.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0029
111	Wh-what is that thing?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
112	Aaaaahh!!!
113	Nameless warriors, there is no need to lament. Your sacrifices will be the foundation of a new world.	VO_orione.orione_sys_0007
114	The time has come! A new era is now upon us!
115	O ancient tower of desires, show yourself to this world once more!
116	Th-the Sacred Stones are...glowing?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0046
117	Look there! Is that...the Tower of Babel?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0027
118	Hahaha! I knew you were anticipating this moment as well!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0008
119	Now, make your path to resurrection apparent!
120	Founder of Alchemy, Nimul... Descend unto my being!
121	Nnrgh...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
122	Lord Commander Kanon!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
123	Wh-where is Orion?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
124	My apologies! We could not stand against his overwhelming power as he made his way toward the Babel Ruins!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
125	Ngh...! N-no! We must s-stop him!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
126	Lord Commander! Medic, over here! Hurry!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
127	Never mind me! Get to the more seriously wounded first!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
128	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
129	K-Kagura?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
130	Are you okay?! Where is Orion?!
131	He took Lucifer and headed to the Babel Ruins.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
132	He took Lucifer?! What about the Emperor?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
133	Medics are caring for him now. His wounds are deep, but they're not life-threatening.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
134	Then...all is not yet lost.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
135	The Lion Monarch Orion... His aim is to topple this world from its foundations!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
136	Conflicts within this continent mean nothing to him. He doesn't even blink at killing the leader of this suzerain nation.
137	You are...Chihaya's...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
138	Hey, it's been a while.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
139	You two...know each other?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
140	We met once before, in Wadatsumi. It was before I started working with Kudanstein.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
141	You were with Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
142	For a while after Wadatsumi, yeah. By the way...I heard Kudanstein has returned to this world.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0045
143	Did you have anything to do with that?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
144	H-how do you know about that?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
145	I'm the one asking questions here.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
146	As far as I know, that's just hearsay. There has been no chance for me to confirm that rumor.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
147	It's the truth. I was saved by him just recently.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
148	By Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
149	Kanon... Have you heard about Captain Othima and Seida?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
150	I have. That they...passed away. Is it true?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
151	I'm...sorry.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
152	No!
153	Captain Othima and Seida were both trying to save me.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0019
154	They gave their lives to... to...!
155	There's no need to cry, Kagura.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
156	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
157	They are both alive within your heart, aren't they?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
158	Wha—?!
159	The fact you survived and made it this far is proof enough that their will lives on within you.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
160	No matter how hard things get, we have to keep our eyes on the future. For their sake.
161	You're right.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
162	I was about to be killed along with Captain Othima and Seida, but that's when Kudan came and...
163	Wha—?!
164	If Kudan had not arrived when he did, I would surely be dead now.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
165	Captain Kudan...? But why?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
166	I don't know why he saved me. He even said he had no obligation to do so.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0030
167	He really can't be honest with himself, can he?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
168	Anyway, this is no time to discuss this. We can talk later! Kagura, come with me to the Babel Ruins!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
169	Orion has the Sacred Stone Lucifer!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
170	He plans to awaken the Tower of Babel, that which paves the path for Nimul's resurrection!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
171	We must hurry!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
172	And...? What are you going to do? Destroy the Sacred Stones?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
173	Who's there?!
174	That voice...came from that guy all in black over there?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0027
175	N-no...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
176	Who is he? Do you know him?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
177	It's...S-Sol!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
178	Wh-what?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
179	Urgh...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
180	I thought you said you were getting used to my speed. Don't make me laugh! I'm here to kill someone ranked Captain or higher! You're not worth my time!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
181	I'm not worth your time? I'll prove you wrong!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
182	What?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0025
183	Urgh! Why, you little...	VO_neun.neun_sys_0027
184	If I couldn't learn from the past, I wouldn't be able to face Captain Othima again!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
185	I can't disappoint him—bless his soul—by losing to the likes of you!
186	You...actually managed to...wound me.	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
187	He's gone?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
188	You really shouldn't have done that.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
189	He's faster than before?! Whoa!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0020
190	I'll shred you to pieces, brat!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
191	Huzzzaaaaahh!!!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0007
192	What?!
193	Ack!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0026
194	Hey, hey, hey! It's not like you to get beaten so badly!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
195	Little frog?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
196	Stop calling me a frog!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
197	Hmph! You think another kid in the fight is gonna change anything? Fools!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
198	Behind me?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
199	Wh-whoa!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0028
200	Some of us aren't kids anymore.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0010
201	Urgh! Another one?!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
202	We are the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia! We will now join the battle in support of the Holy Guard!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0030
203	Soldiers of Greed Dike, prepare yourselves!!!
204	Captain Vettel! Chloe!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0009
205	We finally managed to subdue the Greed Dike forces in Envylia.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
206	I apologize for the delay. We came as soon as we could to help!
207	Th-thank you so much! This is definitely the boost we needed!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0033
208	There's no need to thank us. Had Captain Monzein not been there to help us...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
209	Our country would be in complete ruin by now.
210	It's only right that we would come to help during Northern Pride's time of need.
211	Paladins of the Holy Guard, hear me!	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
212	Knights of Lustburg and Gluttony Foss are on their way, along with even more soldiers of a few other countries!
213	Do not lose hope! We can and will drive back Greed Dike's forces! Hold fast, and victory will be ours!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
214	This must be what Commander Kanon and Captain Monzein were talking about!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
215	What?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
216	Little frog, I finally understand.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0010
217	This is what they meant when they said that caring for others is what gives us strength!
218	Heh, nice. You finally get it. Also, stop calling me a frog.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
219	Aaaaahh!!!
220	!!!
221	How long do you all intend to stand around and chat?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0013
222	You really think the lot of you can defeat us? You, who have known nothing but lives of comfort and ease?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0040
223	He's preparing to attack! Everybody watch out!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0022
224	You've all ticked me off! I'm going to kill—!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0011
225	Wh-what the...? What is he looking at?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
226	Tch! Took you long enough!	VO_neun.neun_chara_1004
227	Huh?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
228	I'll kill you later. Just you wait.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
229	Wha—?!
230	He...ran away?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
231	Captain Vettel, I'm going after him!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
232	Right! We'll cover you! Knights, raise your swords! This is the battle that will decide the fate of this world!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
233	We just received reports that the Scarlet Flame Guard have arrived from Envylia to support us!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
234	Not only that, but knights from other countries are on their way as well!
235	Looks like the wind's blowing in our favor. What are you going to do? Keep this up and you'll...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0024
236	...
237	Um, are you listening?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0001
238	The fair wind is still on our side.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
239	Huh?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
240	It is settled. We have won. All of you should surrender for your own good.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0030
241	What?! What are you talking about? We just said knights from around the world are headed this way.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0025
242	There's no way you can win.
243	It's not about numbers.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
244	The fate of this world was sealed the moment he arrived.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0007
245	Who?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
246	No... You can't mean...	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
247	A new future is about to be created. Take pride in knowing you will bear witness to the birth of a new era.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0008
248	She's gone?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
249	Miuna!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
250	I know! Let's go after her!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0004
251	Hey, redhead. We're in a tight spot because of what you did to the Matter. Do you understand?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
252	Urgh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
253	He's Sol? As in...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
254	As in the leader of the Templars?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
255	He's the one who killed Captain Yauras! He killed Captain Othima and Seida, too!
256	Wha—?!
257	You speak as though I'm some murderer. You lot started this, remember?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0012
258	The leader of the Templars?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
259	He's the one that killed our Captains?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0020
260	A wise man sees his neighbor's residence on fire and checks his own hearth.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
261	Huh?
262	It means it would be wise to pluck the buds of distress before they bloom. I won't let you derail our plans again, redhead.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
263	I'll kill you first.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
264	You're not going to steal Lucifer in place of the Matter, are you?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
265	Of course I will. Mercenaries don't work for free.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
266	We won't let you!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
267	He's only one man! Get him!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0025
268	S-stop! No!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
269	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
270	Aaaaahh!!!
271	No!!!
272	What the hell was that?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
273	He can cause explosions at will. Don't rush him without a plan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
274	Don't worry, I don't plan to blow everything up indiscriminately. I just need you to die.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
275	You...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
276	We won't let you take her!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
277	Get out of my way. I'd rather not kill women if I can avoid it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
278	I won't move! As the Lord Commander, I cannot let your barbarity continue!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
279	Lord...Commander?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
280	Kanon, you have to go! The situation at the Babel Ruins—!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
281	If we don't stop him here, he'll make his way to the Babel Ruins as well!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
282	It would be better to take care of him here than to risk having him join Orion!
283	So... You are Kanon. You're younger than I thought.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
284	I guess there's no avoiding it. We Templars share a bond that was forged in steel.
285	You caused the death of one of our own. I cannot allow you to live.
286	Sorry, but you're going to die with the redhead there.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
287	Can you do that without a head on your shoulders?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0044
288	Reimei?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
289	When did he sneak up on him?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
290	Didn't your parents teach you that it's dangerous to point a blade at someone?	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
291	Sorry, but I'm an assassin. I get paid to point blades at people. By the way, I have a question for you, too.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
292	And what would that be?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
293	I heard you fought against Kudanstein.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
294	If you're here, does that mean you killed Kudanstein?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0002
295	Kudanstein? He was a tiring one to deal with. I'll leave it up to your imagination.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
296	In that case...your time's up.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0012
297	Wh-where did he go?!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0026
298	I forgot to tell you. I'm pretty confident about my speed as well.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
299	How did he get...?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0025
300	Agh! Gah!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0023
301	Reimei!
302	Reimei!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
303	I'll say it one last time. I only need you to die. No one else.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
304	Urgh!	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0022
305	Wha—?!
306	Are you prepared to die?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0007
307	Ugh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
