001	Ugh...agh...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0043
002	I see. Your bravery is not unfounded. Your dexterity is impressive.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
003	However...you chose the wrong opponent.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
004	Ack...I'm still not done yet!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
005	Enough. The contrast in our abilities exudes from our bodies.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0030
006	I won't have you underestimate me! Compared to that fight...these can hardly be called scratches!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
007	I'll warn you that if you endure any more injuries, it'll have lasting consequences. You may die, you know?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
008	I'm well prepared for that!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
009	What are you doing?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
010	...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
011	Are you back?
012	Yes! I felt that something serious was going on so I ran back as fast I could!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
013	More importantly...what this?! Who is this girl?!
014	I'm not a girl, I'm Suzuka! And who do you think you are?! Don't get in the way of our battle!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0047
015	What do you mean battle?! You're just one-sidedly taking blows!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
016	It'll be dangerous for you to continue any further. I don't know what's going on, but you've lost. Now put down your sword.
017	That's nonsense! I still haven't been defeated! My sword is still...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
018	Ughh...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0043
019	See. What did I tell you?!
020	Ack...you villain! Getting in my way...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
021	You can hardly stand. Quick, you need to look after your injuries before it's too late.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
022	Shut up!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
023	Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
024	It's dangerous; get back!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
025	Enough with this!
026	...?!
027	Lord Commander Zain is busy right now! Can't you tell?!
028	If you want to challenge someone, you must choose the time and place! When you're going about things hectically, it's hard to go easy on you!
029	Go easy on me...?! I never...agh...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0027
030	...Why?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
031	Huh?
032	I've lived my life with just one goal: to become the best blademaster of my time.
033	I learned to hold a sword before chopsticks. Both night and day I continued to practice.
034	Even after I was acknowledged as a first class blademaster...I continued to travel and challenge others in order to hone my skill.
035	So why can't I even get a single blow in without being hurled miserably to my defeat?!
036	Ah, is that what you're worried about? The answer is easy.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
037	Your sword is lightweight, especially when compared with Lord Commander Zain's sword. It's just that.
038	You little...! How dare you stick your nose in other people's business and pretend like you know everything!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
039	I saw more than enough. Besides, you just said yourself...
040	What?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0029
041	All this time...you've been fighting on your own, haven't you?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
042	...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
043	You want to become the greatest blademaster of your generation. I think that's a wonderful dream, and I think you might actually be able to achieve it.
044	But...the way you are now, I don't think it's possible. After all, you're only using your power for yourself.
045	Only for myself...?
046	The look on your face says that's to be expected, but...that's not the case for Lord Zain.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
047	Lord Zain's sword is the Lord Commander's sword.
048	Each blow he deals must be stronger, faster, and more accurate than anyone else in the Holy Guard.
049	He seeks to save the continent, to carry the lives of thousands on the blade of his sword.
050	... ...
051	That's why...at any time, any place, he can't afford to lose to others.
052	Can you stop this weight with your sword?
053	We-well...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
054	Is your power enough to beat a sword that carries the will of countless people?
055	Umm...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
056	I...I give up.
057	Okay! That concludes this challenge.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
058	What is your name?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0001
059	I see...Su-Suzuka.
060	Hey... Suzuka. Why don't you come again?
061	Huh?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0047
062	You're not a Lord Commander, so you may not be able to carry the lives of thousands on the blade of your sword, but...
063	I'm sure that you'll be able to obtain your own strength.
064	When the time comes you can just challenge him again.
065	Lord Zain isn't the kind of person to run away. I'm sure he'll accept your challenge again. Right?
066	Oh...yes, but I'd prefer if it was when I have more time.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
067	See! So let's heal your wounds properly first! I'm going to help you bandage them.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
068	Tsk...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0042
069	All right. It's done! Don't push yourself too hard anymore.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0023
070	I thank you, Kanon. You prevented me from killing unnecessarily.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0033
071	Come on, Lord Zain! I'm sure that wasn't your intention!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0008
072	Ka-Kanon?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
073	Huh?
074	S-so you're Kanon?! The Paladin who drove Zangetsu, my eternal rival, to the ground?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0025
075	U-um, yeah, but...it was all thanks to Capitan Kudan and Kagura...and stuff.
076	I know that this might be too forward...I don't mind if it's just for now...but would you please keep me by your side?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0041
077	B-by my side?! What are you saying all of a sudden?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
078	I know I am unworthy! I am painfully aware of my own inadequacy!
079	It was brash of me to attempt to challenge you, Kanon, and the Lord Commander when I am only just as strong as Zangetsu!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0036
080	As both of us are women, I want to know the source of your strength and gallantry that allows you to hold your own men.
081	Please teach me this and let me stay by your side!
082	I-I'm not sure...what do you think, Lord Commander Zain?
083	It shouldn't be a problem. We have a long and difficult fight ahead of us. Every additional friend who stands by our side is a blessing.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
084	Bu-but...
085	I'll say this once again if you insist on not allowing me to accompany you at your side...
086	Then I'll end my own life here!
087	Why do you have to be so extreme?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0028
088	Seriously...fine.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
089	I don't think there's anything I can teach you, but if I leave you on your own there's no knowing what you'd do to yourself.
090	Th-then...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0009
091	Yes. Let's fight together, Suzuka!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
092	Thank you, mistress!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0034
093	Huh?! Hey, why are you calling me mistress?! Stop it! I don't like that title!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0026
094	Why?! I have acknowledged you as a worthy individual to whom I will serve. Of course, I will call you, mistress!
095	Knock it out!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_chara_0011
096	Oh, my mistress! Please, wait!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
097	Kanon has the power to almost unfairly draw people to her.
098	She is quite different than me and Cadanova. She may be the more worthy one for this day and age.
