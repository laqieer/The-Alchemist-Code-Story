001	The boys are on tenterhooks and the girls are all of a flutter... The whole town is in a lovey-dovey mood.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
002	Oooh! I love it! This is the best! This is a day for all the lovebirds in the city!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0010
003	Today, those whose hearts are as one will be happily wed at last... Hooray for White Day!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
004	Speaking of lovebirds...
005	The first pair to come to mind are Eve and Fraise! I wonder how they'll spend their time together today.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
006	They're an OTP, my ideal couple, so I'm sure they'll make the best of this wonderful day, but...I can't help feeling curious!
007	I know! I'll go ask Fraise what he plans to do today!
008	Hey there, Fraise! I was hoping we could have a little chat about White Day...	VO_mor.mor_sys_0001
009	Oh, oops! Didn't mean to bother you if you were in the middle of something.
010	Do you know this girl?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
011	She's my friend's little sister. It's good to see you again, Moa. This is Gino, my younger brother.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0001
012	Oh! Hi! Nice to meet you. My name is Moa!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0003
013	I don't care for introductions. I only came here to issue you a warning...Brother.
014	Huh? A warning?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
015	That's right. Fraise, I'm here to tell you not to get carried away with a stupid convention like White Day.
016	H-hey! What is that supposed to mean?!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
017	Exactly what it sounds like.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
018	Soldiers who absorb themselves in affairs of the heart soon grow weak, becoming the laughing stock of their peers. Hence my warning.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0002
019	Hey... Don't you think it's kinda harsh to start with that right off the bat, after being summoned here as a Phantom Soldier?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
020	Besides, you know what, Gino? I think my feelings have actually made me stronger, so today is pretty important to me.
021	What is wrong with you? You're not making any sense.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
022	Maybe you'll understand it for yourself someday.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
023	Moa... I have a favor to ask you.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0041
024	I'm all ears!
025	I don't want to trouble you, but do you think you could keep an eye on my little brother for me?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
026	M-me?!
027	He became a Phantom Soldier only recently, so there's a lot he doesn't know.
028	I should really be the one to show him the ropes, but he won't listen to me at all.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0011
029	Besides, I'm sure there are things that he would never share with me, but that he might be able to confide in a stranger about.
030	I can see where you're coming from, but...	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
031	Also... I've got to go and meet with Lady Eve shortly, and I really don't want to keep her waiting.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
032	Oh!
033	Why didn't you mention that earlier? I'd be delighted to help out!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0005
034	All I ask for in exchange is that you share the perfect White Day with Eve! Can you promise me that?
035	Thank you, Moa. And, yes, I think I can manage that.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0034
036	Well, Gino, I'm heading out for a bit. You two play nice.
037	What?! After all that stuff I said, you're just going to go ahead with this White Day nonsense anyway?!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0014
038	Just take it easy, all right? It'll be a while yet before you're accustomed to being a Phantom, and I don't want you getting into any trouble. Now, I'd best be off.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
039	Tch. I hate it when he treats me like a little kid.
040	Play nice...? It doesn't look like things are going to go that smoothly.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0011
041	Still, there's nothing else for it! Fraise needs to spend time with Eve today, and it's up to me to make sure he can.
042	Hey. You're Eve's... I mean, that woman's little sister, right?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
043	Well, actually, she's my cousin. But she's always been very kind to me, and looks out for me just as if she were my big sister.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0004
044	Hmm...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0044
045	Eve is always smiling! She's the best big sister I could have ever asked for.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
046	You don't need to tell me that.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
047	What?
048	Hey! Fraise! You there?
049	Huh? Where'd he go?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0001
050	He went out.
051	Aw, man... I was gonna get him to help me choose a present, but I guess I must've just missed him, huh? That's too bad.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
052	A present? Are you talking about a gift for White Day?!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0025
053	Well, uh... Yeah?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
054	Oh my gosh! So, so! Do you have a juicy love story to share? You've gotta tell me! I need to know!
055	A love story...? Well, I guess...I just wanted to get something for someone who's very important to me.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
056	Oooh!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
057	...
058	I heard about how guys are meant to give girls presents on White Day, and thought it'd be as good of an opportunity as any to show how much I appreciate her. I mean, she's always doing things for me.
059	...
060	I figured Fraise would probably have something for Eve, so I thought I'd ask him how he went about it, you know?
061	Ugh! For crying out loud! I'm so sick of hearing about this lovey-dovey crap! Just leave me out of it, all right?!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0015
062	Huh? What the hell is up with you, man? Who the heck are you, anyway?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0027
063	This is Fraise's younger brother. I only just met him myself, but he's been angsty like this from the outset. His attitude is really starting to get on my nerves!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
064	His younger brother, huh? Hmm...	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
065	What? You got something to say?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0025
066	Heh. Only that it seems to me that you don't like seeing Fraise get so close to Eve.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
067	Tch. So what? I don't have to like it.
068	Love just makes people weak. My brother is a shining example of that. Knights don't need to be distracted by such things.
069	But even after becoming a Phantom Soldier, Fraise keeps fooling around with all this sappy foolishness. It's so sickening, it's not even funny. What the hell is the point? I don't see one, and that's why I don't like it.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0040
070	Hey! Gino! Where are you going?!
071	Home. I've done what I came here to do—not that it made any difference. My warning clearly fell on deaf ears.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
072	Wait! I'm supposed to be looking after you, remember?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0014
073	Oh, no... I've lost sight of him! Where could he have gotten off to?!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0018
074	Hey!
075	Kevin! Would you mind helping me search for Gino?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
076	Course not. Leaving a lady to deal with her problems alone goes against my principles, so...	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
077	Oho! I dare you to say that again!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
078	Fine. You'd better move it, because crowding around outside the sweetshop like that is blocking the sidewalk!	VO_gino.gino_battle_0011
079	Shut your mouth! Girls go crazy for the cookies they sell here. If you want us to move, you're gonna have to make us!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0013
080	That's easily done. No skin off my back. Beating a bunch of pathetic, perverted weaklings is child's play for me.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0038
081	The hell did you just say?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
082	Jeez! That idiot... He needs to learn how to keep a cool head!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
083	Ugh... I might as well be babysitting a goblin! Come on, Kevin. We'd better join him.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
