001	Chihaya, where are you? We need to find her quickly.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
002	Chihaya has the power of a shrine maiden, so she won't be defeated that easily.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0010
003	Still, we can't afford for her to be on her own. You were being pursued, right?	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
004	What is the pursuer like? Have you seen him?
005	Yes. He's a super strong and scary guy...	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0004
006	If he finds Chihaya before we do, I'm sure he'll—
007	Don't worry! It'll be okay. After all, we're Paladins!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0007
008	Yep, yep. Even if he's captured her already, we'll get her back safely!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0007
009	O-okay...	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0030
010	What, are you dissatisfied? Don't you think we're competent?	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0014
011	Well, you both look like children. I feel like even I could defeat you.	VO_mizuchi.mizuchi_sys_0031
012	What did you say? Hold on!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
013	Kagura is one thing, but you think I look like a child too? I can't pretend I didn't hear that!
014	Oh, perfect timing!
015	Watch carefully, Mizuchi. I'll show you that I'm no child!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0014
