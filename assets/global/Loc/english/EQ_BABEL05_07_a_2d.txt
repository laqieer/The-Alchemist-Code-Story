001	No one can construct something without blueprints...
002	In the same way that it's impossible to build anything without components.
003	That's how the world works.
004	I can't hear anything from the other side of the wall.
005	My brother...is gone. I have nothing left.
006	I can't...make anything from this.
007	...
008	...
009	...
010	(She's fallen into despair.)
011	(The person she was chasing is gone. She's lost sight of her goal. She's got no hope left for the future.)
012	(I know it's inevitable, but...)
013	(But...)
014	(Can I really do nothing but watch? Observe?)
015	(Why did I come here?)
016	(Wasn't I supposed to be fighting for the future?)
017	...
018	Yes... That's right, I...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
019	...
020	I thought to myself, over, and over, and over, and over again...how badly I wanted to see him.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0019
021	I know.
022	Yet I still didn't get to see him.
023	Yeah.
024	...
025	He always did as he pleased, didn't he?
026	Just like me.
027	Huh?
028	I thought too highly of you, Magnus.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
029	Wh-what are you saying?
030	He's pigheaded, stubborn, selfish, and a show off...just like me.
031	Just like me! How...annoying!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
032	(She's...)
033	(She's crying.)
034	...
035	Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
036	You got that right.
037	(He's in pain, too.)
038	Hahah.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
039	You can't fool me anymore. I can tell.
040	You're my brother. You're Magnus.
041	If you say that you don't want to see me, then I'll stay away.
042	If you say that you want me to live, then I will survive.
043	If you say that you want me to forget, then...
044	Then I'll... I'll...
045	Unngh...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
046	Even if you say those things, I'm the one who gets to decide whether or not I do them!
047	We're brother and sister, so you can accept that, right?
048	Magnus...
049	He would. Knowing him.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
050	Look!
051	The Demonic Soldiers are coming!
052	Hahah.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0008
053	Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
054	How are we supposed to get outta this one, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
055	What was all that you were saying about winning it all in one burst?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0017
056	Guess he must've had a really bad hand.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
057	Your luck is awful, Magnus.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
058	(They're smiling through their tears.)
059	Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
060	...
061	I've always been the one who had to take care of his messes.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
062	Now, here's a question for you.
063	Shoot.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
064	Here we have two battered people who can barely stand...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1020
065	So we do.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
066	There are dozens of Demonic Soldiers, and more of them just keep popping up. There's little to no chance of victory...
067	As you say.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
068	What should one do in such a situation?
069	I know this one.
070	I'm all ears, Miss Albea.
071	One should live.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
072	Huh?!
073	We have a winner!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
074	Grrrrrooooorrrrrrrggggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
075	All right. Let's do this.
076	You're swaying on your feet.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
077	So are you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
078	I don't think for a moment that we can win this.
079	That's called...a gamble.
080	Yes. That's what it's all about.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
081	Gyaaaaaaaah!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0001
082	Ngh!
083	...
084	They...stopped?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
085	At long last...
086	Mira?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
087	The time has finally come.
088	What're you...?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
089	Things never go as planned.
090	Meaning...?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
091	I believe that you cannot lose hope, even in the midst of despair.
092	The present is built upon all of our past hopes for the future.
093	Time is not an object for strong convictions and those who hold them.
094	Is that...the chime of the clock tower?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
095	We shouldn't be able to hear it from here, though.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
096	I know now that this world isn't a lost cause.
097	This is the result of your hard work.
098	Driven by the Alchemia which transforms despair into hope...
099	The reasons that you fight and the convictions that you hold will draw their like unto us.
100	The bridge formed by such convictions can only be traversed when the chasm between hope and despair is at its widest.
101	Now is that time.
102	I'm sorry. I don't really understand what you're saying.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
103	Well, to put it simply...
104	I can do something to help!
105	Now, and only now, for the sake of those who live in this present!
106	I'll do it for you because you... You kept smiling through everything!
107	Ungh... Unguhhh... Waaaaah!
108	Wh-what's wrong, Mira? Why are you crying?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
109	I'm... I'm sorry.
110	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
111	I couldn't do anything to help any sooner.
112	I wanted to, but it was all a matter of time... There was nothing I could do!
113	All I could do was watch...and wait.
114	That's not true, Mira.
115	She's right.
116	Forget about what's done. Just show us what you can do from here on out.
117	The future...?
118	I...!
119	Right!
120	I don't really get it, but I guess this means we're going on some kind of journey together.
121	Does that sound about right, time traveler?
122	Yes! Yeah! You've got it!
123	Space-Time Manipulator!
124	Adrift in the sea of time, the pendulum stirs the depths of the waves. Gather where the light falls, that I may see you.
125	Sea floor and cerulean sky, woven and unfurled. Be it chance or be it fate, we are chased by dreams both infinite and finite.
126	Now, come!
127	Chance Encounter!!!
128	What in the—?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
129	Wh-where are we?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
130	Phantoms?! Wait, no, that can't be right.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
131	Chance Encounter.
132	A space-time technique which, for a limited time, pulls together people who hold the same convictions from their separate times.
133	Even people who have no idea what's going on? Isn't that kinda rude?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0004
134	Well... It is somewhat random.
135	It's a big help, either way.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
136	Nyx...?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0002
137	What?! How do you know Nyx?!
138	No, you aren't Nyx at all. Where are we?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
139	H-how did we get here? Just a second ago we were—	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
140	Grooooorrrgggghhhhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0001
141	Ahh!	VO_rofia.rofia_battle_0022
142	What in the world...?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
143	I have no idea what's going on, but they're not our enemies, right?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
144	Probably not!
145	Yo.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
146	Yes?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0006
147	You wanna lend us a hand?
148	Who are you, anyway, old man? You're suspicious.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
149	Heh. I'm not an old man. Call me Mister Will.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0015
150	Only an old man would want to be called "Mister."	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0031
151	What?! The hell kinda logic is that?!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
152	Besides, Will is an old man's name.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
153	Oh, is it now?! Ha! Hell no it ain't!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
154	Are those...Demonic Soldiers?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0021
155	Now how do you know that, pretty lady?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
156	P-pretty lady?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
157	Yeah, you. Don't you like it?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
158	W-we only just met!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0050
159	Was I being too forward?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0035
160	N-no, not at all! I mean, I...! I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement.
161	Anyway, it doesn't really matter who you guys are right now.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
162	We don't have the strength to fight them at the moment, so would you mind doing us a favor and helping out?
163	To what end?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0001
164	Our survival.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
165	Y-your eyes are all red. Have you been crying?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
166	Someone very important to me just passed away. I want to live on, for their sake.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
167	So, please... Please help us.
168	...
169	Very well. I accept your request as reasonable and just.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_1001
170	Cheryl?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
171	I need no reason to execute these disgusting products of Alchemy, believe you me!
172	Moreover, by fighting beside these people, who are only trying to survive, and by experiencing this other time...
173	Perhaps we can find out why.
174	Why...you were killed.
175	Maybe.	VO_rofia.rofia_chara_1023
176	Don't cry.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
177	...
178	I want to keep on living, too.
179	Just like you.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
180	I...!
181	Th-thank you.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0033
182	Magnus...
183	I'll be back soon.
184	Albea, that coat...
185	It's a present from my brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
186	Well, just know that you can hide a lot in a coat.	VO_magnus.magnus_event_1015
187	Albea!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
188	Wh-what?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
189	Showdown!
190	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0027
191	Is this...Magnus' Alchemy?
192	It was the first Alchemy I ever used as a Paladin.
193	I imbued my uniform with it.
194	That coat...?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
195	I hope you know that it came from the bottom of my heart.
196	Magnus' true feelings...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0024
197	Are flowing into my gadgets!
198	What is this? This...power...!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0026
199	What the hell?! I haven't seen this before!	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
200	This isn't Alchemy! What is it?
201	This scent...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
202	It smells like...tea leaves!
203	Oh, my!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0006
204	It appears the stars have reached you.
205	Healing Polaris!
206	The stars tremble and surround you.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
207	Shine, Albea!
208	May I borrow it?	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0002
209	P-please take good care of it.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
210	But of course.	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0005
211	What are you going to do with it?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
212	Project the star seeped in memories upon the ice to reveal the trail.
213	Also...
214	Y-yes?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
215	We will be needing a spell to make sure that everything goes well!	VO_sophia.sophia_sys_0007
216	J-just make sure you give it back!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
217	I guess I owe her one.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
218	You'd better return the favor someday.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
219	I will... When I visit her for some tea.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
220	Whoa!
221	My gadgets' Alchemia is fully recharged.
222	They should work now.
223	The weapon my father made, the clothes my mother sewed, and Magnus' Alchemy...
224	Boot up, Campanella!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
225	It's so bright! Is this...Alchemy?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0046
226	It's so pretty.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0046
227	Father, mother, Magnus... Let's go!
228	It's family vacation time!
229	Grrrroooooorrgghhh!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
230	Ah, this is the true pleasure of traveling.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
231	Huh?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
232	Nothing beats raising hell with the people you meet along the way.
233	We're not strangers anymore!
234	Watch this!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0001
235	I'm gonna show you why I'm someone you can be proud of.	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0002
236	Cause I'm gonna win this in one burst!	VO_albell.albell_favorite_0003
