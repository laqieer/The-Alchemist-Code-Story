001	Urk! They just keep coming! Kamui, we're not going to get anywhere like this!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
002	I beseech the supreme...!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0004
003	My purification powers can't keep up with this number of Jam! How many does Ceclidis have in this castle?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
004	What is this?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
005	Logi, you must keep moving! If you let yourself get caught up in this, you'll end up cursed as well!
006	I just saw a dead body in the shadow of the pillar... The body of a soldier of the Royal Army.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
007	What?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0012
008	They're... They're not just eating people...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0042
009	They're multiplying by eating people!
010	Wh-what?! Aren't the Jam under Ceclidis' control?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
011	This must be why there are so few people in the cities and in the castle... They've been gorging themselves on their own people!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0022
012	We have to stop them before anyone else becomes a victim of the Jam!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0019
013	Kamui.
014	I know. Complete purification of the Jam in the castle will have to come later.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
015	Tina, please make a path for us with your Wind Ouija, straight for the throne!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
