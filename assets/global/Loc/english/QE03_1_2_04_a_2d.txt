001	Yikes! I got a little too carried away with practice!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0020
002	If we run we can make it...oh! We ended up only practicing how to ride standing, and I didn't even teach you the rules!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0016
003	Whoa! You're right...what should I do?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0024
004	It's not that difficult.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
005	Sabbath is a sport you play with a team of five.
006	Two of the five players ride on Broom Aces and attempt to remove their opponents' mask. They're called the Aces.
007	It's the job of the other three, called Lamps, to attack their opponents from the ground using magic.
008	The mask is worn by the team leader who is called the Face.
009	This has to be one of the two Aces.
010	It's simple really. If you either shoot down or remove the mask from the other team's Face, your team wins.
011	Shoot down?! That sounds so scary!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
012	It'll be fine! There's snow on the ground.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
013	Besides, attacks are limited to weak fire magic. Anyway, if you set fire to the Face's clothes, it'll be hot enough for them to willingly fall on the snow.
014	So about who's gonna wear this thing we're supposed to protect...
015	Wow! It's kind of beautiful!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0024
016	The mask was made in Saga from dragon scales. It's resistant to fire so it'll protect the face. This...	VO_alma.alma_sys_0004
017	?!
018	This time you wear it, Liz! You're the Face!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0005
019	What?! Not you, Alma?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
020	Come on. This way it's more fun!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0008
021	No, but...whoa!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
022	Oh? Are you getting caught up in the lure of Sabbath?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
023	Hey...something's coming this way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0025
