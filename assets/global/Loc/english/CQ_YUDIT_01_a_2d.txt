001	Oh man... I keep wracking my brains, but I just can't figure it out.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
002	Still, I can't afford not to, not with the Holy Guard backing me. I owe them some results.
003	This must be Rosa's place. Could he really be here?	VO_judith.judith_chara_1002
004	I mean, how does a guy from Wadatsumi end up all the way out here in Wratharis?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
005	Hello? Anyone home?
006	Greetings, madam. How may I help you?
007	Hi! I'm Judith. I sent word that I'd be coming to consult Eizan regarding a...personal matter. Is he here?	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
008	Ah, Miss Judith! We've been expecting you. Follow me.
009	...
010	Hmm... Seems I've exhausted the potential of this compound. If I could get my hands on some of that ore, instead...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
011	Yes... I think that's just what I need.
012	Whoa!
013	Hmm...
014	This is incredible!
015	Hmm?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
016	Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt. I just got lost in your craftsmanship.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0036
017	And who might you be? Have you got a commission for me?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1009
018	Not exactly. My name is Judith. I've come to ask you for some help.	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
019	Is that so? Come to think of it, I did hear somebody would be coming.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
020	So what's this all about?
021	I guess you could say I need some advice.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
022	I've been working with the Holy Guard to develop weaponized mechas, called mech gears.
023	The idea is to create a weapon strong enough to protect everyone in the world. A mech gear that can bring about world peace.
024	But...I'm stuck. I'm not exactly a weaponsmith myself, so I was hoping to get some advice from a professional in that field. From you.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
025	Why me?
026	Because in my eyes, there's no one better. I've seen some of your work before, and they were hands down the greatest weapons I'd ever handled.
027	So I figured if anyone could help me through this slump, it'd be you.
028	Very well. Let's see this mech gear of yours.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
029	R-right! Here.	VO_judith.judith_battle_1016
030	So...you're looking for advice?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
031	Hmm...
032	Come. Spar with me.
033	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
034	The best way to tell what a tool is worth is to use it for its intended purpose.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
035	If this thing's the weapon you claim it is, then prove it. Show me what it can do in battle.
036	And while you're at it, show me your conviction as its creator.
037	M-my...conviction?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
038	If you aren't prepared to do so, then you might as well turn around and head back the way you came.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
039	No, I am! I'll do it! I'll show you what my mech gear can do!
