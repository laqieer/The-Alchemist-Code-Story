001	Phew! We finally made it back to the first floor! What was it with that dog?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0024
002	Thanks to today's events, I now officially hate dogs.
003	By the way, you said that this was the Elester family's coat of arms, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
004	It's a strange design, isn't it? The continent is depicted very oddly.
005	This isn't the continent, aye! It's an island!
006	An island?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
007	It's lore that's been passed down within my family.
008	The ancestors of the Elester family brought peace to this world by defeating a large island that carried disaster.
009	This is said to be a depiction of that story.
010	Defeating an island that carries disaster—what a strange story.
011	Hey, more importantly, what do we do from now? The Sacred Stone isn't here, right?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
012	We're still not giving up.
013	Since the Beckrams have infiltrated this place, I doubt the Sacred Stone is here, but let's check the top floor just in case.
014	Do we have to? Ack...	VO_ronnie.ronnie_favorite_0025
