001	I'll just run if things turn sour.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
002	You can't lose a fight you've already run away from.
003	All right. This is a bold gamble, but I'm going for it.	VO_magnus.magnus_chara_1004
004	Where is he?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
005	Hey, Albea. This is a pleasant surprise.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
006	Where did he get to?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
007	You came all the way to Wratharis in search of your brother? That's a hell of a trip.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0044
008	This is a big country. Want me to help you find him?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
009	I heard that there's a very energetic, blond-haired man with a distinct laugh here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
010	Apparently, he's been seen hanging around with a man with pink hair...
011	A genius gambler who never loses.
012	My brother, Magnus. I heard he's here.
013	...
014	Let me see my brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
015	Heheh.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
016	Never heard of him.
017	You...!
018	No... He is here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0044
019	...
020	Somewhere near... Is he outsi—?
021	I told you to steer clear of all this.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0012
022	Let me through!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
023	Not a chance.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
024	Why did you keep quiet about him?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
025	I'm actually quite talkative once you get to know me.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1020
026	You know my brother, don't you?! Why didn't you tell me?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
027	To tell you the truth, it's not actually the gambling I'm into.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
028	Don't change the subject!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
029	He's always winning big and losing just as much in these games.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
030	What I enjoy...is watching him go at it.
031	I won't let you mess up his hand.
032	What are you going on about?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
033	Is it so wrong for me to want to see my brother?!
034	Am I not even allowed to let him know that a relative of ours passed away?!
035	Are you saying that we need to live our whole lives apart...?!
036	Without even knowing where the other is or what they are doing?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
037	I...!
038	What I'm saying...is that I don't want anyone to die.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
039	Who's going to...?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
040	People pray before making a bet, don't they?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
041	Even though they know it won't change a thing.
042	This is my prayer.
043	It's better for at least one of you to survive.
044	Better that, than both of you being gone.
045	You won't...change your mind, will you? No matter what I say.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
046	There are just some things that can't be said.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
047	Move.	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
048	Tch! Show-off!
049	Yeah, we guys are always trying to show off.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
050	I said move! Let me see my brother!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0013
051	Why don't you make me?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
052	What is it with you?! One second you're protecting me, and the next you're standing in my way!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
053	I told you from the start.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
054	I'm a troublemaker.
055	You...!
056	I'm an ally to none...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
057	But that doesn't make me the enemy.
058	I just go around causing trouble.
059	Sir, please refrain from causing quarrels within the—	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0025
060	You mean trouble.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0039
061	Yes, fine. Please refrain from causing trouble within this—	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
062	You know what? I think I'm gonna stir up some trouble.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0024
063	Sir, please, no! We don't want any trouble!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0027
064	Life off the grid isn't half bad.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_1016
065	Getting blacklisted by this place... You think that means anything to me?
066	I...see.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0016
067	If that's how you want to do this...
068	Then I'll show you what I'm made of!
069	Please, stop!	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0028
070	I can't call myself good-natured, but...	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
071	I am very kind.
072	I'll only hurt you a little bit.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0010
073	We'll see who gets hurt!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0032
074	Why won't these people stop?!	VO_knightf.knightf_battle_0022
