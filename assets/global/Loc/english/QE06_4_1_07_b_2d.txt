001	Grah! Hold your ranks, men! Kill them one by one!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0021
002	Their wounds! The flesh is regenerating!
003	"I beseech the supreme..."	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0001
004	Hmm... Demons granted the power of the undead during their creation, it seems.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
005	What...?!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0017
006	Stay close, Agatha.
007	To think that Wadatsumi has become such a den of evil! No... That phrase doesn't even quite do it justice.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
008	Perhaps "hell" would be more fitting.
009	Monzein said that my roots, my destiny could be found here in this place.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
010	I cannot allow myself to be stopped now!
011	Move, Logi!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
012	!!!
013	Ngh... We have to find a way through somehow...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
014	Perhaps I can be of help?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
015	A bullet...? And that voice! Could it be...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
016	Hey. Long time no see.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
017	Edgar?! What are you doing here?
018	Save the reunion! We're still under attack!
019	You've got nothing to worry about. I'm a professional demon hunter now, you know!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
020	What...?
021	I'll end this right here and now. Huzzah!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0032
022	Incredible! Subjugated in the blink of an eye!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0046
023	...!
024	Logi, watch out!
025	?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0026
026	So, we finally meet, Logi Crowley.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
027	I've been searching at great length for you, and anticipating your arrival with bated breath. We have a future to create together.
028	This marks the end of an old journey, and the beginning of a new one. And this time, no one will be able to stand in our way!
029	Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Tigris!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
030	And you are...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
031	My name is Amane. Your mother, Celis, took me in as one of her own. I'm a member of the Demon Elimination Corps known as Blade Fox.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
032	What?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
033	There's...so much we have to discuss.
034	The long and the short of it is, you are the sole beacon of hope for the land of Wadatsumi, Logi Crowley.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
