001	Phew, that was a fine workout.
002	Ugh... You just got done with all that training and you still wiped the floor without breaking a sweat. You didn't even need me to back you up.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
003	You've got a tough sister.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
004	...
005	Ren.
006	I haven't forgotten about the mission. Though I'd like to point out that I've said before that training too much before a mission makes getting them done a lot harder.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
007	Become stronger than me and I'll consider it.
008	I could train my whole life and it still wouldn't be enough...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
009	...
010	...
011	I would come here after training to think about my sister.
012	Nothing about her seemed like she was about to die.
013	The three years the doctors gave her were already up, but she was still standing.
014	Though I always knew she could die at any time.
015	I knew that there was no good answer to the issue I was preoccupied with.
016	If only...	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
017	I couldn't bear to say the words. "If only she could live."
018	Those words would only hurt if things went badly.
019	Hurt who?
020	Me, of course.
021	Sigh... Jeez!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
022	It's time, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
023	Yeah, I know. I'm ready.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
024	We have demons to exorcise.
025	I still sometimes wonder.
026	What was on Natsume's mind? How did she feel about it herself?
028	But I never asked her. Because if I did...
027	I thought she might disappear like one of those bubbles.
