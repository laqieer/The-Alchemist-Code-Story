001	Unbelievable! Their rebellion is giving birth to a great tragedy in the world. Are you going to turn a blind eye to that fact?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
002	How can you be so detached? Their lands were burned. They've lost their families. How are they different from us?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
003	What...?
004	Zeke found us, and so we were able to grow up in such a loving environment.
005	Our encounter with him was nothing more than a coincidence.
006	They...just weren't able to encounter such love.
007	Don't put us in the same boat as them.
008	But we are! If we hadn't met father, I'm sure we would be the same!
009	Don't be stupid! We're siblings. It was fate!
010	Thank you, Logi, but...I'm painfully aware of how horrible it feels not to have a place you can call home.
011	You feel the same, don't you, Dias? Power doesn't solve anything. We need to look for other ways—
012	Shut up! This spiral of tragedy needs to be stopped! You two don't understand anything!
013	What're you ranting about? I heard you saved the village from monsters. It appears you've been running around doing as you please.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0030
014	Father! My...apologies.
015	From here we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights. Our destination is the Gilrack Ruins beyond that.
016	Most likely, we will find the rebel's hideout there.
017	Logi, Dias, you join the scouting party. Agatha, you come with me.
018	Yes, Sir!
