001	Is that all of 'em? Wooooooo! We did it!!!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0032
002	Eek! My poor ears! Don't shout when you're this close!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
003	Captain! We've successfully put out the fire! We also finished healing the injured!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
004	We're not sure about the whereabouts of some of the Holy Order's investigation team, but there were no casualties amongst the villagers.
005	I see. That's a relief...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
006	Thank you, everyone! We'd be lost without the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0034
007	We can't take too much praise... Look at this place, it's been burned to the ground. How can we ask you to keep living in a place like this?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0031
008	It'll be difficult, but...what's most important is that we're all together. We'll figure something out.
009	The Scarlet Flame Guard will provide whatever we can to help you rebuild.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
010	Thank you so much!
011	Hmm?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
012	...
013	Hm. Guess I should keep an eye out for now.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
014	Well, I guess we finally get to head back! I'm sure everyone's tired, so rest up!
015	Phew...	VO_vetel.vetel_chara_1007
016	My body feels like lead... I feel like I've been sleeping forever... What time is it?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
017	Natalie said not to worry, but... I wonder if Captain Vettel is really going to be okay...	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
018	Wait, Captain Vettel?! You're awake?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
019	Hn, yeah... Morning—	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
020	E-everyone! Come quick! Captain Vettel is awake!
021	...Hnn?
022	Vettel's awake?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0027
023	H-huh?! What's wrong with you all?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0028
024	Don't you 'what's wrong' with me, mister!
025	The second we got back to base you fell asleep, but it's been three days since then!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
026	R-really?! No wonder I feel so well rested...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
027	I knew you weren't in critical condition or anything like that, so I let it be for now, but Chloe was worried sick! She barely even left the room!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0022
028	I told you that you were seriously overworking yourself!
029	This is exactly why I told you to take a break! If you'd taken a break like I told you to, it would've never gotten this bad!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
030	Exactly! You gotta get some sleep BEFORE you pass out for three days!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
031	S-sorry...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0035
032	Stop trying to carry all of our responsibilities by yourself, and put yourself first for once!
033	I know you care about all of us, but we care about you too, you know!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0002
034	She's right, Captain!
035	(I thought I had things under control, but look at how much I worried everyone... I still have a lot to learn.)	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
036	...
037	I'm sorry for worrying you all, but I promise I'll do better this time.
038	...And if I ever do anything irresponsible enough to end up in that place again, well, I know he'll set me straight.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
039	He? Who are you talking about?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
040	Ah, it's nothing...	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
041	...
042	...Um!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1004
043	What is it?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0005
044	...I... I'm so sorry. I'm still not strong enough to be of help to you.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0031
045	Victor...
046	I know I'm still lacking in many ways! But...I really want to support you however I can!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
047	I look up to you so much! I want to become a knight just like you, just watch and wait, so that's why—!
048	I'd say his heart is in the right place.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
049	Ren?
050	Victor has spent all this time looking at his comrades and wondering what he can do to help them.	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
051	Besides, he managed to not just protect the village, but even fight in your stead in that final battle.
052	Don't you think he's grown strong enough to carry some of that burden of yours?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
053	He even suggested that everybody try and do some of your work while you were snoring away.
054	All in order to lighten your load a little when you woke up.
055	He did? Thank you, Victor.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
056	If that's true, I suppose I could give you a bit more responsibility.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
057	D-does that mean—?!
058	That's right. Congrats, Victor. I'm promoting you to Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
059	...Huh?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0025
060	Wh-what?! Y-you can't just say such a thing out of nowhere! M-me? Captain?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0026
061	Do you have any objections?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
062	No, no, no! Not at all! I'm just a little surprised!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1002
063	It'll be a lot of responsibility, Victor. Prepare yourself, because I'm going to be stricter on you than ever.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0007
064	Well, then I'll play good cop. I'll help you out here and there.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
065	Victor! Let's do our best together!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
066	Whoa, what! No way! I can't believe I made it to captain! Heheh... Nice!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
067	Hold on! This isn't happening right away, right? Vettel?
068	Haha, of course. I've still got some life left in me.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0023
069	I will continue to do my best for all of you. Promise.
070	(Happy now, Gerald?)
071	...And that concludes my report on the matter.
072	I see... How unfortunate. I had hoped to learn more about these ruins, but if they have been burned down...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
073	Yes... But I'm happy to report the villagers made it out unharmed. It is a small mercy.
074	A silver lining in this dark cloud indeed. I must also extend my gratitude to you for keeping the members of our expedition safe.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
075	Ah, before I forget. You mentioned you were concerned that some of our members were unaccounted for after the battle. I'm happy to report that they simply ran back to report here when things got a bit too heated.
084	They are all safe and sound.
076	Really? What a relief.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
077	There's a chance something like this will happen again next time a ruin is excavated in Envylia.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
078	Therefore the Scarlet Flame Guard plans to compile what we have learned about our opponents and the battle strategies we made use of, and share it with you.
079	That's a wonderful plan, and I certainly won't say no to that offer. But don't the knights have enough on their plate already? Wouldn't this be yet another burden?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
080	Researching and recording this kind of thing may attract bad people your way, as well.
081	Are you sure you want to do this? The Holy Order is willing to take on this task in your place if needed.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
082	You're right... This would be terribly hard to do alone.
083	Luckily for me, thanks to all my comrades: I'm not.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
