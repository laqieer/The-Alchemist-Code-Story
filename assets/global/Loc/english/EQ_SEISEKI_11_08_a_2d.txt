001	That sword's purpose...was to help that man live on.
002	My father forged that sword solely for the purpose of helping him live on...and yet...
003	It was...all for nothing.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
004	Miuna...
005	Not for nothing, I think.
006	What are you saying?! That man, he just used my father's sword to...	VO_miuna.miuna_battle_0025
007	Yes, but in the end, he was able to remember his true self.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
008	That he was able to remember the values he once held when he received that sword; after a life of regrets... Isn't that proof that your father's heart was able to reach him?
009	I mean... Maybe, but...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
010	The Yogi Ku that I knew had a greater vision of the world than just what laid before him.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
011	He was the kind of person who looked into people's hearts and could be deeply moved by what he saw. That's what inspired him to forge this sword.
012	But if the wielder dies, all of that just...ends!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0019
013	I disagree.
014	Huh?
015	It doesn't end unless the people left behind let it.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
016	Doesn't...end...?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
017	His dream to end the chaos and suffering of the world with his sword... It's something of a reckless ambition, but if we carry on his will, then it will never die.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
018	That will... That heart that Yogi Ku was so taken with...
019	...!
020	Ah, classic Yogi Ku; to make such an incredible sword by making use of the "other" world.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0020
021	Cadanova...
022	I will use this sword to carry out Zehn's dreams, as your father would have wanted, and not just me... Right, Kanon?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
023	Yes! I promised Zehn himself that I would, after all.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
024	Do you understand now, Miu? Yogi Ku's efforts were not in vain.
025	Your father was a great man, and his legacy will live on.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
026	Y-you're right! Thank you...	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
027	W-wait, what? Why are you crying?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0029
028	Grrrrrnghhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
029	Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
030	...?!
031	Nnghhhhh... Gwa...gwaaaaaah!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
032	No, it can't be!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
033	It seems that he is close to being completely overwhelmed by the power of darkness. This is...unfortunate.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0025
034	No...!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0020
035	At this point, I think it's too late. I think...it may have already been too late the moment he allowed the darkness into his body at all.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
036	Which he did, despite knowing how it would end.
037	Too late...? Meaning that there's no way he can be returned to normal?!	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_1028
038	Exactly. Now that it's come to this, there's only one thing left to do. We must take him down.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
039	...!
040	Kanon, come. I cannot deal with his powers of darkness without your powers of light.
041	W-wait, but...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
042	What is it?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
043	Zahar, he... He pushed himself into the darkness in order to save us! After that, I...
044	That is exactly why we need to do this.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0012
045	Huh?
046	He lost himself to the darkness and now has the potential to push this world to the brink of destruction. Do you think that is what he would want?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
047	...!
048	Well...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
049	Zahar stood apart from the rest of us, but in his last moments I saw that he was just as committed to truth and justice as any knight of the Holy Guard.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
050	He has been my enemy, but I find myself compelled to help him stay true to the justice he threw us away for.
051	If this is the fate he must be left to, I prefer to deal with it personally.
052	...!
053	Uggg....gyaaahahahhh!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0008
054	The darkness is escalating more quickly than I expected! Hurry, Kanon!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
055	Urk! Hyaaaahh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
