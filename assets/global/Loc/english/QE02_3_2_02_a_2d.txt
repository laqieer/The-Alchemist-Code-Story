001	We still can't catch up with him. I guess that's to be expected from Zeke's son. He seems quite adept with a horse.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
002	Every human lives their own form of justice, was it?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
003	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
004	Those are Zeke's words. Your opponents have their own concept of justice. It's this difference in beliefs that gives birth to conflict.
005	Zeke, huh? I just can't bring myself to believe that man would start a revolt.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
006	And why are you pursuing the young lady?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
007	What a stupid question.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
008	You know very well about my policy regarding not letting a girl cry.
009	Don't kid me. I'm talking about what happens after that. Are you also searching for the Sacred Stone?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
010	You could say that.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0004
011	What are you looking for beyond that? Wealth? Power?
012	Tsk. What are you playing at? I don't have time to be chatting idly with you.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
013	Don't try to evade the question. Just answer.	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0002
014	Seriously. Do you think I'm the kind of person who would be motivated by wealth and power?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
015	You're an idiot, but you're not motivated by short-term interests...that much I know.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
016	That's exactly why I'm asking you what your motivation is.
017	You just can't let it go, can you?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
018	I'm fulfilling a promise I made to Fiona's old man. Are you happy now?
019	Promise?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0044
020	I made a promise with her old man. Although, now that he's dead, it might be pointless.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
021	Let's save the talk for later. Those troublesome dogs are waiting for us!
022	Hey! Hold on!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0002
