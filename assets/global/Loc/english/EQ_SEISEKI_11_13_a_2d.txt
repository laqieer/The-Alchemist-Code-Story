001	Agh!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
002	C-Captain Kudan?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
003	Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
004	Urgh! Y-you bastard!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
005	Heh heh. S-see? Just as I...th-thought.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0008
006	Urgh! Y-you planned this all along?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
007	T-told you I'm an assassin. We will do...wh-whatever it takes to...slay our target.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0011
008	Reimei.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
009	L-long time no see, K-Kudanstein. Glad to...see you're alive.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0008
010	Nngh! This... This can't be!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
011	Sorry, Reimei, I don't think I can get you out of this one.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0035
012	Heh, d-don't sweat it. I wasn't counting...on it.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0019
013	Still...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
014	...?
015	We lived and walked through the same darkness.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
016	Allow me to at least send you off with a gift. His life.
017	Heh, h-how unexpected...of you. Gah!	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
018	Reimei!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
019	B-but hear me, Kudanstein.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0027
020	Having traveled with you... I-I can tell.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0018
021	Y-your strength is...drawn from your will to...protect those who are d-dear to you.
022	Those who are dear to me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0027
023	Kagura and...this world. You want to protect...them all. That's what g-gives you strength.
024	M-me?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
025	Remember, Kudanstein.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0012
026	Your strength is...only seen in those who...have something to p-protect. It's a true...unwavering strength.
027	You... You don't know what you're talking about.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
028	D-don't cheat yourself. Heh heh, I...envy you, you know?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
029	Envy...me?
030	Yeah, after losing...the one person I...wanted to protect, I can...never achieve the s-strength you have.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0011
031	You mean Chihaya? You still...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
032	Had I strength like yours... I could have protected...her.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
033	I wish I...could have seen...wh-where the path you walk would...take you.
034	Do not worry, Reimei.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
035	...?
036	Your soul, too, will become part of my strength. Whether you mean it to or not.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
037	Wha—?
038	Don't you dare avert your eyes from the path I walk. I need you to bear witness to my fate.
039	Heh heh...s-sure thing...friend.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0008
040	Reimei!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
041	...
042	I knew I should have dealt with you sooner.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0019
043	Wh-whoa! Oh no!
044	What an aura...! Everybody, be careful!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
045	You have interfered with my plans for the last time! I'll wipe you all out!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
046	Wha—aaaaaahh!!!
047	H-huh...?
048	Kanon! Kudan!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
049	Impossible! Just the two of them stopped my attack?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
050	C-Captain Kudan?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
051	Don't linger on this. We will resume our own fight after we get rid of this fool.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
052	Tch! I take it you still haven't changed your ways.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
053	A temporary alliance? Starting to get desperate?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
054	Still, are the two of you really prepared to face me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
055	It's unbelievable how much strength he has left. I'll engage him directly. Cover me and don't run away, got it?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
056	As if! I'll be the one to take him out!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
057	Tch!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
058	A former captain of the Holy Guard and its current Lord Commander.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
059	I wouldn't say you two are weak, but I do find you wanting for a little...something more.
060	Watch out!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
061	Everybody, get down!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
062	You're too late. Plasma Burst!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
063	Huzzaaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
064	Huzzaaaaaaaahh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
065	Nngh! Gaah!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
066	Agh...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
067	Wh-whoa! What is going on?!
068	K-keep your head down!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
069	Tch! Its impact was reduced. It was wise of you to attack rather than dodge. This skill could have wiped out this entire country.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
070	Urgh! His...power... So overwhelming!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
071	So this is the power that transcends dimensions!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
072	Come on, I'm still holding back. Is this really all you've got? I was hoping you'd be able to entertain me a little more.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
073	What?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0025
074	One's true worth is measured at the twilight of their life. The next three minutes will reveal to me all that you have managed to gain in your lives.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
075	Three minutes?
076	I'm saying you'll all be dead in three minutes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
077	That is, if you even last that long.
078	Wha—?!
079	You...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
080	Feel free to attack me anytime. I will vanquish the symbol of this world's justice to usher in the new era!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
081	You have a lot of bark, but do you have the bite to back it up? I'll make you regret those words!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
082	Prepare yourself!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
083	Magic Spear Flash!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
084	That is a flashy move, indeed. I do commend your spirit, but...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
085	He's...gone?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
086	I've seen that move already. Can't you do anything else? You should fight more intelligently.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
087	Kudan! Behind you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
088	You're too slow. Even three minutes was impossible for you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
089	Spear Shockwave!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_1014
090	What the—?!
091	You lured me here on purpose?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
092	Due to your overwhelming strength, you have turned away from using tactics. You are the one who should remember how to fight intelligently.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
093	What?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
094	Trinity Slash!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
095	A trap?! Bang!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
096	Agh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
097	Kanon!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
098	Tch! I never expected coordinated attacks like this.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
099	I warned you to fight intelligently. I thought it was obvious which of us would play decoy.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
100	Wha—?!
101	You wanted to be entertained? Then so be it! Bloody Strike!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
102	Gah—aaaaaahhh!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
103	Whoa! They did it!
104	Captain Kudan!
105	Haa... Haa... You've made a lot of bold statements, but I am the one who will usher in a new era.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0018
106	Just kidding.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
107	...?!
108	Wh-what?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
109	You will usher in a new era? Don't make me laugh! You have less than a minute left to live.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
110	No... How?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
111	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0001
112	Agh!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
113	Urgh!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
114	Don't tell me you're finished already.	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
115	I have been incredibly merciful. Just consider all the time I've given you to repent. You're reducing all of my kindness to naught.
116	Urgh! Y-you...!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
117	He's too strong!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
118	Oh well, I already knew none of you would give me any sort of challenge. Maybe nobody in this world can.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
119	Or...perhaps Orion would be somewhat threatening if he gained the Alchemy Source.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
120	Then why are you wasting your time fighting us instead of Orion?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
121	He could be resurrecting Nimul as we speak!
122	That's exactly what I want him to do.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
123	What?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
124	Why would I want to stop him? It's a chance to see a legend with my own two eyes.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
125	It will be the most exciting thing I will ever witness!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
126	Exciting?!
127	Wouldn't you all like to see for yourselves a power that can wreak havoc upon this world?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
128	I would lose an opportunity to see what that power is capable of if I interrupt. Why would I ruin this for myself?
129	You...plan on fighting against the Alchemy Source?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
130	Fight against it? No. I intend to annihilate it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
131	Yes... Yes! The thought alone gives me chills! A chance to completely annihilate that fully resurrected legendary power!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0009
132	H-he's...
133	Crazy!
134	It's been three minutes. Pity, you lot really couldn't accomplish anything. What a waste of my time.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
135	What do you plan to do?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
136	Usher in a new era. What else?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
137	Right after I crush the justice of this world. Bear witness!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
138	He's coming!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
139	He's going to destroy this country along with us! Huzzaaaaaah!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0029
140	You're too slow. Omega Pulse!!!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
141	Aghh...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0019
142	Gaaaaah!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
