001	I see. So when the bucket was raised from that well...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
002	I'm afraid so.
003	How fare the citizens?
004	They remain troubled.
005	It's no wonder. Confirming the relationship I had with those two came as quite a shock to many. Time cannot erode such disillusionment so quickly.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
006	But I must go on. Whatever shame I must bear, whatever struggles I must endure...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0029
007	Until I've avenged my dear children, I will not go gentle into that good night. I promise you that much.
008	And the stone and blade you brought me were found in their hands, you say?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
009	Did Kaede's horn fulfill its purpose as an eye and turn to stone, perhaps? Or could it be it was somehow forced to take on such a form?
010	In any event, that it changed forms at all is a clear sign of Mikaboshi's resolve. She's ensured that it will never stop beholding. I just wish she didn't have to go that far...
011	The same is true of Sumeragi. I know...just how much of themselves they've disseminated into these artifacts.
012	At the very least, I can temper both the eye and the blade with my Kagutsuchi, to unite my resolve with theirs.
013	But...is that all I can do? Isn't there anything more?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0027
014	...
015	Could I not also be of service?
016	Hmm?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
017	Particularly once they've been imbued with your Kagutsuchi, I think it would be fair to call the stone and the blade what they are: Sacred Treasures.
018	But merely calling them that is not enough. We will need individuals who are capable of maintaining and correctly utilizing them—particularly the blade.
019	Without someone to wield it, it's little more than a decoration. And I think you'll agree, such a status would clearly go against Master Sumeragi's wishes.
020	What do you propose, then?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0005
021	I know of a person entrusted with the teaching of martial disciplines. In their hands, proper techniques for the handling of this blade could be devised.
022	It would become a potent assassin's blade, capable of vanquishing any foe, no matter the odds—a most appropriate use for it, I believe.
023	And with each kill, it would slake its thirst, bit by bit, on demon blood.
024	Pardon?	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0025
025	As I myself have the blood of demons running through my veins, I can instantly tell. The more demonic blood this blade drinks, the stronger it will become.
026	My family line is tainted by it. The sealing of the Demon Paragon spread the curse to us, yet also allows us to imbibe demon blood as emergency sustenance. We are well-suited to handle the blade.
027	I see. So in a sense, it resonates with you. Very well, then. Please proceed at your discretion.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0006
028	...
029	Lady Mitsuha, you may have lost the people's faith, but I do not believe your actions were misguided.
030	Please know there are many others here as well who share that sentiment.
031	We have affirmed our commitment to you. You are not alone in your struggles. I hope you will never forget that.
032	We share your will and your desire for the future, and hope that together, we can see through the present turmoil to a better tomorrow.
033	...
034	A better tomorrow, huh? The future that Koga envisioned, and Kaede's resolve to support it... Those are the ideals I've been charged with.
035	I tried so hard, yet in the end, I could do nothing but sit by as you were slain...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0019
036	How could you two die before your mother?! Have some respect for your family...stupid jerks...
037	I'm the stupidest jerk of them all, though. That should've been my body down that well.	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0018
038	But I can't just give up the ghost so easily!
039	Wait for me, you two. I'll join you sooner or later.
086	And when I do, you can harangue me all you want. Just... Just please... I know it won't be easy, but I hope in my heart of hearts...
040	...that you can at least rest in peace for a time.
041	Ohh... Mikaboshi... Sumeragi...	VO_mitsuha.mitsuha_sys_0019
042	From that day onward, Queen Mitsuha set the flames of her Phoenix upon the stone and blade alike, time and again, intermixing her own will and determination with that of her children.
043	And in doing so, the Sacred Three of Wadatsumi were at last complete.
044	As the march of time wore on, I continued to watch the history of this land unfold before me, incorporeal eyes unclouded.
045	Once, I dwelled within the body of a mother. Another time, I was nearly destroyed by the Holy Guard.
046	Still another time, I observed in sadness as the land was laid to waste by the Lion Monarch's Charge.
047	I can recall nearly being misused at the hands of Wadatsumi's Shiba Senko clan.
048	There was also a period when I wondered if perhaps someone tainted with malice was heightening the emotions of those who bore the stone, since that seemed to keep happening.
049	For a while, these extreme emotional effects kept getting blamed on the stone-bearer's poor diet, if you can believe it!
050	I beheld every twist and turn of history. I sought out those who could stand against Malice, so that my resolve might resonate with them.
051	And then, finally, after touching so many lives and observing so much...I met you.
052	So you truly are...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0026
053	While beholding the world as a stone, fate would have it that I'd end up in that well time and again. This last time, part of my consciousness split off from me and was beginning to dissolve.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
054	My resolution to see the future my parents dreamed of come to pass was separated from the "me" inside the stone, and I just sat at the bottom of that well, waiting...for so, so long...
055	I was hoping someone would come along who could bind my resolve back into me and make me whole again. And like a miracle, here you are!
056	Mikaboshi!
057	This is...our story.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
058	Why would you place your trust in me, though?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
059	Our souls called out to each other. You and I share the selfsame resolve.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0005
060	My name is Amane! I vow to exterminate the demons and protect the people's everyday life!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
061	I will bring peace to Wadatsumi!
062	Oh. But, I was so young and naive back then...
063	With your strong determination, a foundation had already been set.
064	Which is why I entrust this resolve of mine, woven throughout time immemorial, to you.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
065	...
066	Amane?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0006
067	It's a heavy burden to bear. But having heard your story, I couldn't in all good conscience say no.
068	I'm not sure how well I can manage to live up to your expectations, but I will gladly accept your will and bind it to my own.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
069	Then I am in your debt, Lady Amane. May we henceforth serve together as one.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0034
070	Heehee!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0024
071	Did...I say something funny?
072	No, no. You just needn't use such formal language with me. Please, I...entreat you to speak with me as you would a close friend.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
073	Hahaha! Look who's talking. I think we both need to lighten up a little!	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0007
074	Huh?! This is how I've always spoken, so there's not much to be done about that!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
075	Though, I...suppose with all the expectations we have of each other, it might be best to make an effort to...lighten up a little, as you say. So each may better understand the other.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
076	For what will hopefully be Wadatsumi's great purge.
077	Purge?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0031
078	That's right! We're not just fighting demons higgledy-piggledy, after all. We need to seek out those born of malice, and completely obliterate them.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0005
079	That's what partnering with a Third Squad member of a demon slayer corps will get you. By my hand, I swear Wadatsumi will be restored back to the way it once was!
080	Hahahahahaha! Oh, I am so happy to have met you.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0008
081	But the question is, what do we do first?
082	We should seek out my true self. Only then will the full scope of my observations over the vast, turbulent history of Wadatsumi be laid bare.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0005
083	Within that true self, we'll find a light that we can shine upon our foes; the greatest asset there is in combating demons—	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
084	A means to acquire the secret art of Kagutsuchi.
085	...!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
