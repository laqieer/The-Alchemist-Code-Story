001	Pardon me, is this the orphanage?
002	Welcome miss. Are you looking to adopt kids?
003	Um, no... I'm here to investigate the rumors of some kids wreaking havoc?
004	Goodness, those rumors are simply untrue! Come in come in, and take a look for yourself!
005	Ah, there's really no need to-
006	Hi Miss!
007	Hello there.
008	Miss! Would you like to hear the story about my buddy Ellie?
009	The child holds up a toy elephant.
010	That's very sweet, bu-
011	His story starts in the orphanage air ducts, Ellie was stuck for decades!
012	Some time later...
013	And Ellie learned that sometimes, all you need is a family you can depend on.
014	Fantastic! You did it again!
015	What a great story!
016	I really must be going now.
017	*psst! She's leaving! We need to continue distracting her!*
018	*I'm on it!*
019	Wait Miss! We have to show you around!
020	Before Blair could respond, she is immediately led around the orphanage.
021	(I didn't expect this to drag on for so long...)
022	(But it's strange that Roxanne received some wrong information.)
023	(Come to think of it, is this even part of a State Artificer's duties?)
024	(I became too excited back at the mansion... I'll head back to ask her about this.)
025	Psst!
026	Who's there?
027	Over here!
028	Everyone, we're saved!
029	These Droids will go down like flies!
030	What is going on?
031	You see, the caretaker let us out to play...
032	... but all of a sudden these creepy Droids started to show up and chase us.
033	Miss, you have to save the others!
034	Stay here where its safe you two! I'm going to rescue your friends!
035	Ok, she's gone.
036	Good, let's go tell Miss Roxanne the plan is a success!
