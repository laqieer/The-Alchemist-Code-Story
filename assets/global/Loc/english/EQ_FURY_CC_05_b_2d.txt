001	Unforgivable savagery!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0040
002	You all know that Wadatsumi has restricted contact with other nations and cut itself from the rest of society for years!
003	And this is despite the fact that powerful nations, including our own, have pleaded with them time and time again to open their borders, so that we might establish friendly relations!
004	What have they been doing behind those closed walls?! We only wish to examine their actions in the light of day!
005	She was trying to call a disaster down upon us from the top of that mountain!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
006	No! That's not true at all! P-please, listen to me!
007	Then why'd you climb up that mountain?! I knew there was something funny going on!
008	C'mon, Button. Let's go.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
009	B-but I...!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
010	Sh-she put a spell on me!
011	Me, too!
012	Y-you're...!
013	She made me feel all icky!
014	Yeah! It was gross!
015	Why?
016	Everything's changed now.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0019
017	Wadatsumi has continuously used Alchemy within its borders!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0005
018	Need I remind you that those powers are forbidden? Just think of it! An entire country full of individuals possessing immense destructive power!
019	They have blatantly defied the Magna Code! We must not let them spread the taboo art of Alchemy any further!
020	Down with Wadatsumi, the filthy traitors!
021	P-please, listen to me for a moment! Let's hold hands, and...and...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
022	And shake hands! We did it once before, we can do it again!
023	Hmph.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
024	Button, no!
025	I-Ikasa! What—
026	Don't touch me! What're you plannin'?! How many people have you killed with your Alchemy?! Think you're goin' to slaughter us, too, huh?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_battle_0019
027	K-kill her! Kill her before she kills us! Kill the traitorous heretic!
028	Kill her! Slit her throat!
029	N-no!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0027
030	Not gonna happen.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0025
031	H-huh?!
032	What the hell?! You should be dead!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
033	I-Ikasa...?
034	I'm fine. Don't worry about—	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
035	She came back...from the dead!
036	This must be that shrine maiden's magic! Wadatsumi's foul sorcery!
037	Button, you don't have to worry about a thing.
038	B-but...
039	Just cover your ears. Don't listen.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0022
040	If we could just talk, I'm sure we could understand one another!
041	Kill her! Kill her!
042	Move out of the way, now.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0010
043	Kill her! Get her! Slit her throat!
044	N-no, Ikasa!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
045	I won't let you kill her.
046	If she goes free, we will once again see an age of war, like that which once reduced the entire ancient civilization of Babel to ashes!
047	Our thorough investigation has uncovered that, no longer content with having Alchemy run wild behind their own borders...	VO_orione.orione_sys_0030
048	Wadatsumi was attempting to expand the powers of Alchemy and set them upon the rest of the world!
049	Such outrageous folly!
050	Please, help me! Someone! Anyone! Please!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
051	Button, I'm fine! Look, you're the one who's injured!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0022
052	Please! Won't someone please help?! I just need medicine—a small amount will do! I can pay for it! I'll give you anything!
053	There they are! Over there!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
054	No!
055	The knight with her cannot be killed! The shrine maiden has enslaved a departed soul! It is blasphemy!
056	Get her! Hunt her down!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
057	Please stop! Put your swords away and we can talk about this!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
058	Button, you're bleeding. You've got to stop the blood, or—	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0003
059	Shrine maidens from Wadatsumi will fetch a high bounty in Greed Dike, dead or alive!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
060	No! Why? Why is this happening?! This is all wrong! There's been some mistake!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
061	For the peace of the continent!
062	Ngh... You've got to...run!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0042
063	Wadatsumi's shrine maidens are the root of all evil!
064	Not only do they desecrate the souls of the departed with Alchemy, but they doom our beloved Babel with their magic rites!
065	I-I did learn something...through this.
066	Yeah?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
067	Northern Pride, home of the Holy Guard, is on good terms with this nation—with Envylia.
068	You are a member of the Holy Guard, Ikasa! Surely they could shelter us, even temporarily?
069	I...
070	If they can at least do something for you, that's more than enough! I'll manage. I'll find a way.
071	Your mission is the absolute justice of the continent, is it not? Surely you can put a stop to this ridiculous invasion! You have that power!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
072	Everyone has it within themselves to forgive! I'm sure we can all make peace! You're good people! I believe in you! Nothing is beyond your understanding—not Wadatsumi, or magic!
073	And we... Wadatsumi truly didn't know that Alchemy was forbidden!
074	So you see? No one has done anything wrong!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
075	There will be no forgiveness!
076	We all know where justice truly lies!
077	Where is the justice in Wadatsumi?!
078	What is just about their shrine maidens, agents of treason who threaten world peace?!
079	Our journey's over, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0028
080	This doesn't make any sense. I didn't think the world would be so...so...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_battle_0019
081	Button...
082	This... This can't be right! Everyone seemed so kind!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0018
083	They were warm and friendly with us, even though we were strangers!
084	This isn't... This isn't the world I know!
085	You're right. This is all wrong. I'm sorry, Button.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
086	Ikasa...?
087	The Holy Guard won't do anything to stop it. Greed Dike's invasion has their tacit approval.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
088	I'm sorry.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0036
089	Why are you apologizing to me?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
090	I thought it might turn out like this.
091	This... What? But...how could that be? Surely there were other paths that could have been taken...
092	Still...
093	Ikasa... I think...it's time to forget.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
094	Huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
095	Our promise. It's...irrelevant now. Leave me. If you stay, you'll...
096	Why would I go anywhere? I'm having fun.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
097	You said you hate traveling.
098	Yeah, but it's not so bad when I'm with you.
099	You'll die!
100	I'm staying right here. I won't leave your side, even if it kills me.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
101	It's not like I can actually die, anyway.
102	Why... How did you become immortal?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
103	I don't remember.
104	Do not forget!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0013
105	When the people of Wadatsumi continued to ignore brotherly calls from the countries of the continent to build on their forbidden rites of ruin, was justice on their side?
106	No!	VO_orione.orione_sys_0040
107	Justice was—and remains—ours!
108	We will bring down the evil shrine maiden. For justice!
109	...
110	J-jus...tice?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0025
111	I will never, ever forget that day.
112	Nothing was as I remembered it.
113	When I arrived in Wadatsumi on the smuggling ship, I thought for a moment that we had docked on the wrong island.
114	The town had been reduced to ashes and scorched earth. The streets were littered with the corpses of people who had once smiled at me.
115	Burnt homes. Pillaged shopping districts. A devastated nation.
116	Piles of corpses. A sea of dried blood. The stench of death.
117	Ikasa... Where is our...peace?	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
118	Button...
119	There was justice...wasn't there? Justice...and peace?
120	Yet all that's here now...all I can see...
121	My family's rotting corpses.
122	They had been strung up cruelly, left to die horrible, painful deaths. All in the name of retribution for their use of forbidden arts.
123	They were unrecognizable piles of skin and bone. Black birds circled overhead, eyeing their remains, while flies swarmed them, and maggots writhed on their rancid flesh.
124	Father! Mother! Granny!
125	I took them in my arms, and my ears were filled with a horrible wriggling and buzzing.
126	No... This can't... Aaaaahhh!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
127	It...hurts.
128	Everything...hurts. My head...my heart...
129	I-it... It doesn't...hurt.
130	It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It's okay. It's okay. It's...
131	Why? Why isn't it working? It still hurts. Everything still hurts. Why? Why? I've been saying the magic words! Why aren't they working?!
132	It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It's okay. It doesn't hurt.
133	It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It's okay. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't—
134	It's okay. I'm right here beside you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
135	Don't touch me!
136	Okay.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
137	Let me forget! Make me forget! I want to forget! All of it! Take it away!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0020
138	I know.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
139	Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0019
140	If I had known that this was going to happen, I never would have left. I never should have gone on that journey!
141	If I had known that this was going to happen, I never would have come back! I would have died! I should have died too!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0022
142	Everyone's gone and left me behind.
143	Even you.
144	Yeah.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
145	Why did I have to see this? Why did I have to exist?
146	All those smiling faces... All of those beautiful sights... All of those happy memories... What was the point?
147	What was the point of our journey? What was the point of going to the world's end?
148	No... That mountain wasn't the end of the world.
149	This is! This, right here!	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0018
150	This is the end of the world! Of my world! Of my parent's world! Of everything!
151	Yeah.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
152	Just end it.
153	Leave me.
154	I'm not going anywhere.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
155	Ngh...
156	You can hate me for it...
157	But just let me stay with you.
158	Let me be your umbrella.
159	The rain stopped hitting my back...
160	But I could still hear it pounding away.
