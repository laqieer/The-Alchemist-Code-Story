001	I see. I hadn't realized the demons' invasion has progressed quite so far.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0045
002	Humankind continues to endure. However, as of now, all we're able to do is protect the few villages that still remain.
003	We help the people take refuge and delay the inevitable as much as we can.
004	...
005	Thankfully, it seems the survivors haven't yet reached the point of desperation.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
006	They've been eating the provisions supplied by Greed Dike, as opposed to...well, one another, particularly should any of them get turned.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
007	But hope is in short supply. There seems to be little confidence that the tides can ever be turned back in their favor again.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0004
008	We must see to it that those tides are reversed. At all costs! Even if only to honor those who've fallen in Wadatsumi's name!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0014
009	Of course. And on that note, there is something I think you need to—
010	Ohh! Ohhhh! Ahhhh!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0019
011	By the heavens, man, I can't hear myself think over all that crying!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
012	I'm sorry! I can't help it!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
013	How can I not cry when I hear how you took over for Amane's sister and still continue to fight despite the loss of your arm?! It's so...noble!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
014	I, Edgar L. Leonhart, am moved by the strength of your character, and do hereby pledge to lend my aid to your cause in whatever capacity I'm able, Captain Ugachi!
015	I'm not your captain, so please don't call me that. But it is clear just how strong you are.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
016	So we'd be grateful to have your help.
017	Awesome! I won't let you down, Captain!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
018	You two have certainly warmed up to each other quickly.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
019	This is how men work! It doesn't matter how long you've known each other, as long as there's passion burning in your heart!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
020	Don't get the wrong idea. I'll cut you loose as soon as you stop being useful.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0039
021	Heeey!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0021
022	At any rate, let's hear that report, Amane. For our counteroffensive to succeed...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
023	The information you've brought will prove absolutely essential.
024	Right!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
