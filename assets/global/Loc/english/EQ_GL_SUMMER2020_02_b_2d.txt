001	Say goodnight!
002	Argh!
003	Ahhhh! My stall!
004	Damn it, we won't forget this!
005	Look at this mess! How am I supposed to run my stall when all my ingredients are smashed!
006	Oh no... please let me pay you back for the damage?
007	... sorry...
008	How will the beachgoers get any food and cold treats around here now?
009	A day's earnings won't bleed me dry, but there are people round here looking to crack open a cold one and enjoy fresh seafood!
010	Ugh, he's got a point... and we did start the fight after all.
011	(What am I going to do? This isn't something money alone can solve...)
012	It would seem our encounters are never fated to be without some excitement, unfortunately it's never of the pleasant sort.
013	Could you not have chosen a more elegant approach to handle those ruffians?
014	What? Who's there?
015	Shion!?
016	What are you doing here?
017	It is good to see you again as well Miss Roxanne.
018	I wish I could say the same... out on another one of your so-called "business trips" I see?
019	Although my work never truly ceases, I am allowed a brief respite from time to time. Today I'm just here for a little... sightseeing.
020	Right... just like when we met you back in Lustburg?
021	Despite what you may think of my family and me, I still am genuinely grateful for your actions that saved the lives of my sister and her betrothed.
022	Lord Zheng Yi has been deep in reflection since then, and we have all been making utmost efforts to correct our past ..."indiscretions".
023	As for my presence... I've heard that the beaches are wonderful this time of the year, and so I came to see if it would make a suitable vacation spot.
024	Shion glances at the ruined stall with a regretful smile
025	although it would seem that I will have to enjoy them without any hope of refreshment.
026	Thanks for rubbing it in...
027	(Yet another human to contend with, coming out here really wasn't wise after all)
028	And who might your two new companions be?
029	Eira!
030	You may call me Morrigan.
031	It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
032	And you came alone? What about Asuka?
033	My beloved sister practically forced me away from my duties. She chose to remain in our household to deal with other matters.
034	I would very much have preferred to stay with her, but she insisted that I took some time away from it all. And so here I am.
035	What's this, the ever-collected Shion is troubled by the absence of the precious little sister?
036	I didn't think it was possible for you to even feel lonely.
037	Hmph, says the Lady who still has yet to win over her childhood sweetheart?
038	Perhaps you would prefer I redirect my attention to him once again?
039	Don't you dare! He's not so blind that he'd fall for a trap like you anyways!
040	Oh, so you are more perceptive than you initially seem.
041	But, I am very confident of my charm. Believe me, I can be very persuasive... to anyone.
042	I would never lose to a flatchest like you!
043	... flat... chest?
044	You shouldn't concern yourself with this Eira. Humans have... quite the derogatory terms.
045	Eira... don't understand...
046	A woman's figure isn't everything you know, if not you would have captured your beloved's heart long ago.
047	Grrrr... even though we're no longer enemies, I really feel like beating the crap out of you right now!
048	It would be wise not to begin another pointless conflict. We still have yet to address the shopkeeper's demands.
049	Yeah! All your bickering isn't doing anything to solve the problem here!
050	If I may, perhaps we could settle both our disagreements as well as the issue of food together in a more... entertaining manner?
051	Interesting, what are you proposing?
052	How about a food challenge? We each produce a dish to sate the beachgoers, and see which of us can garner the most sales.
053	That's... actually not a bad idea. But what's in it for you?
054	Well, I am quite alone and rather bored, and I would very much like to put our vastly different charms to the test.
055	You really think you can beat me huh, you're on!
056	Well then, I will be taking this one as my partner.
057	Eira... partner?
058	Of course! Together, we're going to show Miss Roxanne that a woman's appeal doesn't rely solely on her "Assets". Come along!
059	Ah...
060	(No malice... it seems he speaks truthfully)
061	(Although I'm slightly concerned, this situation is much too amusing to pass up)
062	Go along with him Eira, it won't be fair if all three of us were on the same side.
063	... ok...
064	(This is a good chance for Eira to enjoy some new experiences as well)
065	Are you sure she'll be okay? She doesn't seem very comfortable with new people.
066	Eira will be alright. As reserved as she is, her heart is always in the right place, and others will always appreciate her for it.
067	Besides, I believe right now we have a more immediate challenge to focus on.
068	Right! There's no way we're losing to that washboard, let's get going too!
