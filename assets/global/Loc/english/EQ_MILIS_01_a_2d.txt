001	Ugh. I'm so hungry.
002	I never imagined that the city would be so large! Plus, it's all brick and cobblestone. I don't see a single animal.	VO_milis.milis_battle_0028
003	I'm sorry, Grandma. I might not be able to keep my promise.
004	Ohh...it's snowing.	VO_milis.milis__sys_0018
005	... ...
006	Huh?
007	Oh, you moved.
008	Um?
009	Hey, what are doing there? Is this a new game? I'm pretty sure you'll freeze to death.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
010	Oh, um, no. I'm, well...
011	Heheh. I-I guess you can say I sort of collapsed here.
012	Collapsere? Is that some kind of new art? Are you a street performer?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
013	Umm...
014	This child doesn't seem to understand the meaning of collapse! Is she some kind of rich girl?
015	I don't know how else to explain it. I'm so hungry, my mind is starting to...
016	Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0011
017	Are you talking about this?
018	What's that?
019	It's a chiffon cake from the sweets shop across the street.
020	Cake? Is that food?
021	Don't you know what cake is?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
022	Huh? No...
023	That's no good. You're missing out on life. Try eating some.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0015
024	Are you giving it to me?
025	Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives.
026	Th-thank you? Wow. It's so fluffy!
027	... ...
028	This is so delicious! I've never eaten anything like it before!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0026
029	The shop is right there. If you like it you could go buy some.
030	Yea...yeah!
031	Would you like to try this as well?
032	Yes, I would! Thanks!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0009
033	Wow...
034	This is also super sweet! What is this black food?! It tastes so good!
035	She doesn't know about chocolate. She ate it without knowing what it was.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
036	A rare breed...
037	Huh? Did you say something?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0047
038	Nothing.
039	This tastes as delicious as water lizards!
040	Hm? What did you just say?
041	Oh. Don't you know what water lizards are? Maybe you don't have them around here.
042	Of course, I do. It's a creature with four legs who lives in places with high humidity. What about water lizards?
043	I love the taste of water lizard! This is about as good as that—
044	About as good as water lizard...?
045	The cake that you're eating right now is my favorite. I lined up for an hour to buy it.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
046	And you think it tastes about as good as water lizard?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0021
047	What's the matter?
048	Fine. Come with me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0032
049	I'm going to teach you about the refined tastes of a lady!
050	Huh?!
051	Wow! It's beautiful! Is all of this food?!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0023
052	Do you see anything you haven't eaten before?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
053	Huh? I've seen none of these before.
054	None...
055	What about this tart? And palmier? What about pudding? Wait, are you telling me you don't know what Sacher torte is?
056	Um. The sweet things I've really eaten are sugar pickled fruits.
057	I can't believe it! Then there's no point in living!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
058	Is it that bad?!
059	Here's a cream puff, ganache Sacher torte, and some Bavarian cream. I still have more.
060	Are these all sweet? Can I eat them?!
061	Of course. Sweets are the coloring that decorates life. At least that's the case for me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0037
062	Wow. This is incredible! They're all sweet, but each one tastes different. Some are soft, and some are chewy!
063	You should give you impressions one at a time. Also, you don't have to eat in such a hurry. The sweets aren't going anywhere.
064	It's just so delicious. Hey, what're you drinking?
065	Would you like to drink it as well?
066	Yes, please! Why is it so bitter?!
067	It's supposed to be. When you drink this, it brings out the sweetness of the sweets.
068	In other words, it's a sophisticated flavor. You have to be mature enough to understand it.
069	That's what my grandma used to say. It tastes like medicine, so I don't like it.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0031
070	Oh! Maybe this girl is that type my grandma used to tell me about.
071	A modern, feminine, and urban gentlewoman! I mean, she was kind enough to feed a complete stranger. I'm sure of it!
072	U-um! I'm Milis from the plains of Saga!
073	What's the matter? You've gone all formal on me.
074	Please make me your protege!
075	... ...
076	I-is that a no?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0041
077	Do you know who I am? I'm sorry, but—
078	I want to be a dignified gentlewoman!
079	... ...
080	What did you just say?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
081	My grandma used to tell me that, since I was born as a girl, I should aim to become a lovely gentlewoman!
082	I didn't know what that meant until now, but...
083	I'm sure she meant someone like you! That's why I want to become your protege and learn as much as I can!
084	Hey, Milis...are you always like this?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
085	Well, I'm always me. The lady living next door used to compliment me for always being energetic!
086	Yes, you are energetic. And strange.
087	Oh, that's right! I need to repay you!
088	Repay me?
089	You gave me all this food. Of course, I should repay you!
090	It was my choice to give it to you. Don't worry about it.
091	By the way, what's your name?	VO_milis.milis_sys_0002
092	She's not even listening.
093	It's Lofia.
094	All right, Lofy! Let's go! We need to find a shop that offers my favorite food!
095	Oh, wait a moment—
096	I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you eat some delicious water lizard cuisine!
097	You're so...forceful.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0016
098	Waaaaah!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0019
099	I-I can't believe there isn't a single shop that has water lizard!
100	You'll be hard-pressed to find a shop that serves such bizarre food.
101	It looks like I'll have to catch one myself! Just you watch!
102	Look. I don't need any repayment.
103	Hold on, Lofy!
104	Sigh. You're hopeless.
105	Hey, I found one!
106	It doesn't seem to have noticed us yet. Should we use magic to take it down from here?
107	Ahaha. Then we won't be able to eat it!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
108	Let's go around a little more. I probably won't notice us approaching from the shadow of that rock.
109	How do you know that?
110	I find the best place to hunt by listening to the breathing of the trees in the forest. That's my way of hunting!
111	Hold on. Are you able to read the flow of Alchemy in this forest?
112	Now!	VO_milis.milis_battle_0006
