001	(Ngh... She's fast!)	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
002	Hyah!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0001
003	(Now... There!)	VO_zain.zain_battle_0001
004	You win. Thank you.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
005	I can see why surpassing the Lord Commander will be worthwhile.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0010
006	I wasn't holding back. You've gotten stronger, Yauras.	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
007	I've still got a long way to go. I'm definitely nowhere near surpassing the Cadanova I fought that day...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
008	But I swear that I will surpass him...and you, Zain.
009	Yauras... You need to use different styles. There is no absolute when it comes to magnificence... Just like how magnificence never manifests in the unrefined.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
010	You understand that now, don't you?
011	I...! Thank you. I swear that I will become stronger, no matter what.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0018
012	Heheh. I feel like I'm finally free of doubt. Thank you, Lord Zain.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0010
013	(She's close to surpassing Cadanova. Yauras really has gotten stronger.)
014	I can't afford to be idle, either.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
015	Well, that was quite the show. It's nice to watch people grow. A rhyme? How strange of me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
016	Let's go, Kaya. Let's complete our task in Lustburg.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
017	When we return to Northern Pride, I will consider my responsibility complete.
018	So...you've finally decided?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
019	Yes. I cannot be idle while those under my command are moving forward.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
020	(I will spread justice throughout the continent alongside them. That will be my parting gift to Cadanova, and to Kaya!)
021	Thank you, Kaya. It is because of you that I was able to see the path I needed to take.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0033
022	Our paths may be different, but I will strive to give you no cause for worry as I set out on mine.
023	Good.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
024	Then let us continue on our journey of discovery. What were the Cursed Beasts? For what purpose was the Holy Guard created?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
025	Finding these answers and exposing the truth is something that I must do as Lord Commander. I truly mean these words.
026	However, this will be the last time that you and I walk the same path!
