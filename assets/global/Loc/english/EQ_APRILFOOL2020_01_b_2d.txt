001	You saved me! Thank you so much! Y'know, you really do look familiar...
002	It's said that those who summon a girl at the foot of the legendary tower can find eternal happiness.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
003	Huh?
004	You were standing right next to said legendary tower when I first saw you. Though it would seem that was not your reason for being there.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
005	Oh! Uh... no. I've never heard that before. I'm not even sure how I ended up outside the Venus School of Magic, to be honest.
006	Excuse me? There's no such school in this area.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
007	Huh? But that's gotta be the Venus School of Magic! If this is TAC, then—!
008	Well, at least you got that part correct.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
009	What d'you mean?
010	TAC. As in, TAC Academy. It's the name of my school.
011	TAC Academy?!
012	I see... Nations warring for possession of sacred stones, people summoning soldiers from beyond the grave through the use of alchemic powers...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
013	It's an interesting setting for a story, I'll give it that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
014	Right?! I really love this one character, Kaya, the Crimson Dragon—it's super weird how much you look like her, actually...
015	Oh, really? My name is Kaya, in fact. What a funny coincidence.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
016	No way! You look the same, you've got the same name—this goes way beyond coincidence!
017	What can I say? This is the first I've heard of such a character.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
018	As for me, I'm the president of the archaeology club here at TAC Academy.
019	TAC Academy... There's something fishy about this place.
020	You think so? I'm not sure I fully understand, but if you believe there might be clues inside the academy... this could prove rather interesting.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
021	Well, I don't even know if I can get back to my world... but I guess doing a little investigation would be the first step to finding out.
022	Your... world?	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_1018
023	Yup. I mean, I'm not sure if I actually want to go back yet or not, but I've at least got to find out if it's possible. I'm gonna head up to the school—thanks again for helping me!
024	Hold on. You're not planning to leave without even telling me your name, are you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
025	Oh! My bad. You can call me <p_name>.
026	<p_name>? Hm...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
027	Well, see you around!
028	Don't be foolish. What are you going to do if you get attacked again?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
029	Uhh... Y'know, I hadn't really thought about that.
030	I suspected as much. It's all right—I shall accompany you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0037
031	Let's unravel the mysteries of this world together!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
