001	Grrrooooooggghhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0001
002	This area is...a shrine?! Could it be Mammon's?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
003	.........
004	I see. Luke... You took on all of Benika's corruption.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0022
005	At this rate, this region will be swallowed up by corruption, just as with Guardian Dragon Nidhogg!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
006	No... Luke...	VO_benika.benika_battle_0016
007	Scraaarghhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0002
008	Fall back, Roh Ku.
009	Grrooooooooo!	VO_kubera.kubera_battle_0022
010	Troops, ready your swords! The enemy is a dragon Fallen!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0001
011	A worthy adversary for us to face!
012	Kubera!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
013	We will draw its attention.	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0010
014	Huh?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
015	You said you did not want it killed. If that determination is unchanged, reveal it to me once more!	VO_kubera.kubera_sys_0002
016	Right.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
017	Grrrraaaarrrrgggghhhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0021
018	What should we do now, Nimul?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
019	That dragon hasn't succumbed fully yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
020	If we can drive the purification Alchemy into its head...
021	That large Cursed Beast?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0006
022	Yes. If only we had the airship with us now...
023	We finally caught up to you, my foolish apprentices!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0010
024	That voice...
025	Could it be Ambrosia?!
026	What?! This is...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
027	Heh, looks like we made it in the nick of time.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0007
028	Are Mira and Nyx not here?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0031
029	Abstinent Witch Ambrosia! And...
030	Hey there, friends. Looks like you're in a bind. I'll give you a hand.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
031	I'm so glad you're safe, Nimul!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0007
032	Minario! And Waginau! How did you all get here?
033	This guy let us know that you were in trouble. And there was no way we were not going to come and help you.	VO_minario.minario_sys_0005
034	Honestly... Now is not the time for bantering.	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0030
035	So you would like to do something about the dragonkin before us?	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
036	Exactly! Minario, can you fly us over there?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
037	'Course!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0038
092	We fixed up the airship you left in the Invidia Belt perfectly.
038	With this level of quality, it'll only take one jump to get there!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0008
039	Please!
040	Are you ready, Yna?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
041	Oh, yes... But what do you intend to do?
042	There are no Gears of Judgement nor is there anyone who could wield it. So what are we going to do?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
043	There is still an area we haven't tried yet.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
044	Let's go, Minario!
045	Aye, aye!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0004
046	Nnngg... Haaah...
047	There's not enough time to apply the brakes! We'll cross for a split second! Jump on at the right moment!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0001
048	Let's go, Yna!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
049	Right!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
050	Three, two, one...now!
051	Yes, we made it on!
052	Sorry, but this is as far as it goes! From here on out, you'll have to run up the back of that huge snake!	VO_minario.minario_sys_0035
053	I don't know why but there's no Libra on this ship!
054	It's impossible to provide adequate backup without Libra at this distance! But we'll have to do what we can!	VO_ambrosia.ambrosia_sys_0001
055	You've done enough! Let's go, Yna!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
056	I know!
057	What?! The dragon is moving?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
058	This is the dragon technique I wield! I will become a blade to cut through corruption!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0032
059	Isn't that Zafeiris's technique?
060	I will explain later! Focus on the problem before us!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
061	R-right!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
062	Grrrraaaaahhhhhh!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0019
063	Here it comes, Nimul! With that much mass, a direct hit from it would be...!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0022
064	Urk...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0025
065	Nimul?!
066	I'm...all right!
067	I see your anger.
068	(That voice from before... Add that to what Bianca said, and...!)	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
069	But if you defeat them, obtain them, and follow them...	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
070	Your wish is sure to come true.
071	If those words were true...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
072	"I will transcend envy and become wrath!"
073	"My faith will be guided by two stones."	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
074	I am still a far cry from the Truth. There are things I cannot save and even if I stretch out my hand, I don't know what I will gain.
075	But even so!
076	I hereby swear it again!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
077	I need it! I need greater power! I will break this spiral of sorrow! I must have it to lead all of humankind to a golden era!
078	I must open the door to the beyond and reveal it here and now!
079	This is my ideal future!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
080	Access to the Invidia Belt confirmed.
081	Access to the Ire Belt confirmed.
082	We will become stones and submit to your will.
083	What is this light?	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
084	I have never seen anything like this in my life.
085	Oh, the light of my princess! The light of all things, illuminating the world of creation!
086	Silence! Cease attempting to come to the forefront! You're disrupting my control!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_battle_0019
087	"The Power of Alchemy is not solely for creating wealth!"
088	"In other words, my soul will become a new, refined extreme!"
089	The Cursed Beast's core is now under control. With this much magil, we can dispel the dragon's body again!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
090	Ssscccaaaaarrrrgghhh!!!	VO_desutoruku.desutoruku_battle_0028_c
091	Dragon child swallowed by corruption, I will now break this spell!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_1030
