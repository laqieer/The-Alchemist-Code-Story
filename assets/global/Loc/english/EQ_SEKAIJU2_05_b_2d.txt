001	He...lp...adve...tur...rs! Nrrk...blss...glrp...
002	It is done!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0009
003	Haaa... Well, taking down one or two Alraunes is a cinch for someone like me!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0022
004	And I'm the callous one?	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0010
005	Heh! We won because we all worked together!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
006	Ah... I guess...this is goodbye.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0020
007	Sh-Shenmei! I...I see. The transmutation was an irregularity. Like Chloe, Shenmei will...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_1028
008	Wh-what are you talking about?!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0012
009	I think that the link between our worlds was fixed when we defeated Alraune.
010	That link was what triggered my summons and gave me these weird clothes. It was probably the only thing keeping me here.
011	N-no! We haven't even gotten to hear a single tale of your adventures!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0021
012	Oh, yeah... I never finished telling that one, did I? At least you'll all be able to go home now.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0020
013	This doesn't mean that we will never meet again, does it? We will be able to see each other again...won't we?	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0020
014	I don't know. Even if we do see each other again, I might not remember any of you.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0036
015	But if we do meet again, let's go on another adventure together, all right?!
016	Naturally!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0005
017	Next time, you simply must regale us with a story of your adventures!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0002
018	We won't forget you, Shenmei.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0001
019	Thanks! I'm really glad I met all of you! Good luck, adventurers!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
020	Where are we?	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0025
021	What's going on?	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0016
022	Hmph, how rude! We were not given even a moment to indulge in our sentiment.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0030
023	The Door of Truth...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_1028
024	You have done well, otherworldly adventurers.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0033
025	Wh-who is this?!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0025
026	This is that girl I mentioned earlier, remember? Ouroboros.	VO_fencer.fencer_chara_1001
027	Hey, Ouroboros! Why didn't you show yourself to these three?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
028	Hmm. It all began when this world became linked with Arcania.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
029	When that occurred, some Alchemia Particles slipped through a chink in the fabric of our world and into yours.
030	Alraune allowed herself to be swept into that current, and that is how she came to be in Babel.
031	There lay a Philosopher's Stone, waiting to be found, and who should obtain it but Alraune? She used its immense power to form a point of connection between our worlds.
032	Hence why you three were brought here without passing through the Door of Truth.
033	Why would Alraune bring us here?	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0031
034	I expect it was because of the brilliance of your souls.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0004
035	Alraune coveted that sweet, glitter glow, as well as the strength that lies behind it.
036	If you had been unable to subdue Alraune, her power would have increased, until Green Death ran rampant across the continent.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0030
037	It would likely have meant the end of Babel.
038	I...didn't realize it was so vital.	VO_paladin.paladin_chara_1002
039	Indeed! We are truly the saviors of this day!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0044
040	I suppose some things are worthy of a little pride.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0007
041	It is thanks to your efforts that Babel was saved. Allow me to express my sincere gratitude.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0034
042	Hey, Ouroboros! Do you know what happened to those soldiers in the forest?!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_1028
043	Do not worry. They have left the forest now, safe and sound. Alraune lies defeated, and the monsters of the forest have become placid once more.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0037
044	Phew! That's good to hear.
045	Now then. I am not sure that this even needs to be said...however, the door that would take you back to your world lies here, and it is open to you.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
046	You may go home. On the other hand...
047	Ah, yes, the other hand.	VO_princess.princess_sys_0031
048	Well, I'm going back to Babel. I need to find my friends—and there's someone I still need to see!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0031
049	It would not do to forget about your companions! Very well, then! I shall accompany you!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0044
050	We have not reported back to the village about the completion of the quest, after all! Moreover, we are yet to have had any real adventure!
051	I agree with the last part. I, too, choose to remain in Babel.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0005
052	Can we really call our quest complete, though? We didn't end up collecting the medicinal herbs we were charged with finding.	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0002
053	I don't think that matters. We eradicated the source of the infection. That's what counts.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0031
054	I will stay here, too, of course. I might be able to meet Shenmei again.	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0007
055	I take it that you are all decided?	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
056	That we are!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0037
057	Let's go!	VO_paladin.paladin_sys_0032
058	Our adventure isn't over yet!	VO_gunner.gunner_sys_0005
059	Ouroboros, we will all be going back to Babel!	VO_princess.princess_sys_0002
060	Very well, adventurers. Know this: I will be watching over you until the very end!	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0045
061	Once, in a small village on the continent of Babel, a terrible illness began to spread among the people.
062	However, it is said that the illness was cured as swiftly as it had appeared.
063	The villagers, while thrilled to be free of the sickness, wondered at its sudden disappearance.
064	There were few who knew of the role played by the otherworldly adventurers, and so this incident became a mystery for the ages.
