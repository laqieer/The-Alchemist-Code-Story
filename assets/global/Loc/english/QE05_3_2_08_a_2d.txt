001	Gyarr!
002	That should do it!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
003	The monsters are running away. We did it!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0009
004	Not bad, visitors.
005	Who's there?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
006	Lower your bow, Tina. He is not our enemy.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
007	It's been a while, Protector.
008	It has. I'm sorry for leaving you in charge of this place alone.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
009	I am lost to this world anyway.
010	There's no need for you to feel responsible.
011	Kamui, who is he?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
012	He is the one tasked with watching over Sephiron.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	Alone?
014	...
015	Y-you are...
016	Um... Yes?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
017	Ah, never mind. I was just remembering an old friend.
018	I would like to perform a star reading. May we use the arboreal altar?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
019	Of course, my friend.
020	Logi, this way.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
021	Right!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
022	We will now trace the bond between the Sacred Stones to find the star hidden in shadows.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
023	Concentrate, and conjure in your mind the one you seek.
024	...
025	I beseech the supreme...
026	All is born under the crown. Wisdom and understanding form beauty on the soil.
027	Those hidden and in hiding, the knowledge in the depths of insight...
028	Show me the guidance of the stars!
029	What the—?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
030	What's wrong? Did you find Agatha?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
031	I see. So this is all your doing!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
032	Kamui?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
033	Ah, sorry. It's nothing. I did find out where Agatha is.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
034	Where? Where is she?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
035	The Door of Truth.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
036	An inaccessible territory to the ordinary. She is trapped within the shadow cast by the eternal light of wisdom.
037	I'm sorry. I... I don't understand.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
038	You mean she's beyond the door where we made our contracts? Is that where she is?
039	Not beyond the door itself. Somehow, through the power of Alchemy, she is caught in a chasm there.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
040	If that's true, can we even save her?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
041	I haven't seen that door since I made the deal.
042	Me neither.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
043	Just as I thought.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
044	What do you mean?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
045	We haven't much time. There are certain people who we cannot let know that we've found her.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0039
046	To free her, we will be needing your strength, Logi.
047	Wait, can you at least explain—	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
048	I wander the path of wisdom. Though the path may be lost, I still hold the stairway within me.
049	I am the one who breaks the lock!
