001	There's only Guard Droids here as well, aye! No, Ethan!
002	That leaves only three compartments. Are they keeping Ethan in the front?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	Eeek!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
004	Are you okay?! What was that shaking?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
005	Up ahead, aye! The shutter closed!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
006	Tsk!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
007	Eeek!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
008	Squeak! Fire detected! Fire detected! Fire in the compartment directly behind us!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
009	Oh no! The smoke is coming this way!
010	What're you trying to do, little lady?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
011	We need to cut off the rear compartment! If the smoke fills this one, we'll die of poisoning!
012	Aye, leave it to me! I can't get poisoned!
013	Edgar, you think of a way to make it to the next compartment, aye?
014	Heh. You two have become incredibly reliable, you know? Good luck!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
015	Aye!
016	Well then...
017	It looks like this shutter is made of some special metal. Bullets have no effect against it.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
018	In that case...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
019	We did it!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
020	We were able to separate the compartment, aye! We're safe now.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0007
021	Yeah. Good job, you two.
022	Did you find a way to get into the front compartment?
023	Are you good at tree climbing, little lady?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
024	Huh? No, not really. Are we going to try climbing through the outside window?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
025	There's no other way. We'll jump onto the roof of the front compartment.
026	Don't worry. It's not that big of a jump. We'll take it in stride, okay?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0001
027	Th-that's not the problem! If we fall...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
028	What are you going to do about your motorbike, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0001
029	I've no choice but to leave it here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
030	Sorry, pal. I know it'll be lonely, but I'll be back for you soon. Come on, let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
