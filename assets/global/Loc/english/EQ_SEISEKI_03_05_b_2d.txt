001	The wind ruins... I haven't been here since that day. Not one thing about it has changed.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
002	Where is everyone?
003	And who might you be looking for?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0001
004	Who's there?!
005	I am Waginau—one who knows much about all of you.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
006	All of us? I don't understand what you're talking about, but if there's something you want to ask then hurry up. You're being highly inefficient right now.
007	Heheh. That's quite the tone to take with someone you've just met. I'm not very impressed by your attitude, Seida.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
008	Who are you...? How do you know my name?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
009	Hahaha! Fate is on our side, after all! Who would've thought you would make your way to me!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0008
010	It's saved me the trouble of going out to find you! Well then, how about you tell me...where the Sacred Stone is?
011	What...?!
012	Gluttony and your people of Alize thought this one out well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
013	On the surface, the king and chief appeared to be at each other's throats, but, in fact, they were connected.
014	...?! How did you know that?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0029
015	Heheh. I was told so...by the very people who planned it!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
016	N-no, it can't be...!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0020
017	I can't feel anyone's presence anymore... I felt them just a moment ago.
018	At first, I attempted to prise the information from them gently, but their attitude was much like yours, and so I had to punish them a little.
019	No...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0021
020	Heheheh.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0023
021	Noooooo!!!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0019
022	They were quite noble. They didn't give up the location of the Sacred Stone, even until the very end. That's why I'm going to ask you now.
023	Where is the Sacred Stone? If you won't answer, then you'll also...
024	Miracle Kanon Slaaaash!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
025	Kanon...!
026	Are you okay, Seida?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
027	Are these your friends? I have no business with them. My apologies, but I'm going to have to ki—	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
028	Lightning Axe!!!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0001
029	...?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
030	Vice-Captain...?!
031	You scum...did you make one of my knights cry?	VO_monzein.monzein_chara_0002
032	If you so much as laid a finger on my teacher...	VO_almira.almira_sys_0027
033	I'm not gonna forgive you!
034	Oh dear. I see that it's four against one. Not the best odds.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
035	Oh, he ran away!
036	Let's chase after him!	VO_monzein.monzein_battle_0019
