001	Most impressive, little shaman! So that Slothstein ringleader wasn't just spouting nonsense.
002	How ironic of a Holy Guard operative to be traveling with an unsanctioned Alchemy user. Wouldn't you say, Siegfried?
003	So you were behind the Slothstein orphan kidnappings as well, huh?
004	What did you do with them? Bleed them dry like when the Sakris villagers gave their blood to power their guardian?
005	That's disgusting...
006	Ah, you wound me with your narrow-mindedness. Did you believe I would snuff out the lives of children for my own selfish gains?
007	Those with Alchemic potential, I take under my care. I am merely providing them with a means to a better life.
008	Wouldn't you say it is a far better fate than dying of starvation or illness in some godforsaken sewer?
009	Tch. You expect us to believe you're actually running some sort of daycare? You're a devil.
010	Watch your tongue, insolent fool!
011	Hold, Asuka. They will come to understand in time. For now...
012	Initializing... 78%.
013	What on earth is that?
014	My life's greatest work, whose purpose would have been made clear to you had you been more cooperative.
015	Alas, it seems that none of you are keen on sharing my vision! Truly a shame.
016	Perhaps some convincing is in order. Asuka?
017	My Lord.
018	Let's give them a live demonstration, shall we?
019	Adjusting in progress...
020	...!
021	Ugh... The air... Feels heavy.
022	(This is familiar... The Alchemia particle density is rapidly increasing!)
023	(Our Alchemia particles are suffusing into the air...)
024	Adjusting complete. Particle lock enabled.
025	*WHIRRRRR!*
026	I've got it. This must be the Core!
027	The one giving the Constructs their directives?
028	Doesn't explain why that woman can command them, though!
029	Prepare yourself!
