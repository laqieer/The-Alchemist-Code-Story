001	Is this all the soldiers we have?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
002	Yes. We have sent dispatches to every location in which we have allies, but we can't count on any of them arriving in time.
003	Then we must make this work with the numbers we do have!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0045
004	We of the Gluttony Foss Liberation Army will spare no effort to help the people of the desert in this, the hour of their need.
005	Neither will the Blue Tongues... Or, that's what I'd like to say, but we can't get in contact with our main force.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
006	It seems that shortly before the Jam started appearing in great numbers, there were a few who witnessed the Blue Tongues fighting something, but the details are unclear.
007	Mocca was with them, wasn't she? I really wish we could go look for her.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
008	I'm sorry, but we don't have the time. The scouts' reports show that the Gluttony army has already crossed the border and entered the Desert Zone.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0039
009	They'll likely arrive here by tomorrow. We need to make sure we're ready by then.
010	All right. I'm not worried, though. The Blue Tongues have won a lot of battles, you know.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
011	I'm sure they're fine.
012	...
013	First, we will need to evacuate the people of this city to a town deep in the middle of the Desert Zone.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
014	The Fruit Peddlers can handle that. I'll have them help carry supplies and guide people to safety. I'd like to evacuate all the civilians from the area at once.
015	Um... Does that include me?	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0002
016	If at all possible. Depending on how things turn out, you could end up being something of a chink in our armor.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
017	I...
018	It's all right. Everyone here is an ally, a friend. No one will hurt you.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_1011
019	I know that. It's just... I feel so useless. I'm the only one who isn't helping.	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0005
020	You might not be standing with us on the front lines, but that doesn't mean you can't help.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
021	We need logistic support, supplies... Once the battle breaks out, we'll begin sending the severely wounded your way to get patched up.
022	Even those who don't fight on the battlefield still have a war to win, you know. It's people like you who will do battle with death itself to save every life that you possibly can from its clutches. I want you to remember that, all right?
023	I-I will!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0004
024	What will we do about guards? This city is little more than a marketplace with an oasis at its center.
025	There are no ramparts, and no moat—we might as well be naked, we are so utterly defenseless.
026	Don't worry. I have an idea. If all goes well, we'll find ourselves in quite an advantageous position.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
027	Ceclidis is indeed a man to be feared, but he cannot neglect his instinct for self-preservation.
028	That's how we'll get him.
029	Onward! Our King wishes us to restore this land to its rightful place as part of the territory of Gluttony Foss!
030	The black tide will open up our path! Lay waste to everything that stands in your way, and plunder whatever your heart desires!
031	Huzzzaaahhh!
032	Reporting! The Gluttony army is now passing through the streets that were swallowed up by the Jam! Their number is estimated to be three times our own!
033	It will take a force that size some time to reach us. I'd say we have about half a day at best.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
034	Is Ceclidis present among the troops?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
035	Negative! The army is being led by one of the nobles aligned with Cecildis.
036	I didn't think he would be. Excellent!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
037	Indeed. It seems that our plan is fit to go as it is—in which case, I suppose I must now finish attending to the preparations.
038	It looks like it's going to be a long day.
039	You know what to do—just follow the plan. I leave the preparations in the city to you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
040	I understand.
041	In the meantime, it's up to us to kill every last one of those creatures—those monsters lingering outside the city!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
042	We will need to do this fast, so keep your wits about you, all of you!
043	Over there! There's a horde of monsters in the shadow of that dune!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
044	Gotcha. I'll head over there right away, but...do you really think this plan will work?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0038
045	Who can say for sure? Right now, all we can do is give it everything we've got!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
046	You're right... Let's go!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
