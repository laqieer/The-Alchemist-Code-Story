001	They're really good at hiding in the shadows at this late hour. However, I won't let them escape.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
002	I will find them. All of them.
003	...
004	If we did that, it would fail to make this a hallmark achievement for the Scarlet Legion.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
005	(Why did I say something like that?)
006	Gerald...
007	What is it now?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
008	Your wounds... I still haven't treated them.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
009	Right.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
010	You really are far too reckless.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
011	Gerald? Why did you say what you did?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
012	I...
013	Was your head sparking?
056	What does that have to do with anything?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
057	Nothing, really. I don't have to analyze you to know that it can't be fixed.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
058	Still... I want to do something for you. It hurts to see you like this.
059	You're always overdoing it, Gerald.
014	I can walk by myself on my own two feet, thank you! Put me down right now! You're embarrassing me!
015	Just let me carry you. It's your own fault.
016	I had to go all-out if I was going to beat you! I have to do whatever it takes to keep up with you!
017	Well, injuring your leg isn't going to get you anywhere, is it? Vettel went to get the first-aid kit, so I guess that's it for us for today.
018	Heheh. Good!
019	What're you snickering about?
020	Aww. Don't be mean.
021	It's just...you've changed since you started training with Vettel.
022	You think so?
023	You've always thought that you were the only one willing to do whatever it takes, no matter how reckless.
024	But Vettel is even more reckless than you are, so your hair keeps sparking like crazy and I don't think it's ever going to stop.
025	You might be right.
026	Huh? Wait... It stopped!
027	It's nothing to worry about.
028	Hmm... Maybe if I work harder to study medicine, one day I'll be able to analyze you through dissection and figure you out?
029	If that's a joke, it isn't funny.
060	I might be able to tend to your injuries, but I can't do anything about your sparkiness. A thorough physical analysis is what's called for here.
061	You know, that's not really sounding like a joke.
062	I want to help you, Gerald. So, what do you say? Will you lie down on my operating table, for science?
063	Hahah. I'm afraid I'll have to pass.
064	I won't tell you not to be reckless, or to stay away from the battlefield because you're not a fighter.
065	We'll always be together, Natalie. You and me.
030	Okay.
031	I miss those days.
032	Now you're the one being reckless all the time and I'm the one who has to patch you up.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
033	...
034	Gerald, let me carry you, too!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
035	What are you talking about?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
036	I don't mean physically, you big lump! You're always trying to shoulder your burdens alone, but you don't have to!
037	Let me help you. Let me support you. Let me take some of that weight off of your shoulders and carry it for you.
038	Just like how you picked me up and put me on your shoulders that day.
039	I'm not burdened with anything.
040	There you go again, sparking! You can't hide it from me.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
041	...
044	Would it really be so bad to lean on me? Even when I'm standing here, begging you to let me help you?
045	I...
046	Why can't you just be honest with yourself?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
047	Just...bring me some water, would you?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
048	Hmph. Fine! I'll be right back.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0030
049	Strange... She's been gone for quite a while.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
050	I'll do it, whether he asks me to or not! He wants the Scarlet Legion to be famous? Done! Maybe if I make that happen, his head will stop sparking so much!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
051	Well, I mean, I hope I can cure it like that. Won't know unless I try.
