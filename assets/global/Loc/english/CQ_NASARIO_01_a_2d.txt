001	The forest is beautiful as always.	VO_nazario.nazario_chara_1003
002	Spirits dance delightfully in the pure air, elf song caresses my ears, and noble Alchemia flows between the trees.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0007
003	Hmm...? What is that sound?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0004
004	Is that a bard? What is he doing in this forest?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0012
005	That instrument he's playing is...odd.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0012
006	Does he intend to disrupt the balance of this forest with his instruments, forged by hateful, human hands?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0015
007	I will not allow it!
008	When I hit my tambourine twice...that means no.	VO_lion.lion_chara_2001
009	You're an odd fellow, aren't you?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0016
010	You may not care to know this, but my name is Leon.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0001
011	Leon, hm? You are...a half-elf?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0004
012	What about it?	VO_lion.lion_sys_0005
013	Tch. Disgusting. Sullied blood...	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0029
014	That's surprising.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0030
015	I didn't think that there were any boorish forest elves, but it seems that I was mistaken. What a shame.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0016
016	What? Are you mocking me?!	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0005
017	No, I'm sorry. The fault is not with you.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0036
018	Even if the parent loses their pride as an elf, the child that they bear is not to blame.
019	In fact, a half-elf is a victim.
020	You definitely speak like a high-elf.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0045
021	Hnnghh... They heard us.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0042
022	Half of the blood that flows in your veins is elven, at least.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0010
023	Since I pity your situation, I shall lend you my strength.
024	Haa... Thanks for the pity.	VO_lion.lion_sys_0030
