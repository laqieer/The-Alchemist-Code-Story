001	Hellooo, anybody home?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
002	Miss Malta? Is that you?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0004
003	Kamui's out right now, but go ahead and let yourself in!
004	Hello, little man of the house! Do you know where Kamui has gone off to?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
005	Isidore showed up and dragged him off to visit Sephiron or something.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
006	Oh, I see, so I just missed him.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0022
007	So...you're here to hang out with Kamui again?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0010
008	I-I didn't say that!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
009	I mean, I wanted to check on you, Hisham! How have you been sleeping? Any more nightmares?
010	Mm... Sometimes, but I just forget them as soon as I wake up.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
011	Ah... So no new clues or memories about where you're from, then?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0021
012	Yeah...
013	Aw, don't look so sad. I'm sure you'll remember soon!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
014	More importantly, look at you! It seems like you've bounced back! Why don't we go for a walk since you're feeling better?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
015	Besides, aren't you curious about the rest of the village?
016	Wait, really?! Kamui told me I wasn't allowed to wander around outside on my own!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
017	Hehe, I'm kind of an important person around here. No one will question it if you're with me.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0023
018	If I say it's fine, they'll have no choice but to accept it! Um, except for my father.
019	Isn't that...kind of a big deal?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
020	W-well, at the very least, I should be able to show you around. What do you think?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0011
021	Of course! I want to see the ruins at the foot of Sephiron!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0005
022	The altar? Hm... I don't think I can do that.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0025
023	Aw, okay! B-but I still wanna go out for a walk! Please, Miss Malta!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0029
024	Of course! Come with me!	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
025	Whoa... Sephiron is as amazingly big as ever!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
026	Incredible, isn't it? The great tree of life, Sephiron, the pillar of our world, which watches over us all.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
027	I can't see it from Kamui's place, though. I wonder why we don't have a window that faces it.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
028	The light of Sephiron shines even deep into the night. You wouldn't want that to disturb your sleep, would you?
029	Oh, I had no idea. Kamui told me it was too dangerous to go out at night, so I've never seen it.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0044
030	That's true, actually! Night is when the beasts come out, so you should avoid going out.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
031	But...isn't this village protected by a mirage barrier? How can beasts come in here?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
032	Who told you that?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
033	Isidore told me when he was drinking with Kamui once.
034	That man... Honestly...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
035	Wait, am I not supposed to know about that?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
036	Not necessarily, but he really shouldn't be running his mouth when drinking, for security reasons. I suppose it's fine if it's you, though.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
037	The barrier around this village is aimed only at people.
038	Especially those who have machinations regarding Sephiron.
039	The sephirah that appear on the bodies of those who live in this village are proof that Sephiron herself has given us permission to live at her foot.
040	Oh... That's what that mark on Kamui's arm means.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0044
041	The beasts that come are only doing their best to survive. There is no reason to bar them from the village.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0005
042	Outside of this place, there is only desert and wilderness.
043	The blessings of the great tree Sephiron are for all who live on this continent. Sephiron does not deny those beings who wish only to live their lives.
044	As such, we do not do so, either. The night is for the beasts, and the day is ours.
045	We do not try to chase them out or engage them in unnecessary battle. Even now, our way of life is plentiful enough as it is.
046	At most, we will defend our fields and our livestock.
047	Oh, so Kamui was called to do that?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
048	Well, many ask for his help, as Kamui is the most powerful Spiritbonder in the village, but if it was Isidore? I expect so.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
049	So Kamui's really popular, huh? Miss Malta, you must get nervous about that, huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
050	Excuse me?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0006
051	Heh, I mean, aren't you showing me around because you're hoping to see him?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0011
052	N-no, I was just, you know, checking in with my patient! Doing my due diligence!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0019
053	Aw, that's disappointing. You know, if you keep making excuses like this, you'll never be more than childhood friends.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0010
054	...
055	Uh-oh. Are you upset?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
056	Hisham, you little...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
057	Yikes! Y-you know, it looks really bad for the Chief's daughter to inflict violence upon a helpless youth such as myself!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
058	I'm sure people will just think I am doling out the appropriate measure of discipline!
059	Th-this is abuse!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0019
060	Hey, get back here!	VO_malta.malta_favorite_0005
