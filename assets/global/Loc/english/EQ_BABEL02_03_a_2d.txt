001	(When did it start? This ever-present ache in my left eye...?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
002	(I escaped that cursed home. I sank deeper into the darkness. I hunted for the meaning of the shadows.)
003	(For the meaning of the never-ending death. Massacre. Blood spilled. I hated it. I escaped...didn't I?)
004	Are you listening, assassin?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
005	Nn.
006	It is disrespectful to simply continue drinking while I speak to you!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
007	Hey. There is no reason to raise your voice. I can hear you just fine. It's just that "assassin" is not actually my name.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
008	Your name doesn't matter to me! I just need to know if you understand what I am asking you to do!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
009	What's to understand? You want me to kill that...what did you call him? "Ungrateful little git"?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
010	Exactly! That boy seems to have forgotten that he could never have joined the Holy Guard without me!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0037
011	Me! He owes me everything! Yet I'm stuck in this pointless, backwater place!
012	Gr... I will return to Northern Pride... No matter what it costs.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
013	Hah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
014	What exactly are you laughing at?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
015	No, no. It's just the shadows. They're whispering.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
016	What? You're an odd one.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
017	(Ugliness exists everywhere, even...or especially...in clerics...and those clad in rich, splendid clothing.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
018	Well. Thanks for the job. I'll go do it now.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
019	Hey. Can you really do what I ask? That man is quite strong.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
020	Of course. No one, no matter how heroic, powerful or beloved... No one is safe from an assassin like me.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
021	Even the mighty "Silver Steed" whose majesty on the battlefield is well-known... Even if he is on the short-list to become the next Lord Commander.
022	He is dead, he just does not know it yet. I swear that by the darkness within me.
023	(I was born in the shadows. I ran from them, but they followed me.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
024	Zahar of the Holy Guard will die by my hand. I, Corvus Leonhart, swear upon the house I was born to.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0038
025	Now, if you will excuse me.
026	Hello. I am Corvus. I will be joining the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment from today.
027	Hm... I heard that you passed the trial with flying colors. I would like to hear in your own words... Why are you here? What do you hope to accomplish?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
028	Uh... Yessir. I hope to dedicate my life to protecting the Holy Order and the peace of the people of Babel, Vice-Captain Zahar.
029	Hm. Well. I look forward to seeing what you will do with us.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
030	...!
031	...Yessir.
032	(The shadows in me whispered and recoiled. They knew I was no match for him.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
033	(Those eyes held an abyss of unending darkness... They dragged me in. Or did I fall?)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0028
034	(After all that effort getting into the Holy Guard! After getting so close!)
035	Nnnghh!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
036	(My left eye, my evil eye...cried out in fear! I had never met an opponent such as this before!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0022
037	(Still...I had made my vow.)
038	(And so I stayed with the 4th Regiment as I tried to figure out how to kill Zahar.)
039	(However, he never showed weakness. Not even once. All I could do was keep pretending and watching.)
040	(It was beyond infuriating. I could not accept that he might be an opponent I could not best.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
041	(The days blurred together as I continued to play my role and waited for my chance.)
042	(Then, that day...)
043	Corvus. Prepare what you need for a mission to Wratharis.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
044	Wratharis? What kind of mission?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
045	We must make an example of a noble who has broken the Magna Code by using and conducting alchemical experiments.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
046	Alchemy...? A bold choice. How many should I expect to face?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0025
047	One.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
048	One...? So, we're just going to arrest the noble?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
049	No. Our orders are to...dispose of them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
050	Kill them?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0027
051	Those are our orders.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
052	...
053	Well, it may be just one noble, but they will be escorted by Wratharis knights. Do not underestimate them.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
054	U-understood.
055	(The mission called for a small cadre of knights led by Zahar and I to go to Wratharis. I was...uneasy.)
056	(I had not imagined that the Holy Guard, tasked with maintaining peace, would order us to kill someone.)
057	(Even if they had broken the Magna Code. Still... I could not pass up this opportunity.)
058	Guhyah?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0025
059	...
060	(I had never seen such skill with a sword. I couldn't even see it as he cut down knight after knight.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0021
061	(This was the Silver Steed of the Holy Guard, the most powerful of all the Paladins.)
062	Eeek!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0027
063	Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
064	Yes?
065	Do it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
066	!!!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
067	Aghhh...?!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0028
068	Yessir.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
069	Well done, Corvus.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
070	Thank...you...
071	Let us return. The mission is over.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
072	(I completed the mission as a Paladin. Yet...the shadows in my heart whispered.)
073	(They rustled and shuddered. They insisted... "You cannot win against him.")
074	Why are you giving me money?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
075	This is the money you gave me to complete the job. I'm returning it.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
076	You...?! What are you saying?! Don't tell me you're chickening out!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0012
077	Yeah... That is exactly what I am saying.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
078	How dare you?! Did you not vow on your house that you would kill him? Kill Zahar?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
079	Kill me? This conversation is certainly interesting.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
080	Zahar?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0026
081	You?! Assassin! You double-crossed me!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
082	No! I would never... Vice-Captain, what are you—?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0022
083	Ah, Corvus, so naive... I knew what you intended the moment I laid eyes on you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
084	What?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
085	And you, cleric. I am indeed grateful for your recommendation...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
086	But it is a little much to ask me to turn a blind eye to the fact that you simply wanted to use me, let alone the fact that you tried to have me killed.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0029
087	Eep?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
088	Luckily for you, I am feeling generous. Leave now, and I will overlook what I have heard...this once.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
089	Grk... I will not forget this disgraceful treatment!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0042
090	Now, as for you...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
091	Vice-Captain... I suppose I am now to be disposed of?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
092	Corvus Leonhart, from Slothstein. Your family has made quite the name for themselves as assassins.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
093	I...am impressed that you know this much.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0021
094	Are you? It is only natural that I do a bit of research into an untrustworthy subordinate.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
095	You knew who I was this whole time, so why...? Ah. I understand now. To draw out the cleric.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0027
096	Jumping to conclusions, Corvus? That is a rather unbecoming habit of yours. No. I want you to serve me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
097	Say again?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
098	You have proven your abilities to me. I have been looking for someone like you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
099	What is...?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
100	I need you, because I have come to the conclusion that you are exactly who I need. Join me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
101	Wait. Why me?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
102	Corruption is rife within the Holy Order. You have seen so for yourself, have you not?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
103	...
104	Do you remember that noble in Wratharis? They had, in fact, broken the Magna Code.
105	But think about it. Who created the Magna Code? Who enforces it? Why?
106	The Holy Order uses it to create a monopoly on alchemy, so that they may continue to exploit the whole of Babel!
107	No, that's... That's ridiculous.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0021
108	Tell me, Corvus... Why do you think this continent can never escape war?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
109	...
110	The Holy Order and the Holy Guard supposedly protect the peace of Babel, and yet!
111	When has Babel ever seen true peace? What have they been doing all this time?!
112	Vice-Captain Zahar... What do you mean to do about this?
113	I will change this world.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
114	...?
115	I will bring a new order to this tumultuous world and lead it to its true potential!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
116	I will crush the duplicitous Holy Order and save the world from its lies!
117	Are you nuts?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0022
118	What, Corvus? You don't believe I can do it?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
119	Come with me, Corvus! I will show you what we can do, together! Together, we have the strength to create a new order!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
120	You, who could not escape the shadows, yet sought to do so! You can become the bridge between me and the world I hope to create!
121	Zahar...?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
122	(His eyes...! Even disguised in the light, there was no mistaking the depths of darkness in his soul!)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
123	The shadows within me... They whisper. They call for you, my lord... Lord Zahar.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0011
124	Good.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
125	(I would follow him. For one whose blood carries the curse of my house... He was the only hope one such as I had ever held.)
126	Zahar...	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
127	A single existence with the potential to tip the scales of power for the Holy Order...and for all of Babel.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
128	Perhaps the "King of Darkness" of elven lore is nothing more than a pretty story. Or perhaps...
129	To Wratharis again?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
130	Yes.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
131	Isn't this strange, though? To go all of a sudden.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0031
132	The shadows whisper to me... They speak of danger.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0018
133	Indeed, there will be danger.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
134	The time has come already... Well, I always knew it would.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
135	Huh?
136	(The throbbing of my left eye... It indicates something wrong with this mission.)	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0029
137	Hold.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
138	Wha...?
139	You all... You are not my 4th Regiment.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
140	Wait, what?!	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_1050
141	Hello, Inquisitors.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
142	Inquisitors?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0006
143	Dogs of the Holy Order whose only mission is to ensure the Holy Order's monopoly on alchemy.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
144	As expected of the Silver Steed. I am quite impressed that you caught us.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0023
145	Hmph. I suppose I can guess why you are here.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
146	We can no longer allow you to live. You and your ideas are too dangerous. This here will be your final resting place!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
147	Ha! As if my will could be ended so easily! Do not underestimate me!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0029
148	Corvus, prepare yourself for battle! This is the moment our new world order begins to take shape!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0002
149	Understood.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0037
