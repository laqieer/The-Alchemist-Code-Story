001	Huff...huff...	VO_ines.ines_battle_0019
002	Found her! She's over here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
003	!!!
004	S-stay away...	VO_ines.ines_sys_0018
005	You're making this so much harder than it has to be!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
006	Stop dilly-dallying! Grab her already, and stuff her in the carriage!
007	No! Get back! Stop! Get off me!!!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0027
008	Noooooo!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0028
009	...!
010	Not again! I keep having the same dream lately. Nngh...	VO_ines.ines_sys_0022
011	Huh? Wait, what time is it?
012	Oh no! I need to hurry, or I'll be late!
013	Ines? It's about time. Is everything taken care of?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0002
014	Whoa! You're already here?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0026
015	No time to lose, then! I should be fine dressed like this. First, we need to get the festival items all sorted...
016	I believe they're all in...this bag, yes! Gotta take special care setting them up, though. We don't want to disrespect any traditions.
017	Um... First is the staff, then the crown, the bracelet...then incense, I think? After that...	VO_ines.ines_sys_0031
018	After that is my charm, official or no.
019	Ines? Aren't you finished yet?	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0003
020	Sure am! Be right there!
021	Sorry to keep you waiting!
022	You're late. And you still have bedhead.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0031
023	Honestly... A proud high elf such as yourself should always keep up appearances. How many times must I tell you that?
024	Maybe just don't? It's really no big deal. I'll go wet my hair. That'll fix it right up.	VO_ines.ines_sys_0029
025	Dear me. I thought taking over as festival representative might've made you more...cognizant of your demeanor. But I seem to have been mistaken.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0030
026	You will be representing us high elves—the most elite of elite in this world—to the humans. A disheveled appearance is plainly unacceptable. What's more—
027	Look, I get it! All I need to do is fix it and we're good, right?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0012
028	You haven't time to fix anything! Our human guide will be arriving at any moment.
029	What? Already?
030	For her to even be allowed into this forest, I guess she really must be from a family line blessed by the high elves. It's hard to imagine a human here, though!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0002
031	That's correct. Under ordinary circumstances, no human would ever be permitted to enter our sacred forest at all.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0006
032	But our predecessors allowed them access so as not to see our past conflicts resurface. It was a compromise of necessity.
033	It's for that reason that we must treat these humans with respect and acceptance. That being said...
034	I feel a disturbance in the forest's Alchemia. The animals are restless, and it is no doubt due to the unwelcome presence of humans.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0016
035	One must wonder if something as droll as a festival can even bring true peace in the first place. It's only been a few hundred years, after all.
036	Don't talk like that! This festival is really important for our people.	VO_ines.ines_sys_0015
037	It's our chance to join hands with the humans and ask the spirits to bless us all.
058	That's...what my mother always told me, anyway.
038	That's why she entrusted me with this position. So I could make sure our relationship with them stays strong.	VO_ines.ines_sys_0005
039	So yes, I'm well aware how important all of this is. And I'm going to go into it with my best foot forward. For our people, and as my mother's successor, I promise you:
040	I will uphold the cordial relationship we have with the humans.
041	......
042	Well said. This festival is crucial for the high elves. The pact we've made ensures our forest's continued safety. You seem to fully understand that...	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0031
043	And that's wonderful to see. Reducing threats to our livelihood is of paramount importance indeed.
044	I suppose what truly concerns me, however, is not whether you understand the gravity of the event, but...if you're personally okay with it all.
045	What do you mean? Okay with what?	VO_ines.ines_sys_0006
046	As our representative, you will be forced to deal with many humans. And you will have to do so impartially. I'm asking if you feel you can manage that task.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0022
047	I'm sure you must still be having that same dream, no?
048	......
049	Ever since you were almost kidnapped by those humans, you haven't quite been yourself. It's hard not to have some concerns—	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0002
050	I'm fine! Really. That was a long time ago. Trust me, I'm okay!
051	......
052	Very well. Pay me no mind, then.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0006
059	(I do still worry whether her past may affect the blessing of the spirits, though...)
060	Just...promise me one thing. If the spirits are upset in any way, it could disrupt the festival. So if anything should happen, I'd ask that you please inform me immediately.
053	Of course. Thank you, Nasario.	VO_ines.ines_sys_0005
054	Huh? Well, hello there! It's a rare treat to see you little ones in the high elf forest!	VO_ines.ines_sys_0006
055	......
056	Careful, Ines. Something's not right here.	VO_nazario.nazario_sys_0004
057	Nununu, numa!	VO_Mrat.Mrat_battle_0001
