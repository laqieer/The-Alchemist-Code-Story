001	Are you deaf? I told you. It's my turn next, unless you want to see Saga reduced to a smoldering wasteland!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0001
002	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
003	Nothing will change if we stand here twiddling our thumbs. So, shouldn't we take one step forward? The question is, how do I get up there...?
004	I think I might be able to help you with that.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
005	Lisbeth?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
006	Tina, I'm really glad I met you. Everyone else from Saga, too. I want to help you in any way I can!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
007	Don't say that! What...are you planning?! It's like... It's like you're about to say goodbye!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
008	I'm not going anywhere! I just don't have any time to explain. I have to push my body to the limit to ensure this works!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1005
009	Tina, don't look so worried! Next time we see each other, it'll be smiles all around!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
010	You've got a lovely smile, you know! That's why I'm going to do everything in my power to make you...and everyone else in Saga...smile again!
011	Very well!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
012	If everyone will hear me out, please... I think I have an idea. I might be able to get you to the dragon's back again.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
013	Lisbeth...what exactly are you planning to do?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
014	Could you all lend me some of your wind power? Voda, if you would grant me some of your water as well... I'll stop the dragon in its tracks!
015	All right, Lisbeth! Here we go!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0037
016	I have no idea what you're planning, Witch of Lustburg, but I like your spirit!	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
017	Thank you! Leave the rest to me!
018	This should be it. Icicle...Edge!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0007
019	She's...frozen the dragon's feet!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
020	I'm not done yet! I'm going to use every ounce of magical energy left in my body! Freeze...Over!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
021	Huff... Huff... I did it. It's all...up to you...now.
022	Lisbeth!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
023	She's fine. She's just lost consciousness from using all of her magical energy. What a reckless girl.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
024	Climbing that monstrosity won't be easy, even with one of its legs frozen. I've given it much thought.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0031
025	We can't waste this opening Lisbeth has given us. I'm going in alone!
026	Fuu!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
