001	They're finally gone.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0017
002	Yes. It seems like they've given up for today. The stars are better aligned now. But...	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0030
003	It seems like it'll be better if I leave here.
004	Yeah? Are you going to hide somewhere?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0006
005	Yes. I'll hide at a good friend's place for now. But, before that...	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
006	...?!	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
007	Your older brother, he's alive. Right now, he is positioned under a lost star. He seems to have lost his way.
008	But he is very smart with high ideals.
009	And where is he right now?!	VO_albell.albell_battle_0021
010	Well...	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0031
011	Tell me! Where is he?!
012	Your brother is...in Wratharis now.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
013	Wratharis?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0025
014	Yes. I'm not certain what he is doing there right now. I'm sorry.
015	I see.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
016	Are you going to go see him? It's dangerous. Surely, on the way there you'll encounter men like those from earlier.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0003
017	You're right. I might as well have had those men take me with them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0005
018	Albea!	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0021
019	Heh. I'm joking. Don't worry. I won't really go to see him. Right now, I can't.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
020	... ...
021	When we were children...before I became aware of things, my parents split up. I went with my father and my older brother went with my mother.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
022	I don't really remember my mother's face, but I remember meeting her just once.
023	At that time, she said to me, "You have a brother who is aiming to become an excellent Alchemist.
024	I'm sure he will become a great Paladin and a wonderful Alchemist. He will be a brother that will make you proud."
025	I see.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0044
026	Until then, I didn't even know I had a brother.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
027	But, those words stuck with me for some reason. That may be why...
028	I wanted to become a sister that my brother could be proud of. Although I wasn't that great, I did my best to improve as a mechanic.
029	I wanted to become an excellent artisan and take over my father's studio...so that my brother would have a place to come home to.
030	I wanted a place that my mother could come home to as well.
031	But...I couldn't do it in time and she died.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
032	I wanted to create and protect a home where he could always come back to. I wanted to make my brother proud.
033	I see. So that was your connection to your brother.
034	Yes. But my brother quit the Holy Guard and gave up on being an Alchemist.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1001
035	I want to meet him. I want to ask why he gave up on being an Alchemist, but...
036	I don't know what I'm going to do with that information once I find out.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0018
037	You're scared of meeting your brother.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0022
038	You might be right.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
039	Sigh... When you gaze at me like that, I feel like talking forever.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
040	Thank you for reading my fortune. How much should I pay you?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0033
041	You don't have to pay me anything. Instead...	VO_deneb.deneb_chara_1003
042	...?
043	Can you help me pack?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0041
044	Huh? What a hassle...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0029
045	Come now. Please?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0016
046	Sigh... Fine. I'll help.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
047	Yes! Well then, please wait a moment.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0004
048	Um...this...and this...oh, this as well...yes! This too!	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0031
049	What? This is all a bunch of junk.	VO_albell.albell_battle_0019
050	They're all things that I've received as gifts for reading fortunes. They're broken, so I can't use them, but I don't have the heart to throw them away.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0011
051	Sigh... So? Do you want me to pack them in a box?	VO_albell.albell_sys_0030
052	Yes. Please!	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
053	Hey...this right here.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
054	Yes?
055	If you tighten the screws here and here, you can still use it.
056	Oh? Really?	VO_deneb.deneb_chara_1003
057	This one as well. You just need to change the spring and it'll be okay.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
058	As for this one...it seems like the gear is rusty, but, if you brush and polish it, it'll still move.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0031
059	You really do know your way around these things, don't you!	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0024
060	Of course, I do. I'm an artisan.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0022
061	As for this, you can't use it anymore, but you can use the parts for this one.
062	This watch as well, you just need to change the crown. Oh, if you just modify the parts of the watch...I think it'll fit.
063	If you change the crystal on this one...maybe...	VO_albell.albell_battle_1018
064	Hey, if you don't need these things, can you give them to me? I think I might be able to make something interesting from them.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0002
065	Heheh. You really do like machines, don't you?	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0008
066	Mm...	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
067	Please. Take whatever it is that you want.	VO_deneb.deneb_chara_1024
068	Th-thank you.	VO_albell.albell_battle_0018
069	The stars shine at night and disappear with the rise of the sun.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
070	But they are not gone, just invisible.
071	Don't be afraid of the darkness. That's when the stars will shine.
072	You're right.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0004
073	I must have just lost sight of my love for machinery.	VO_albell.albell_chara_1007
074	I'm sure there will come a time when I'll find answers about my brother as well, right?
075	Yes. I'm sure of it.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0005
076	I'll do my best so that, when I meet him someday, he can be the one that says, "I'll be an older brother that my sister can be proud of."	VO_albell.albell_sys_0007
077	Thank you for everything.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0033
078	May you be guided by beautiful stars. Be well, Albea.	VO_deneb.deneb_sys_0007
079	You too.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0037
080	I'm glad I came.	VO_albell.albell_sys_0023
081	With the help of the other mechanics, maybe I'll remake this into a telescope that I can deliver to her new house.	VO_albell.albell_event_1009
