001	All right! Northern Pride is in danger.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0032
002	Let's quickly take down Greed Dike's army here!
003	Captain Othima! I'll go call the men waiting outside! Let's end this quickly!
004	Wait! We don't have time for this!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
005	Huh...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
006	This attack against Wratharis is clearly a diversion tactic!
007	We should return immediately to intercede in Northern Pride! Don't you agree, Othima?!
008	......
009	But...even if it is a diversion, I don't know how I feel about just abandoning the Greed Dike forces here and returning...	VO_basini.basini_chara_1011
010	If Northern Pride falls then the Holy Guard will no longer be able to function. You understand that, don't you? We need to return immediately...	VO_caida.caida_chara_1011
011	Ouch! What was that for...?	VO_caida.caida_battle_0019
012	Oh...it's just that I think it's irresponsible for a captain to disappear from the frontlines.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0014
013	Huh?! Why can't you understand?! If Northern Pride falls then it's all over!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0016
014	In any case, we need to temporarily withdraw...
015	Ouch...! Stop! What are you doing?!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0019
016	He-hey...what are you doing?! Don't poke so much...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
017	No...I was just wondering when she would show her true self.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
018	Her true self?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
019	The thing about Seida is that she takes everything seriously. If anyone tells her she's doing something wrong, she'll try to fix it immediately.
020	What are you talking about?	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
021	See, exactly that.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
022	I told her once that, since I'm her senior, she has to speak to me in a respectful way.
023	I don't know how to put this to you, but you're a little rough around the edges. Your impersonation is pretty bad.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
024	Impersonation?! Wait, are you serious?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
025	Ugh...! That's exactly why I said this kind of strategy is such a hassle and totally against my character!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
026	What...!?
027	Gwahahahah!!! I'm released from my stifling performance!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
028	Look. My muscles are pulsating with their desire to beat you all to a pulp!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
029	Wh-what?! A-a man...?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0026
030	This guy is pretty over the top...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
031	Was it a hallucination?! I can't believe it...there wasn't any smell!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
032	You're talking about Vier's technique. Sorry, but Füry was the one who did this. Her technique has no smell.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
033	That being said, it completely failed anyway. Why do they make me do these things? It's such a hassle.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
034	Füry...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
035	In other words, there are other magic users as well. That seems to be their expertise.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
036	Gwahahah!!! I'm one of the Veda Templars...Neun, wielder of Explosive Magic!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0023
037	I finally get to meet you, Othima! At this point I'm sick of hearing all the rumors about you!
038	You're actually more lanky than I imagined, you know?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
039	Sorry about that...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0035
040	Tsk. Anyway. Fine. I guess I'll be satisfied with you.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0022
041	Satisfied...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0005
042	I actually wanted to go head-to-head with this guy called Monzein, but I heard he kind of pathetically just died.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0007
043	Honestly. So much for the Great Thunder Axe. What a disappointment.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0030
044	What did you say...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
045	That reminds me. You sounded like you'd heard about Vier.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
046	Does that mean you were at Envylia at the time?
047	Let's see if I really am a disappointment.	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
048	Huh...?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0006
049	When Captain Monzein died he entrusted me with the future!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0012
050	Captain Monzein's soul still lives within me!
051	You wish you could've fought him, huh? Then come and get me.
052	The captain's will lives within me now...I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget!
053	...!
054	Basheeny...
055	You're all talk, aren't you?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0003
056	What the...?! What is this tremendous power?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
057	Hey, you...answer me this! Did you take out Vier as well?!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
058	Ugh! Wh-what is this power...?!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
059	Answer me, you scum!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0013
060	Ack...! Sh-she's the one that started it! I tried to avoid as many casualties as possible...	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
061	So it was you!!! You're the one who slaughtered Vier!!!
062	Basheeny! Run!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
063	?! Ack...!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0019
064	Wh-whoa...! So much power!!!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
065	Now that you've killed one of my precious friends, you've been labelled an Unforgivable.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0031
066	An Unforgivable?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
067	We have only one law! Those who hurt our friends will be killed by any means necessary!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0037
068	Under that law, you've been sentenced to death!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
069	Agh...! His power's increasing even more!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
070	...!
071	Hwoaahhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
072	Agh! Wh-what a tremendous aura!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0022
073	...?! Run, Basheeny!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
074	I'm gonna beat you to a pulp! Apologize to Vier!!! You scum!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0012
075	?! He's...fast!!!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
076	Ack...! Mystical Fire!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
077	Agh! Don't get in my way, Hero of Lost Blue! Hyaahhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_battle_0019
078	What...?!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
079	He destroyed Captain Othima's attack?!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0025
080	Wh...whoa?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0028
081	Die and go apologize to Vier!!! Fyaaahhh!!!	VO_neun.neun_sys_0032
082	Agh...!!! Aghh...akkk!!!	VO_basini.basini_battle_0025
083	Huh...?! Ar-arrgggh!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0019
084	Wait! Kazahaya, sorry to stop you when you're getting worked up, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
085	Do you think you can go call the soldiers waiting outside?
086	Huh...?! B-but...then...!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
087	As long as Wratharis is a diversionary tactic...then we can't afford to waste time here.
088	Besides...
089	Defeating him is my duty as someone who comes from the same hometown.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
090	...Understood! Please don't push yourself too hard!	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
091	Thank you. I-I'll do my best.
092	You seem to be taking this in stride, huh...? Just so you know, you also fit the category of an Unforgiveable for inflicting damage on Acht.	VO_neun.neun_sys_0016
093	You're the exact opposite of me; pure brute strength. Phew...what a day.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
