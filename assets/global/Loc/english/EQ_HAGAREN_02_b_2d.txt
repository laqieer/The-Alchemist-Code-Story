001	Heh.	VO_edo.edo_sys_0010
002	They're not very strong, but the sheer number of them makes this tougher than when we fought Miss Toritoh. Besides, I hate that our enemy looks like Ed!	VO_alphonse.alphonse_sys_0018
003	The way he's fighting and deploying his men... That's the strategy of someone who knows us well.	VO_riza.riza_sys_0016
004	Lowly soldiers though they may be, it's as though he's using them as cannon fodder... Stop it, Edward! You're incurring too many casualties! This isn't how the Holy Order fights!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0015
005	Did you not come to save me? You need not engage in needless battle, or sacrifice so many of your soldiers!
006	Shut your trap. I don't have to listen to a blathering twit like you.	VO_edo.edo_sys_0013
007	My job is to get you back, but as long as I keep you alive, they don't care how I deal with you.
008	What? How dare you treat the Blessed One this way?!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0012
009	This is bad! Enough dillydallying! We've gotta get out of here, General! You're a target, too!
010	I am the Holy Order's Blessed One... This is unforgivable.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0017
011	However...I am also General of the Holy Guard. The lives of my men come first.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0042
012	This is futile. Men, stand down at once!	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0015
013	Light?! Urgh... How could a mere human pull off a stunt like this?! My eyes... My eyes! They're burning!	VO_edo.edo_battle_0022
014	Tch. They got away. All the soldiers are out cold, too. We can't go after them like this.	VO_edo.edo_battle_0019
015	She's not their so-called Blessed One for nothing. They've trained her well. I'll let them have their fun...for now.	VO_edo.edo_sys_0007
