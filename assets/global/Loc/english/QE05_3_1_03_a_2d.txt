001	I cannot thank you enough.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
002	I am Marie. A member of the Gluttony Foss gentility.	VO_mary.mary_favorite_0001
003	...
004	Ah, uh...I'm Mocca. This is Tina. We're from Saga.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
005	I see! No wonder your attire is so different from that of the people I've seen in the desert.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0045
006	I simply must reward you with something to express my gratitude.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0034
007	...
008	Don't trouble yourself. We only did what was natural. We didn't do it to get—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
009	Oh, no. That wouldn't do! You have done me a great service, so please do let me repay you.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0014
010	I'll lose my sense of nobility if I don't!	VO_mary.mary_favorite_0002
011	Can we ask you something?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
012	On our way here, we saw many fallen travelers from Gluttony Foss.
013	What's happening in that country?
014	Gluttony Foss is...having some domestic conflicts at present.
015	Domestic conflicts? You mean like a coup d'état?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
016	Yes. The failed conquest of Saga has brought the discontent of our people to a head.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0005
017	Chaos reigns in the capital, with riotous masses clashing against the military dispatched to suppress them. Casualties are high on both sides.
018	And the nobility are abandoning their country and people?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0016
019	Shamefully, yes. Most of the nobility has already lost any influence they once had over the country.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0039
020	None but the Ceclidis family, the king's direct line, can fix this.
021	Then that whole Saga invasion was also...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
022	I presume so. I understand how you, the people of Saga, must feel.
023	Though I may be powerless, I am still a noble of Gluttony Foss, after all.
024	Your anger is mine to bear.
025	I owe you my life. If you wish it, I will gladly place it in your hands.
026	Ah, no, we don't—	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
027	However, I would ask that you please allow me time to accomplish my mission first.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
028	Mission?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
029	I came here in search of the people of my ancient lineage.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0005
030	An ancient tribe, the protectors of the great tree, the Sephira.
031	Y-you...!
032	You're one of the Sephira?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
033	So this is Bandit's Nest.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0044
034	Oh, come on! Do you have any idea what I had to do to get this?! Can't you give it a better price?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
035	Hell no! Look at this scratch, you idiot!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0015
036	Works of art go way down in value if you get them scratched up!
037	Hey, buddy! Wanna play a game? Wanna try your luck?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
038	This place is worse than I thought.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
039	Yeah, but it might be the perfect place to gather information.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
040	We'll see what we can find out.
041	Please do, but be careful. Try not to cause trouble with the locals.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0041
042	We won't be able to ask anything if we end up starting a fight.
043	Understood, Captain. We'll meet you in the square in an hour.
044	All right.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
045	You seem accustomed to this sort of thing. I didn't think the military trained their soldiers to conceal themselves in a crowd.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
046	Well, we've had to move around a lot since leaving Envylia.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0011
047	I suppose we have acquired some stealth skills.
048	I see—but you're still naive.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
049	Huh?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
050	I believe I told you that it is sometimes necessary to take risks.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0016
051	Isidore...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0025
052	The hell, bro?! You just bumped into me on purpose, didn't you?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
053	Isidore! What are you doing?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
054	What? You got somethin' to say?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
055	Allow me to apologize. He's had a long trip. We're all very tired.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0036
056	What the—? Agh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
057	I think you're the one who owes us an apology.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0010
058	You son of a—! I'm gonna knock your teeth in!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
