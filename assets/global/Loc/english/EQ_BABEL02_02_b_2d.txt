001	Is everyone all right?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
002	You, elven swordsman... Thank you for saving our village!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0046
003	If you weren't here, I am sure we would have had many more casualties. Urk. Ow...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
004	Please, take this medicine for your injuries.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0025
005	It should help.
006	O-oh, you are too kind! Thank you!
007	Hello, elven friends. I am the cleric posted in this village to preach the teachings of the Holy Order of Babel.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
008	I am deeply grateful for your help in defending our village.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0033
009	It was nothing. We simply happened to be passing through.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
010	By the way... I noticed that the two of you not only possess Alchemia, but also make use of alchemy.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
011	Yes. Is that a problem?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
012	No, no. During these troubled days, we all must make use of whatever tools we have to survive.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0016
013	I was just wondering if you had heard of the knights of the Holy Guard.
014	Of course. I do not believe there is anyone who has not.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
015	It seems that recently they have been having trouble finding new recruits with the requisite strength of body and heart.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
016	I am sure they would welcome courageous travelers such as yourselves into their ranks.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0011
017	They accept both elven folk and therians these days. The only requirement is strength.
018	You want us...to become Paladins?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
019	Exactly! There would be training, and a trial to pass, but...I am willing to put you two forward as candidates.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
020	As a Paladin, you would be granted the authority to use alchemy as you please.
021	Hm... A Paladin...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
022	What do you think, Zahar? The headquarters of the Holy Order is in Northern Pride.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
023	It sits at the foot of the Tower of Babel. If we join the Holy Guard, we would be able to see the Tower from up close.
024	That is true... I suppose that this would be a good opportunity for us.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
025	Heheh. It might be interesting to try being Paladins for a while. It would be something new, at least.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
026	Protect the order of the world as a Paladin? Hmmm. Cleric, if you truly mean to recommend us, we will accept the opportunity.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
027	It would be my honor. I shall write the letter of recommendation right away.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0009
028	Hmhmhm... How lucky. If I am able to return to headquarters with such valuable recruits for the Holy Guard, perhaps they'll take me back...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0008
029	This is a fantastic opportunity. I shall join the Holy Guard and gain the strength to change this world!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
030	I cannot gain such strength as a simple nomad who wanders aimlessly.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
031	...
