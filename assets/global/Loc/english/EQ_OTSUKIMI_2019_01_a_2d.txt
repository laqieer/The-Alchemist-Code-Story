001	The sky above us was always obscured by thick clouds, but the heavens have become so clear.
002	I'm a Phantom Soldier now, but knowing that and believing it are two different things. It didn't feel real until I saw that sky.
003	The clouds parted, and I was able to meet someone I never thought I'd see again. I was so happy...
004	But...
005	...
006	...
007	Wow... Feels like a completely different city without all those clouds.
008	While I'm here, I want to see how far the field of magical engineering has progressed. Wait, could that car's engine be...?
009	It's perfect weather for moon-gazing!
010	Whoa! Wh-who are you?! Huh? Hazel, is she a friend of yours?
011	My name is Tamamo, and this is Kon!
012	Nice to meet you. My name is Evelika. I'm a mercenary from Slothstein, and...
013	Wait a minute! Where did you come from, anyway? Jumping out of nowhere and shouting about the moon... Who does something like that?
014	Sorry, sorry! I'm just so excited about moon-gazing!
015	What is moon-gazing, anyway?
016	It's a custom of Wadatsumi. I had it explained to me earlier, but if you want the details...Tamamo?
017	Heheh! Then allow me to explain! You see, moon-gazing is...
018	Haaaahmm... The people at the shrines seem kinda busy today, huh?
019	Ahh. That is because they are preparing for the moon-gazing event.
020	Moon-gazing? What's that?
021	Curious, are we? Very good. Ahem.
022	Moon-gazing is a festival in which we express our gratitude to the gods for the year's harvest. We begin by decorating the altar with offerings.
023	Such offerings should be dumplings made to look like the moon.
024	In addition to a nice meal made using seasonal foods, of course.
025	After the festival, you enjoy these offerings. By doing so, you express your thanks for the bountiful harvest with which you were blessed, thereby strengthening your connection to the gods.
026	That is what the gods tell me, at least.
027	Sounds delicious! Well, I'm convinced!
028	I would like to take part in the festivities myself.
029	However, leaving the shrine amidst such sizeable crowds was deemed too dangerous for me. As such, I have been forbidden from participating.
030	I am sure that everyone will enjoy this day in harmony, united under the majesty of the full moon. I cannot deny that I am a little envious. I would very much like to enjoy it alongside them, but alas...
031	Okay! Then I promise you that we'll go moon-gazing together someday!
032	And that's what we're doing today!
033	I see... So that's why you're both dressed like that.
034	Aren't these garments lovely?
035	They are, but they look difficult to move around in. I wouldn't have expected you to be so into this, Hazel.
036	It sounds like it'll be fun! The moon should be so beautiful with skies as clear as this!
037	...!
038	If the sky ever clears, I would like to see the moon with you, Hazel.
039	That would be nice. Someday...
040	...
041	Unless... You don't want to...
042	No, I would love to! I swear it.
043	All right, then! If that is what we are doing, then I, Evelika, will do everything in my power to make tonight go well!
044	Yay!
045	So, we'll be needing dumplings as round as the moon and a feast full of seasonal deliciousness...
046	I've asked Carol to take care of the dumplings, but... Ah, right. We'll need to make some other things as well. I wonder if she'd be okay with me making another request?
047	Oh, I almost forgot! We need silver grass!
048	Silver grass? What does that have to do with anything?
049	But... Hmm... I think I saw some growing somewhere near this area.
050	We'll need to watch our step. Wild animals live here and we're invading their territory. Let's try not to disturb them.
051	Isn't that right, Hazel?
052	What the...? Where did she go?!
053	Over here! Come on!
054	Hey! Don't go on without me! Wait for me!
055	Look! A whole field of silver grass!
056	So this is silver grass... They look so fuzzy.
057	Hrm... These are a bit wimpy looking. Are there more down this way?
058	A-are you two sure we should be going in any deeper? I heard wolves nest in this area. Maybe we shouldn't...
059	Whoa!
060	Huh?
061	Hehehe, sorry. I think I just woke them up.
062	What did I just tell you?!
063	Grrrroooooooghh!
