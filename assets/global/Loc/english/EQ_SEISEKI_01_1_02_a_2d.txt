001	I wonder how many of us will pass this final test.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0030
002	Who knows? Paladin hopefuls gather from all over Babel.
003	The number of them is more than 1,000 a year. Amongst them, only a handful become Paladins.
004	True. There were a lot of Squires who weren't able to keep up and ended up quitting.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0020
005	I'm surprised you weren't one of them despite your inferior rank.
006	What?! You're making fun of me again!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0016
007	No, I'm not. I'm telling you that you've got guts. I mean that.
008	Huh?
009	Of course, talent is important for becoming a Paladin, but you also need incredible determination and mental strength.
010	Kanon, why did you want to become a Paladin?
011	I...want to repay my debt to the Holy Order of Babel.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0010
012	Repay your debt?
013	Yep. I was taken in and raised by the Holy Order.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
014	That's why I want to become a worthy knight and repay them with my gratitude!
015	Wow...I see.
016	That's why my dream is to become captain of the Holy Guard!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
017	There's no better way to show my gratitude than to become captain and protect the peace, right?!
018	Captain, huh? That's a pretty big dream.
019	Why did you want to join the Holy Guard, Chloe?
020	Me...
021	Yeah?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
022	Because I'm a fan of Captain Vettel!
023	What?! No, come on. I'm being serious.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
024	I'm serious, I'm totally freaking serious! My mom's a huge fan of Captain Vettel!
025	...Your mom, huh?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0030
026	Ever since I was a child, I grew up hearing stories about Captain Vettel.
027	Before I knew it...
028	I found myself thinking, "When I grow up, I want to become a knight and meet Captain Vettel."
029	So, I naturally enrolled in a knight training school.
030	There, I learned that I had more Alchemia Particles than most people.
031	That's when I decided I might as well become a Paladin since I have the potential.
032	So, I joined our Paladin apprenticeship school!
033	The truth is, I wanted to join the Scarlet Flame Guard where Captain Vettel is!
034	... ...
035	Huh? What's the matter, Kanon?
036	Argh! Just look at you, breezing through life with no effort!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0024
037	I want to be a Paladin, but I'm in the 13th Rank!
038	I can't help it. This talent is something I was born with.
039	Okay, wow! That sounds totally elitist and stuck-up!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0017
040	Fine! You do you; I'll do me!
041	I'm gonna do whatever it takes to pass this thing! Urgh!	VO_kanon.kanon_battle_0013
042	Why are you suddenly getting so worked up?
043	Seriously! When are we gonna reach the Trial Ruins?!
