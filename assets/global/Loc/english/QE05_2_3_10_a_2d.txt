001	Oh, hey. What's up?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
002	I've heard rumors that the Lion Monarch's invasion has begun.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
003	Right, right. In a pretty sick way, it's impressive just how well it's going. Looks like there's even a chance his campaign might reach all the way here to our little desert.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
004	I doubt that would come to be.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
005	That Lion Monarch's got his eye on the prize, you know: world domination. Still, you seem pretty confident. What do you know that I don't?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
006	Well, I've been puzzling over why Greed Dike would destroy Wadatsumi for some time.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
007	Huh. I guess...for it to have become a beachhead for this current invasion, Greed Dike must have taken an awfully long time to raise an army.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
008	Just as when Sephiron was destroyed.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
009	I remember... There were reinforcements from Greed Dike among Ceclidis' soldiers.
010	And? Sephiron, Wadatsumi... I'm not seeing the connection.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0044
011	They both needed those two adversaries gone, especially Greed Dike.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
012	Now the Lion Monarch has taken pains to occupy Envylia and Lustburg.
013	Then...their target is the Sacred Stones?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0031
014	Or something else with the same depth of power.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
015	As bittersweet as this truth is, it is lucky for us that there is nothing of the like left here in the Desert Zone.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
016	Can't argue with that logic. Still, better safe than sorry.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0045
017	I mean to be prepared for the hypothetical moment they take even a single step into my desert. Are you ready for this?
018	I am. I am also unable to rest easy while that Lion Monarch roams free.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0038
