001	Nope, nope nope! This won't do!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0039
002	No? I think it's much better than before. Don't be so pessimistic…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
003	It's no good unless you say "Delicious!"	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0022
004	I need to convince demons that this food is better than eating humans. Otherwise, how can we expect to achieve peace?
005	There must be something else I can add. Something...	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0031
006	…*Chuckle*	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
007	What? Did I say something funny?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0005
008	No... I just thought, "You really are crazy."
009	…Obviously!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
010	…Oh! Speaking of which ...
011	Hmm?
012	Since you can't eat humans, how did you survive before? Did you have some kind of nutritional supplement or something.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
013	I had life force poured directly into my body.
014	Life force…poured directly? What do you mean?
015	How can I explain it? I had someone put their hand on my head…and then my hunger would be satisfied...	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
016	THAT was a substitute for meals...?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0025
017	Yes...but I'm not sure what it was...	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
018	Maybe ... !!
019	W-What's wrong Koga...? What did I say?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0025
020	It's a chakra! It was a chakra!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
021	I have no idea what you're talking about.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
022	I was too focused on flavor! That must be it… The food I gave you was lacking chakra!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
023	Please explain.
024	I've been thinking for a long time--Why do demons eat humans? Have you ever wondered?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
025	No...I haven't, now that you mention it…	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0031
026	Humans aren't delicious at all! Well, that might not be true from a demon's perspective, but...
027	I always thought the meat or blood was important--not the taste...but I was wrong. The important thing was...the intake of life force!
028	Do you...think so?
029	I do! Think about it. Humans also get nutrition from their diet, so demons must be the same.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
030	What if we provide the necessary life force with chakra!?
031	…I'm listening.
032	A small amount of chakra is contained in all living things. When a demon eats a human, it also ingests chakra.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
033	...I don't know if it ingests the chakra itself...but it should be a familiar flavor to demons--something they won't reject.
034	And if all living things contain chakra--
035	…It may be possible to convert that into life force!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
036	I wonder…
037	We might as well give it a shot! I've tried plenty of things that didn't work before.	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0007
038	Pour chakra directly into the dish. Convert it into life force. Add flavor and...presto! Fusion cuisine!
039	This may be a major breakthrough!	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0008
040	Is there anything I can do?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0002
041	We need more ingredients. Can you help me?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0004
042	Yes, of course!	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
