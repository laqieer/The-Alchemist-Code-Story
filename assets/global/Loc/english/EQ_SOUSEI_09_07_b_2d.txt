001	The clashing of swords... The ringing of shields... The sounds of battle echo forth, far and wide.
002	Ghh. She's no joke.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0021
003	(She is incredibly strong. But she's not untouchable.)
004	(Both her techniques and her form are outdated. It's like seeing a fossil in action.)
005	Yet no matter where I aim, whether it be the neck, elbows, knees, fingers, or even the eyes or the stomach, it doesn't seem to matter.
006	I'm confident that at least half of my hits connected, and I put my full strength behind them...
007	And yet, they do nothing!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0022
008	This doesn't make any sense!
009	Phew... Haa...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0029
010	Daphne, are you all right?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
011	Yes... I can still...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
012	(She's reaching her limits. Of course she is! How many times has she taken those powerful blows? Her arms must be aching so!)
013	Delightful! So, this is how people fight in this age, is it?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0008
014	She really does seem to be thoroughly enjoying this. On the other hand, we're barely holding on.
015	(If my sword doesn't have any effect, I guess I'll just have to use magil instead!)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
016	Prepare yourself, and think fast!	VO_messaletim.messaletim_battle_0007
017	...!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
018	I couldn't completely dodge her attack, and so I had to meet it with my sword instead. I'm left barely able to hold my own. Just keeping her at bay is draining my stamina rapidly.
019	(There's no outlasting an opponent like this. We have to end this quickly, or we have no hope of winning.)
020	(But...)	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
021	We also have no technique capable of attacking her. Or rather, no technique capable of successfully attacking her. Nothing we throw at her has any impact whatsoever.
022	(My sword just isn't doing anything!)
023	What should I do? What can I do? There's really only one option.
024	I must overcome my own limits to win this!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
025	Haa... Phew...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
026	Your ability to defend against my attacks is faltering. How...disappointing. Is this all your future is worth to you?	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0001
027	Nnfgh...	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
028	Breathe in. Breathe out. Find your center. Put everything into this next strike!
029	(Only one option...)
030	Remember that feeling of bounding through time...
031	(Only one way out: through that door I saw.)
032	That place Nimul's voice beckoned me to. That place in the sky.
033	My Wrath is a righteous flame...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
034	Oh? This ought to be interesting.	VO_messaletim.messaletim_sys_0006
035	I shall commit the full power of my Wrath into my blade!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0012
