001	The winds...are so strong.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
002	That's this realm's particular characteristic. The unending gales make it impossible for anything here to last.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
003	Anything native to this land, that is.
004	What do you mean?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
005	Human ingenuity allows some of us to call even this harsh environment home.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
006	Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition. Destination: Good ol' Vice City.
007	Shall we?
008	Welcome to the stronghold of the Infinite Serpent, and Superbia Belt's one and only metropolis:	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0031
009	A town of free spirits known as Hierosolyma.
010	Impressive...
011	Lord Quence? Is that you? I'd heard you were attending to business in the Ire Belt.
012	I was, but that business led me back here. Is Lord Shahel around?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0006
013	Of course. He's eating his lunch at present.
014	Seriously? Guess I should have timed this better.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0039
015	I'm sure Lord Shahel will be most pleased to see you, lunchtime or no.
016	That's what I'm afraid of.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
017	Quence?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
018	Hmm? Oh, Shahel is the name of the leader of this Belt Region.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
019	And he also happens to be the head of the Infinite Serpent.
020	The leader of the Belt Region?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
021	What are you so surprised about? Nimul's the leader of Gula Belt, isn't he?	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
022	Yes, but that's different...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0016
023	At any rate, Lord Shahel is quite the gourmand. Every time I see him, he gives me recommendations for all sorts of foods.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
024	You two must be...pretty close, then, I guess.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
025	He's like that to everyone. But the problem is, after he eats, he always goes into a serious food coma.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0004
026	Uh... Come again?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
027	We don't have time to wait for him to wake up, though, so come on, Boss. We're going to head him off at the pass.
028	"Boss"? Do you mean me?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
029	What, don't you like being called "Boss"? The only other thing I'd feel comfortable calling you is "Ma'am"...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0003
030	Um, you can always just call me by my name...
031	...
032	...Did you forget my name?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
033	Of course not! A man of my intellect would never forget anyone's name! Not even that of someone he only ever met once before...	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0025
034	Oh, right, you were one of Ambrosia's older apprentices, weren't you? That must mean you're getting a bit up there in years.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0008
035	So what if I am?! That doesn't mean I've gone senile!	VO_kvense.kvense_battle_0019
036	Rrrg... That's right! Emmel! Your name's Emmel! I finally remem—I-I mean, of course I know your name! See?!
037	Of course. Anyway, like I said, you can just call me Emmel. So, you were saying you'd take me to meet Shahel?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
038	Yes. Come with me.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0016
039	Mm, thish pie ish beautifully baked! You can tell, right, Helene? The crishpnesh of the crusht can only be achieved through ekshpert control of—	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0008
040	I understand you're excited, Father, but could you please not talk with your mouth full? It's very unpleasant!	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0002
041	Oh, don't be like that! This is so good, I have to sing its praises in the moment! There's no time to swallow!
042	Ah, I'm ready for my wine, if you would.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
043	Of course, Sir.
044	Ah, the act of eating is such a stupendous thing.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
045	I can understand why so many of this Belt Region would succumb to such an indulgence.
046	You may very well be the one who indulges in it the most, Father.
047	But of course! I could never pass up such a perfect means to learn more about human culture. You'd do well to try it yourself, Helene!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0003
048	Unlike we, who feel the magil of the world directly, humans must depend on their senses to perceive the world.
049	Sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste... When you eat, all five are thoroughly stimulated. It is a truly divine experience!
050	Yes, yes. I've heard all this before.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0030
051	You are even more talkative than usual today, though, Father. Did you receive good tidings, perhaps?
052	I did! I heard tell that Zafeiris was defeated.
053	All this after attaining the coordinates for Gula Belt and so triumphantly marching forth! I'll have to tease him about this when he gets back.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
054	That old dragon corpse was taken down?	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0025
055	Indeed. Imagine: a dragon—one of the beings who created the high elves—was actually bested in battle!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
056	What's more, he wasn't even bested by the famed Guardian Dragon, but by a mere human!
057	Such powerful humans are finally beginning to show themselves... It seems our efforts have begun to bear fruit, no?
058	Maybe. But you could also be jumping to conclusions again, just as you did with Avaritia Belt.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0031
059	It's certainly possible. But high expectations are free, so why not indulge in them from time to time? Disappointment is a risk, but when the expectations are met, oh, the satisfaction!
060	Speaking of, this wine is simply divine! Do I detect some fruity notes on the end, there? I've never tasted anything like this before.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0024
061	It's a reproduction of the grain wine produced in the Avaritia Belt Region you were just speaking of.
062	Why have you never served me this before? I dare say I'd love to drink this every night!	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
063	Its manufacture is quite complex, and we only had Lord Yna's verbal instructions to go by, leading to many failed attempts. However, we were finally able to recreate it with some persistence.
064	Ah, I see. I suppose there's no way around that, then. When he was here, reminiscing about his past was really all he ever did. I'm impressed you were able to glean anything from those ramblings.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0045
065	I wonder if he's finally been able to move on.
066	Pardon me, Sir—oh, were you in the middle of a meal?	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0004
067	My son! It's good to see you. Come, sit. I'll have them prepare some for you as well.
068	Well, I... Ah, thank you, but there's no need. I've already eaten.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0039
069	Very well, then.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0020
070	You must have business with me, yes? Even if we are not blood-related, I still think of us as family. You may speak with me on any topic you wish, at any time.
071	In this case, I simply came to deliver a message. You have a visitor. Lord Quence brought a guest who wishes to meet you in person.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0045
072	Oh?
073	We'll have to ready a proper welcome for this mysterious guest, then. My apologies for cutting our meal short, Helene.
074	Oh, no, that's fine.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0006
075	Though it's probably just another miserable stray one of the serpents picked up on patrol.
076	Well... I wouldn't be so sure about that.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0020
077	Hmph. As if you're in any position to judge.	VO_helenne.helenne_sys_0004
078	Let's see how you feel after you've met her. I, for one, was rather caught off-guard.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
079	...?
080	Well met, esteemed guest. We of Superbia Belt extend our warmest welcome to all humans...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
081	Even if they do stand against the very Truth of this world.
082	That's not a very warm welcome at all, Shahel.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
083	When you first met me, you were much more polite and gregarious.
084	And, wait, I was told you were eating! Now I feel like a fool for hesitating over asking to speak with you.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0001
085	When I first met you, I didn't yet know of your disposition. If I had, I'm certain my greeting would have been more...apropos.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0001
086	As for eating, I was. I've taken the liberty of having meals prepared for you both as well, so please do feel free to partake at your leisure. Particularly you, Quence. You've gotten skinny, and it worries me so.
087	...
088	It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir. I'm—	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
089	A citizen of the Sephira.
090	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
091	I can tell simply by...let's say, the look of your magil. Furthermore, you have the cores of Cursed Beasts embedded in your being, which means...
092	You're the Vessel of Purification, are you not?
093	Yes, that's right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
094	How fascinating. The Vessel of Purification. The sacrificial daughter...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
095	Come here all the way from Gula Belt. Why, I wonder?
096	Though perhaps it would be best for me to ask you this first:	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0039
097	How is it you possess the core of a Cursed Beast which has yet to be felled?
098	Because I hail from the future.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
099	So, the Observer has gone, then. Which must mean...
100	Can you at least try to act a little more surprised?!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0030
101	There was always a chance for such eventuality once the Ceremony of Creation had reached its final stage.
102	But if she isn't taken care of soon, things could become most troublesome indeed.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
103	She's the root of the dragon technique that binds this world.
104	Her continued existence only means the guaranteed failure of the Ceremony.
105	I've come to take over that Ceremony.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
106	...!	VO_helenne.helenne_battle_0019
107	(Her eyes are filled with such resolve... Just how deep does that resolve run?!)
108	You have, have you?
109	Yes. Am I not a satisfactory candidate for the role?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
110	Regrettably, I am not the person who decides that.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0035
111	Only one who has successfully conquered all the Cursed Beasts has the right to carry out the Ceremony of Creation.
112	For only one with the power to exert control over the world itself can lead the charge on its remaking, as you may well imagine.
113	But as far as I can see...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
114	You are not a warrior, nor do you possess any outstanding abilities. You are simply a formerly empty vessel that absorbed the cores into your being.
115	You are not yet prepared to fight against fate itself.
116	I know. And that's exactly why I came here to Superbia Belt.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
117	Oh?
118	I do not possess the wisdom needed to overturn the world's order.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0030
119	I have neither the skill to discern the nature of the universe, nor the aptitude to alter it. And yet, despite that...
120	If I were able to defeat the Beast of Pride as I am now...
121	Would that not mean I have earned the right to change this world?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
122	Oho!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0031
123	You are quite the fascinating one indeed, girl. I can see now why you picked her, Quence.
124	Right?!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
125	But I believe you have an ulterior motive. You didn't actually come here with the intention of taking over the Ceremony of Creation, did you?
126	What makes you say that?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
127	Because all of this was prophesied—described in a most heinously accursed foretelling left behind by the one regarded as the priestess of Ouroboros.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0037
128	...
129	Besides which...you do not have the eyes of one determined to make change, but rather of one who is resolved to protect.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
130	You wish for this world to continue as it has always been.
131	You want to keep the Truth of this world unchanged, even sealed as it is in corruption alongside all the world's people.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
132	You understand, don't you? Your goal is in complete defiance of ours. We wish to rebuild this world from scratch, while you wish to preserve it.
133	Are you planning to stop me, then?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
134	Oh, certainly not! Your voice joins the chorus of those from all the Belt Regions, and the wishes it proclaims are no less valid than any others.
135	I have no intention of nipping that bud.
136	Then what is your intention?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0003
137	I am only here to oversee things so that the past splendor of the dragons, and the world they left behind, can be passed along to those who may help bring it to flower once more.
138	Though I do so wish the humans would simply accept the fact that everything must be sacrificed, and move on already...	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
139	How can we accept that, when the Infinite Serpent has done nothing to explain any part of it?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
140	We've toiled endlessly—blindly—all just to barely grasp the faintest of answers without even a hint of assurance if they're actually true!
141	Yet you tell us to accept those answers on, what, faith? What gives you that right?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
142	Most unfortunately, I am not a god. I am far from almighty, and am limited by much.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0030
143	There is no way for me to save everything and everyone...which is why those who are unnecessary must be cast away, and that which is excess must be disposed of.
144	Only then can I entrust everything I have to whatever remains.
145	And who gets to choose who or what remains? Do you spare no regard for the feelings of those who are destined to be sifted out and discarded through little more than your own selfish choices?	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
146	I could say the same for you. You can't possibly believe that no one will be hurt by your decision to sacrifice yourself.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0016
147	...
148	Life is built upon a foundation of sacrifices. The mere act of living is but a constant fight for the resources to continue living!
149	Take eating, for example. Food is a wondrous thing, and humans have both a biological need and an instinctive drive to eat. One could even think of food culture as a sublime art all its own.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0007
150	But at its very core, consuming food is the act of taking life from others.
151	Day by day, we continue eating to survive, to nourish, and even to enjoy. But have you ever stopped to wonder just how many sacrifices have been made in the name of consumption?
152	Your point is noted, but you can't deny that my wish to save everyone is a noble cause.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
153	Certainly. But that's not truly the cause you champion, is it?
154	Use your own words to refute me. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear; tell me what you truly feel.
155	I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
156	What is it you truly wish for?
157	...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0031
158	I don't have much longer for this world.
159	I was born as the Vessel of Purification, and my body has already been wrought by an incalculable amount of corruption.
160	I cannot hold out to the end of this journey.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0022
161	I see. And?
162	I want to leave something behind.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
163	For the people I treasure... For my brother... I want to leave behind a world as beautiful as the one he envisions.
164	And if I can fulfill that vision through this feeble shell that's destined to break apart regardless...
165	Then that's exactly what I intend to do.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
166	I understand now. Your ultimate goal, it would seem, is to denounce the Ceremony altogether.
167	Yes. Once it begins, countless aspects of this world will change, and many lives will undoubtedly be lost.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
168	Naturally. The very laws of the world—the Truth, as we know it—will be rewritten from dust.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0006
169	There will be no small number of casualties, and many beyond that will be forced to abandon their lives as they've known them.
170	And what you're saying is, you wish to save even them?
171	Yes, for they are all a part of this world that I've loved so much.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0005
172	Then I'm sure you're aware that the Infinite Serpent must stop you. You leave us no other choice.
173	I am aware.
174	But you are merely a single person. Even if Quence should be foolish enough to join you, that would make two.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
175	You're rather lacking in manpower for a siege upon the enemy's stronghold, don't you think?
176	You must have known I would oppose you. Which begs the question, how are you planning to get out of this?
177	Are you ready, Quence?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0002
178	Ready as I'll ever be, Boss.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0007
179	Oh, Quence. You really are planning to betray us!	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0002
180	I don't expect you to understand, Ignacio, but all I'm looking to do here is save the world.	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0005
181	How I get there, and what form it takes, doesn't matter. I'm just following my heart!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0010
182	Pity. I thought you were going to say you did all this to save a girl. At least that would've sounded cool on your memorial.	VO_ignacio.ignacio_sys_0007
183	Well, she is my world now, so it wouldn't be wrong!	VO_kvense.kvense_sys_0023
