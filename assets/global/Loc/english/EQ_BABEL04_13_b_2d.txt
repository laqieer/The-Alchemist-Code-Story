001	Here we come! Charge!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0015
002	Be gone!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
003	Grrrraaarrrggghhh! Aaaaaarrrrrrrrggggghhhhhh!
004	Third time's the charm!
005	Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
006	Hrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaagggggggggggghhhhhh!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0007
007	Ngh... Hrrrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhh!
008	This is it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0032
009	Kiraboshi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0004
010	Nnnnnnnnnnrrrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
011	Hrrrrrgggghhhh?!
012	Sumeragi! Drink of my blood, and give me strength!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
013	Drink deep! Fill me with demonic power!
014	Grrrraaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!
015	This is your end!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0011
016	Huzzzzzaaaaaaahhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
017	Gwaaaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!
018	Haaaaa...haaaaa... Haaaaa.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
019	Nnngh!
020	D-did we win?! Did we really w-win?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
021	Haha! Finally!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
022	Haaa...haaaa... Sumeragi's power has been exhausted! I don't think I can...!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
023	...
024	L-Lady Kagura?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
025	It's not over yet.
026	Huh?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
027	It's not over.
028	What do...?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0027
029	Hmmmmmmmm...
030	Aaaarrrrrrrgggghhhh?!
031	Grrrraaaaaaarrrrrggggghhh?!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0025
032	Yomi!
033	Fortuitous! Most fortuitous!
034	W-why...?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0020
035	Sublime! Perfection!
036	There is no need to be disheartened. You did kill me...once.
037	However... However.
038	I am an accumulation of corruption.
039	As I am sure you are well aware, the Mikaboshi amplifies corruption.
040	So long as corruption fills me, I will be resurrected; over and over, and over again.
041	That is all. It is a simple matter.
042	N-no...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
043	The Mikaboshi is mine. You cannot touch it.
044	Then how...?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0021
045	The moment I was made manifest in this world, you had already lost.
046	It was an immense delight to watch you all working so hard, ignorant of the futility of your actions.
047	Truly splendid.
048	Ngh!
049	Well, it is time for me to release the corruption from this statue, and make myself some friends.
050	W-wait!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
051	Aaaarrrrrgggghhh!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0022
052	Nnnnrrgggghhh!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0012
053	Ngh...aaarrrrrggghhhh!	VO_ren.ren_battle_0025
054	Ahhh.
055	I suppose I should dispose of you first.
056	Ah!
057	There is such a difference in power between us. You cannot possibly hope to bridge that gap. You are all too tired to do anything at all.
058	Nonetheless, you must be taken care of. Oh, woe is me.
059	Nnngghhh... Aarrrgghhh... Aaaarrrrrggghhh...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
060	Die!
061	A difference in power?
062	That's stupid! Power isn't what decides a battle!
063	The one with greater willpower wins in the end!
064	Ah! B-B-B...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
065	Bud?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
066	Huuuuzzzzzzaaaaahhhhhh!
067	Who is this now?
068	Me? I'm Bud Crowley, knight of the Blue Flame Guard of Envylia!
069	Bud!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
070	Hey!
071	H-how did you even get here?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
072	Ever heard of boats?
073	What?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0006
074	I took a boat!
075	No, no, no, no, no!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1002
076	I had to! I made a promise!
077	A...promise?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
078	I promised to protect you!
079	Oh...!
080	I listened to you, and I thought about everything you said...
081	But in the end, the only thing I really understood was that Wadatsumi is a crazy dangerous place!
082	W-were you even listening?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0020
083	I was worried about you being all alone in a dangerous place like this!
084	I couldn't stand around waiting!
085	Ngh!
086	So, I'm gonna borrow this neat sword I found!
087	Th-that's Sumeragi! Yomi must have dropped it!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
088	It is? Perfect!
089	Only those of the Kagomurasaki line can wield its true power! It won't work for you!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0039
090	Please, just run!
091	If you have conviction, there's no need to run, right?
092	Wh-what are you...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
093	You'd put your life on the line for the destiny of the royal family, right? Well, I'm gonna put my life on the line to protect you!
094	Wha—?! Wh-what are you saying?! You only have one life, you fool!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
095	Yep, but I'm gonna risk that life of mine for the sake of all those who have died!
096	Ah!
097	That's why you're not running, right? Well, I'm not going anywhere, either!
098	Y-you...!
099	Huzzzzzahhhhh!
100	Surely even you cannot be so dim as to fail to realize that you have no hope of winning here!
101	Even if I can't win, I will protect her!
102	Ah!
103	Huzzzzzahhhhh!
104	Indeed. A loyal mutt you may be, but you are all bark and no bite.
105	Nnrrggghh?!
106	S-Sumeragi...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
107	It b-b-b... It broke?!
108	A blunt thing like that could not hope to withstand true, divine demonic power.
109	Urrgghhh!
110	Now, little mutt... It is time for you to play dead.
111	Bud!
112	Oh, dear. Are you feeling a little cornered?
113	Come, Mikaboshi. Unleash the corruption from this statue upon the world!
114	Once you do, demons will rule supreme!
115	N-no...! We can't let this happen!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
116	Oh, but it will. Soon, Demon's Blood will spread like wildfire throughout the world, infecting every living being and turning them into demons!
117	Ahhh, this air is so refreshing.
118	The Discarnate Power is...m-multiplying!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
119	I believe you call it a pantheon? With this corruption, we could easily create our own.
120	For now, we number but one hundred. Perhaps, for a time, we will roam the continent as a horde of demons.
121	Heeheehee.
122	Ngh...
123	Oh, Yomi. You are looking quite black and blue...and red.
124	...
125	This is the end of Wadatsumi. The show—splendid as it has been—is done.
126	N-not...y-yet.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
127	Now, Yomi, it is pointless to struggle.
128	W-Wadatsumi isn't...finished...yet.	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0020
129	I...have a p-promise...to keep.
130	I am afraid you shall live to see them broken... Both Wadatsumi, and your little promise, that is.
131	I'm s-still...	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
132	Alive.
133	That is easily rectified!
134	He was so good at spinning tops.
135	Memories are flashing before my eyes...
136	Spinning around and around inside my mind...
137	Like a merry-go-round.
