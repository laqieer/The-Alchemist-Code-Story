001	(Such darkness, such quiet, such warmth... This bed is wasted on me.)
002	(As comfortable as it is, the lingering memory of the battlefield wakes me, as ever. I never sleep for long.)
003	...Zzz...
004	Just the slightest breeze snatches me from the jaws of sleep.	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0007
005	...
006	Mm?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
007	(Too dark... Too quiet... Too cold.)
008	(The blizzard that was blowing outside has subsided, but even so, it's unnaturally quiet and not even the faintest ray of dawn lights the darkness.)	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0016
009	...?!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
010	(The village sprawling beyond the palace is gone. There's no sign of any people. Even the sweet scent that lingered in the village is no more.)
011	(Blanketed beneath the fresh snow is only dilapidated homes, and...)
012	Where are the high elves? The people? The dark elves...? Letitia... There's nobody to be seen, anywhere...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0006
013	What's happened?
014	Why are there only insectoid husks where once there were people?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0020
015	(All these bug carcasses laying about...)
016	What...did I see?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
017	(There was nobody to be found anywhere in the palace and those dead bugs littered about...)
018	Who...did I meet...?
019	How has your journey home to the village been?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0007
020	We heard you assisted our dear daughter.	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0003
021	What did I eat? Where did I sleep?	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_battle_0019
022	A feast so fragrant you can taste it, so beautiful the sight of it fills you up! Such luxury!	VO_ainanna.ainanna_sys_0008
023	Silently... Just like all the rest...
024	(That bleak, silent landscape that reminded me of my nightmare... I didn't want to believe it.)
025	(It's almost as though there were never...)
026	(Never any people at all to begin with.)
027	The Beds of Ice...
028	The Beds of Ice below the royal palace have protected the stability of the village for time immemorial.
029	For Fairgreen, its completion was an important historical crossroads.
030	"In particular, without ********** *** *** ** ******* ****** **** *****, only the infliction of ******* ******* can allow for * ****** ***** **** *********..."
031	Fairgreen became a clean country, purged of corruption.
032	Beneath the palace!	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0018
033	This...is...
034	(A vast plane of darkness.)
035	(A wall of ice spanning the four cardinal points to encase the basement creates a glass-like case, chilling and muting the air.)
036	No... This... This is...	VO_vier_vier-b.vier_sys_0027
037	The Beds...of Ice...
038	(Countless rows of beds.)
039	(Within them sleep an innumerable number of high elves.)
