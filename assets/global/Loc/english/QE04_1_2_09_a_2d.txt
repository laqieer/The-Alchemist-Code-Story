001	The old man told me about this...but I didn't think it was this strained.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0016
002	... ...
003	Is that why you avoided me as well, Tina? Like they did...	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
004	Don't put me in the same boat as them! I would never abandon someone who was under attack!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
005	I know that, but...do you also feel you couldn't get along with people from other factions?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
006	Well...	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
007	For example, I'm not from the Voda faction, right? You could say that I'm from the Lustburg faction.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
008	But still...we've been able to work together this far, right?
009	That's because it's you and me. If you think about it from the perspective of one who governs...	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
010	How is it different?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
011	What do you mean...?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
012	I think what Liz said is the truth. Even if we come from different factions or beliefs, we can still get along.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0016
013	Ultimately, we are all living in Saga. I'm sure we could all see eye-to-eye.
014	I don't think...you're in a position to make claims like that.	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
015	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
016	Are you talking about Fuu? It's true that my tribe belongs to the Fuu faction...I feel that responsibility heavily.	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
017	But...that's another reason why I want to destroy the boundaries that separate our factions.
018	Do you want to do that? Why?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
019	I'll tell you all about it in time. It's the reason why I couldn't say anything in response to your words.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
020	I'm sure you know how pointless all of this conflict is.
021	...!
022	I'm certain that our biggest enemy is the prejudice that is deeply rooted in the hearts of all our people.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0030
023	As long as that remains, even if we were to resurrect the wind Matter, I doubt we'd be able to restore peace.
