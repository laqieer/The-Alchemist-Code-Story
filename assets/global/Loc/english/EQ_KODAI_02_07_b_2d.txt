001	Huzzzaaahhh!	VO_schmeier_transform.schmeier_transform_battle_0003
002	Esai…! You're going too far!
003	I know, but I have to…	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
004	…! Oh no!
005	The gunfire just crumbled the pillars of this underground cavern...!
006	How do we get out…?	VO_schmeier_transform.schmeier_transform_battle_0001
007	…
008	…
009	…
010	…
011	Now there is no escape to the surface for you. But…	VO_schmeier_transform.schmeier_transform_battle_0019
012	The weight of the Dragon Realm cannot bring me down, as I see it!
013	If I forcibly open a hole up above…!	VO_schmeier_transform.schmeier_transform_battle_0028_a
014	Owwwww….!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0043
015	Stay calm, Schmeier. I need to put this ointment on you.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
016	A savior! I'm the savior, alright? Ow! Please do it more gently…
017	Alright, there you go...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
018	Making a hole for an escape plan like that… That is certainly an achievement for a dragon…
019	"It's been a while since I've used all my power at once, so I have muscle pain." Doesn't that sound pathetic?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0030
020	Well, but… For the last hundred years I've dedicated myself to research…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0011
021	His name was Esai, correct? He'll probably return.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
022	Most likely.
023	Things might not be as lucky for us next time.
024	Of course.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
025	Then why are you so carefree?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
026	Well, we'll be prepared when the time comes. Though I'm glad to have some reliable allies around me.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0008
027	Ouch…!
028	Aedith, the injury on your belly still hurts?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0001
029	Yeah… But I won't give out with just this. It'll take more than this to kill me.
030	But will we really receive help from that dragon? Schmeier, wasn't it?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0016
031	Yeah, as Ignacio betrayed her.
032	For us, we have no choice but to rely on her.
033	If you can improve the city with dragon technology, then why not have that?
034	I love the city…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0031
035	But if there isn't change, we won't survive. That's just how the world is right now.
036	Aedith… If that's what you say…	VO_karne.karne_sys_0037
037	It's late. Brush your teeth before going to bed. Also, don't call me Aedith at home. Call me Father, alright?
038	Y-yes… Good night. Father.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
039	A father that teaches his daugher to kill… How cruel…
040	But we, the helpless people, have to do this to survive.
041	To betray or become betrayed… Terrible positions either way, but the strongest will survive.
042	But…
043	That Yishai Ignacio… Why did he miss my vital organs?
044	Shahel, you're back.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0005
045	Yes. Fifty have been rolled out.
046	Is that all that is necessary?	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0031
047	What do you mean?
048	About Schmeier. It was thought that we could retrieve her if we had used our full force.	VO_chahele.chahele_sys_0004
049	There's no point to that.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0004
050	Schmeier, like Ophioneus is leading towards the life of a Cursed Dragon.	VO_esai.esai_sys_0002
051	For that reason, despair was the path…
052	Schmeier is a wonderful person. She is merciful and kind to all. So losing her will spread despair further…
053	The people of the Sloth Layer will become the sacrifice…	VO_esai.esai_sys_0010
054	Understood…
055	It seems that there isn't much time left for the impending human filth in this layer. Ophioneus…	VO_esai.esai_sys_0030
