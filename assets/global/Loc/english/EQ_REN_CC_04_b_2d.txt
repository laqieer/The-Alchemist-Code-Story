001	...
002	You heard me. Come at me like this is life or death.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
003	What...the...?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
004	Bubbles...?
005	Let's talk, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
006	Natsume...
007	To be honest, I don't remember what we talked about.
008	We just talked like we always did, about nothing in particular.
009	But we both were smiling.
010	That I remember vividly.
011	My sister blew bubbles for me. I don't know how long it had been...
012	But I blew some too.
013	They danced in sky, disappearing one by one.
014	Something like this isn't so bad every now and again.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
015	Why are you doing this with me today?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
016	I don't know. I figured it's good to make sure sometimes.
017	Make sure of what?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
018	Of where we belong.
019	Where we belong?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
020	...
021	Say what you will. I choose to lead the Shiba Senko in a way that I wouldn't be ashamed of.
022	No matter how many lives I have to take.	VO_reimay.reimay_battle_0020
023	Humans really live the best lives they can, don't they?
024	That seems like an ironic thing for an assassin to say.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0011
025	It's exactly why I can say it. The moment a person dies you can feel them release everything they once held within themselves.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
026	Even with just a slash of a blade, you can feel it. The stronger they feel, the more vivid the feeling.
027	Even if they're a clumsy fool.
028	Is everything okay? Did you eat something weird or something?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
029	Hmm, nothing that you haven't eaten.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0031
030	I was joking.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
031	Do you know why I have this blade?
032	To kill?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
033	Yes, to kill. I believe there's something that lies beyond the moment of death. After killing or being killed.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
034	Seriously, did you eat something weird?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
035	How rude.
036	What are you trying to say?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
037	The Black Star doesn't need you, Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
038	...What?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
039	This is not where you belong.
040	H-hey, don't joke like that! I'm your brother! I'm a Black Star...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0043
041	You will never beat me. And you'll never truly accept being a Black Star. Do you really think they need someone like you?	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0006
042	...!
043	The bubbles are pretty, aren't they?
044	Drifting so lightly on the breeze... It seems like they could go anywhere they wanted to. Just like you.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
045	I don't get it! I don't want to go anywhere!
046	I'm nothing like them... If anything, you...	VO_ren.ren_battle_0022
047	I what?
048	...
049	If I went away, what would happen to you if something happened?! The Black Star line would end...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
050	That's against your code, isn't it?! The Black Star needs me!
051	I've been thinking. The code shouldn't be continued based on blood. It should be ability.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0005
052	You've misunderstood me. The place you belong isn't necessarily where you're needed. You'll understand someday.
053	I don't get it! I don't want to get it!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0029
054	It's hard to understand. The code. Why we live. Why we fight.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
055	What lies beyond the moment of killing. You don't belong here if you can't understand.
056	But...	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
057	It's because you couldn't face all of this. You should...go somewhere before you hold the Black Star back.
058	Until you understand what waits beyond death.
059	I couldn't...face it?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
060	Yes.
061	What would that change? Does understanding change anything? It doesn't, does it?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
062	Then why does it matter if I face things or not?! What...does it matter...
063	...
064	You'll find somewhere you belong. Somewhere that isn't here.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0030
065	...
066	Gather your things.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
067	...
068	After Natsume left, the last bubble, floating on the breeze—
069	Popped.
070	At the time, I had no idea what my sister was thinking.
071	And so I left, hoping that one day I would.
072	You don't have to go out of your way to see me off.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
073	I'm your sister. I want to see my cute little Ren start his journey.
074	Did you eat something weird or something?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
075	How rude.	VO_natsume.natsume_battle_0019
076	...
077	...
078	I guess I should get going.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
079	Yes.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0004
080	Bye, Natsume.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
081	...Ren.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0001
082	Yeah?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
083	Live a long life.	VO_natsume.natsume_sys_0007
084	...!
085	I remember thinking...
086	About how much my sister would do to protect me.
087	About how she was the same as always. About how thankful I was. About how terrible she was at lying.
088	But I still didn't know what was going on in her head.
089	I hope that one day I can tell my sister that I understand the words she said to me that day.
090	That's why I began my journey.
091	Lady Natsume?! Lady Natsume, wake up! Someone... Someone call the doctor!
092	...
093	Maybe if I could have faced it all, things would be different.
094	Not that it helps to think about it now.
095	Is there really a place for someone like me to belong? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn't sure.
096	But I still kept my eye out for a place like that, because my sister had wanted me to. I hoped it would bring her peace.
097	I hated the weak. They died too fast, like those bubbles.
098	I looked for someone strong. Someone like my sister, someone who could give me the same sense of security she had.
099	I thought that if I did, that would be enough.
100	I killed and killed and killed and killed.
101	No matter how much I killed, I still didn't understand what was beyond it.
102	But...
103	Think about it. Taking lives, living hidden in the shadows...or saving lives, surrounded by happiness.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0001
104	I think the latter would be much more fun. Don't you think so?
105	I felt like I'd found it. A place among the strong.
106	Not just the physically strong, but those with strong hearts.
107	I didn't understand it at first, but little by little, I came to.
108	They were fighting to protect others.
109	And they were willing to die for it.
110	That's my justice, my...legacy. An...iron will...that will never...be broken.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
111	Ren... I'm not dying...for the therians. I'm...dying for me...the way I choose... My iron...will...leading me to a...glorious, blazing...end...and turning...to steel.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
112	Tell everyone...what I said! Nina... You...will inherit my legacy!
113	The best kind of outrageous.
114	Thanks to them, I feel like I've begun to understand.
115	Understand the things my sister told me.
116	About what was beyond killing and beyond death.
