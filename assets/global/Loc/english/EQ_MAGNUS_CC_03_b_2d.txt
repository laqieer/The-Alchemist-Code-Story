001	Hey! W-Will! Put me down!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0026
002	Hell, you're light as a feather! Don't you eat?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
003	Of course I do! I consume a nutritionally balanced diet for long-lasting energy and good health!
004	Geez... Don't you ever do anything for fun? Or enjoyment? Eat somethin' tasty once in a while! It won't kill you.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0030
005	I don't care about fun! Especially not right now...	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
006	Is that really all you've got? You'll never hit the target like that.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
007	Ngh... It's not fair! How can a good-for-nothing lazybones like you be so strong?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
008	Ouch.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0025
009	Ryui, your powers of Alchemy just aren't a match for mine. But don't feel bad; I am, after all, a genius.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0023
010	Heh. You're just about the only person who can say that and it not be an exaggeration.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
011	Listen, Ryui. You're going up against the Alchemy nut who only joined the Holy Guard to research Alchemy.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0003
012	In other words, he's in his element. This is what he wants to do. This is what he enjoys doing. That's what makes him so strong.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
013	So, what about you? What do you want to do?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
014	Right now, I want to win.
015	That's not what I mean and you know it.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0001
016	I don't know... What do you want to do, then?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
017	Me? My whole purpose in life is to show up that Alchemy nut.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0024
018	What?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
019	The point is, you're not alone in this.
020	I mean, it's not like you're using me to beat Magnus. We're working on this together, right? We're a team.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
021	So, c'mon. Let's go again.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
022	R-right!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0037
023	Enough!
024	Nice one! Turns out even that Alchemy nut doesn't stand a chance against the two of us.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
025	Did I really win?
026	Guess so. A little hard work can go a long way, huh?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0007
027	...
028	You should be proud, Magnus. This is what you wanted, isn't it? Now no one will dare target her overtly.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
029	I have no idea what you're talking about.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
030	What's the point in playing dumb when you're the one who asked me to arrange this battle in the first place?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
031	You've made enemies in the past, when you've swindled people with your little games. Of course, that's not a problem for someone of your caliber...
032	But if they were to use her to get to you... Now, that would be a problem, wouldn't it? On top of that, she hasn't exactly been making friends, herself.
033	Well, she's honest to a fault, isn't she? It's a bit of a double-edged sword.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
034	Add to that her flagging results during the mock battle on her first day...and you found yourself faced with a situation that, as her mentor, you had to rectify.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
035	You might show an utter lack of dedication to your work, but when it comes to Alchemy, you're as talented as they come, and everyone knows it.
036	So when Ryui beats you in a head-to-head contest, mock battle or not, people are going to take notice. In other words, you just proved once and for all that she's a worthy paladin.
037	All in all, I'd say that gambit was a huge success. What do you think, Ryui?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
038	I...!
039	You're still here, are you? I thought you went back to the barracks.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
040	Eavesdropping, were we?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0002
041	I-I... I just wanted to tell you a few things before I left!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
042	Firstly, never forget that that gambling tournament was unequivocally your fault!
043	I hope the two of you will learn something from this and start taking your work seriously. People's hard-earned taxes shouldn't be funding your gambling habits!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0016
044	You heard the lady. Get to work.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
045	Ha-ha, Will. And...okay, Ryui. We've already said we're sorry. What more do you want from us?
046	Well... Secondly, it would seem that while you were the ones who got me into this mess, you're also the ones who got me out of it.
047	Hey, you beat me. Nothing can change that.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
048	Will, the other day, you asked me what I wanted to do with my life.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
049	I did. Never got an answer, though.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0037
050	Well, you're getting one now. I want to continue working with the two of you. And thanks to the outcome of that mock battle, I'll be able to do just that.
051	It was no big deal. Besides, you helped us first. Not that I was glad to do all that work, but still.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0010
052	Thank you, Magnus. And you, Will. Captain Kaya, I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0008
