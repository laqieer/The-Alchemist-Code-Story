001	Huzzah!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0011
002	...
003	I should have known fighting a professional gladiator in her own domain would be a futile attempt.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
004	So you say, but your sword work is very refined. I can tell you have honed your skills with much practice.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
005	Urk!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
006	You aren't taking this fight seriously, are you? It seems like it doesn't matter to you whether you win or lose.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
007	Well...
008	I do not know what your aim is, nor do I care to ask, but...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
009	I do have my pride as the apex combatant of this Arena.
010	I will force you to fight with all that you have!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0004
011	Wha—?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
012	Urgh!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0042
013	I take it that the sword is not your preferred weapon. That much is obvious.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0045
014	What are you most skilled with? The spear? A bow? An axe or a scythe? Firearms, perhaps? What about the magical arts?
015	There is no need to hold back. Come at me with everything you have!
016	I will prove this Arena Champion can handle whatever you can throw!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0032
017	Ngh!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0042
018	(Her strikes are so precise! She's even throwing in feints!)
019	I'm impressed by how well you can keep up with me! Then, why don't you try this on for size?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
020	Uh-oh!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
021	I've got you now!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
022	(I won't be able to parry in time! She might actually kill me!)
023	What was—?!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
024	No, what have I done?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
025	You just—?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0010
026	I yield.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
027	Your power in that instant, was that—?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
028	I am uncertain what you are referring to.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
029	Why did you let me win?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
030	That was not my intention. Well, it was in the beginning, but you have genuinely defeated me.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
031	I was quite confident in my skill, but I now see that I am no match for an Arena Champion.
032	...
033	I thank you for this wonderful opportunity.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0011
034	Hmm.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
035	Is everything okay, sir?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
036	That fight, what do you make of it?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0003
037	I could not make out all the details of it, but I believe he was using a power related to Alchemy, sir.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0002
038	You are not wrong. That is called "Spiritbonding", an art that has been lost over time. Only the Sephira retain its secrets now.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
039	Shall we detain him and inquire about his origins?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0031
040	That is unnecessary. There is no need to make a scene. His people are not the type to bring disorder to the world.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0039
041	However, it is a rare sight to see a Sephira out of their village. I hope this is not a bad omen for things to come.
042	That was so close, Kamui! It looked like you could've won!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
043	No, it is impossible for me to win against her with a sword.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
044	Really?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
045	Yes. She is a natural-born warrior. It requires dedication and an incredible amount of training to become so accomplished.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
046	There aren't many fighters as skilled as she is. She may even be equal to Isidore, if not stronger.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
047	Isidore? Who's that? A friend of yours, Kamui?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
048	...
049	What's wrong?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
050	How long do you intend to name me with such familiarity? We're far enough from the Arena now. There's no need to pretend to be brothers.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
051	Oh...but...I'm starting to get used to it.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0011
052	Hisham... If you get used to this, it'll hinder your drive to find your true family.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
053	You may think nothing of it at first. I'm sure you believe you won't change your mind and that your heart will be strong...
054	Until the day it leads you to forsake your quest.
055	Forsake my...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
056	You want to reclaim your memory and find your family, correct?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
057	Yeah.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
058	That desire may be strong now. You may believe it will always be strong, but that is not the case.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
059	The more you allow yourself to compromise and settle, your priorities will gradually shift.
060	Soon, you will find that you no longer wish to venture out to find them.
061	There is still hope that you have a home and family to return to. So do not allow yourself to give up yet.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
062	But doesn't that seem...lonely?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0017
063	That is what it means to remain dedicated to something. Can you do it?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
064	I'll... try.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
065	Hm? I don't really understand this conversation. What are you two discussing?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
066	Wha—?! M-Miss Teona?! The Arena Champion?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0028
067	What are you doing here?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
068	Oh, are you finished? Then I have something to discuss, myself. Ahem.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
069	Allow me to introduce myself properly now, as we didn't have a chance to speak before our match. It is only polite to do so before a rematch.
070	What did you just say?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
071	A rematch! Now that we know each other better!	VO_theona.theona_battle_0010
