001	Ngh... There're so many...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0022
002	You may be the eldest daughter of this family, but you're still inexperienced. The Summons of your Battalion are still too few and frail.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
003	You have no chance of winning. Just hand over Alma now! If you do, we won't speak of your treason.
004	Haa...haa... Th-those guys are after me, so...don't push yourself, Rebecca. It's okay.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0019
005	Let's just do what they say. I'll find a way to escape without your help, eventually.
006	Y-you fool! Are you...? Are you telling me to abandon my friend?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
007	Rebecca... Haha. Yeah, you really... You've always been the meddling type.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
008	You're always looking after someone. This time, you're trying to watch over the whole country.
009	That meddling... Who is it for? For the sake of the Helkovara? For this lot?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
010	At first...it was for my family.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
011	Becoming class chairperson, watching over those studying around me... I thought it was all a given for a member of the Helkovara family.
012	Yet seeing how this group conducts themselves... It's clear to me now.
013	Now I see that, just as they were in the past, my family is power mad. So even... Even if I become queen...
014	Even if I, Rebecca Helkovara Lustburg, take the throne, I refuse to do so as a pawn for my family!
015	I don't want to be a self-centered ruler who constantly belittles others!
016	Isn't a queen who lives to serve others the ideal?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
017	Who do you think you are, spouting all that idealistic drivel?! You don't have what it takes to rule over people! Take a step out into the real world before you start mouthing off!
018	Living to serve only others? Who ever said that?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0040
019	What...?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0020
020	You used your incredible power to help another?	VO_mervi.mervi_sys_0025
021	It may have been for myself as well. After all, I wouldn't want someone I love to become an insect.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_event_1002
022	I've come this far to do this for myself and with the hope that I am helping others as well!
023	I want to do this for myself as much as for anyone else! I want to make this country better!
024	However, I can fight on, knowing that it will benefit others, too! Like Queen Venus, Melvy...and just like Liz!
025	What do you think you can do with what little power you have left, big mouth? Don't make me laugh.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0010
026	You said it yourself, if I'm not mistaken; that if you cast Alma's magic on Battalion, they'll become an unstoppable force!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
027	Gah! There's no way! She can do that even in this condition?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
028	Let's go, Alma!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
029	S-seriously?! After training with Melvy, and the fight against this lot before that, I've got no magical power left, you know?!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0025
030	Oh no... Wh-what about physical strength?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0020
031	You're kidding, right?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1010
032	Hmph. You two are as oblivious as ever. If you need magical power, there's some right here.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
033	What?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
034	I'm filled with Lisbeth's power right now. Honestly, it's a pretty gross feeling, so just hurry up and use it. I can't stand it much longer.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
035	Is that really okay? I mean, you finally have magical power in you now. It's your one chance to be able to defeat a witch.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0001
036	I'm not about to fight with borrowed power. I said it, didn't I? I'm fighting to have our existence recognized.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0030
037	What kind of idiot would proudly show off his hand-me-downs?
038	But...what if taking that energy kills you?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0001
039	Like I'm going to die that easily! Well... I can't say I'd have no regrets.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
040	I mean, I know this isn't a power I got for myself, and it's not something I feel I can use, but if I stayed like this, I would have a lot more job opportunities...	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0031
041	Job opportunities...?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
042	The way us men earn money to survive is by making incantation gear and selling it to foreign countries.	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0004
043	In particular, there's a curious merchant from Saga who always comes to buy things. For those of us who can't use magic, incantation items give us a way to surpass witches.
044	It's only science if it's carried out in the pursuit of that which is not inherent to me. I can't make good incantation goods when I'm bursting with this magic power.
045	Besides, people will always take a mile if you give them an inch.
046	Y-you...
047	The more I use Alchemy...the more I realize how powerful it is. It scares me, yet makes me feel like I'm capable of doing anything with this power.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0003
048	Gradually...I've begun to feel the weakness of my body as a nuisance.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
049	(That's right! This culture of female dominance is something that Alma's grandmother established all on her own.)
050	(To the other witches, it must have been such a sudden gift.)
051	(If you give people an inch, they'll take a mile.)
052	(If people are just given things, then they'll grow impudent and the situation will dissolve into fighting.)
053	(But...how do we keep the balance, then?)
054	Just hurry up and use it! I don't need pity from you!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0001
055	I'll get stronger on my own and I'll surpass you witches!	VO_salomo.salomo_sys_0010
056	I will get stronger on my own!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
057	Then, don't hesitate!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
058	Salomo's magic will flow that way, so aim it toward Battalion! Rebecca? Are you listening?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0041
059	Huh? Oh, right... Yes! I understand! This brings back memories...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
060	Memories of when Battalion were running wild before and Liz shared her power with me...
061	Oh yeah, that happened, didn't it?	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
062	(At that time, I didn't really intend to borrow even more power from Liz.)
063	(She's my rival, so I don't like being in debt to her.)
064	(From then on, I haven't been able to tear my eyes away from her.)
065	We have Liz, and because that girl can only see what is in front of her, we were able to reach our goal without getting lost along the way.
066	That's it. That's what Melvy and them were missing. Even now, Liz's power is supporting us!
067	I can't become stronger on my own...so we have to all live and become stronger together!
068	I felt stronger when I was on my own, but...
069	That's right, everything you have was given to you by the Helkovara family!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0029
070	Now is the time to repay that debt! Do you not understand that?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0001
071	No, not everything! I've had best friends beside me to support me, walk with me, and help me toward my goals!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0039
072	One day, after she's grown up some more, she'll come back! So I will create a safe, warm country for her to come home to!
073	For that, we all need to get stronger together and support each other!
074	Even if I'm not as independent as Queen Venus, I will become the ruler that she wasn't able to!
075	That is the Rebecca Helkovara Lustburg that I am to be!
076	You... Rebecca! Would you really cross your family...your mother...like that?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0022
077	No. Someday, I will support you and the Helkovara as a whole.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0039
078	S-support us?!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
079	That's right. I want us to see eye to eye and to support each other.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0004
080	I want to become that kind of queen! So let me watch over you!
081	Stupid rookie, prattling on and on... Fine. If you want to take care of us, then first I'll have you show me your true strength!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0025
