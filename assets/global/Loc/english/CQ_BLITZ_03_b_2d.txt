001	...
002	...
003	By a slim margin...you have failed.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0030
004	What?! No way! That's so harsh!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0016
005	There is room for improvement; however, I would advise that you first contend with the hesitation that hinders your fists.
006	Ugh...	VO_blits.blits_sys_0022
007	Will you wield them as a knight of the Envylian Guard, or for yourself, as an individual?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0031
008	The former option will allow you to save far more people, but at the cost of sacrificing the few for the sake of the many.
009	The latter, meanwhile, will mean that you can only protect those who lie within your reach, but will enable you to unreservedly reach out to those who you dearly wish to save.
010	Which of these two choices does your heart desire?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0003
011	I... I want to protect the smiles that I see before me.	VO_blits.blits_battle_1014
012	Protecting more people would be a good thing, but if I have to sacrifice others to do it... That just isn't something I think I could handle.
013	Hmph. I see... What I tell you next amounts to no more or less than the ramblings of one who is affiliated with such an organization, but I hope that you will listen, regardless.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0031
014	The larger an organization grows, the more susceptible it is to losing its original purpose.
015	Those who supposedly aspire to justice fall instead to greed; compelled to serve their own interests, they forge petty plots to sabotage others.
016	Is that why there are plots against you—why I ended up in here?	VO_blits.blits_sys_0025
017	Precisely. Such foolish conflict stands at the forefront of the countless problems caused by this lapse in attitude, serving only to bring about a delay in decision-making and action-taking.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0005
018	That's so dumb! I bet it sometimes ends up being too late.
019	Indeed. We have lost the opportunity to save those who would have been saved; though there will always be those who we simply could not have aided.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0004
020	I sought a reliable source of power that would allow me to protect as many people as possible, and so became an inquisitor. This has placed me in a position from which I can exorcise authority far greater than that of any single individual.
021	While I do not regret my decision, I do feel that what I do is...imperfect.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0017
022	Well, the more people there are, the more opinions you have, and the more likely it is that there will be differences between them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.	VO_blits.blits_sys_0031
023	Of course. There are merits and demerits to both of our choices.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0005
024	To put it another way, in order to save all the people of this world we require both organizations who can protect the many, and independent agents who can protect the few.
025	So then...everything I've been doing up till now... Do you think it's made a difference?
026	I do. That is why I have faith in you, that you will wield those thunderous fists with sincere devotion to others, and without being bound or restricted as I am.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0004
027	I've never thought about all this before, so I wasn't sure, but...I guess I haven't been doing the wrong thing after all, huh?	VO_blits.blits_sys_0009
028	In that case...I'm going to keep going! I'll save the people I see with my own two hands!
029	If you just do something about everyone else—everyone who's out of my reach—then we're all covered!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0023
030	I will...endeavor to meet your expectations.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0037
031	Everything has been taken care of, Lord Gilfred.
032	Excellent. Blitz, your case has now been processed, so it is time for you to go. Here are your personal effects.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0045
033	Really?! I can leave?!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0025
034	Of course. I had already set the processing for your mistaken arrest in motion before I came here.
035	Wow... Oh! I know! Here!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0045
036	What?	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0025
037	I was given this apple just before I was taken in. It was a reward for helping someone—I guess you could say they were in my jurisdiction. I want you to have it!
038	I will...graciously accept.	VO_gilford.gilford_sys_0007
039	Hahah! All right!	VO_blits.blits_sys_0023
040	The second I get out of here, I'm gonna work so hard to make people smile! After all, I can't afford to let Gilfred down!
