001	Oh. It's been a while since I've breathed this air. It feels good to be back in Slothstein!	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
002	Oh...Carol.	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1010
003	Hey, Hazel! I haven't seen you in a while. Have you gotten used to your job as a mercenary?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0009
004	Long time no see. Yeah. I just got back, actually. Have you been shopping? Looks like you're carrying a lot of bags.	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1020
005	Yes. I was buying tools for a spring cleaning. Vincent isn't going to be at the manor for a few days, so I thought I'd use this opportunity to make it spick and span.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0004
006	I see. It's rare for Vincent to be absent for so long. I'm proud of you for cleaning the house in the meantime.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0045
007	Hey! Don't pat my head like I'm a little girl. I'm always telling you not to.	VO_carol.carol_chara_1011
008	Anyway, thank you for holding my bags.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0029
009	Not at all. It's nothing. By the way, Carol, have you gotten used to your prosthetic leg?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0007
010	A long time ago! You ask me that every time we meet, Hazel.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0005
011	Do I? Maybe it's because I remember the day I carried you to Vincent's manor.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
012	Oh... Vincent told me about it. He said that he was the one who found me, but you were the one who carried me back.
013	But that was a long time ago! Look at me now. I can even go out to do the shopping and everything.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0010
014	Yeah. I'm really proud of you.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0008
015	Hey! There you go again!	VO_carol.carol_chara_1011
016	Heheh. Sorry.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0023
017	Seriously. Even Vincent doesn't treat me so childishly.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0030
018	You think so? Anyway, I'm sure that you're very important to Vincent as well, Carol.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0025
019	And you're very important to me too.	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1010
020	I know that. You're always so protective of me, Hazel... Thank you.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0007
021	You're welcome.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
022	(When Carol first came to Vincent's manor...she was trembling, in pain, and never stopped crying.)
023	(She was even scared of my prosthetic legs... All the more reason why I want to do everything I can so that Carol can keep smiling the way she is now.)
024	Huh? There seems to be some kind of commotion going on over there.	VO_carol.carol_sys_0031
025	You're right. I wonder what it is.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0006
026	Ru-run! A Guard Droid has gone rogue!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0028
027	A-a Guard Droid...gone rogue?! Oh dear...	VO_carol.carol_sys_0027
028	!
029	(I can't afford to let Carol see the rogue Guard Droid...I won't allow it!)
030	It's all right. I'll go stop it. Wait here with the bags. I'll be back right away!	VO_hazel.hazel_chara_1006
031	Hazel...?!	VO_carol.carol_chara_1004
