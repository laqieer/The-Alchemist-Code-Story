001	How did you know I would be here?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0002
002	Well, if you stayed in the center of the clock tower, you would've missed out on seeing the conclusion.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
003	I thought you would want to witness it all.
004	I see. Quite a nice view, isn't it?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0045
005	An old abandoned factory, huh? I agree. It's not a bad view.
006	I'm glad you like it.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0044
007	I'm sure my father—who met his demise here—is glad as well.
008	Your father died here?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
009	Yes...he died protecting me when I was an infant.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0004
010	What do you mean?
011	My father, Jonathan, was an engineer at this factory.
012	The weapons my father developed protect the country of Slothstein. When I was a child, I felt very proud.
013	So this is Slothstein's weapons plant factory, huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
014	Weapon development is a crucial department that can affect a country's military status. Your father must have been quite talented.
015	Yes...too talented—enough to be noticed for his development skills.
016	Indeed. A talented weapons developer is something that every country wants.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0006
017	How foolish. Every day, my father lived with the reality that the products he developed were used to take the lives of others.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0027
018	Of course, no matter how tempting an offer...my father continued to turn them down.
019	In the end, the men who showed up resorted to forceful measures.
020	Forceful measures?
021	Having grown frustrated with my father's lack of interest, they decided to abduct me. On a day that I had come to play in this factory, they suddenly appeared before me.
022	Realizing that something was wrong, my father rushed to my side. There was a conflict between him and these men...
023	...And it ended in tragedy.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
024	Ironically, the gun that took my father's life was one that he had developed.
025	...!
026	Ever since...whenever anything happens, I remember my father's words.
027	The mindset of the user can change even the most excellent products or useful machines into deadly weapons.
028	... ...
029	Don't you understand? In the end, the roots of this world revert back to the ugly emotions of man!
030	Everything is a result brought to fruition by man. Machines cannot sin! It is humans themselves that have corrupted this world with evil.
031	Let me ask you one question: are you Alvarez or the Messiah?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
032	It doesn't matter which I am. After all, you are about to be eradicated from this world.
