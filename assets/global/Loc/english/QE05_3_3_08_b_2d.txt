001	All right, I think that does it. It's over.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
002	...
003	What's wrong, Tina?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0005
004	I feel like they were somehow weaker than the ones that attacked Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
005	Really, now?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
006	Yeah. I can't put my finger on it, but I feel like the ones we fought in Saga multiplied a lot faster and pretty much decimated the area.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
007	Hmm... It might be that the desert has something to do with that.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
008	The sands in this area contain high levels of Alchemia, which is quite rare elsewhere.
009	On top of that, the climate here isn't really suitable for propagation—not for the Jam, and not for living things in general.
010	Then... Even if Ceclidis can control the Jam, they'll be ineffective so long as they're in the desert?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
011	It's highly possible. I wonder... Could we somehow lure them here?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
012	That's a problem for a later time. The Gluttony Foss army is moving on the desert as we speak.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
013	We need to meet up with the others and make sure that we are prepared for our counterattack.
