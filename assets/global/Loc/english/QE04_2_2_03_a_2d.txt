001	Gluttony and...Saga... Is that true?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0022
002	Both Narol—who was King of Gluttony at the time—and those of the Alize people had grown tired of the constant conflict between the two countries.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
003	When Beelzebub went berserk, the one who reached out to suppress that power...
004	...was none other than Alia's son, his successor as chief of the Alize people.
005	The reason why Gluttony was able to possess Beelzebub was because of the purifying power of Sephiron.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
006	Without it, they would not have been able to stifle the power of the Sacred Stone.
007	Its gluttonous force was a preemptive curse. If left alone, it would continue to eat away at the lifeblood of both countries, transforming them into deserts.	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
008	However, King Narol's secret alliance with the Alize people was the one saving grace.
009	Because they possessed the power of the wind?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
010	Indeed. Both King Narol and Alia's son eyed the possibility that, by using the purifying, circulatory power of the wind...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
011	They would be able to prevent the decaying of both lands.
012	Thus, they finally found a solution. By combining the power of the four Matters, they could seal Beelzebub in the Wind Temple.
013	This technique could serve to replace Sephiron's purifying power...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
014	They were able to prevent the decaying of the land?
015	Yes. This continued even after King Narol was assassinated and King Ceclidis' regime ascended to power in Gluttony Foss.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
016	Beelzebub continued to be managed in secret from within Saga.
017	I guess that's because, without the Wind Temple, Beelzebub could go berserk again.	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0044
018	However, Alia continued to hide this truth.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
019	This regardless of the fact that the rumors of Beelzebub being within Saga caused many to come in search of it.
020	Yes. Not even we knew about this. Alia continued to hide Beelzebub's existence.
021	If Alia was responsible for such a crucial role...how could he lose the power of the wind?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
022	You've, of course, heard about the Lion Monarch's Charge, haven't you?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
023	...The Lion Monarch's Charge!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
024	It was the greatest battle in this history of Babel that was brought about by Emperor Orion, the Mad King of Greed Dike. What about it?	VO_moca.moca_chara_1009
025	That war was caused by his search for the Sacred Stone. Do you think Saga, which possessed Beelzebub, was left unharmed?	VO_hoo.hoo_chara_1019
026	So Saga suffered damage during the Lion Monarch's Charge?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
027	Indeed. Both I and Voda witnessed this with our own eyes.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
028	It was terrible....the acts of those who called themselves the Veda Templars.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
029	The Veda Templars...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
030	They targeted the Matter instead of the Sacred Stone.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
031	They did this to overlap the four powers of Matter and manifest the upper layer of the Mystic Tower Veda, thus disrupting it.
032	Still, as a result, the Matter was protected...but at a significant cost.
033	Combining the powers of Matter provides one with a power comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.
034	They figured this out because the seal placed on Beelzebub was done so by the powers of Matter.
035	Thus, the Templar attacked Saga. However, at the time, the people of Saga could not comprehend why they were being attacked.
036	Right. The people of Saga didn't know that Beelzebub was located within Saga!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
037	Yes. The truth that only the Wind Sprite Alia and the Alize people knew about was discovered.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0037
038	What happened then?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
039	Because of the Lion Monarch's Charge...the fact that the Alize people were connected to Gluttony...that they were managing Beelzebub...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
040	All that the Wind Sprite Alia had been hiding...came to light.
041	Thus, people throughout all of Saga came to view Alia with distrust and even murderous intent.
042	But he did it to prevent Beelzebub from going berserk!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
043	Do you think that answer would satisfy every individual within our land? The truth remains that Saga suffered massive damage because of that.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
044	But...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
045	Thus, the Wind Sprite Alia was to be purged under the law for having placed Saga in danger.	VO_hoo.hoo_battle_0019
046	The law...
047	Yes. This much I am aware of. And you, Fuu boy...were the one who executed this purge.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
048	Alia was indeed purged...and his land fell into your hands.
049	The other tribes had no choice but to blindly listen.
050	After all, the people of Saga had never expected the balance of the Sprite Quartet to crumble.
051	... ...
052	Why that happened and what interactions you exchanged with Alia...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
053	It is time you told me about it now, Fuu.
