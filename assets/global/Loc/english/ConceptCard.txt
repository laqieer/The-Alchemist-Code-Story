TS_REV_20180526_VISION_001	I have a lute, but I'm still practicing! I hope I can master it before people start asking me to play.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_002	You think it's creepy that a spy would be into an idol? I'll give you a rose if you keep it a secret!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_003	You could say this hat is what makes me who I am! I wouldn't sell it at any price!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_004	I am the heroine of The Alchemist Code! Though lately, I think Kanon is stealing center stage.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_005	The loincloth thing wasn't my idea. They just...decided on it.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_006	I'm the only one who can prevent all status effects and inflict all status effects! I'm quite proud of my Ability!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_007	"Mendelssohn" is such an excessively long name!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_008	You think it's too bothersome to max out all my stats? Oh, come on, I can be fun to keep around!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_009	I don't have the personality to be a spy, but no one ever suspects me of it because I don't stand out.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_010	Will you train me if I get Enlightened?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_011	I'm sorry about the Divine Shelter incident, but I'm a victim, too! It was all the Director's fault!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_012	Yeah, being part of a bloodline that wields the power of mythical beasts definitely doesn't allow for a white-picket fence kind of life...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_013	I've been super busy since these high level quests began inflicting status effects on everybody!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_014	Everybody in the Handsome Summons event is strong, but maybe now that I get to take center stage...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_015	I wonder if learning Enchantments will help with my cooking.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_016	Cuteness is key, and I'm the cutest of them all!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_017	Lord Commander You-Know-Who took my Vision Weapon away.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_018	M-my hat doesn't define me, okay? Nor does this box!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_019	No, I do not stalk my sister! I just love her more than anybody else!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_020	I'm known as a lion too, you know? No? Have you not heard of my nickname?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_021	I'm doing my best every day to achieve the Max Flash Wind Speed!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_022	Do I not get an Enchantment yet?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_023	Even the developers are calling me "Dartanyan"! I do not approve!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_024	It's me, Blitz! I'm real! Catch me if you can!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_025	I sometimes get left and right mixed up. Sorry if I blast targets in the wrong direction.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_026	I've seen much improvement in my abilities after fighting Vettel.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_027	Asclepius was better? Ha, don't make me sew your mouth shut!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_028	Being a pirate was my thing until that giant loincloth guy stole my spotlight!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_029	Am I embarrassed? About what? Does this outfit look like underwear to you, or something?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_030	I demand respect. My name is Chao. If another person calls me "Chow Chow", I will snap.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_031	I have a name, you know. It's Fayrene, not "the one with the pipa".
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_032	I'm a smith, but I'm not really a smith. What?! I'm not who you're thinking, either!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_033	I may be poor, but I can still afford to devote my time to a pupil! Wanna know who it is? Then show some support, why don't ya?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_034	I'm usually a Summoner, but I'm cleaning house as a Geomancer in the Draft Matches!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_035	I am the Lion Monarch, Olion! I-I mean, Orion!!!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_036	Everybody underestimated me, but didn't I tell you all I'm amazing?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_037	I love the wind so much, and yet...Wind characters are my greatest weakness.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_038	I've been super busy inventing stuff! What did I miss? What is an Enchantment?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_039	Airship? Yeah, whatever. Can we talk about how awesome this baby is, though? (It's a canon.)
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_040	Yes, these toys talk. No, it's not ventriloquism.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_041	Am I creepy? I heard that people said I look creepy.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_042	I know I don't look like it, but I'm a hopeless romantic. Honest!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_043	For those of you who keep asking me to take my mask off... What you seek is in the illustration files.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_044	I'm too busy looking for my father! Do you really think I have the time to be in this story?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_045	That old perv... I don't care how popular he used to be, how did he get included in the Handsome Summons event?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_046	Vincent makes a mess faster than I can clean, so I'm thinking of hiring some help.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_047	So even cheese dogs were implemented in real life before I got enhanced?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_048	Come see me fight in the armored weapons contest! I'm sure they'll eventually put me in a match!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_049	Who am I, you ask? The greatest thief alive, of course!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_050	Justice will be served! Not on a platter or anything, though!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_051	I was meant to support Chat Noir, but nobody puts us in the same party.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_052	The darkness within whispers to me...that my Japanese voice actor is more popular than I am.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_053	I should be showing up in the story soon, so why not get yourself a Valkyrie before anybody else?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_054	I heard there's a demon out in town calling my name, so I'm gonna stay in for a while...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_055	Zofia, can't! Words! Dif...difficult? I did it? Hahahaha!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_056	Everybody seems to be wondering what Perez looks like. What if I told you I haven't seen his face either?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_057	Have you seen me in action yet? You can find me in the Arena!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_058	I'm a free spirit, but at least I have a job, unlike some people...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_059	This was a long while ago, but I used to dance around the Login Bonus screen!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_060	I'm the one everybody thinks is a girl at first glance.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_061	My favorite gamble? Seeing if I can successfully give my enemies status effects!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_062	Were you surprised to find out I don't get a job that uses blades? Me too.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_063	How many of you actually know me? Have any of you leveled me up to Enlightenment? Don't lie, okay?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_064	The faster a genie is, the more they're respected!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_065	Am I the only one that got a new scenario after the revamp? I am so lucky! Probably...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_066	I've heard that some people are concerned I might trip because of the chain on my ankle.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_067	(Ryle will provide a statement as soon as he shows up.)
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_068	Sometimes the story just writes itself. I just let the brush flow until I get carpal tunnel.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_069	I know I've been calling myself the Successor of the Sun, but there are too many sunny studs around here somehow.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_070	Has someone been using my cape?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_071	They told me I may be a candidate for the next loincloth skin.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_072	I get so dizzy when people spin me around a lot in the Character Skin screen.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_073	Here, on the Continent of Babel, even those of noble birth can learn to become a butler.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_074	I hate sloths, and I don't mean the animals.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_075	My leader skill and element almost seem specifically designed to support Ramses.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_076	Being summoned by humans is annoying enough, but knowing I exist in a game run by humans is truly aggravating.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_077	I know I'm a bit sloppy, but I do try to be fashionable! It would be easier if I had new clothes!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_078	Hey, so, what's the difference between a Sacred Knight and a Holy Cavalier?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_079	Have we met?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_080	My first exclusive gear is a Phantom of the Kill limited edition that isn't even a weapon?! Oh, c'mon!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_081	A special card that can help distract you from stark reality... It's just like my medicine.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_082	You know, people have complimented me on how beautiful my eyes are.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_083	I've been around from the beginning like Lambert, you know? Can't I get one of those Mementos, too?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_084	How come I don't get an Enchantment? Is this punishment for something?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_085	I grew up running around in the wild! Why is my speed stat so low?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_086	The loincloth isn't my default skin, okay?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_087	Am I really ranked lowest in communication ability? What about that Gyan kid?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_088	Kiki and Adele cried with me when we found out people had been calling me the "Merchant of Death".
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_089	They say I look like a certain yellow bird, but I can't run that fast.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_090	Alkemono and Nube became items. I think it's Surapero's turn.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_091	I am not one of the guardians! I'm a doctor!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_092	I'm hoping for a new look! Something that lets me show off my tail!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_093	Heh, did you appreciate the turn around time on my character (wink wink) skin?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_094	My Tigferes friends are Fons and Rivus! Nothing to do with Fung Liu!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_095	My name is Birgitta. Just Birgitta.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_096	Dear developers, please give me a character skin!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_097	I'm not the only one in the Unicorn Knight band, right?! Helloooooo?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_098	My matches are my most popular item...? Maybe I should quit barkeeping and go all in selling those instead.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_099	How to use...? Gyan confused.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_100	2nd Anniversary! I have surpassed all those 5-star characters and amassed the greatest power!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_101	Became a Phantom immediately after dying. Quite concerned about some internal matters.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_102	Look at me! I'm glowing! Glittering! Dazzling in the Draft Match too!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_103	If Lotiyah was around... Would I be exchanged?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_104	I refuse to show you anything but my back.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_105	My big bro doesn't come out of the Arena, so our teamwork potential is seriously wasted...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_106	I've read this many magical tomes! My heyday is nearly upon us!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_107	The opponent's Bloody Rose is more powerful than mine?! A-ahem, sorry about that...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_108	For a while, people would mistake me for Red Magnus, but I'm not red... all over...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_109	It's quite sad that the one job that allows me to carry a scythe is the one I am least suited for...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_110	I shine the brightest when I'm with the Shadow Messiah. Uh, the group, not the man!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_111	Nothing escapes my notice. My keen skills of detection make me Detective Glanz!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_112	Hello. I'm Dorothea. Not Isis!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_113	Thank you for improving my range! Just a little more, and...!!!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_114	There's a lot of curious people asking for a stone called "phosphorite"... Do you know anything about it?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_115	My dedication to cutting down wolves is what proved me worthy of Enchantments!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_116	I was the first Diviner, but the second, Fairily, stands out more than I do.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_117	I mean, I'm better with a gun, but it's not like I don't know how to stab people with a sword.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_118	I wanted a fancy vehicle, so I made it. Chicks will dig me with this ride.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_119	Seems like anyone released on January 1st is a teacher... How strange.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_120	The only thing I could beat my sister in was climbing trees. She always outshines me!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_121	The sun rises and sets on the same covenant once made... Apparently talking like this makes people think I'm poetic and deep.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_122	One wrong step and then everyone gets upset and wants to roast me on a skewer. The world is cruel.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_123	I got way more powerful after I made a big discovery!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_124	I'll tell you what I research day after day! Medicines and battle tactics, of course! I wanna be strong, too!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_125	Who are you calling the Unlucky 4-star? I promise you, I will make you regret it.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_126	A bunch of people have been saying "Polin's an angel!" recently. Yay!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_127	I've been popping up a lot recently, huh? Heheh, way to make an old man feel wanted!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_128	Seems like lots of people prefer the golden age version of me, but I've got more feminine looks, too.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_129	I feel like it wouldn't be too much effort for me to get into the Shadow Messiah.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_130	I'm the originator of Overclocking! Yet, it seems like the title of top Chronomancer is going to go to Rahu.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_131	I'm a court mage, though... People shouldn't expect me to tame wild animals, you know?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_132	You know, I've been thinking, I should, like, work on my speaking skills, instead of, like, my abilities.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_133	I'm training every day! Don't you think it's time to reward me with an Enchantment?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_134	What's the point in powering me up for battle? Just let me die. I'm used to it.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_135	What? I'm too nice to be real? I promise you I'm all genuine.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_136	My first showing here was weak due to the influence of an unlucky star, but I promise you that my luck has changed!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_137	Compared to when I first showed up, my strength and usability has improved, right? Right?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_138	I'm honored to have been the first proper elf here, but isn't it too early to release such a top-class high-elf..?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_139	Why don't you take a chance on Enchanting me? It'll rock your world.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_140	Huh? What's Phantom of the Kill? I definitely didn't host any Nico Live for it.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_141	Wait, is that my own face? Are those my eyes? Bigger than I thought!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_142	If I think about it, then during the event...with Mielikki... Heh.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_143	I love that there are three of us, not just me and Noah! Hope they get here soon!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_144	All of my jobs are very attack-based, but my constitution really isn't what it could be.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_145	Recently, there's been chatter that Yunagi is strong, but she's always been scary strong!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_146	The one who popularized charging up is me! Me and my special attack, Grand Cross!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_147	Hm, there's a lot of people who have complained that I ruined their lives...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_148	Excuse me?! I'm a boy! Isn't that obvious?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_149	I've been training a lot, but the number of tails and enchantments I have hasn't changed at all.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_150	Don't exorcise me! This is mochi, a sticky and stretchy rice cake, not my soul!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_151	Excuse me? You're complaining that I don't have a job which allows my family sword to be equipped? Just be patient!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_152	I wanna use some spirit medium techniques! Do I have to keep them secret, though?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_153	I'm a member of the Gyobu tanuki clan, but all my friends are foxes... Where are all my raccoon friends?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_154	I didn't mean to get so many voices of the night clamoring.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_155	A lot of people seem to take umbrage to how much of my armpits they can see...
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_156	Is it the lack of class changes that keeps me from increasing the number of tails I have...?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_157	The names of my brother and I are actually pressure points. Heh... Wanna try pressing them?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_158	My illustrations really show off my muscles. I wish my 3D avatar showed some of that.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_159	Tiger Tremor after charging up... I'm really sorry if you get caught up in it.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_160	It's not my fault, okay? Blame the people who decided to make the loincloth mighty!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_161	Everyone is always saying I look just like Suiran.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_162	Everyone is always saying I look just like Yunagi.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_163	I used to cry at night because I was afraid of the dark, but they said I had to be more manly. Don't tell Yomi!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_164	My name is Fujika. FujiKA. Not FujiTA. "Ka" and "Ta" are totally different!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_165	You're surprised by how powerful I am despite looking, ahem, "vaguely sickly"? It's all thanks to my Divine Shelter.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_166	The beast that I use as a weapon? No, it is not Tsuru, but that was a good try.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_167	Why do people call me a demon? It's because I'm just so cute, yet so strong! Heheh.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_168	Kunai, knives, lance... Huh...? Where'd my sword go?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_169	I have a suspicion that I may be the director and producer's favorite... I've been powered up several times.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_170	Can I be THE ALCHEMIST CODE's main protagonist already? Please?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_171	I'm a growing girl, okay?! Sometimes, it just happens, even if it's only been a year!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_172	Different skins and class changes, Enlightenment, all the works... Why aren't I more popular?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_173	It's an Inefficient Mandragora, huh.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_174	I'm the obvious choice for the next loincloth illustration!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_175	Embrace the light that guides the world! (Said while making stuff explode)
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_176	This is not splendid at all! (Said while dodging an attack)
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_177	My mother is not a certain PR Angel. She's a normal woman.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_178	My father is Yogi Ku, not Eizan!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_179	Huh? A camera? Don't you mean my secret weapon?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_180	Hmph! Don't expect me to get excited just because I was voted No. 1 Most Popular!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_181	You mean to tell me Monzein will go down easily if you use "Thunderbolt" Spark Ray consecutively?!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_182	Yauras has been rather active recently. When will the day come for my dazzling twin-blades to shine?
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_183	That special attack of Kanon's is really no joke!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_184	Before I lost hope...? Why are you interested in something like that? Figure it out yourself.
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_185	I was strong once, in the story... One day... I will truly achieve that strength!
TS_REV_20180526_VISION_186	Everyone loves me! Everyone wants me in their party, so there's no way anyone hates me!
TS_SWIM_2018_ACHAD	Swimwear... It's nice, but thanks to my attachments, I am too heavy to do anything but sink in water.
TS_SWIM_2018_ALMILA	I've got no weapon except this meat skewer?! That's not too bad... Give me more!
TS_SWIM_2018_CHALICE	Did someone say they wanted to see me dripping wet while I fixed my bike?
TS_SWIM_2018_DILGA	Summer heat, the beach, loincloths! This is the THE ALCHEMIST CODE aesthetic! Wait, what? Not this year???
TS_SWIM_2018_GORMALAS	It's loincloth season, baby! Let's get these glutes into gear!
TS_SWIM_2018_GRANZ	Acht looks so cute in her swimwear... Rin and Mielikki, too... I would do anything to protect their joy.
TS_SWIM_2018_MIELIKKI	All the beautiful blondes last year were totally glittery and amazing! I kinda remember a dark, shadowy presence.
TS_SWIM_2018_RINN	Hmmm, anyone interested in goods based on my sandals, water gun, etcetera?
TS_SWIM_2018_TEONA	We should do a muscle madness sports event! What do you mean, nobody wants that? I do!!!
TS_SWIM_2018_TERESA	There is no such thing as an opponent that only Lamia can take down! It's a summertime coincidence!
TS_SWIM_2018_VETEL	It'd be nice to get some male swimwear around here that's not just loincloths.
TS_SWIM_2018_YAULAS	If you say anything about me looking younger in a swimsuit, I promise you will regret it.
TS_SWIM_2018_YOMI	This isn't a negligee! It's definitely a swimsuit, okay?!
