001	Tsk! You!	VO_vier.vier_battle_0019
002	We've destroyed your ring. Looks...like we made the right choice.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
003	Heh heh... I may have underestimated you a little. You, in particular... If it weren't for your injuries, we could have some real fun. Too bad!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
004	Too bad...? I think it is more accurate...to say you are lucky my...injuries give you a glimmer of...hope!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
005	Ha! Well, I'll let it slide. You did have a lucky break with the ring. Unfortunately, I have an appointment, so...it's time for me to wrap things up.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
006	I've got a date with your country! To hack it to pieces, of course... I'm sorry to abandon you like this, but I'll leave a few immortal soldiers to keep you company.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0035
007	I don't know what you people...are planning, but whatever it is...the Scarlet Flame Guard will stand...in your way. For Envylia. For...the entire world.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0013
008	Please. Look at yourself. You're barely holding it together and you still think you can stop us?	VO_vier.vier_battle_1017
009	Barely holding it together...? Ha... What is death? Even if I die...my iron will stands strong.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
010	My vow will live on...in the Scarlet Flame Guard! We...will win in the end!
011	A test of endurance...? My specialty! I'm intrigued to see who will win!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0023
012	I'm a little bitter that you managed to smash through my Ring Guard - Black Flames...but I think that half of my immortal soldiers should be enough to bury you.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
013	Hmph. Feels like I'm leaving the job half done, but... Well. Can't be helped. Toodles! Enjoy the last moments of your life!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
014	Urgh... Agh...	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0025
015	Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
016	Ren... Take Nina and leave this place.	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
017	...What will you do?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
018	I'll stop them on my own.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
019	You got a death wish? Lame. What happened to Smile Protection Guild or whatever? You know that this is going to cause the opposite of joy for a bunch of people, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
020	Someone has to do it...and if it has to be anybody...it should be...me. Go, Ren. We'll settle our grudge...another time...all right?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
021	That ain't gonna happen any time soon! You... Ugh. You make me sick. Always taking the short straw for yourself! You're the worst!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
022	That's my justice, my...legacy. An...iron will...that will never...be broken.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
023	Ren... I'm not dying...for the therians. I'm...dying for me...the way I choose... My iron...will...leading me to a...glorious, blazing...end...and turning...to steel.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
024	Tell everyone...what I said! Nina... You...will inherit my legacy!
025	Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
026	I just...can't beat you... Exceeding...expectations...to the...very end.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
027	Tch. I guess I'll never really have the chance to show you up.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0022
028	I wanted to be the one who bested you, the one who finally took your life. This sucks.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
029	Hmph... Go. Hurry! I leave the Scarlet Flame...Guard to...you, Nina!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
030	Sir Gerald!!!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0021
031	Gerald?! What...? You're surrounded by flames?!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
032	Vettel... How are things going...over by the palace?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
033	Things have calmed down somewhat now that the reinforcements from the Holy Guard are here.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
034	So I thought I would check on things over your way...
035	But never mind that, Gerald. What the heck are you doing? What are you doing there?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0021
036	Natalie... I thought I...told you to stay...back.	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
037	What?! As if I could just leave you behind with those injuries! Get over here! I'm going to heal you, like it or not!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
038	No. Natalie. Fall back.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
039	No! I won't! I won't leave you behind! How could you?! How dare you ask me to do something like that?! Why do you think I worked so hard to improve my healing?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0019
040	It was all for you! You're such a stubborn, stupid idiot! You just never let me heal you, always going off on your own and taking everything on your own shoulders until you are buried by it all!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
041	You never ask for help, never let anyone help! What am I supposed to do with you? What...? What am I supposed to do without you?
042	Natalie... Natalie, stop... You... You have your...own honor left... Let me have mine!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0014
043	You are so thick-skulled! My honor... My reason for everything...has always been to be at your side, to support you!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
044	Natalie... You were...always at my side...healing me. Making...it so that...I could focus all...my energies on...defeating the enemy...before me.	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0019
045	Find...a...new...reason...to live. Live...for...me...Natalie. Live...and let go...of me.
046	Gerald!
047	Sir Gerald! I-I'll never forget you! I will carry your convictions with me forever! The Scarlet Flame Guard will never lose the heart you gave it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
048	"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved. There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. Respect none who wield the sword without heart."	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
049	"Dedicate your sword...to the pursuit of...justice..." Nina... This shall...be your creed, your code...of honor to live by... Remember it.
050	Remember! Remember that you...are the sun that gives...joy and hope! Never let soften...your iron will!
051	Sir Gerald!!!
052	Gerald, it's too early to give up! I still need you!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
053	Haha... No, you don't...my old friend. Go on, Vettel...Natalie... I leave this world...to you!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0039
054	We swore to defend...the setting Scarlet...and hold in our hearts...the Flames to manifest our iron wills!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0032
055	We are...the wielders of the Scarlet Flame!
056	We swore...that our iron wills should stand indomitable...in the face of hardship! In order to ensure...the joy and laughter of the people!
057	Gerald!
058	Go! Protect...our country! Protect...our...world! As long as the two of you live...the vow we made together...will live on!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
059	Gerald! I promise you, I won't let you down! I will never forget our vow!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
060	Goodbye...Gerald. We'll settle everything when we meet again in another world.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
061	Sir Gerald!!! I vow to carry on your code of honor! I will show you what I can do! I'll show you that I can fill your shoes!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
062	Yes... I believe you. You can...do it. You... You are the reason why I can...face my own reckoning without...a single regret...in...my...heart!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
063	Nina! Of the Scarlet Flame Guard! I expect...great things from you!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0028
064	No! Noooooooooo!!!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0025
065	Full retreat!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
066	Gerald!!!
067	Natalie... Thank you for...everything. That I could do things my own...way this whole time...was all because of....you.
068	So this...is what it is like...to die for what...you believe in. Heh... I finally get it...father.
069	Hmph. Not kind enough...to give me a few extra moments...to soak in my...final goodbyes...huh? Well...I'll show you...that I won't...die...easy!!!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
070	The Scarlet...Flame...will never die! Step forward to face...Ironheart Gerald...of the Scarlet Flame Guard!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0014
