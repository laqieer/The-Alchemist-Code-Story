001	Yaaarrrrgh!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
002	Glurrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0004
003	Huff... Huff... Dang it. There's just too many!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0022
004	Glurp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0006
005	...?! Dang it!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
006	Gluuurrrrrp!	VO_jam.jam_battle_0028_a
007	They're gone?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
008	What do you think you're doing, Wind Shaman?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
009	Georgios! What did you do just now?	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
010	The Jam are the product of Beelzebub's preemptive curse. I am able to influence them with my purification power.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0004
011	You purified them?! Why would you save me?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0047
012	Wind Shaman, answer me! What is it that you seek?
013	Why do you want to know all of a sudden?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
014	So I can get my hands on Beelzebub... For that alone, I'm willing to fight by your side.
015	Yet, I wonder what your goal might be. Are you plotting revenge for my having killed your father and Asena? If so, your motives are foolish!
016	Why are you so desperate to obtain Beelzebub?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
017	You could never understand. Beelzebub's fate...belongs to us. It is my duty to obtain Beelzebub at all costs!
018	It is retribution for the destruction of my clan. This is my calling. My one and only purpose in life...
019	The destruction...of your clan?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
020	Hmph. It seems I've said too much... Regardless, that is my mission. Now, Wind Shaman...what of you?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
021	......
022	So you choose to continue dwelling in your sorrow. I was wrong to consider you a strong champion.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
023	You had better stay out of my way...weakling.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0017
024	......
025	Tina!
026	Tina, are you okay?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
027	Mocca... Lisbeth...
028	Tina, what were you thinking?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0006
029	When Georgios killed Asena in front of my very eyes...it reminded me of what happened to Father.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
030	...
031	I'm always saying I want to change the future, but I end up losing the ones I want to protect most of all. I'm useless.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
032	I hate him. He's the one who killed Asena. He's the one who killed Father. I couldn't even do anything to stop him. That's...all I keep thinking about.
033	I don't know what to do with these emotions. I just... I just...!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
034	Tina...
035	Tell me... What should I do?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
