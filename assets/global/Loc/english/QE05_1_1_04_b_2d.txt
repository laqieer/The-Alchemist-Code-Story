001	Why...? How could I lose to scum like this?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
002	Did you forget you lost to Kamui last time?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0030
003	Urg...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0022
004	Excuse me, sir, it's almost time for—what happened?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0001
005	Oh no! Kamui, this guy's completely knocked out!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0028
006	Knocked out?! Do you guys have any idea how much money is riding on this match?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0023
007	I know! You'll compete in his place! You're clearly strong enough.
008	W-wait a moment, this was just self defense.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
009	Either you fight or you pay for damages! You ruined one of tonight's main bouts! Do you have any idea how much money this is costing us?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
010	Ah... It does not seem as though there is any room to argue.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
011	K-Kamui! What are you gonna do?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
012	Yeah! What are you gonna do?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
013	Fine, I'll fight, but I will not accept any complaints if I lose.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0038
014	Good, now take this sword. You're going against the Champion, so don't hold back!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0007
015	Today is just not my day.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
016	Your Highness, King Narol! We of Gluttony Foss' Third Legion are present and accounted for, sir.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0020
017	Good work, Ceclidis.
018	If I may speak freely, Your Highness, those under the banner of Leordas, General of the First Legion and instigator of the rebellion, are the best our country had to offer.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0031
019	If our forces were to face each other in a pitched battle, the victor would be determined by mere chance.
020	Are we sure peace talks are no longer on the table? This civil war was spawned from the differing perspectives of the North and South, but...
021	Killing each other over such issues serves no purpose but to diminish our country's strength.
022	Your Highness, I believe the forces of the South under Leordas will no longer hear our words.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0022
023	As proof, they have kept their own council in response to your repeated edict to lay down their weapons.
024	If you were to show any signs of weakness, they might see it as an opportunity to usurp the throne.
025	We must end this rebellion, swiftly and decisively, to save this country.
026	I understand. You will have the Second Legion to command as well.
027	The entire military force of our country is at your disposal. We must suppress this rebellion.
028	Thank you, sir, but if I may... As you know, there is another means to end this.	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0039
029	What are you trying to say?
030	Unleash Beelzebub! With the power of the Sacred Stone, a simple rebellion would—	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0020
031	Silence! That is out of the question!
032	But why?! I know that using the Sacred Stone comes at a great cost, but it would be nothing compared to how many would be sacrificed by the strife of war!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0025
033	Or is it your secret agreement with the so-called "Sephira" that is hindering your decision?	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0010
034	You...
035	I am sorry, general. I cannot do as you say.
036	No matter what the situation, we must never unleash the powers of the Sacred Stone.
037	That King Narol! Why can he not simply do as I say? Fool! He sits on the fence even as it is about to be blown over!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_favorite_0003
038	The whereabouts of the Sacred Stone Beelzebub are known only to the King.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
039	The stone is no good to us sealed away.
040	Yet, we can only assist from the shadows. You are the only one who can take action directly.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
041	I know. I will find it on my own if I must!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0004
042	I must know where these Sephira hide. They are the ones who keep Beelzebub hidden and sealed...!
