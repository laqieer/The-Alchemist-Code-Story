001	Ngh... We got rid of the corruption, but...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
002	Oh, no... The airship! It got flung so far away from the dragon!
003	If only we could bring it just a little closer...!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
004	Is that all?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
005	Huh?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
006	I had Adaleigh teach me the basic controls of the airship in the advent of an emergency. Unless I am very much mistaken, we have found ourselves in exactly such a predicament.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0030
007	O-oh! Yes! If you, um, please?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
008	All right. I am...actually quite clumsy, so I'm not at all confident as to how this will go...but I'm sure it will be fine. In any case, let's give it a shot.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
009	Um, Julia? What did you just say? You were mumbling.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0001
010	Nothing. Everything will be fine. I think this is the right one. Yes... Yes, it has to be this. All right. I'm going with this one.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
011	It is a drastic measure, to be sure...but this is the only operation he taught me.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
012	W-wait a second! I thought you said that—!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
013	Bam!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0004
014	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0025
015	Oh...? That's strange...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
016	What just happened?!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0026
017	I'm not sure...but it seems that the dragon is no longer moving.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
018	What the hell?! Why am I getting an emergency alert from the airship?! This is bad! This is really bad! It's already damaged!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
019	No way! No freaking way! Don't tell me someone has rammed my ship into this dragon!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
020	Calm down, Adaleigh.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0001
021	Calm down? Calm down?! How the hell am I supposed to do that?! If something's happened to my ship... I might not be able to go home!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
022	And what about Emmel?! How do we know she's even safe?!
023	Don't worry. The dragon isn't moving anymore, which means that it's being restrained by the Matter again. Without a doubt, Emmel is safe.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
024	R-right...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0020
025	But that doesn't change the fact that we must hurry. The final core awaits us!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
026	Unghh... Huh? I...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
027	Lady Emmel, you're finally awake.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
028	Forgive me. It seems I...might have botched the controls a little.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0035
029	J-just a little...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0011
030	In any case, now I—	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
031	Hrrngh! Arrrgh! Take...that!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
032	Uuhhh... Uuuhhhh... F-faaaaaall...
033	Fall! Fall to us! Fall! Fall! Fall! Fall! Faaall! Faaaaall! Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall!
034	Th-the corruption...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
035	Fear not, my lady. I will deal with them forthwith.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
036	J-Julia...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
037	Y-you're bleeding!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
038	My wounds must have opened in the impact.	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
039	The ones I sustained during my fight with the Black Knight... It appears that the corruption was applied to his blade.
040	I tried treating the wounds with my Spiritbonding, but to no avail. I'm not sure what else can be done.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
041	Then why...? Wh-why did you come with us?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
042	Because that is nothing less than my duty...and what I wanted.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
043	I wanted to protect you, my lady, and Lord Nimul as well. So long as I was of use... That is all I need to hear.
044	No! Julia, if you use your purification powers with a wound like that, y-you'll...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
045	Please don't make such a face. With this...my soul will remain intact. I can die without ever falling to the corruption of sin. There is no greater happiness in this world.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
046	No! What are you saying?! You don't mean that! Y-you were meant to...t-take care of my brother...for me.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0019
047	That was your wish, Emmel. Not mine.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0042
048	Ngh!
049	Hmhm... You cannot cleanse me of the corruption. It is too late. There is nothing that can be done for me now.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
050	Julia... If you come into contact with the Fallen... If you let the corruption fester...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
051	Listen to me, my lady. You must make your own wish come true. After all... Isn't that what dreams are? Wishes that we must...fulfill...for ourselves.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
052	Julia...? Julia! No!
053	No... No! Wh-why...? Wh-why is this...happening?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
054	All life is doomed to end in death. That is the inescapable truth...and the way of this world.	VO_uroboros-c.uroboros-c_sys_0031
055	Wh-who's there?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
056	Wh-what's going on?! I don't understand!
057	Why is this happening?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0018
