001	Wait! Is Ethan really all right?!
002	Calm yourself. I'd gain nothing by killing the man.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
003	In fact, by letting him live, there's a chance he shows up and rescues you. I've got zero reasons for killing him.
004	Okay...
005	More importantly, the guy was screaming about how he wanted you to use the Sacred Stone Belphegor to lead this country.
006	You sure you have no idea where it is?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
007	None. I honestly wasn't told anything.
008	I see... Man, those are some terrifying black clouds. What's with the smoggy air?
009	When Alvarez was appointed mayor of Redington...after my father's death, he began to rapidly boost industrialization.
010	The toxic discharge caused by this has been making the population worse.
011	Jeez. I came to offer flowers, but this country has really taken a dark turn. Honestly...your father must be turning in his grave.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
012	U-um. How did you know my father?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0002
013	I'm not in the habit of lying to ladies, but I don't really want to talk about it.. It'll be troublesome if you become even more suspicious of me.
014	Suspicious? What do you mean?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
015	Oops! N-no, I just accepted a request to kill him and, as a result...
016	Kill? Wh-what do you mean kill?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0026
017	Tsk! It's the Alkaroids! Let's go!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
018	He-hey! Wait!
