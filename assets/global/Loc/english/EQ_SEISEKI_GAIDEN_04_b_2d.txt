001	This will do.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
002	Their fighting style resembles that of the Shadow Messiah survivors in Envylia. I thought as much. I'm glad that I was paying attention.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
003	She's so strong...and that insight...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_1026
004	She's not even trying, though! This is what it means to be a Captain! I still have much to learn.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
005	Yet...for there to be such a difference in power between us...!
006	No, it's just my Alchemia Pura. I'm sure you will both come to surpass me. I really believe that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
007	You are strong, but opponents outside of the Holy Guard will use more than brute force against you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
008	Now that you are a Captain, Kudan, you need to focus on the bigger picture, not only on taking down the enemy in front of you.
009	What am I saying? It isn't like me to lecture...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
010	Yes, Captain. I am still weak. I need to become stronger, both as Captain and as an individual!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
011	Stop. Kudan, strength isn't everything. That's what I meant by straightforwardness being dangerous.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0015
012	I really hope that you don't stray down the wrong path.
013	It's all right. Kudan would never do such a thing...
014	And in the unlikely event that he did stray down the wrong path, I am sure that I would be there to pull him back from it.
015	Hmmm... If you are by his side, Kagura, then I suppose it will be fine. Do you agree, Kudanstein?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
016	Yes...of course. I need power only so that I can protect Kagura and this world!
017	There is no reason for me to stray from that path!
018	A good answer. You have a good Captain here, Lord Commander.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
019	Indeed.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
020	You must be tired. I'm sorry for keeping you. You may go.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0035
021	Then we shall take our leave. Please take care.
022	They have a good bond. Yes... It's time for me to step down as Captain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
023	I... What am I doing here?	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
024	What's the matter, Zain? You're here to accompany me on my research, are you not?	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
025	I am, but...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
026	Then we should get going, too. We need to reach the truth.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
027	That's why we're here, so we shouldn't waste time.
028	Mmm...
