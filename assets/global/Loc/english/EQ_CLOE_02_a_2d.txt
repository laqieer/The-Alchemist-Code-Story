001	Hah! Hmph!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0002
002	Hyaaaaah!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0007
003	...
004	This is no good.	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0030
005	Hm? Where is that voice coming from?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
006	This voice...
007	That's why our standing within Envylia is changing every year.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0003
008	Really? I guess it has changed a little bit.
009	It's never going to be great, though, is it?
010	Don't look so hopeless! It's okay, just relax.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0002
011	Go ahead and groom yourselves while you hear me out, okay?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
012	The shedding gets really bad around this time of year, doesn't it? There we go.
013	What are you doing?
014	Brushing my fur! Grooming is important, after all.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0008
015	If I don't brush it properly, there'll be fur everywhere. It's especially bad during shedding season.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0012
016	No, no. That's not what I meant. Why are you gathering up all the loose fur like that? Are you gonna use it for something?
017	Ehehehe... Well, I collect all the fur I shed and make stuffed animals with it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
018	S-stuffed...animals?
019	It's super soft and feels really nice to the touch! See? Look at it!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0023
020	Do you want to touch it? Eheheheh... Isn't it cute?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0024
021	Oh, uh... No thanks. I'll pass. Besides...you can't really call this cute, can you? Er, never mind. Back to the point!
022	Oh, that's right. Eheh... Ahem!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
023	There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. We all follow this rule and fight together.
024	My... Um, the person who I admire made that rule, you see. So I'm determined to protect it with my iron will!
025	You don't say...
026	That's why I'm sure the day will come when the people of Envylia and we therians can walk hand in hand together!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0003
027	No, I'm more than sure. I know that this country will be a place like that someday!
028	I will make it a reality!
029	R-really? So... Is it okay for us to get our hopes up?!
030	You betcha!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0007
031	...
032	Huh? Chloe...? What're you doing all the way out here?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0004
033	Oh, well, I... I just happened to hear your voice. What are you doing here?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0011
034	Well, I want the therians and animals to like Envylia just a bit more.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
035	So I come here to talk to them about all sorts of things; to show them the good side of Envylia, a little bit at a time.
036	Even if the situation improves, it's pointless if the hearts of the people don't change along with it.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0030
037	A little at a time? Does that mean that you do this often, then? In addition to all your training and your duties in the Scarlet Flame Guard?	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0001
038	It's important to keep moving forward, even if it's just one step at a time.
039	I will do everything I can. I have to do something!
040	Nina...
041	We'll handle this! Don't panic, and take cover!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
042	O-okay!
043	Let's go, Chloe!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0015
044	Right!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0005
