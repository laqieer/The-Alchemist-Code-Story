001	So you, too, have awakened to a new dimension of battle.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1008
002	Grk! What is this?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
003	Proof that a fool remains a fool. To think you would show me all that you are capable of, and so soon...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
004	Did you forget? I myself have transcended the limits of this world, having been bathed in an abyss of everlasting darkness.
005	The...power of darkness!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
006	Serving a new master, hm? I didn't think you had any semblance of faith left within you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0030
007	Tell me, do you truly believe that your late wife and daughter will be waiting for you at the end of this path of mindless violence you are on?
008	...!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
009	Wife and daughter...?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
010	Before embarking on whatever this is, this man believed in the Door of Truth.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
011	He believed that his wife and daughter, who were lost during war, would be waiting beyond it.
012	Silence!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0042
013	People naturally wish to protect others from the pain they have experienced themselves... In other words...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
014	Indeed. This man once aspired to put an end to the wars with his own sword. Looking at him now that he has fallen so far, you may not be able to imagine it.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
015	Be quiet!!!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
016	I had forgotten who I was, but...	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
017	Jealousy, resentment, and finally, hatred...
018	While I was sunk into a world of darkness so overwhelming that I could never have imagined it, my mind churned with such negative emotions.
019	Lord...Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
020	Where there is light, there is darkness...in any world or dimension!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
021	This is... This...overwhelming darkness is...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
022	Allow me to display the depths I witnessed in that world of darkness!
023	Oh no! If he unleashes that power, it will drag all of us down with it!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
024	Agh...ahhh!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0026
025	Lord Zahar!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0019
026	Taste defeat and know true regret! This is your end!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
027	Everyone, run!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
028	...?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
029	Your strength is indeed impressive. I did not expect something like this from you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
030	You!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
031	I recognize that you are not the Zahar that I remember. However, I...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
032	...Agh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0025
033	?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
034	Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
035	I did not think there was anyone who could challenge Zehn in a sword fight. Who in the world is that?	VO_neun.neun_sys_0020
036	The Veda Templars?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
037	Ah, the Lord Commander Kanon.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
038	Sorry about this. You're something of a thorn in Sol's side, so we're here to take care of you.
039	W-we're surrounded?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
040	Ngh... Not even enough honor to do the deed yourself, Zehn?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0022
041	Acht... Neun... What are...?	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
042	Sol will be here at any moment. We can't waste any more time. Ready?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
043	This looks really bad...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
