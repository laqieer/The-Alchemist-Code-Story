001	Haaaa...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
002	Noah, are you finished yet?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
003	No! Wait, don't tell me you've finished writing your apology letter already, Emma.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
004	Yeah, I've had to write them a lot. You get used to them after a while. Though I guess you wouldn't know anything about that, huh?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0023
005	Of course not. This is the first time I've ever had to write one.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0010
006	(Why did it end up like this?)	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
007	I think I understand the situation now.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
008	I'm so sorry, professor.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0035
009	Thankfully it was not as bad as it could have been. I will have you write a twenty page apology letter as punishment.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0031
010	Are you certain? What about Emma?	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0025
011	Emma can do it as well. I know she didn't mean any harm.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0030
012	Besides, Noah needs to learn to control herself a bit more.
013	Yes, professor.	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
014	Ugh! An honor student writing an apology letter. This is ridiculous! Then again, I suppose I did use magic carelessly...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
015	(But it wasn't my fault! It's only natural that I'd panic when my glasses were taken! It's embarrassing, and I can't see, and...!)
016	(Emma should know that.)
017	Haaa...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
018	Hey, Noah? Are you angry at me?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0031
019	Yes.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0016
020	I said I'm sorry! Oh man, and I totally forgot to bring some silverware with me today, too.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0035
021	What? Why would you bring silverware here?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0013
022	Huh? Well, you were super angry at those girls earlier, right?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
023	What are you talking about?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
024	(There's nothing wrong with my behavior! What I'm doing is right!)
025	Oh!	VO_noah.noah_chara_1005
026	If you had snapped at those girls, it would have just made them feel justified! I didn't want that to happen!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
027	So you did that...for me?
028	(Now that I think about it, she did something similar the other day in the library, too.)
029	I cannot fathom how they manage to bungle even such a simple rule! It is really not that difficult! Ugh!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
030	Boo!	VO_emma.emma_battle_1017
031	(With that, my irritation was gone. She even helped me calm down after the teacher left.)
032	(If Emma hadn't been there, I...)
033	Why?	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
034	Huh?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0025
035	Why do you always do things like that? I never asked you to, did I? Yet you're always meddling in everything!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0011
036	Noah...
037	I never asked you to, yet... Yet you still...!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0018
038	H-hey, Noah? Are you okay?! Don't cry!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0026
039	Unngghhh... I-I'm not crying!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0019
040	Pretty sure those are tears!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0028
041	I'm so horrible! I was always trying to cover for you, as if I was better than you!	VO_noah.noah_battle_0019
042	I didn't understand anything, yet I acted like I could do everything by myself!
043	I'm so sorry, Emma.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0036
044	What are you apologizing for?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0006
045	Huh? But I—!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
046	You're not doing anything wrong, Noah. I appreciate how you're always covering for me, like you did in the library the other day.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
047	That was only because you had calmed me down beforehand.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0020
048	I'm used to people misunderstanding me, and saying those kinds of things about me.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0022
049	But you're not like that, Noah.
050	You always cover for me, and get angry at people for me. You're an honor student in the school of friendship!
051	That makes me want to do what I can to help you out, too.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
052	Emma...	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
053	(I'm short tempered, and I snap at the smallest things. I couldn't manage to be an honor student all by myself.)
054	(I was only able to become an honor student because of your support, Emma.)
055	In other words... We make a great pair! The honor student and the problem child! Heheh, a top secret duo that even the teachers don't know about!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0023
056	Problem child...? You know, Emma, if you would just act a bit less reckless, you wouldn't get into nearly so much trouble as you do.	VO_noah.noah_sys_1011
057	Hah! Screw acting! I just do what I want and I don't like hard work. See? That's what you call a problem child.	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
058	But I really hate it when people misunderstand you!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
059	It doesn't matter! So long as you understand the real me, then I don't care what other people think!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1011
060	Hurry up and finish your letter already, will you? I've been waiting for you this whole time! I'm bored of reading books.	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
061	Yes, yes, I'm getting there! Have a little patience, would you?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
062	(Wow! Emma actually put the books back where they belong!)
063	Hey, Emma? After I've finished writing this, shall we go and get some crepes?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0002
064	Whoa! Noah! Stopping somewhere on the way home?! How rebellious!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1006
065	I'm writing an apology letter, aren't I? I'm already a rebel!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
