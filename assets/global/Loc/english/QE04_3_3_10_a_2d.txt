001	Don't get in my way! I will do everything that I can...to prevent the future I glimpsed from coming to fruition!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
002	We're almost at the fountain! Let's press onward!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
003	Leave this to me! You two, go on ahead!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0004
004	...I'm sorry, Lisbeth! Let's go, Mocca!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0035
005	Got it... We must do everything we can to make it on time! Hyaaah!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
006	Huff...huff...! Where's Asena...?!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
007	Asena! We made it!
008	You got here faster than I anticipated...Wind Shamans.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
009	Georgios! Step away from Asena immediately!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
010	I can't do that. After all, my objective is to kill Asena.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
011	What need is there for that?! What is Tehre thinking?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
012	This has nothing to do with Tehre. I told you: this is my objective. Asena has shouldered this burden long enough.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
013	Originally, it was my responsibility to suppress the power of Beelzebub.
014	Thus, I will now release the Godwolf Asena from this heavy burden!
015	Originally...your responsibility?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
016	That doesn't concern you. Just shut up and observe what happens from there.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
017	...Not gonna happen!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0007
018	Hyaaaahhh!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
019	What...?! Arghhhhh!!!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0032
020	Hyahahahahah!!! Well done. You've increased the potency of that wind of yours! How you manage to keep me entertained.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0023
021	Impossible! He deflected it so easily...!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
022	There's an opening! Stormwolf Fang!!!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0017
023	Thought I was vulnerable...did you? ...I see your moves! Hmph!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0017
024	How did you manage to fend that off?! You monster...!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
