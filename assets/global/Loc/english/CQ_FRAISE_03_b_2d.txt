001	We did it! Victor...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0009
002	Be careful!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0019
003	An ambush...?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
004	I told you, didn't I? Now we're completely surrounded...	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
005	Ack. I'm sorry. This is all my fault.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0027
006	Victor, I'll create an escape route for you! Run and report what's happened here to the king!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
007	What are you talking about?! Look at how many of them there are! You'll die in the meantime!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
008	Don't worry about me! Please...!	VO_frayze.frayze_event_1003
009	I won't go!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0039
010	Go!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
011	I told you I'm not going!	VO_victor.victor_battle_0011
012	Just because this is your first mission, stop trying to shoulder everything on your own!
013	We're in this together! You've got to trust and rely on me!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
014	...!
015	("A knight must protect and believe in his country, his people, and his comrades"...)
016	That's right. I got so caught up in this mission that I forgot to trust my own comrades.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0018
017	Seriously. You've always been a little air-headed. I can't tell whether you're dependable or not.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
018	Besides, you're the commander now. How stupid are you to go charging in on your own...?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
019	You gotta leave that kind stuff to me.
020	Heheh...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
021	Huh? What're you laughing about?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
022	No...I just find you really dependable right now.	VO_frayze.frayze_event_1003
023	It's such a reassuring thing to know that someone has my back.
024	It's a little late for that. Oh, in that case, maybe that will reassure you even more!	VO_victor.victor_chara_1006
025	Huh...?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0016
026	Aghhh...!!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0026
027	Captain! We've come to assist you!
028	Soldiers...why?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
029	You just went off on your own when we got word of the enemy attack, so I went and told everyone.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
030	I'll admit...today you've all taught me a lot.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0029
031	Thanks for the compliment!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0010
032	Agh...!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0027
033	Are the two of you all right?!
034	Yes! Victor! Let's go!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
035	Already on it!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0005
036	...We somehow managed to finish them off.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0022
037	I wouldn't have been able to do it without you. Thank you so much. And...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0034
038	I'm sorry. My inexperience put you in danger.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0035
039	Please...enough of that!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0027
040	I...just did the obvious things that a knight is supposed to do.	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
041	Well...I learned a lot from your example. And I realized that I've still got so much I need to learn...	VO_frayze.frayze_event_1003
042	Victor, I have a request I'd like to make of you!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
043	A request...?	VO_victor.victor_sys_0006
044	Please, be my friend!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0041
045	What?! What's gotten into you?!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0012
046	You helped me realize something important! I need a friend like you!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0004
047	I want to become friends with you! So...!
048	No! I told you, didn't I? I feel uncomfortable around you!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
049	Why?! What's wrong with me? Please, tell me, Victor!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0021
050	No, Vicky!	VO_frayze.frayze_event_1003
051	Why are you suddenly calling me by my nickname?! Argh...fine! If you want to know that badly, I'll tell you!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0029
052	You're such a hard worker and you're amazing! You can do anything, but you're also super humble!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
053	You work hard and you don't brag! When you show me that side of you, I lose confidence in myself!
054	Also, you're tall! But you're not stuck-up. And you're easy-going!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
055	Hmm. I see the problem. My height, huh? I can't make myself shorter...so maybe I should brag more?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0042
056	Look at me, Vicky! I'm amazing, aren't I?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0008
057	Jeez! Seriously! I can't even hate the way you brag! Argh! I'm getting so annoyed!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
058	Come on. Let's go back! You've got a report to deliver and stuff, right?!
059	Wa-wait, Vicky!	VO_frayze.frayze_chara_2007
060	Shut up!	VO_victor.victor_battle_1028
061	...I feel like I've only managed to make matters worse.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0031
062	Sigh... I'm so bad at these things.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0030
063	That being said, as long as we stick together...we can become stronger!
064	Yes...I've still got a lot of room to grow!
065	And...and...one day...!
