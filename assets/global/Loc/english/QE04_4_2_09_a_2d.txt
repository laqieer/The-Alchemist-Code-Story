001	Huff... Huff... There's so many of them!	VO_rega.rega_battle_0019
002	If we take out the main body, then they'll no longer be able to bolster their numbers. I'm going ahead!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
003	Tehre, how are you planning to reach its chest? And how can you be sure that's where the earth core is?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
004	That is definitely its earth core. I can feel the power of earth resonating from it. Have you not noticed, Mocca?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
005	If you recall the terrain of Saga, the answer should come to you.
006	The terrain of Saga?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
007	I see... Each of the cores is located in the same area as each of the temples in Saga!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
008	Precisely. Fire in its back, water in its neck, and earth in its chest. Which means, wind should be located—	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
009	In its stomach! So that's what you meant by the "terrain of Saga".
010	This land...really is one with its legend.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
011	That's why I'm certain the earth core must be there in its chest. As for how I'm going to reach it... Haaaaaaargh!
012	Wow! The ground's rising and forming a path for him!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0009
013	Quit dawdling! Get over here!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
014	We're so high up! One wrong step and we'll be goners...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0029
015	This must be it!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
016	WRAAAAAAAAAGH!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0032
017	Jump! Now!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
018	So this is the dragon's interior, is it? It's different from what I had imagined.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
019	I thought it would be more like a living organism, but it seems to be...rather akin to some age-old ruin...	VO_rega.rega_sys_0009
020	The earth core must be here, somewhere.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0006
021	Is that it?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
022	Intruders! Leave this place! At once!	VO_terre.terre_battle_0013
023	It...really does give off the same aura as the shadows we faced in the Trial. No matter. I've defeated you once before, and I have no intention of losing this time, either.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
024	I will honor my side of our partnership, Georgios. Furthermore, as the Earth Sprite, I will destroy the earth core for the good of all Saga!
