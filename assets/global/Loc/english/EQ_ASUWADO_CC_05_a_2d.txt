001	Ghah...!
002	What?! Hey!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0025
003	Oh, how the star has fallen. I can't believe you've stooped so low as to guard a man marked for death! You bring disgrace upon Zalam Gaim.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
004	The client is dead, and the mission has been retracted. This man is no longer a target. You will stand down.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
005	Our creed forbids the execution of any target after the mission has been canceled.
006	I know what our creed forbids. But this man's life happens to be worth a pretty penny.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
007	Even if the original client is dead, there are many others who also wish for the Desert Wings' guild captain to meet his demise.
008	And despite your failure, Najam, there are many other assassins ready and willing to execute this mission on my word alone.
009	You poor souls...	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_0019
010	Go! Take the guild captain down, now!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
011	Whosoever succeeds where Najam has failed will have her rank bestowed upon them in my new order of Zalam Gaim!
012	This is absurd. Don't you all have other missions to attend to? What of them?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
013	Looks like Zalam Gaim's a much more fragile organization than I even realized.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
014	So it would seem.
015	(Ryle was right. At this rate, our assassins will continue making attempts at his life until they finally execute him...)	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
016	(And Zalam Gaim will completely lose its identity when people start to realize a swift death can be sold to the highest bidder.)
017	You really okay with this? Helping me means betraying your order, you know. I don't think there's any coming back from this.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
018	I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this because...Zalam Gaim is the only home I have. And I intend to save it.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
019	I'll show Zalam Gaim just how bright its star can burn!
