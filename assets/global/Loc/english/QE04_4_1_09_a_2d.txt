001	Tina.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
002	I absolutely loathe him...but to save Saga, I have to overcome these feelings—for Father's sake as well!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
003	I know that deep down...but they just won't go away!
004	I had no idea you felt this way.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
005	Mocca, I...I can't believe I feel this way myself, either!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0018
006	Tina...
007	We made a promise, didn't we? That we were going to protect Saga together!	VO_moca.moca_battle_0019
008	This is the land that Asena and your father gave their lives to protect! Now it's our turn to protect it!
009	This is the land...that Asena and Father...gave their lives...to protect...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
010	Don't worry. I know you would never break a promise. I'm proud to call you my friend!	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
011	If you don't have any faith in yourself, then...put your faith in me! I would never leave your side!
012	Mocca...
013	We have to keep moving forward. We don't know when the dragon might start moving again. Tina, I'm going on ahead!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
014	I'm here too, you know! You should lean on us more, Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
015	Lisbeth, Mocca...thank you.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
016	So it's just you two, huh? Good. The battlefield's no place for a weakling like that.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
017	Tina's not weak at all! She'll be joining us later.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
018	So be it. Hmmm. It still hasn't moved. Shall we begin scaling the tail?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0031
019	Mocca, it's starting to move!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0026
020	I see. It's moving because it senses danger...However, if it's moving, that also means the blade can cut into it now.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
021	Well spotted, Rega! We'd better start climbing before it is able to fully move!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0033
022	Rega, you take Kiki and Adel with you and return to the bottom. I want you to stay on standby.
023	But why?	VO_rega.rega_sys_0025
024	We need someone to wait for the Great Sprites and Tina...just in case something happens to the rest of us.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
025	If you're waiting for me, then you don't need to wait any longer. Sorry for the hold up!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
026	Tina!
027	Wind Shaman, has your hesitation been laid to rest?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0002
028	For Saga's sake, I'll set aside my vendetta to defeat the dragon. I'll do it for those who have put their faith in me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
029	We don't have time for you! Get out of our way!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
030	Remember, we're not here to cull the Jam! Reaching the dragon's back is our top priority!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
031	It's possible the dragon might start moving while we're on our way up, so stay on your guard! We're aiming for the core inside its body!
