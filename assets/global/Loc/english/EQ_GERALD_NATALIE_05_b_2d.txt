001	Hm...?
002	Finally awake?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
003	I... H-huh?! What's going on?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0026
004	You must be pretty out of it if you can't figure that out. I'm carrying you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
005	I-I know that much! It's just that it's embarrassing!
006	You lost consciousness. You weren't in any state to walk on your own.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
007	S-still...! Wait... What happened with the bandits?
008	Incapacitated and bound. I instructed the Scarlet Legion to hand them over to the Envylian Guard.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
009	That's...good.
010	Thank you, Natalie.
011	F-for what?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0025
012	You really opened my eyes.
013	Heheh. Guess I can put that dissection on hold then, huh?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
014	You really intend to do that someday?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
015	Assuming you keep sparking. Someone's got to do something about that! It might as well be me.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0005
016	...
017	Gerald...?
018	You were right. I've been comparing myself. To him.
019	Leading the Scarlet Legion, I began to wonder which was more important: strength like steel or a light as bright as the sun?
020	Well, look at you, being all honest with yourself. And to even admit that I'm right...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
021	I no longer have any doubts.
022	Perhaps you are more suited to leading the Scarlet Legion.
023	But I am who I am, and that is enough.
024	Even if you forsake your vows, I will see them through to the end, the way that only I can.
025	Driven by my iron will.
026	Natalie.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
027	Yes?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
028	Here and now, I vow to protect those I care for in my own way, regardless of how long that may take.
029	So, please...remain by my side. Support me as you will.
030	G-Gerald, I...!
031	Of course I will, you idiot! Who else could support a sensitive, stubborn fool like you? It has to be me!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
032	Good. I'm counting on you.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
033	Hey... Can I ask you something?	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0002
034	Sure.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0006
035	How long do you intend on carrying me?! I can walk now! Clearly!
036	Why don't we go eat something sweet?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0007
037	Y-you're going to put me down first, right? We're not walking into town like this! No way! Put me down!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0014
038	Just let me carry you.
039	Oh...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_1034
040	Something you want to say?
041	It's just... You're smiling. I haven't seen you smile in so long...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0008
042	I promised dad that I'd...
043	Stop right there! Let the memory itself be enough. You don't have to put it all into words for me to understand.
044	We're going to stay together, right? That's all that matters.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0007
045	You're right. Let's go, Natalie. Together.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0004
