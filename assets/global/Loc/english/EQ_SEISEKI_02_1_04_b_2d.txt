001	All right. We finished them off.
002	We've still got a long way to go. Keep your guard up as we advance.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0004
003	Yep, got it!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
004	Hey, Kagura...about what we just discussed...
005	What about it? Look, I trusted you enough to tell you. Don't go blabbering off your mouth, all right?
006	I won't... I'm going to support you, Kagura!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0004
007	...Huh?
008	I know this might sound imprudent, but I was glad that you told me about your tragic past.
009	Th-that wasn't why I told—	VO_kagura.kagura_chara_0011
010	Besides, my goal is the same as yours.
011	I want to become a strong knight who can stand against any villain. I want to save as many people as I can!
012	So Kagura...let's do our best together! If the two of us fight side by side, I'm sure we can become much, much stronger than we are now!
013	H-hmph!
014	I thought you were just an airhead, but you do have some redeeming qualities.
015	Of course I do! Come on, let's shake on it!	VO_kanon.kanon_chara_0010
016	Huh...?
017	It'll be our way of apologizing to each other and agreeing to do our best in the future.
018	H-huh?! But...
019	Come on, let's do it!	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0008
020	O-okay...	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
021	Enough!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0015
022	?!
023	How long are you two gonna play at being buddies?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
024	We're not friends. We're nothing more than allies, working together to complete our mission.
025	Unfiltered emotions have no place on the battlefield. It will only hasten your death.
026	But then—	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
027	Do you want to contradict me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
028	No, but then...
029	What do you think is required on the battlefield, Captain?
030	Are you saying that the only thing needed is one's body and weapon?
031	No, I'm not.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
032	What you need is power.
033	Huh?	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0026
034	Overwhelming power to suppress evil.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_chara_0017
035	Captain Kudan...	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0022
