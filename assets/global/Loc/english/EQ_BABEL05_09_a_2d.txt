001	It's cold, so I started pulling on my overcoat.
002	I rid myself of the vestments of the Court Mage so that I might protect this country...all alone.
003	I knew so little of the world, and was enticed by it.
004	Magic interferes with the Alchemia in nature, materializing as the conjurer desires. It is an art which adheres to the guidance of the natural world.
005	To learn magic is to learn about nature itself. In other words, it teaches one the ways of the world.
006	I will learn all that there is to know.
007	The more I learn, the more distinctly my desires take shape.
008	They are sweet and profound, just like the tea cakes I so adore.
009	Yet, I didn't know that it is only we humans who have to balance our interference and the consequences that follow for things to go well.
010	Hey, what are you doing there? Is this a new game? I'm pretty sure you'll freeze to death.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0002
011	Oh, um, no. I'm, well...
012	Heheh. I-I guess you can say I sort of collapsed here.
013	Collapsere? Is that some kind of new art? Are you a street performer?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0006
014	Umm...
015	Ahahah. I wonder if I'm hallucinating things. Something smells sweet.	VO_milis.milis_sys_0011
016	Are you talking about this?
017	What's that?
018	It's a chiffon cake from the sweets shop across the street.
019	Cake? Is that food?
020	Don't you know what cake is?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
021	Huh? No...
022	That's no good. You're missing out on life. Try eating some.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0015
023	Are you giving it to me?
024	Everyone should have the opportunity to enrich their lives.
025	Th-thank you? Wow. It's so fluffy!
026	...
027	This is so delicious! I've never eaten anything like it before!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0026
028	Our first meeting.
029	Like me, Milis, the girl from the plains, also understood nature.
030	Perhaps that's why I felt so much warmth; so much kindness from her.
031	I'll come again to this city!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0041
032	When I do, let's eat sweets together again, okay? Next time I'll tell you all about my homeland!
033	Oh, that's right! You also need to teach me to become a gentlewoman like you, Lofy.
034	There's so much we've gotta do together!	VO_milis.milis_sys_0007
035	I will never see her again.
036	She was the last friend I ever made.
037	...
038	Those sweet memories of mine... Of the country with so many cakes and confections...
039	I wanted to hold on to them, no matter what.
040	Yet, it seems that in the end, I am destined to lose them.
041	...
042	I'm...crying.
043	I'm...
044	Am I still...alive?
045	Don't come any closer!	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1001
046	Is that...Ravina?
047	It is good to see that you are all right.
048	Good?! Exactly what part of this is good?!
049	Does she look all right to you?! You... It's your fault that Lofia—!
050	Ravina... Please. That's enough.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0004
051	I can't believe you, Michael! How could you let someone like her into the manor?!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0016
052	She very kindly carried Lady Lofia—who is in critical condition—all the way up here.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0031
053	It was the Holy Guard who attacked her in the first place!
054	I am not a member of the Holy Guard.
055	You're associated with the Holy Order, aren't you?!
056	I am an inquisitor of the Holy Order of Babel.
057	It is my duty to judge those who misuse Alchemy, and that includes members of the Holy Guard.
058	Well, you didn't stop them, did you?! You haven't done anything at all!
059	I offer you my sincerest apologies on behalf of the Holy Order.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0036
060	A Paladin of the Holy Guard attacked a Court Mage and used Alchemy without permission.
061	I cannot overlook this.
062	As such, I have sent him back under stringent guard, that the Inquisition may take the appropriate measures to deal with him.
063	Why was Lofia attacked, then?!
064	That matter...is currently under investigation.
065	You killed Lofia! It was all you lot! You're all to blame!
066	Please, at least listen to what I—!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
067	Don't come any closer!	VO_lavina.lavina_chara_1001
068	R-Ravina, you need to calm down! You mustn't—!	VO_michael.michael_sys_0015
069	Th-this is...magic!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
070	Lofia was always so kind to me!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
071	She's been protecting this country, but you...! You...!
072	You want to see uncontrolled power? Then watch! It's meaningless! This kind of power is meaningless!
073	It's unforgivable!	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0010
074	M-Michael! She's...!
075	The vast stores of magic contained within her are overheating!
076	O-overheating?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
077	Ravina...	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
078	L-Lofia?!
079	It's all right, I'm fine, so please... Please calm down.
080	Unnghh... L-Lofia, I'm so sorry! I... I thought... I...!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0043
081	Are her powers are out of control?!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0025
082	After your initial help, Lady Lofia, Ravina and myself have continued the treatment...
083	Yet Ravina is not yet capable of controlling her powers alone!
084	Her emotions, too, are running wild!
085	She's...!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0016
086	Ravina!
087	I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I-I'm just c-causing you trouble again!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0018
088	I'm going to make it all stop now.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
089	L-Lofia...!
090	I'm a Court Mage. It is my duty to protect the country. You needn't worry about me.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0038
091	Well, this isn't the first time that this has happened.	VO_michael.michael_sys_0007
092	M-Michael...!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0019
093	Will you lend me a hand?
094	...
095	As recompense for killing me?
096	...
097	I will not penalize you for that nonsensical statement.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_chara_1007
098	However, none of this is ideal.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0012
099	Alchemy, magic... It's all the same!
