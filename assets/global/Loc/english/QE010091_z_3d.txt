001	...Dias.
002	I received a report that you conquered one of Wratharis's forts alongside the Holy Guard. Well done.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0045
003	His deed of defeating the Demon is one deserving high praise.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0011
004	When the Holy Guard was backed into a corner, he saved—
005	Lord Gabirond, now is not the time for such talk.
006	What...?
007	Due to the resurrection of the Demon, the Holy Guard suffered extensive damage.
008	Sabareta, the leader of the Lizard Brigade, is the one who plotted its resurrection—he cannot be disregarded.
009	Your Majesty...please dispatch me immediately to aid the Blue Flame Guard.
010	Your worry is unnecessary, Dias. We've received news that Zeke, Logi...and Agatha are safe.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0007
011	Re-really?! What a relief!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
012	However, to use the expression 'out of the cauldron and into the fire,' the situation has become one we cannot sit idly by and watch.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0029
013	What does Your Majesty mean?
014	Zeke has advised me to initiate a peace treaty with Wratharis.
015	He recommends making Wratharis a dominion and appointing Agatha as their representative.
016	What?! Agatha as their representative?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
017	Peace with Wratharis...?! Impossible!	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0012
018	I have fought many a battle with Zeke and we have long been friends. However, in regards to this, I do not know what he is thinking.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0031
019	...Your Majesty, Captain Zeke was originally reluctant to join in the crusade against Wratharis.
020	Although this is nothing more than speculation...
021	Captain Zeke's guilt at having killed so many in the last war may be, now, leading him down the wrong path...	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0031
022	Please! My father is no fool; he would not allow himself to be consumed by some passing emotion. He must have a plan.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
023	...Regardless of what the truth is, it does not change the fact that Wratharis is a loathsome kingdom, responsible for initiating conflict.	VO_gabirond.gabirond_sys_0010
024	That it would so easily open its doors to establishing peace is very unlikely...
025	Your Majesty...allow Dias and me to reorganize the Holy Guard and make our way to Captain Zeke. I will confirm his true motives with my own eyes.
026	Very well. Dias, Gabirond, I leave it in your hands.	VO_patrick.patrick_sys_0045
027	Yes, Your Majesty!
028	Yes, Your Majesty!
029	What is father thinking?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
030	He's even involved Agatha...
031	Ag-agh!	VO_dios.dios_battle_0022
032	What's the matter, Dias?
033	N-no...it's nothing.	VO_dios.dios_battle_0021
034	... ...
035	In any case...we need to confirm my father's true motives!
