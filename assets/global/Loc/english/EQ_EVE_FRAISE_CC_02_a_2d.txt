001	A Few Days Later
002	…I didn't tell Moa that I went back to Eve's house. There was something about her I needed to investigate further.	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_1029
003	If something's going on, I want to help. She's doing her best to break the curse to be with the person she loves...
004	Yet she doesn't conform to society's expectations. I want someone as determined as she is to have all her hard work pay off…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0042
005	…Hm? What's going on?
006	I told you! I don't want to be a scout! I have no interest in joining any order of knights.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0013
007	…That's fine. However--	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0016
008	This is a critical moment for Lustburg. I wouldn't want one of our own giving aid to other countries--like Envylia, for example.
009	Like I said…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0012
010	…At any rate, once we shut down our borders, you won't be able to wander around aimlessly like before.
011	Stop wasting your time with that "Bridal Training," or whatever you call it, and just turn him into an insect already.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0001
012	A-An insect!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
013	As long as you have children, we won't give you any grief. They'll become an asset to our country.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0005
014	Besides don't you want to leave behind a legacy--all the more so with the man you love?
015	…
016	(What's with that tone…I don’t like how she's speaking to her.)	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0029
017	(…And why isn't Eve speaking up? She tore into that witch the other day.)
018	At any rate, think it over. You're a woman of Lustburg, after all.	VO_courtmage.courtmage_sys_0010
019	…*Sigh*
020	…Um…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
021	! R-Rachel! What are you doing here?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
022	Sorry to drop by without warning. I was wondering if we could talk… What happened just now?
023	Oh that…
024	They've been coming here a lot lately. Seems like they want to keep an eye on me.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
025	My guess is that it's because I used to be scouted by other countries to join their order of knights.
026	"Never act on behalf of another country! Always behave like a proper woman of Lustburg!" That's what they say.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0016
027	Yeesh… What gives them any right to say that sort of thing?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0030
028	…Lustburg witches are so pushy.
029	Aren't they? I couldn't agree more.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0004
030	I think what they say sounds totally unreasonable…but at the same time I sort of understand where they're coming from.
031	Lustburg may have fared better than others during the Lion Monarch's Charge, but we still suffered. So, I understand the instinct to be weary of other countries and want to protect our own.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
032	But…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
033	They're not bad people. They're doing their best for their country.
034	…That doesn't mean they can do whatever they want in the name of national security.
035	True…but I'm sure it isn't easy protecting an entire country!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
036	Look at Fraise. He's constantly working to protect Envylia. When I think of that, this kind of thing doesn't get to me.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
037	…
038	(Sure, they're trying to protect their country, but…still…)	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0031
039	(That doesn't give them the right to harass their own citizens. Right?)
040	…
041	Hey, Rach. Please don't tell Moa about what happened today, okay?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
042	She finally cheered up, so I don't want her worrying on my account. Please!
043	…If that's what you want, then you should make up with Fraise. I think that'll make her happy, too.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0003
044	What?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
045	…Sorry. I know it's wrong, but… I work part time delivering letters, and…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0036
046	That's why I know--that you and Fraise haven't been exchanging letters lately.
047	Lately, the higher ups have been checking mail a lot, so at first I thought they were blocking you. But…
048	…I-It's just a coincidence! Just bad timing!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0042
049	…Then may I take the letter on your desk? I can deliver it for you.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0001
050	What?!
051	Once the borders are closed it'll be even more difficult to send letters. You've got to tell him how you feel before that happens.
052	Y-You may be right…but...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
053	…My mom always said if you have something to say to somebody, then say it.	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_1029
054	If you don't, you'll regret it when it's too late. As long as there's someone you have something tell, you should try to tell them.
055	Your mom said that?	VO_eve.eve_chara_1003
056	She was the kind of person that would go to the forest with a bunch of food in case my dad, who had become an insect, was hungry.
057	Sounds like a wonderful woman.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0044
058	Yeah, well, thanks to that, the witches took all the insects in the area--for experimentation. Apparently, they grew TOO well.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0042
059	…How awful.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0021
060	But…I still think my mom had the right idea. Even if that idea was at odds with the country.
061	My mom was true to herself and the one she loved. That's why I think she was so cool…	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0005
062	…Ah, sorry! Look at me going on and on about myself. We're talking about you right now!
063	…Rach.
064	Anyway, I don't want you to give up! I want you to acknowledge your feelings.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0016
065	Otherwise, someday…I'm sure you'll regret it.
066	…That means a lot, Rach.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0033
067	But…it's done! I've already made up my mind! Because…
068	Made up your mind… But don’t you love Fraise?	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0030
069	W-Well…	VO_eve.eve_battle_0024
070	I……......ADORE him!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0018
071	Then…In that case, I'll help you!	VO_leychel.leychel_battle_0019
072	Oh! My letter…	VO_eve.eve_battle_0019
073	I'll be taking this. It's my duty as a delivery person to make sure your letter arrives safely.
074	EEEEK! W-Wait a minute! I'm not mentally prepared for this…	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
075	…
076	…That reminds me. Moa told me what an absolutely amazing person Fraise is.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0008
077	She did?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0006
078	He's kind and handsome and, to top it all off, he's a super elite knight! What a stud!
079	A knight who fights with pride is so dreamy, don't you think? I sure wouldn't mind if he rescued me, once or twice.	VO_leychel.leychel_sys_0007
080	Uh…Er…
081	I mean if you're not serious about him, I guess he's up for grabs, right?
082	R-Rach?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
083	Don't come crying if things turn out that way--
