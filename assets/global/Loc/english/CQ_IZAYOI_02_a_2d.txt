001	Umgf... Mmff... Umff... Umgf... Inari sushi is the best.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0016
002	I'm curious, second-generation Night Fox. What motivates you to plunder?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0002
003	Why? What a ridiculous question... How else am I suppose to carry on the name of the Night Fox as my teacher taught me to?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0010
004	Mmff... Yeah... Who does that guy think he is anyway, asking me something like that. Umgf...
005	Umgf... But... Why couldn't I just say all that when he asked?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
006	Whew! That was delicious. Time to get back to work! Things don't just steal themselves! Come on, Tsuru!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
007	Today's target is right over there! It's owned by a man notorious in this town for his shady business practices. Tsk, tsk.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
008	Fancy meeting you here, second-gen. You've got business here as well, have you?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0002
009	Chat Noir...
010	I am delighted that you remember me, my sweet little second-gen baby thief.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
011	Have you found an answer to my question yet? I seem to recall that you didn't respond...	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0004
012	I steal for those who are less fortunate, as my teacher instructed me. He was a chivalrous thief, and my duty is to continue his mission.
013	A duty and a mission, huh? My, but those are big shoes to fill. You must have respected him greatly.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0031
014	Do you not wish to surpass your teacher's legacy as the Night Fox?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0005
015	Surpass his...legacy?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
016	From your face, I can see that you have never even considered it.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
017	No. I only...	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0020
018	Only... What?
019	I only ever wanted to be just like him.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0022
020	I see. The first Night Fox was very important to you, wasn't he?	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0045
021	In fact, it seems to me that you're still chasing after him.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0005
022	You...might be right. When he was alive, that was all I ever did. I just wanted to get closer to him.
023	Closer, huh? If you ask me, I’d say that your teacher passed on the title to you so that you'd keep chasing him.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0031
024	What kind of chivalrous thief was he, exactly?
025	He was the kindest, strongest person I have ever known. He saved so many people.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0005
026	I'm...not sure I can be all that he once was.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0031
027	My teacher...always made protecting happiness his priority by being gentle and kind. I loved him for that.
028	Happiness, huh? It seems that my instincts weren't wrong, after all. Your teacher sounds like he was a good sort. I think that if that's your goal, then you're not doing too badly.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
029	Is it really that simple?
030	Maybe... Maybe it can be. Maybe I can achieve the same things as he did.	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0007
031	The happiness of the people is the true treasure of the Night Fox. I steal to protect. That is my answer.
032	Not bad. Seems like I've finally gotten what I wanted and met the true Night Fox.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0008
033	By the way, I plan to steal all the money and goods on this property. This will be my last job here in Wadatsumi.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0004
034	I thought you only stole art?	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0025
035	Heheh. Consider this...a challenge, of sorts.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0007
036	Let the games begin!
037	It’s all-or-nothing. Just a fun competition between fellow thieves to add a little extra spark to the night.	VO_chatnoir.chatnoir_sys_0008
038	If you think I'll just let you steal the reparations due to my people, you have another thing coming. I have my pride and my teacher's pride as the Night Fox on the line!	VO_izayoi.izayoi_sys_0012
039	If I lose, I will abandon the name of the Night Fox forever! Come on, Tsuru! We have something to prove.
