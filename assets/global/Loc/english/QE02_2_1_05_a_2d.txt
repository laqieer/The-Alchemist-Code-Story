001	We did it! It's barely damaged! What do you think, Alkemono?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0009
002	No problem, aye! Initiating hacking! Squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
003	...Alkaroid...Alkaroid...this is Alkemono speaking? Over.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_skill_0001
004	This is...hacking?	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
005	Well, that's a pretty direct approach.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
006	...Bzz..zzz...	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
007	The Alkaroid's eyes just lit up!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
008	This is Alkemono, aye... Can you hear me? Over.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0004
009	Ye...es...
010	Whoa! It spoke!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
011	Alkaroid... We want you to tell us where the Beckrams facilitate their executions.	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0003
012	Bzz... The execution venue...is changed...each time...	VO_aj10.aj10_favorite_0002
013	You don't know the exact place, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0031
014	Bzz... I am AJ10, a civil engineering Alkaroid...	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
015	There is no way...a low-class Alkaroid like me...would know.
016	All the top secret information...is managed by the Central Intelligence Administration...	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
017	Central Intelligence Administration! That's the agency that handles all domestic information!
018	From what I recall...after Alvarez became mayor, the location was changed...	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0031
019	Why did you answer us so honestly? Even as a civil engineering Alkaroid, you were still manufactured by the Beckrams, right?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
020	... ...	VO_aj10.aj10_sys_0012
021	Not good! There's a Hound! Whoa! One over here as well...?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
022	Jeez. Good job. Now let's go.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0022
023	What are we going to do with this Alkaroid, aye?	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0001
024	We're gonna take it with us, of course. Let's make a run for the motorbike!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
