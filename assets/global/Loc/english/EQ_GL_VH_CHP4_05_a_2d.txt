001	Why are you here? I gave no authorization.
002	Where are the guards?
003	I...
004	I want to know the truth.
005	Excuse me?
006	This operation doesn't concern you. Get out.
007	I'll deal with you later.
008	You won't silence me any longer.
009	People like me... Nameless orphans who fight your wars...
010	What happens to the ones that outlive their usefulness? Where do they go?
011	That's enough!
012	Lucan, Alymere!
013	Tell me, Queen.
014	Tch!
015	Is this the little misbehaving cur?
016	Guess she's the one the Doktor spoke of.
017	She's asking far too many questions. This isn't like her.
018	I'm beginning to think there was a lapse in her doses...
019	Doses...?
020	That's disgusting.
021	It's no different from treating them like slaves...
022	...Keep straddling your high horses. It makes little difference.
023	Stop wasting your words, Eliza.
024	Eliza retrieves a small device from her pocket and flicks it haughtily toward Red.
025	Back to sleep, hound.
026	The collar gripping Red's throat like a manacle lights up, and soon a convulsion wracks her body.
027	Ahhh!
028	You're just gonna let them do this to you, Red?
029	Step all over you like a dog?
030	B-Berith...
031	Come on! Spill their guts! Tear their throats out!
032	...Kill...
033	I'LL KILL YOU.
