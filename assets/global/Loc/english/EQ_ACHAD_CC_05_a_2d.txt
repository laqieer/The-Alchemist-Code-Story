001	Mama used to make the same face.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
002	You know, papa used to hit mama right in front of me. He'd call mama all sorts of terrible names that I won't repeat here.
003	He had a few screws loose, I think. He preferred to pretend I didn't exist.
004	Urgh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
005	Over time, my mama's spirit dwindled away. She stopped showing any emotion. Started talking less and less...	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
006	And then she lost control of her own body, because papa crushed her arms and legs, taking care to leave her alive.
007	He was quite the fanatic, I see that now. Always talking about how blood is filthy and flesh is sin...
008	That's why papa loved machines. Lifeless. Cold to the touch. Nothing relaxed him more than tinkering to his heart's content.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
009	Mama prayed and prayed for God to strike him down.
010	And do you know what happened? Papa died! But it wasn't thanks to her prayers. Oh, no.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
011	I killed him! I flew into a rage and killed him! Sound familiar?	VO_sechs.sechs_battle_0019
012	Just kill me.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
013	I'd hate to make Sol sad. Wouldn't you?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
014	Yes...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
015	You know, I thought mama would be happy if I killed papa for her.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0037
016	I really did. I was sure she'd thank me. Stroke my hair. Hug me close.
017	Instead, she lashed out at me. She clawed at me until  her nails started to peel and break.
018	Why?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
019	I asked her the same question. Why, Mama? Didn't I do good, Mama? You don't have to do as papa says anymore!	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
020	What did I do wrong? Should I have made him suffer more?
021	And this is what she told me. "Look at you, you've become just like your papa."
022	...!
023	Unbelievable, isn't it?	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0030
024	What are you going to do with me?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
025	What to do, what to do? I just wanted mama to love me.
026	From what I'd heard, mothers tend to be impressed by their children's creative endeavors.
027	So I created all kinds of plays, and performed them just for her. I went without food and sleep so that the show could go on.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
028	I made a play about God saving the commonfolk. A play about an erroneous king. A play about a human who defeated a massive dragon. A play about a dragon who saved the day. I made dozens of plays, and every last one featured a happy ending.
029	I thought they would make mama happy, but, somehow, I could never get through to her. Why do you think that was?
030	Please. Just stop already.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0015
031	That's it! That's exactly what she said to me!
032	Wh-what?	VO_acht.acht_sys_0025
033	"Stop it." "You're boring me." "You're wasting my time." She'd scratch my face and tell me the same thing you did, time and time again.
034	Yes, she'd leap onto the stage and claw at me, interrupting me and forcing the show to grind to a halt.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0031
035	Mama! Mama, no! You have to watch till the end! There's a happy ending waiting for you! Please, Mama! Just keep watching!
036	I'd beg her to let me continue, smiling all the while. Smile, smile, smile, smile, smile.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0008
037	The day I managed to finish a play for the first time was the same day mama's heart stopped.
038	Tragic, isn't it? I'd been planning to take her out to dinner! To celebrate the success of my first play!
039	But, in the end...that day never came.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0018
040	Tell me about the first person you turned...inhuman.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0031
041	I didn't know anything back then, except that I could somehow grant people power.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0037
042	One day, while wandering around Veda's lower floors, I encountered someone who was single-mindedly searching for power. He smiled widely as he approached me.
043	"God, please answer my prayers."
044	He was smiling as he said that? That's rather...unsettling.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
045	I was delighted by his request. Naively so.
046	Hmm...	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0031
047	Finally, I thought, here was something I could do. The idea filled me with a foolish sense of purpose.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0004
048	I didn't know what would happen, or how it would be done. Without any idea of what I was doing, I gave him the power he sought.
049	And, without even realizing I was doing it, I made him pay the price.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0030
050	And so he lost his sense of self and became inhuman.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0045
051	...
052	What was it he sacrificed?	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0001
053	Hello. I'd like one dimensional power, please.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0001
054	You...!
055	At this point in my life, I only believe in the unbelievable.
056	What do you mean by that?	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
057	The facade of the stage.
058	You have no sacrifice to offer me, therefore I cannot provide you with a revelation.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0014
059	Oh, come on. Don't be so greedy!
060	Ngh!	VO_acht.acht_battle_0022
061	I'm not asking for me, but for this girl!
062	What?!
063	She has already sacrificed that which made her human. Her arms were taken and converted into the dimensional powers that now reside within Nihil.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0003
064	Nihil lost nothing in exchange, and therefore gained a power greater than anyone else ever has.
065	Is that not enough?
066	...
067	Humans just love hearing themselves talk. In pondering that, I finally came up with a play that I just know mama will love.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0002
068	Mama will get to see herself on the stage, because you who so resembles her will play the lead role. The stage will be set by Sol.
069	And the story will be about changing this terrible world, steeped in the sort of violence that my papa perpetrated.
070	Am, you will play your part by fighting till you are in tatters.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
071	This is to be a classic play where the underdog perseveres and makes a glorious comeback.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0007
072	If she were to lose something else...	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0001
073	You have to use what you've got.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0006
074	Even I cannot say what would become of that small body of hers.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0018
075	...
076	Please.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0001
077	...!
078	It might hurt, but I will grit my teeth through the pain. No matter how wretched my existence becomes, I know I can endure.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0016
079	But I can't fight on an empty stomach. I need power.
080	There is no need to be so impatient. Hasty decisions will only beget regrets.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0002
081	Maybe so...but I'm fine with that.
082	Are you certain?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0043
083	I don't know how much longer I can keep going. But the harder I try, the further everything seems to slip away.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0029
084	I'm not capable of doing anything good. I'm at my limit, but there's only one place left in this world that will take me.
085	Bravo! A round of applause for the lady of the hour!
086	I don't want to leave. I don't want to be left alone.	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
087	You will never be able to atone for the sins you have committed. You are an ego-centric, deplorable seductress. You're barely human anyway. Little more than a puppet who can talk.
088	Is this truly what you want?	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0025
089	She has no will of her own. She is a mindless slave! To her, servitude is bliss!
090	My arms have become nothing more than tools for fighting.
091	But if that's all they're good for, then so be it.	VO_acht.acht_sys_0004
092	...
093	Power ungoverned by will...	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0031
094	I only provide what people seek.
095	I'm sure you understand better than anyone that such a choice is doomed to end in ruin.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0030
096	Perhaps. But maybe, just maybe...
097	You're still so naive.	VO_uroboros-b.uroboros-b_sys_0016
098	If there is even one among those ten who can turn it all around... I want to know.
099	Offer me your sacrifice, and you will receive...a revelation.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0006
100	This power... Could it be...?
101	Goodbye for now, little glutton.	VO_sechs.sechs_sys_0010
102	Has she been asleep the entire time?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
103	You were the same way when you became Number Seven.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
104	I found her passed out in Veda. Her body was probably overwhelmed after receiving that sudden burst of power.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
105	Why do I get the feeling you're not telling us everything?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
106	Why would he give you the full story? It's a bad idea to tell a former thief where you keep your valuables.
107	Come on, we're all friends here! And you said it yourself: I'm not a thief anymore.
108	Ngh...	VO_acht.acht_battle_0019
109	Our combined abilities allow us to maintain her vitals, but there's a limit to what we can do.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
110	The dimensional power has already eroded too much of her body. It's throwing off the delicate balance we've managed to achieve. She...might not have long left.
111	...
112	Still, I can't help but be a little jealous.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0031
113	Why? She's lost her arms and her left eye. She can't even eat anymore. It's a miracle she's still alive.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
114	But she's so strong and pure, and she has a place where she belongs, with people who are happy to care for her.
115	Including our esteemed leader.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
116	Sieba.
117	Hehe. Come to think of it, she would probably feel more at ease if a certain someone was to join her in bed.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0008
118	Vier.
119	Go on, Sol. Give her a cuddle.
120	Quit ganging up on me, will you?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
121	I dunno. Sounds like a terrible idea to me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0039
122	And why is that?
123	You look like you've got cold hands and feet. Nothing worse than that.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
124	Ohh, of course! Is that why you always wear gloves, Sol?
125	Haha.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
126	There's that sarcastic laugh we know and love.
127	Thank you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0033
128	You're welcome. By the way, I do have one idea of something we can try.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
129	To deal with my cold hands?
130	You know that wasn't what I was going to say.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0003
131	If the dimensional power is effectively poisoning her body, then maybe introducing another type of power into her will help balance things out.
132	Another power? Like Alchemia?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
133	We've used Alchemia for healing and recovery before, but using too much of it at once causes the body to reject it.
134	So, how do we do it?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
135	Excuse me? It was your suggestion!	VO_vier.vier_sys_0022
136	I'm just saying we should do whatever we can, even if the odds are slim.
137	There's a chance the Alchemia won't have any effect at all.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
138	Aha! The brains of the group joins us at last.
139	Is that my title?
140	Well, you are the most studious person here.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0038
141	I suppose that's true.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
142	And, dang. Your hair sure is pretty. Even I can tell it has a beautiful silver sheen.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
143	Y-yes, well... Vier helped me take care of it earlier. I appreciate, the...um...compliment.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0047
144	Can we get back to talking about what's important here?
145	R-right. If we were to follow Sieba's proposal, I think we should create something like a vaccine. If we were able to introduce something that functioned like antibodies into her system, she might stand a chance.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0001
146	A vaccine, huh? If we can extract Alchemia from a source of dimensional power... Do you really think it could work?
147	We won't know unless we try.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0006
148	And here's the muscle of the group! Gotta love that confidence.
149	Why don't we use the Phantom Soldiers that wander around Veda?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0001
150	That's a great idea!
151	If we go about it properly, we could probably use Alchemy to create a lump of concentrated Alchemia imbued with dimensional power.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0045
152	Can we do that? Can we use Alchemia to balance out the dimensional power? To stabilize Amu's condition?
153	Only one way to find out. It's all or nothing.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0005
154	...
155	Hey. Why the long face?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0004
156	The Phantom Soldiers in Veda are composed entirely of dimensional power. If we kill them, they'll just disappear.
157	Then we'll just have to beat them to a pulp without killing them.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
158	Can you handle that?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0002
159	Granted, it's harder to catch someone than to kill them. You run the risk of leaving yourself open to counter-attacks.
160	It'll be very different from just climbing the tower and killing everything in sight. Besides...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
161	Are you sure about this?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
162	Ew! Don't pretend to care about us. It's weird.
163	We're not fighting to climb Veda this time.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
164	Amu's arms became your strength, didn't they?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0001
165	And you are our leader.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0003
166	Which means that you're not really the one who's guiding us.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
167	It's Amu. Amu's arms.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0037
168	...!
169	Then I'd better do my all to get this done.
170	As we've already discussed, it's going to be hard to capture such a strong enemy alive.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
171	On top of that, it's going to take time to successfully transmute a Phantom Soldier. We're going to need the power and knowledge of Alchemy on our side.
172	It goes without saying, but I won't be able to do this alone. Especially not in a place like Veda, where enemies just keep coming.
173	I'll require one commander to lead the charge. At least two people to attack and capture the enemy. And at least two more to provide backup and work on the alchemical components.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
174	Well, the two of us are pretty good at handling a crisis. Aren't we, Zwei?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0037
175	Us two?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0007
176	Very well. Sieba and Zwei will be in charge of attacking and capturing Phantom Soldiers.
177	I'll stay behind and watch over Amu and our hideout. Someone has to.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0031
178	Hehe... What about me? I'm much better at killing than fortune-telling.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0010
179	Yes, take her with you.
180	All right, then. Füry and I will be bringing up the rear and performing the Alchemy.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
181	That's four people in total. We're missing a commander.
182	No, we're not. Our bodyguard is perfect for that role.
183	Bodyguard?	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0031
184	Oh, yeah. That old guy.
185	I'll come along if you're climbing Veda.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
186	Ooh! Does that mean you're finally ready to join us?	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0001
187	Sorry. No.
188	Ooh, rejected again! You're really into older men, aren't you, Sieba?	VO_vier.vier_sys_0007
189	Am not!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
190	At any rate, you'll be taking the reins on this one.
191	Got it.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
192	...
193	What's up, Sol?
194	I just wanted to thank everyone for joining me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
195	I'm glad you're here with me.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
