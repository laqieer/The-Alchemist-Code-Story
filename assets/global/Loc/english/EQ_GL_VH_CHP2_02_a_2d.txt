001	- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -
002	Welcome back, Emrys. Godslayer spoke glowingly of your performance.
003	Happy to be of service, Madam Eliza.
004	Is there another "affair" you require taking care of?
005	Not for the moment, no. I called you here for another reason.
006	Leave us.
007	As you wish, Queen.
008	Eliza produces a small humming device and holds it up with a smile.
009	Are you familiar with this device? We use it to measure Alchemia levels within our patients.
010	It just so happens that one of my subjects has turned up something...interesting.
011	Take a look.
012	This signature...
013	Is that of your dear sister Eira? But that is not all.
014	We discovered traces of a second signature alongside hers.
015	Tell me, Emrys. Have you ever wondered about the origin of your sister's condition?
016	Do you really suppose it is nothing more than a rare curse?
017	...What do you mean?
018	This second signature belongs to a man named Soren.
019	An apathetic researcher who exploits the innocent for his own nefarious goals.
020	Turning to live subjects, he inundated them with Alchemia, causing the sickness that now afflicts one individual each generation.
021	I need not elaborate which clan he chose for experimentation.
022	(Something doesn't quite add up about this theory.)
023	(So many have fallen victim to the curse, and the origin conveniently reveals itself only now...)
024	(I should conduct my own investigation later. As for her...)
025	Unbelievable... That a single person could be the cause of so much suffering...
026	Where is he?
027	In a mansion right here in the city, like a cornered rat.
028	Awaiting the justice we are about to dispense.
029	Inform the entire branch to prepare for the assault.
030	Contact Nesha and tell her to proceed with her mission.
031	Oh, and if it comes down to it... Tell her she has my permission to break her target's legs, if it will stall him.
032	Emrys, you will join us in ridding the world of this black-hearted villain, yes?
033	I would like nothing more than to see his life forfeit for his crimes.
034	As you well deserve. Good hunting, Emrys.
035	(I wonder if I'm going down the wrong path.)
036	(I swore that no one would ever pay for my mistakes with their lives again...)
037	(...No matter what happens, I will find the truth myself.)
038	- Slothstein City Outskirts -
039	Very well. Send Queen my love for the permission.
040	I think I will enjoy having this one on his knees. Very much so...
041	Uh, I have to go, miss. It's urgent!
042	She'll throttle me if I don't show up soon, so...
043	Goodbye!
044	Wait! Mister Siegfried! Come back!
045	Hmhmhm...
046	Oh, this is going to be a treat, my little ladykiller.
