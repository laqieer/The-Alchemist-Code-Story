001	Reactor, check! Fuel, check! It'll be a little rocky, so be sure to hold on to something!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
002	Really? You just got here! Aren't you a busy one?
003	You didn't have to come with us, you know?
004	I mean, I'd rather not get involved, but you've never entered the mines, have you?
005	Well...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
006	To find the inspection team, you'll have to make your way to the underground.
007	You're headed into a mine that's like a labyrinth.
008	People with no sense of the land here are bound to get lost.
009	I guess you're right...	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
010	That means you'll need someone like me to guide you.
011	You're familiar with the mines?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
012	Of course. The mines on the surface below this city are under my father's control.
013	Right. You're the son of the mayor of Redington.
014	That might not be good for much, but at least my knowledge of the mining tunnels can help you now.
015	But listen, our first priority must be to rescue the villagers.
016	Land the airship at these coordinates. It's the fastest way to get there.
017	Roger that!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
018	This place is nothing like the floating city. I can hardly believe it's part of the same region.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
019	The buildings over there are quite simple, aren't they? It looks like they've been rebuilt a number of times.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0045
020	You're exactly right. And any time now...
021	Ah! That was an earthquake just now?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
022	This land is the lair of the Cursed Beast. Whenever it turns in its slumber, the shaking begins.
023	The earthquakes get much worse than this.
024	When Belphegor is in a bad mood, villages around here are decimated instantly.
025	That's how much of a threat this region's Cursed Beast is...	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
026	Yeah... This is why I've gotta help save everyone from this suffering!
027	Adaleigh, focus on the task at hand. What did we come here to do?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
028	To stop the Fallen that appeared in the mines, and to save Icona.
029	To do that, you must stay focused on your mission.
030	Yeah... You're right.
031	Well, would you look at that.
032	W-what?
033	Nothing. Just thinking how you've mellowed out lately.
034	Kinda gives me a jolt to see it. I might even say it's almost inspiring. Hello, there! How's it going?
035	Oh, it's Mister Minario! What brings you here today?
036	It's too quiet here. Something is off. If the Fallen were just here, there should be more alarm.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
037	You're right. That voice on the transmission was panicking, but...
038	I don't want to worry the people here for no reason. Leave this to me.
039	Hey, we're looking for someone. Anyone seen a lady engineer with a mechanical arm around here?
040	I haven't, but I'll ask around.
041	Please do! I really appreciate that.
042	Not a problem at all! Anything for you!
043	Oh, wow. You're respected around here, aren't ya?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0044
044	Well, I've picked up some respect while doing my job as a Detective.
045	You know, the people here are different from the people in the floating city.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
046	Ah, well. This is a ruthless land. In conditions like these, the only way to live is to support one another.
047	They have to be different from the people above, who worry only about themselves.
048	I'd like to do what I can to make life easier for the people here...
049	For now, the least I can do is listen to what the people have to say and act as a voice for them.
050	...
051	Well, there's no use in worrying about those things now.
052	First, we've gotta gather information and figure out where the inspection team—
053	Aaaaaaaaahhh!
054	What was that?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
055	Hey! What's going on?!
056	F-F-Fallen! They came welling up out of the ground with that earthquake!
057	Waginau!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
058	Right!	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
059	Dammit, we've been caught off guard! The villagers need to get to safety!
060	That's no problem, but what about you, Mister Minario?
061	That's obvious! It's times like these that the people from "above" are supposed to do their jobs!
062	Spiritbonding can handle the Fallen! Let's purify them before they harm the villagers!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0015
