001	O storm...release thy true form now! ...Everyone!	VO_tamith.tamith_battle_0014
002	Thank you, Tamis! Tina, now!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0033
003	Rega, together now!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1015
004	Leave it to me...here we go!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0038
005	Hyaaaaaahhhhh!!!
006	......!!!
007	...We did it.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0046
008	Thank you, Rega. If you weren't here, who knows what would've happened...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0033
009	Heheh. I'm glad you're all okay!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
010	Hold on...you have the power of the wind?! What's going on?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
011	I didn't have time to show you my power last time we met. Let me reintroduce myself: I'm Rega, a Tehre-born Wind Shaman!	VO_rega.rega_chara_1005
012	That means that a Wind Shaman exists for each of the three factions!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0012
013	Exactly! Well, last time, Tehre told me I wasn't supposed to tell you guys!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
014	But I already knew about it! Tehre told me that you two were Wind Shamans.	VO_rega.rega_sys_0007
015	...That's why I wanted to be your friend.
016	What are you doing here, Rega? How did you know we were here?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
017	Tehre told me to help you out if things got too bad...since I have the power of the wind like you guys!	VO_rega.rega_sys_0004
018	I see! You know...it's impressive how strong your wind is for someone your age.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0024
019	Asena...!
020	What a sacred wind...	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0009
021	But...it's so...weak...!	VO_tamith.tamith_sys_0022
022	Even I can feel it. Asena's power has been consumed to the point that...the Godwolf is barely managing to stand!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0022
023	Is this the price for suppressing the power of Beelzebub?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
024	No. You are aware of nothing. You burden nature in order to sustain your existence. You've abandoned the responsibility of living by your own hands!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0039
025	You do not see that this current situation is a result of your over-reliance on Asena.
026	We...really were relying too much on Asena.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
027	We've been living blissfully...while Asena has shouldered our burden.
028	......
029	How foolish we've been. We had to witness it to realize!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0019
030	We...were aware of nothing. Tehre was right about everything!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0020
031	I believe...Asena must be released...for the sake of Saga's future!
032	I better understand now...what Tehre was talking about. We should release Asena...from this burden.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0045
033	Asena...I'm truly sorry. We took too long to realize just how heavy the burden you carry is.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0036
034	Please forgive us for having to see it with our own eyes before truly realizing. We promise to restore the balance of nature...at all costs!
035	We will return Saga to a land where humans and nature can co-exist in peace!
036	We will restore the Wind Matter and save you, Asena!
