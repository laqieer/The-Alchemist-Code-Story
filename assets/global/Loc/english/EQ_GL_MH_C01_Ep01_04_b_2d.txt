001	We made it back! We couldn't have done it without you, Siegfried.
002	I did what I could. After all, if you didn’t help me out, I'd probably still be wandering in the woods.
003	We owe you our lives. Please stay for a while so we can offer our hospitality as gratitude.
004	I am curious about your village, so don't mind if I do.
005	May I see the Divine Protector of your village? I have heard much about it but not seen it in the village.
006	Every year, our Divine Protector takes leave for a fortnight to rest from its labor of coming down to Babel to protect us.
007	This is why during this period we have to undertake more hunts to cull the hostile wildlife.
008	If you stay till our Divine Protector is rested, I'll request an audience for you.
009	I will appreciate that greatly.
