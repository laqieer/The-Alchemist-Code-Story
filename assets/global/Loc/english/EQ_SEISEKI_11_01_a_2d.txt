001	Ack...K-Kanon...I leave the rest to you! Take on our resolve...and please...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
002	Save this world from Greed Dike!!!
003	Dieeee!!!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0032
004	Aghhhhhhhhh!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0028
005	Ack...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
006	Huh...?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
007	I come back to this world for the first time in a while and this is the mess that awaits me?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
008	?! Wa...wahh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
009	Who are you? Did you come to help her?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
010	I am a wandering soul. I was merely drawn here by a violent clash of power. However...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
011	No...way!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0026
012	If you intend to harm this girl, consider your life forfeit!
013	K-Kudan?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
014	Kudan...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
015	You... You're alive! How can this be?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
016	A certain someone sent me back from the world of darkness. Hehe...more like kicked me out.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
017	A certain...someone?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
018	Ah... I know you. If I am not mistaken, you are the former Captain Kudanstein of the Holy Guard. The one who fell into the darkness.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
019	Silence. How dare you interrupt my conversation with Kagura.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
020	Ha! You're interesting! When was the last time someone spoke to me in such a disrespectful way?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
021	I don't see your point.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0031
022	My point is...you're a fool for underestimating me. I will make you regret speaking to me like that. Die!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
023	?!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
024	Kudan!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
025	Worry more about yourself, redhead. I still plan to kill you, after all.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
026	Urg...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
027	...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
028	Ugh...! What was that...?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
029	You survived?! You're tougher than you look.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
030	Kudan! Run!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0027
031	...Bang.	VO_sol.sol_battle_0004
032	Nngh! Oof... You...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0019
033	What?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0028
034	All you had to do was mind your own business...	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0016
035	What are you...?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
036	Kagura, this isn't your battle anymore. Run!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0007
037	Huh?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
038	This isn't about protecting you. That's not... That's not my right any longer.
039	However, there's a piece of trash here just begging to be taken out. Who am I to deny its wishes?	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0010
040	Kudan...!
041	Hmph. This is just not my lucky day... I'll never hear the end of it if my people learn I've been made a fool of!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
042	Go, Kagura!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0013
043	Kagutsuchi!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0018
044	You think I'll just let you escape now?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_1017
045	You don't seem to understand your situation.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0024
046	?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0018
047	It's not Kagura who needs to worry about escaping right now. It's you.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_battle_0017
048	You... You'll pay for your disrespect with your life!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0012
049	I'm afraid you've got it backwards.	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0032
050	Meanwhile...in Northern Pride.
051	Suzuka! Tell me about our defensive guard! And how is the evacuation of the residents going?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
052	The evacuation has been completed! Basheeny and Kazahaya are at the front lines. Everything is prepared as you instructed!
053	Good. Those Templars are capable of appearing out of nowhere. Be on your guard!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
054	Understood! I swear, if those Templars so much as point a finger at you, Mistress...
055	So there is a samurai in the Holy Guard... This is the first I am hearing of this.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
056	Huh?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
057	Suzuka!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
058	Huh...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
059	Very impressive... You stopped my sword. As expected of a Lord Commander, you are no slouch.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
060	Ack! Who are you?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
061	I am Zehn, of the Templars.	VO_zen.zen_chara_1001
062	The Veda Templars?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0025
063	When did you...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
064	As a Templar, I am here to take your life in the name of the dream my comrades and I share.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
065	What the...?! Are you...dancing...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
066	...?! Everyone, watch out! That's an attack!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
067	Huh?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
068	Ahhhh!!!
069	Huh...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
070	Everyone...!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
071	It's done. Say your goodbyes to this world now, while you still can.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
072	Ack...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
073	It's done. Say your goodbyes to this world now, while you still can.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
074	Ack...! All the Paladins with me, taken down in an instant... How is this possible?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
075	Mistress, listen! He uses a swordfighting style known as "Iai" in which he draws and sheaths his sword every time he attacks... You must take advantage of that!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
076	Iai? Taking down an enemy as you draw your sword...? That's...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
077	Even swordmasters find it impossible to track the movements of a sword using this style!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0016
078	I believe that this man has refined his skill to maximize the speed he can achieve while still maintaining control of the tip of the blade, allowing him to do a lot of damage from a relatively safe distance!
079	...!
080	You were able to discern that much about my Iai fighting style with a single glance? How unexpected. Your skill with the sword must be above average.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
081	I can only see some of it... I've faced numerous opponents who have made use of the Iai style, and the degree of ability is completely different from anything I've ever seen!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0021
082	If this isn't timed just right, we're done for!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0006
083	Suzuka!
084	Attempting to block my movement in order to allow your mistress to escape... How quaint.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
085	Allow my Mistress to escape...? I am not foolish enough to overestimate my own swordfighting skill.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0012
086	I know that I am no match for you!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0010
087	What...?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0012
088	Steel Cutting Flash!!!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0032
089	Hmph...	VO_zen.zen_battle_0001
090	Nngh... Mistress, I will be your shield so that you can take this man down!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
091	Wha—?! No! Suzuka, no!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
092	I see. You plan to use your own body to slow me down.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0045
093	My Mistress is the light in the darkness... She is necessary to help calm this chaotic world. I won't let someone like you lay your hands on her!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0020
094	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0032
095	Huh...?!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
096	He disappeared...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
097	To understand the limits of your own strength, and yet be willing to sacrifice your own life... I am not unmoved. I must revise my opinion of you.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
098	Suzuka, behind you!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
099	Ack!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
100	However, not unlike you, I too have someone who depends on me.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
101	I hope you will not think less of me for my unwavering belief that the path he lays forth is the one true path.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
102	U-ughh!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0026
103	Suzuka!!! Run!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
104	You?! What are you doing? Why have you crashed this battle?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0020
105	That...is my question. Who are you?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0029
106	I cannot allow you to slay this person.	VO_spica.spica_battle_0010
107	Huh?
108	This woman is a friend of Kanon, a person to whom I owe a great debt.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0010
109	Spica?!
110	I am pleased to see that you are well. Chloe directed me here. I have come to lend what help I can.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
111	You brought backup? No matter.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
112	I need only to destroy you, and another loose end will have been resolved.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0004
113	From behind?!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
114	Huzzzaahhh!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0032
115	Hmph. Deflected again. You all are giving a new meaning to the power of friendship.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
116	I'm sorry, Kanon. I came to help you, but now you're helping me.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0035
117	No, I really appreciate that you're here, Spica!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
118	The biggest issue is that man's strength...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
119	Yeah! His skill is on a whole other level.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
120	Hmph... This is not what I expected.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0030
121	...!
