001	Huzzahhh!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0004
002	What is going on here?!	VO_chloe.chloe_sys_0025
003	Nina challenged Captain Vettel to a one-on-one battle!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0030
004	She said she wanted to test herself, to see how well she can fight now!
005	Wh-what was she thinking?!	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0020
006	What's the matter? Is that all you have? You can't defeat me just by blocking!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0006
007	There!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0001
008	Huzzzaaaahh!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0032
009	Not gonna happen!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0013
010	Ahhh!
011	Take this!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0007
012	Ngh!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
013	Haa...haa... D-did I get him?
014	Ack! Hrgh...ngh!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0022
015	That was a good attack, but it won't be enough.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
016	Not yet...! I'm not done yet!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0019
017	Don't push yourself. I struck you with all I have. You should barely be able to stand right now.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
018	That's not true! I can still fight!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0043
019	Why are you pushing yourself so much? I could feel how much you've grown in just that one attack.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
020	Isn't that why you challenged me? So that you could get a feel for your own strength?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
021	No. That's not the reason why I challenged you.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0016
022	I'm... I'm still chasing after him. I never stopped! I admire him so much.
023	The man with a will of iron, who was bright like a scarlet flame!
024	You mean...!
025	Dedicate your sword to the pursuit of justice. That's what he told me. Well, my justice is the iron will that I got from him!	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
026	I wanted to find out whether or not I've become someone he could be proud of.
027	That's why I wanted to fight you, Captain Vettel!
028	I'm not quite there yet, but if I can at least get close to you, who stood shoulder to shoulder with him, then...	VO_neena.neena_chara_1003
029	I know that he would be proud of me. So this is no time for me to roll over and give up!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
030	Nina...
031	I can still fight! My iron will is still intact!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0030
032	I'll hop over any wall it takes to be more like him!
033	So let's keep going! Get ready, Captain Vettel!	VO_neena.neena_battle_0010
034	...
035	You have truly shown me your iron will here today.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0037
036	Huh?	VO_neena.neena_sys_0006
037	As such, there is no need for us to continue this fight.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
038	Nina...I hereby appoint you as the new vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
039	Wh-wh-what?!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0025
040	No complaints, I trust? Not only are you carrying on Gerald's will, but you've also shown great improvement in a short period of time.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0025
041	Of course, there is still room for improvement. However, I do think that you are well suited for the role.
042	It is not as if the position can stay empty forever. I've been looking for someone who can be trusted with this responsibility.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
043	B-but...!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0029
044	You work hard during regular training, but you also train early in the morning and late into the night. The progress you've shown in this short time is impressive.
045	What?! You knew about that?!	VO_neena.neena_chara_1005
046	It's a captain's job to know whatever they can about their subordinates.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
047	Captain Vettel, I...!
048	From here on out, I want you to help me improve the Scarlet Flame Guard. I feel that I am right in entrusting this task to you.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0041
049	Do you accept, Nina?
050	Y-yes! I'm not sure I'm suited for the role, but I will do my very best!
051	I'm counting on you, Nina.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0034
052	Whoa!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0024
053	Eep!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0028
054	Awesome! You're awesome! Great job, Nina!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0007
055	Um, Victor, you're a little...loud.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
056	Don't worry about silly little things like that! I'm really happy for you! Congratulations!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0008
057	Um... I don't think that's possible.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0030
058	So you're vice-captain now, huh? Oh man, I'm so jealous—but you've really earned it. Darn it! I I'll catch up to you, I swear!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0023
059	See? I'm not the only one who's noticed how hard you've been working.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0007
060	I'm sure that everyone will approve of your appointment.
061	Thank you!
062	(Sir Gerald, please watch over me. Your will, your fire...)
063	(I will never let them be extinguished!)
064	Nina, you...
065	(I could tell that her training has paid off just by watching her fight.)	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0019
066	(...)
067	(I...)	VO_chloe.chloe_battle_0024
