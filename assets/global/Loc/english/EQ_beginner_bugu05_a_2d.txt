001	Do you understand so far? By the way, the current technology on the continent only allows you to evolve until 5★.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
002	All right, from here I'm going to give a little more advanced lessons that are important for becoming stronger.	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1020
003	According to a unit's Limit Break Count, the number of pieces of gear that are equippable increases.
004	At first, all units can equip one piece of gear. Limit Breaking 10 times allows two, and 25 times allows three pieces of gear to be equipped.
005	In other words, a unit can equip a maximum of three pieces of gear.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
006	Also, there are three different types of gear. Weapons, Armor, and Accessories.
007	I mentioned this at the beginning, but the gear chooses the user.
008	Some gear items are special and can only be equipped by specific Jobs.
009	There's no point in someone who fights with a sword carrying a gun, right? In other words, a sword-fighting Job should carry a sword.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0007
010	Also, I said you can use a maximum of three pieces of gear, but you can only equip one Weapon and one Armor each.
011	You can equip up to three accessories. However, you can't equip gear with the same name.
012	No making your repertoire Doll, Doll, and Doll. You can't do that and it's just too cute.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0008
013	When two pieces of gear have the same effect, only the stronger one will have an effect, so no duplicate effects can be used. Use caution.
014	For example: if an HP +100 Armor and HP +50 Weapon are equipped, the HP +100 effect will be prioritized.
015	Well then, from here I'll teach you the about the strength of gear. In other words, your gear's true power.	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_1020
016	Depending on the gear you use, some have special powers. Those are the gear with souls.
017	If you equip these, you can use their special skills. These can range from Magic to Recover, etc.
018	For example: even if your Job doesn't have a Recovery Skill, you will be able to use that skill when using certain gear.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
019	This may allow you to drastically change and improve. Although, on the flip end, it's not your regular skill, so it can sometimes consume more Jewels.
020	Amongst those, there is gear specified for certain units. If a unit uses one of these, it will serve them well in battle.
021	Such gear is powerful. Depending on the user, it can allow a powerful Gear Ability to be used.
022	There is a noticeable difference in strength between units that can and cannot use Gear Abilities. You should try testing it out in the Arena.
023	Phew...I'm not really this talkative usually, so I'm a bit tired now... Well then, let's try to evolve to 5★.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
024	In order to evolve to 5★, gear needs to be at Lv 25. Also, it requires 100 Moon Star Armor Shards.
