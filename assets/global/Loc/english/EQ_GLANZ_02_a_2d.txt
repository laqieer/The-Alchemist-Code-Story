001	You looking for someone?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0002
002	I am. I'm here to report the results of the other day's investigation to General Neville, but...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
003	Ah, I see. You just missed him. He's been busy running around lately.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0045
004	You can still catch him over there. I just spoke to him myself. Thanks to that, I'm about to be pretty busy myself.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0011
005	He's looking for some key for the ruins. He doesn't even know what it's supposed to look like, but he wants me to find it. Outrageous, don't you think?
006	Who knows what he's planning. Could be the salvation of Wratharis. Could be its destruction.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
007	Can he be trusted?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
008	Maybe, maybe not. Just be careful. He might ask you to take care of some bothersome task.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0030
009	I wouldn't mind if he did. That is my job.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
010	Right. Well, if you're fine with it...	VO_freed.freed_sys_0006
011	I wonder... Why is it that people rush through life?	VO_freed.freed_sys_0016
012	Both time and history will eventually pass, if we only allow ourselves to drown in oceans of books.
013	I don't particularly feel like I'm rushing through life.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
014	I just choose to delve into battlefields instead of books.
015	Ah. Then you, too, must feel stifled by this world.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0031
186	Never really feeling alive, like you are a balloon floating aimlessly in the air.
016	Oh, this world truly is a stifling place.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0004
017	Have you considered that those you see as rushing through life are just trying to escape such feelings?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0005
018	That's an interesting way to put it. So there is nothing one can do about this feeling while living.	VO_freed.freed_sys_0006
019	Unfortunately, no.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
020	This concludes my report.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
021	...All right.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0005
022	Glanz, hold it. I have more to discuss with you.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0001
023	Yes?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
024	I'm sure you already know this, but there is talk of nominating you to join the order.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0003
025	Anastasia? I told her not to.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
026	Our secret weapon seems to be quite infatuated with you. This is highly unorthodox, but there is no way we can refuse her recommendation. Wratharis is in desperate need of soldiers.
027	I'm sorry, but I have no intention of taking you up on that offer. Though I will be happy to take on another contract.
028	I...see. That is quite a shame. Well then, I do have another task for you.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0031
029	That didn't take long.
030	I want you to investigate a particular noble. He is suspected of unauthorized digging in the ruins. Grave robbing, essentially.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0003
031	We are almost entirely sure of it, but we cannot officially take action without solid evidence.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0030
032	This will be a commission from me personally. I want you to sneak into his mansion and steal whatever evidence of this you can find.
033	I don't have much experience in thievery. I mean, if you just want me to eliminate him...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
034	I understand. I have already prepared a team to assist you in this matter.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0004
035	The Unicorn Knights. They're a group of bandits who operate within that noble's domain.
036	Bandits, huh? So you want me to assist them?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0037
037	(A mercenary and some bandits... I see. He's employing the most expendable for this mission.)
038	I'm glad you understand. Their chief will fill you in on the details.	VO_neville.neville_sys_0034
039	This is the Unicorn Knights' hideout? They're all little girls.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
040	Wait... You are...
041	Glizzy?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
042	So you're a member of the Unicorn Knights?
043	Chief is in that house there.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
044	How did you know what I came here for?
045	I won't lead you there. I can't sleep around there.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0039
046	Uh, okay. Thank you.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0033
047	You're the chief of this band? I'm Glanz, here by General Neville's request.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
048	Ah, yeah, I was expecting you. Heard you were good. Imma thank you in advance for your help.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0006
049	So... Almost entirely girls, huh?
050	A place for girls who have nowhere else to be. That was what our previous chief Helza intended this to be.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0031
051	We kept taking in runaways, and before we knew it, we grew to be like this.
052	Does that excuse having them turn to banditry?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
053	It was either this or they would have had to endure a worse fate.
054	Those who can't fight gotta do whatever else necessary to survive. It's usually not pretty.
055	Not everyone's strong like you.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0030
056	...
057	You've already met Rochelle, haven't you? The others know that you're meant to be here, so feel free to hang around.	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0003
058	I already have some of ours scouting the mansion in question. I'll find you when we're ready to make our move.
059	All right.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
060	Hello Glizzy.
061	You don't need to be polite. I'm used to working with people I don't know.
062	I... What?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
063	Hm... You know, I've been wondering. What is with your outfit?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
064	I'm a black and white bear. Hmph.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
065	No, I mean...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039rachel_sys_0010
066	I stand out in battle. They target me. Very obvious.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0010
067	So you want to be targeted?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
068	Hungry. This black and white bear needs to eat.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
069	Then why don't you go join the others and have your meal over there?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
070	Does Glizzy not know? Hungry bears are vicious. Hungry is angry.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
071	But this angry needs to lie dormant.
072	Huh?
073	So... I'm gonna lie down. G'night.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
074	Wha—?! Are you going to sleep again?! You should really get to bed before you—	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0026
075	Wake me and I'll bite. I'm gonna sleep.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0012
076	O-okay...
077	I'm home!
078	Hey, wait, Rochelle! Rochelle, are you sleeping?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
079	Oh, wow. You usually never sleep like this unless I'm around. You'll catch a cold lying out here!
080	Mmmmnn... Black and white bears don't catch colds.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
081	I don't care what color you are, lying on the floor like this is not good for you! Geez.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
082	...
083	Uh, who are you supposed to be? Haven't seen you around before.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
084	Ah, I'm Glanz. I'll be working with all of you on this job.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
085	Oh yeah! Chief did mention you! A pretty strong mercenary, right? I'm Ishuna. Nice to meet you!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
086	I'm the fastest one in the Unicorn Knights! Heck, I'm the one that got all the information we have on that noble guy!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0007
087	You did?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
088	(That guy's making these kids carry out intelligence missions?)
089	Izzy, you went alone? I told you I was gonna go with.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
090	Chief's orders! Besides, he wouldn't ask me to do something I couldn't handle. He knows what I'm capable of!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
091	It was easy enough for me to take care of it myself!
092	But you're hurt...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0014
093	Th-this is nothing! I don't even feel it!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
094	Besides, I wouldn't be a proper bandit if I made a big fuss over something like this. Don't you agree?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
095	Glizzy won't agree. She's sparkly-shiny.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0039
096	What?
097	I can sleep if sparkly-shiny is with me. Even if icky-stickies are near.
098	Glizzy is my second pillow.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
099	Huh?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
100	Izzy is my first pillow. Pillows are important.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
101	I guess she likes you.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
102	Is that what she's saying?
103	Rochelle can't sleep around people. Well, except around me or Chief Helza for some reason.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
104	Huh...
105	Helza is best pillow. I'm a black and white bear, but I can be near people because of her.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
106	Uhm...?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
107	Chief was Rochelle's savior. Well, she was for everyone here in one way or another.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
108	Is she not around anymore?
109	She was killed near the border of Envylia. Can't really fuss about it since we were the villains, you know?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
110	Still... I am sorry to hear it.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0035
111	Erm... Not to be insensitive, but didn't you need to report to the chief?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
112	Ah, oh yeah! Rochelle, can you let go of me?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0006
113	Hmmm...	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
114	Hey, is Ishuna doing all of this for the chief?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
115	Do you ask because Izzy's young? Do you hate Chief?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
116	Well, I can see where he's coming from... This is in some ways helping you girls out. I can understand that.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
117	I just... To be honest, I'm not too fond of men.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
118	Glizzy is not a good liar. I will sleep. I'll wake when Izzy gets back.
119	I guess she likes you.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
120	You being here helps me sleep. It's comforting.
121	...
122	...Up.
123	We see that.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
124	Izzy. You done talking to Chief?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0004
125	Yeah, and you... Uh... Glanz. He wanted me to tell you something.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
126	Just as I suspected, the noble's mansion is filled with stolen artifacts.
127	And just between us, a Philosopher's Stone might be there too.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
128	Philosopher's Stone?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0006
129	Yeah. I think I figured it out. That's gotta be why Wratharis is so desperate to get at this noble.
130	I know for a fact that this country is secretly collecting these Philosopher's Stones. I don't know what for, though.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
131	...
132	The client is one of the Deadly Trio and the job does pay very well...
133	Chief said doing this job would help us make our home more secure.
134	Izzy, you're so sparkly-shiny that I'm scared you might burn out.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
135	Chief is doing everything he can for our sake. The least I can do is try to help him with it. That's the right thing to do.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
136	After seeing you do so much, the least I can do as your sister is try to help, don't you think?
137	It's the right thing to do.
138	...
139	I'm not all that interested in stuff like that.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0031
140	Come on! You really should care more about the Unicorn Knights as a whole!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
141	Urgh... I never said I didn't.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
142	Helza believed in me. Even though all I could do was fight.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0030
143	Me too. All I could do was steal, but she took me in and accepted me for who I am.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0004
144	She said that if I'm going to steal things, I might as well go for broke and steal the biggest things I can find. She joked that heroes are usually the ones who manage to steal whole countries.
145	Our current chief is doing his best to keep this place going. So I'm going to do whatever I can for the future of the Unicorn Knights that he believes in.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
146	...
147	You two should bow out of this mission.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
148	What?! Why?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
149	...
150	This mission is a lot more dangerous than either of you think.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
151	A Philosopher's Stone is nothing to mess around with.
152	One wrong move and this whole band could be wiped out. This isn't something children should be getting involved with.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0020
153	Hold on a second. We're a group of bandits. We know a lot more about thievery than you do.
154	And if it's for the Unicorn Knights, I'll take on whatever danger comes my way.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0016
155	I made my decision to do that a long time ago.
156	But...	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
157	...
158	Don't worry. I'll protect Izzy. I'm a protector of the small.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
159	Small?! You're smaller than I am, you know?!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
160	Heh, Izzy. You miss the point.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0010
161	What point?!
162	It's not a bad thing to want to do good for others. But that doesn't justify dying for it.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
163	Wasn't she supposed to be a mercenary?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
164	She's my pillow. Izzy can use Glizzy as a pillow if you want.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0005
165	Come again?
166	Grraaaaah!	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0007
167	Wow.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0044
168	Heheh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0007
169	No... That wasn't meant to be a compliment.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0039
170	Why not?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
171	Seriously?
172	Do you remember what I said before we made our way into this mansion?	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
173	"Let's find what we need without being seen."	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
174	Do you remember that?
175	Heheh!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0008
176	I don't think it's difficult to understand that the noise you're making is counterintuitive to that goal.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0002
177	You knock things over, you screech and yell... The entire mansion knows we're here now.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_1030
178	Meh, not a problem. Easier to just pummel them all.
179	What we want is always in the back of the nest.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0001
180	This is so not how you rob a place! I know for a fact that the Chief has spoken sternly to you about this before!
181	It's my job to draw attention.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0010
182	Geez...	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0030
183	They're just some women and children! Get them!
184	Rawr!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0013
185	Stand back, Ishuna. I'll take care of this.	VO_glanz.glanz_sys_0001
