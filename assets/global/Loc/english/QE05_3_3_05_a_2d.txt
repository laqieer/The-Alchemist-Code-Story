001	Ngh, that took a lot longer than I thought it would. Why the hell are there so many guards stationed at the border?	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
002	We have crossed blades with the Collectors of Wisdom once, in the village of the Sephiron.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
003	I think they were trying to prevent us from returning to the desert.
004	That does sound likely... If that's the case, though, they should be able to reach the desert a few steps ahead of the royal capital troops.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
005	We are not familiar with the path to the desert. I leave our guidance to you, Kamui.
006	Understood! We're running a little low on time, though. Be ready to face monsters on the road!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
