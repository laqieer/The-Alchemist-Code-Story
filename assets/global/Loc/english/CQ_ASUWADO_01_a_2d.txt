001	So this is my target. I'll take him out while masquerading as a thief. No problem. All I've got to do is wait.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0044
002	...Hm? What the...?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0025
003	Phew! What a nice day it was today...and the night wind feels so good. I'll take it a little slow on my walk back♪	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0023
004	How blissful can she be?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
005	A wolf...and she hasn't noticed it?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0026
006	It'll be problematic if there's confrontation. I've got no choice.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0042
007	Eeeek!	VO_kuon.kuon_battle_0021
008	...Hyaah!	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0032
009	!!!
010	There are wolves and thieves around here at night. If you don't want to die, then hurry on out of here.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0002
011	I see. I didn't know about that. Thank you for saving me!	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0027
012	My name is Kuon! I'm a Shrine Maiden of Wadatsumi. What's your name?	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0002
013	My name? Why do you ask? There's no need for you to know.	VO_aswad.aswad_chara_1001
014	No, you can't say that! I want to know the name of the person who saved me.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0014
015	You're a strange one, aren't you? My name is Aswald. Are you satisfied? If you're done here, then hurry on home.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0016
016	Aswald... What a lovely name!	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0009
017	Hey, Oh! Look at the time! I seem to have taken a longer walk than usual. Let's meet again, Aswald.	VO_kuon.kuon_sys_0022
018	(Kuon, Shrine Maiden of Wadatsumi... I've heard her name before. I heard she was famous around these parts.)	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0031
019	She's put me off my stride.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0030
020	...Here he comes. Well, at least my encounter with her served as something of time-killer. Time to perform my duty.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0010
