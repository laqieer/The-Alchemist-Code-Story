001	You seem to have placed quite a bit of trust in those two. Don't you wonder what will happen if they fail to return?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
002	I am certain they will return. I have placed my trust in them. All that remains is for me to believe.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
003	How can you be like that? The only thing I believe in is results. Is it not foolish to believe in results that are yet to be determined?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
004	No, it is not foolish. If you truly wish to change Saga, how about you try and place some trust in others for a change?
005	Nonsense. Like I just told you: the last time I believed in someone...I lost Alia.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0040
006	...Ah, right.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
007	However, if all goes well, the Wind Matter will be restored and Saga will return to the way it is meant to be. That is a gratifying thought.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
008	Saga's culture continues to be passed down from generation to generation since ancient times so that we do not forget the threat of nature.
009	If we rely on nature the way that we do now, we may very well incur its wrath.
010	...Eventually.
011	The wrath of nature... True, it exists within our ancient lore. "Those who walk not with nature shall endure judgment under the ancient dragon."	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
012	Right... The vision that Tina foresaw was referring to the dragon from ancient lore.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0027
013	What vision? ...Ah, I recall her mentioning such things.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0006
014	Tina has received the power of foresight from Asena. Thus, apparently, she glimpsed the future of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0004
015	A future where a giant dragon appeared and trampled over the land of Saga.
016	Hmph. Foresight is nonsense. The future is always an uncertain thing. I will do whatever I can to bring about my ideal future...that's all I can do.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
017	...Heheh.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0008
018	What's so funny?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
019	I was recalling how Tina said something similar. You two have more in common than you realize, you know?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
020	What nonsense. Isn't it time you returned to your Water Temple? It must be tasking for your old body to carry Matter within your body for so long.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
021	Hmph. Don't underestimate my strength, Tehre boy. That being said, I enjoyed our conversation. I look forward to seeing you at the Sprite Trio Discourse.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0010
022	I still haven't decided to attend yet.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
023	...No, I am certain you will attend. Would you like to bet on it?	VO_voda.voda_sys_0039
024	If we are to hold the discourse, it should be held at the Wind Temple. It will suitable for the theme of this particular occasion.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
025	So much for your reluctance... Well then, excuse me.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0044
026	We still cannot be sure it will be held...	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
027	The Wind Shamans have yet to overcome the final barrier of the trial!
