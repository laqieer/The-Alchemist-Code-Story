001	Two days later at Spandau Castle
002	So here you are.	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0051
003	...	epilogue.dios_story0105_0091
004	I heard we'll be working for the Shadows now, or for those corpses rather.	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0052
005	Not really. I just figured I could make use of them. I don't have the slightest intention to bury those bones.	epilogue.dios_story0105_0092
006	In order to find that girl, Agatha back?	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0053
007	...	epilogue.dios_story0105_0093
008	It's like you say. Both Agatha and Logi may be alive somewhere.	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0054
009	It's possible that through the powers of the Sacred Stone, they could have been instantly transported to someplace far away.	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0054_02
010	Stop stating the obvious. Otherwise, I'd never be cooperating with you guys.	epilogue.dios_story0105_0094
011	Well... the Seven Sacred Stones that were scattered across the world attract another.	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0055
012	If we manage to find all of them, we should be able to reunite with them. No half efforts all right?	epilogue.gabirondo_story0105_0055_02
013	Be quiet... I'm not taking any of your orders.	epilogue.dios_story0105_0095
014	Agatha...<br>I will definitely find you.	epilogue.dios_story0105_0096
015	I'll gather the Seven Sacred Stones... and reach back to you, no matter what. Please wait for me until then, Agatha!	epilogue.dios_story0105_0096_02
016	King Patrick of Envylia met a bitter end at the hands of the uprising of Captain Zeke of the Blue Flame Guard.
017	Now without a king, it was decided through negotiations between the Five Major Nations,
018	that the nation of Envylia will be put under direct control of Northern Pride.
019	On this day, yet another kingdom has disappeared from the Babel Continent... Oh my, if that ain't a disturbing story.	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0001
020	...Well, I can't really say it's not my problem though.	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0002
021	Hey! I'll leave the cash here! You can keep the change!	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0003
022	Hey! That's not nearly enough! Wait up!	epilogue.mistress_story0105_0001
023	Once the Seven Sacred Stones show themselves, the world's gears will get in motion.	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0004
024	Question is whether the Sacred Stones will bring eternal peace, or whether they'll bring about an age of total destruction.	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0004_02
025	At any rate, the die is cast. Things are going to get busy!	epilogue.edgar_story0105_0004_03
