001	Heheh, it's finally here! This is our season! Right, Yuki?	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0002
002	Yeah! Since we risked our lives to tell them and everything, I'm sure they're doing things right this year.	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0003
003	You betcha! I just know that the snowmen they decorate are going to be adorable this time 'round!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0001
004	We'll give our thanks to the snow spirits, then wait up with bated breath for the real Santa Claus to appear. Yup, there's no doubt about it! This is gonna be a real Winter Holiday!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0002
005	Don't forget that we have to see if—you know...
006	You're right. We sure have a lot to do!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0019
007	I really hope those guys don't show up again.	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0028_a
008	Hey, don't say scary things like that! I couldn't handle it if they suddenly started shooting at us and chasing us around again!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0021
009	I know! Let's watch over this Winter Holiday from behind the scenes, all sneaky-like! That way, we'll have nothing to worry about!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0019
010	Oh, really now?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0001
011	Ahhhhhhhh!
012	Sneaking around in a place like this... I guess that makes you two the culprits, huh?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0015
013	Unnnnggghhhh! Don't shoot! W-we haven't even done anything yet!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0002
014	Yet...? Wait, are you saying this wasn't your doing?	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0016
015	Wh-what are you even talking about?!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0002
016	Why don't you take a look around? You have eyes, don't you?
017	Huh?
018	There's no snow, not a single drop—and that means no snowmen.
019	W-well, now that you mention it...	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0021
020	There really isn't any snow.
021	This has never happened before. The children always look forward to building snowmen every Winter Holiday, too.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0004
022	I thought it was strange, and just as I started investigating, I came across the two of you.
023	I was convinced that you had decided to call off the Winter Holiday over something petty, like the snowmen not being cute enough.	VO_hazel.hazel_sys_0022
024	How dare you!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0001
025	You should listen to what people have to say before you start pointing guns at them!	VO_kiyu.kiyu_battle_0001
026	Hazel! I brought them!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0002
027	You can't have a Winter Holiday without snow! If the snow won't fall on its own, then it's up to us to make it!
028	That's what these two are here for! Birgitta the Soothsayer and Klima the weather-changer, you're up!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0007
029	My goodness! What a slave-driver you are, Carol.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0004
030	You want me to make it snow, right? I'll do my best!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0004
031	Thanks so much, you two!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0033
032	Okay, here I go!
033	Huh...?	VO_clima.clima_sys_0020
034	What is it, Klima?	VO_carol.carol_sys_0006
035	Something's not right. It's just not working!	VO_clima.clima_sys_0029
036	Hmmm, let me see... Ah, yes. Allow me!	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0044
037	Hmph. My prayers aren't working, either, which means that something must be getting in the way.
038	I knew it.
039	Eek! I'm telling you, it's not us!	VO_yuki.yuki_battle_0003
040	Grrrrrrrrrrrrr!
041	Ahhhhh! M-monsters?!
042	Wh-what are they doing here?! Oh, no! They're coming this way!	VO_carol.carol_sys_0027
043	Hmph. I suppose they were driven here by the Alchemia we stirred up with our powers.	VO_birgitta.birgitta_sys_0010
044	Well, here they come!
045	Urrrrggggrrrrraaagggghhh!
