001	You come entreating me now, yet why did you not save Alia then...even if it meant breaking the law?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0013
002	The law is meant to exist for the sake of Saga. Yet defending it has led to this result. How pathetic.
003	What about you? You say you want to protect Saga, yet you've joined forces with the Gluttony army. Don't you think that's pathetic?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0029
004	Please, explain it to us so that we can be convinced you did it for the sake of Saga!
005	I entreat you as well. I am well aware that we are still inadequate! However, our desire to protect Saga is pure!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
006	This is a waste of time.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0022
007	It's not a waste of time! I have received the power of foresight from Asena and have seen the future of Saga.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
008	I have seen the conflict...and the giant dragon's flames that will burn it all down.
009	And, in another vision, I've foreseen Asena's death...at the hands of Georgios!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
010	I am here to change that future!
011	Tehre, please, speak to us in a way that will make us understand.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0027
012	You do not see that this current situation is a result of your over-reliance on Asena.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
013	Over-reliance...?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
014	Yes. All of you have placed too much reliance on Asena...on nature.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
015	That's the same thing Georgios said...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0021
016	So...is that the reason you began trading with other countries...?	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0025
017	Of course. If we remained closed off from the rest of the world, our advancements would fall behind. Ultimately, we would lose the ability to protect this country.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
018	Saga's fragility comes from the fact that all of you continue to rely on nature. In order to protect one's country, its people must become stronger.
019	Is that really what strength is?! Is relying on guns and weapons and neglecting nature the true definition of strength?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0029
020	Artillery like this is commonplace in other countries. In order to withstand invasion, we must consider such weapons as an option.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0029
021	You are the one who is tolerating Gluttony's invasion of our country! What you are saying makes no sense to me!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0012
022	Tina! Calm down!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
023	Tehre, does that mean you were aware that the Gluttony army was responsible for the outbreak of the Jam?	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
024	Of course, I was aware of it.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
025	Do you know how many lives were lost because of that?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
026	How dare you claim to be protecting Saga while sacrificing its people?!
027	If it weren't for the Jam...countless lives could've been saved! ...Mocca, too, wouldn't be suffering under its corruption!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0020
028	You say you fight for Saga, yet all you're doing is acting as an accomplice in its invasion! I cannot...forgive that!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0013
029	Tina!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0022
030	Hyaaaaahhhh!!!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0032
031	Hmph. Your inadequate Ouija will not reach me. If you wish to know the truth, then prove that your resolve and power is enough to defeat me.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
032	This is not the full extent of my power! Hyaaaah!!!	VO_tina.tina_battle_0013
033	I see. Alchemy, huh? Who...are you?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
034	I am one who has vowed to protect Saga!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
035	My power may be inadequate, but I will make you acknowledge my resolve! And I will have you explain all of your actions!
