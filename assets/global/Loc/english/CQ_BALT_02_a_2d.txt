001	Seriously. If you're gonna take time off, how about you do it somewhere more peaceful next time? Why would you choose such a troublesome place like this?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
002	It's to avoid meddling folk like you of course.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
003	What's that?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
004	If it's somewhere that has easy access, my subordinates would come right away.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
005	Do you even have any regard for your subordinates and your guild?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0001
006	It's got nothing to do with you. I don't want to hear your tiresome lectures.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0012
007	You...!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0013
008	Heheh. I finally found you.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0008
009	Huh? Who are you guys?	VO_balt.balt_sys_0012
010	This has nothing to do with you! Our business is with that scrawny fellow over there.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
011	... ...
012	Did you forget about us? We blame you for what happened to our organization.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
013	A band of thieves, huh? I didn't know the Guild handled folk like this.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0044
014	It's simple... At some point, we determined they were hindering our work. It was nothing personal.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0042
015	Heheh. Keep saying that. This is where your luck runs out!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
016	We've become well-known to the point that if we take you and the Guild out, we'll be able to resurrect our organization!
017	Correct me if I'm wrong, but...	VO_balt.balt_sys_0025
018	Did you set off on your own because you wanted to divert the attention of these bandits away from the Guild?
019	Hmph. The Guild isn't like your tiny little organization. These guys don't hold a candle in comparison to the Guild.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
020	Keep talking! All your bold talk sounds weak when you're hiding out here in the middle of nowhere.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
021	Far from forgetting about us, you've been running scared from us, haven't you?! Gawhaw!
022	You want to protect the pathetic members of your Guild, even if it means having to sacrifice yourself, huh? Gyahahah!
023	Right. So, these are the scum that dabble in killing and human trafficking.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0022
024	Hearing all this vulgar talk is serving as a reminder.
025	I thought they disappeared because of internal division, but, I see... You were taking them out on your own.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0016
026	With this to take care of, I understand what's been keeping you busy.
027	It's not like you to take the hard road like this.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
028	... ...
029	Shut up already! You wanna die?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
030	How amusing. Go on and give it a try. I was just getting bored of having to play babysitter for this fellow.
031	This has nothing to do with you either. Stay out of it.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0014
032	Hah! Finally, you show your true intentions.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
033	Sorry, but I'll be participating in this. There something about their rotten attitude that I just can't stand.
034	Have it your way...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0005
035	Fine! Let's take them both out then!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0005
