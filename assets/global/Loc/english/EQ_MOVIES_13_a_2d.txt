001	Resistance is futile.
002	Why're you doing this?!
003	Why should I explain myself to you? You're not going to understand, no matter what I say. Just consider this...payback, for how you've treated us Phantoms all this time.
004	Isn't that right, Chloe?
005	The sins of the souls of the dead...! The pride of the Phantom Soldiers...!
006	Dias!
007	Edgar! Go!
008	Thanks!
009	You let them pass without a fuss, I see.
010	I believe I just said, "resistance is futile." Well, I meant it. This world is fated to be swallowed up by the Darkness, regardless of your efforts.
011	I'm not going to let that happen.
012	I have no intention of claiming that everything we've done up until this point has been right, but that does not mean that we should just give up.
013	Othima... I would hate for you...for all of you and your lingering sentiments to be sent to the Void.
014	Oh, yeah? Why's that?
015	If we have wronged you...then I would not lose the chance to make things right!
