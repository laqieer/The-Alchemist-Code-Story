001	You did well, Zain.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
002	It's only because fighting Yauras left you slightly fatigued... That's all.
003	I don't know... I should have realized that my blade was getting dull.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0045
004	No, there was barely a difference between us... You could easily have become Lord Commander.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
005	Heh... I guess you could say that I'm better at swinging my sword around on the front lines.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
006	So I'm more suited to being your sword of justice than Lord Commander.
007	I'm glad to have you by my side.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
008	Let's go one more round. This time, I won't lose.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
009	Bring it on!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
010	Hey! I've finished repairing Excalibur...! Training again? You guys never tire of that, do you?	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0003
011	I suppose that's it for today. We'll have to settle this at a later time.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
012	It's too soon to decide the winner now. Let's spar here again later.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
013	You're on!	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
014	I miss those days.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
015	It's thanks to that time that I am the person I am today.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
016	I will spread peace and justice throughout the world, for Cadanova as well!
017	That...is my duty.
018	That's just like you. In that case, don't you think it's time that you listen to your heart?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0044
019	Kaya, you have your duty...and I have mine.
020	Oh? Have you decided, then?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
021	I'll make my decision once I fully understand how the justice you are seeking is different to the justice of Babel.	VO_zain.zain_sys_1047
022	Where are we going next?
023	Well, since you've started to understand... Let's go our separate ways from here.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
024	If my suspicions are correct... This will be extremely dangerous. It would be wise for you to leave even before you fully understand.
025	But if it's that dangerous, then I should...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0022
026	This world cannot afford to lose its Lord Commander. You should understand that better than anyone.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0015
027	That may be true, but I can't just leave. Once I've started something, I can't move on until I've taken responsibility for it.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
028	Your stubbornness can be a nuisance...but will you accompany me for just a little while longer?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
029	Yes. I'll find a way to take responsibility before this is done.	VO_zain.zain_chara_0009
030	Zain... You... No, it'd be insensitive to say it now.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
031	Next, we will head for...Lustburg.
