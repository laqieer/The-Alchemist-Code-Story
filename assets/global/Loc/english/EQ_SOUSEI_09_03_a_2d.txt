001	Just a little bit more... I'm almost there...
002	There's nothing left here... No life left to be lost. No need to fear.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0019
003	So, I must...quickly...!
004	Here! I should be able to—	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
005	Seal it? Just as Nidhogg once sealed Beelzebub?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
006	...!
007	I figured you might try that.
008	B-Bianca?!
009	...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
010	...
011	Too bad for you, though.
012	That power you hold now is what the Infinite Serpent needs to complete its plans.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
013	Therefore, I must insist that you return what we are owed.
014	Wh-what?!
015	You must have realized by now. That power is not meant to be controlled by any one person.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0002
016	If you hold onto it, it'll get progressively worse. You'll lose more and more control, and more people will die.
017	...
018	That's... You... No! I don't believe you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
019	...
020	It's true.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
021	The Infinite Serpent. We are one and the same, it and I.
022	It started with me. I allowed it to come into being, and I allowed it to grow.
023	Their sins are mine. And I suppose you must hate me for that.
024	...! Nghh!
025	What do you want?! Why do this to us?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
026	Shall I tell you a story?	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0003
027	Once upon a time, there was a group of people who decided to create a weapon for the purpose of destroying Ouroboros.
028	They did not know it at the time, but they were approaching their goal from the wrong perspective. Nonetheless, they did finish making their weapon.
029	What they didn't understand is that Ouroboros is much like a breakwater, securely encircling the world and keeping it safe.
030	So their weapon was useless. Utterly devoid of meaning, too. No weapon could possibly have made a dent, ultimately.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0022
031	Its power was irrelevant. Ouroboros simply diverted their attacks, impervious to their paltry attempts.
032	Eventually, they reconsidered their strategy: If attacking from the outside wouldn't work, they'd attack from the inside.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0016
033	They created something modeled after Ouroboros herself to fool her defenses, like a Trojan horse.
034	And that was...you?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0002
035	No.
036	It was that stone you carry within yourself now.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0001
037	Made from a piece of the Shell of the World, engraved with the anguish of the dragons... It is a second vessel for Ouroboros.
038	I am but a spirit created from the crumbling ashes of this world, born from the regrets of a girl who no longer has a name.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0031
039	I contain memories...or perhaps the memories are what contain me.
040	They are the final memories of our failure, our fallacy, and our lingering folly.
041	I am their last promise for absolution. That is my reason for existing.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0004
042	And for that...you used us...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
043	That dragon sleeping within your chest, fighting to awaken... That is what I desire.	VO_uroboros-e.uroboros-e_sys_0006
044	This time, I will make certain that Ouroboros dies by my hand!
045	Gnrgh... As if...I would make it so easy for you!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0001
