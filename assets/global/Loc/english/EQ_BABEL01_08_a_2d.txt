001	Ugh! Even cutting them apart like this isn't enough?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0042
002	Gerald! Are you alright?!	VO_natalie.natalie_battle_0019
003	Forget about me! Make sure not a single knight dies on this battlefield!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0014
004	B-but your wounds...	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
005	I'm fine! That's an order!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0002
006	Fine... Whatever! Just remember, I'll kill you if you die!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0016
007	Hyaaaaaaaaaah!	VO_gerard.gerard_battle_0007
008	?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
009	...!
010	Heh heh heh... His life is mine. As is yours.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0010
011	Thank you, Ren. You saved my life.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0036
012	I got the assassins. You just concentrate on the battle. Leave the professionals to the professional.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
013	Greed Dike's army is...
014	?!
015	How many freaking people do they have?! This is nuts!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0028
016	Ha. Are you really the Ren I know? I thought you'd be having a lot more fun than this.	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0010
017	Behind you!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
018	What?! No—	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
019	I made it! I wasn't sure I would, but I did! I came to help, Sir Gerald!	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
020	Everyone, go now!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0041
021	Therians?! You... What are you...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
022	I figured out what I really wanted to do with my sword! That's why I'm here!	VO_neena.neena_sys_0001
023	What are you talking about?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0012
024	This is a little hard for me...because talking about this was banned in the village and it is still difficult for me to willfully speak about it.	VO_neena.neena_chara_1002
025	But I must! You need to know that your father was highly revered among us therians as a hero who was willing to fight and die for us!
026	...?!	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0027
027	There is not one among us who does not carry that debt of gratitude. However...at the time, the relationship between therians and humans was much worse than it is even now.	VO_neena.neena_sys_0027
028	So a decision was made to continue to keep our distance from the humans. That's why you were treated the way you were before. I have decided that it is time to change that!
029	We are facing something greater than any differences between humans and therians. We are fighting for a way for all in this world to live together!
030	And? You expect me to just believe you?	VO_gerard.gerard_sys_0016
031	Look at all the therians I have managed to gather. I asked them to come and they did, because they believed they owed that to you after you saved them.	VO_neena.neena_battle_1028
032	Whatever happens... Whatever you decide to believe...we are here to do something about the constructed distance between therians and humans.
033	My dream is to see a future where therians and humans can stand together and laugh together! I will get stronger so that I can be the bridge to that future!
034	That is the purpose I found after we last spoke. I will protect the joy and happiness of those around me!
035	...!
036	Therefore, we therians are here to support the Scarlet Flame Guard against the army of Greed Dike!
