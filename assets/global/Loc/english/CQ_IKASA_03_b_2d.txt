001	Grrooooghhh!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0004
002	(What power... I've never seen the captain fight like this before.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0044
003	(He's clearing the area and taking down enemies one after another without hesitation.)
004	(The slashing attacks are so strong that there is no chance for the enemy. How incredible the captain is.)
005	(But...)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
006	But that's why I also feel danger.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
007	You have no mercy in taking down enemies. Your powers don't hold you back.
008	...
009	(There's no time to think. My duty right now is to take down the enemy in front of me.)
010	Groooaaarrr!!!	VO_familiar.familiar_battle_0020
011	Now!
012	HYAAAAAH!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0007
013	Urgaahhh!!!	VO_familiar.familiar_battle_0028_a
014	Great hit. You did well.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0024
015	Thank you very much. Um...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0034
016	What? Is there something on my face?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
017	Or is it that you sense some camaraderie?
018	…I'm sorry if I offended you. But I'm not even sure what I'm thinking now.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
019	Don't worry. What you feel is right. Like swinging a double-edged sword. Basically, it means you and I are alike.
020	But it's being able to use the power effectively that will make things right. To move forward, you have to challenge yourself.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0031
021	You can't just repress the darkness within. You need the strength to reach the darkness as well.
022	What do you mean...?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
023	There's more to be said about this. But now is not the time.
024	If there's one thing I can say, it's that there's truth by looking into the darkness...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
025	...?
026	Okay, so for example, I took you under my wing.
027	If you skillfully use your power to the extent that the Holy Guard expects it to be, you will benefit the continent.
028	That means... This was all deliberate.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
029	Possibly so.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
030	Well... I as a knight choose to shine light for someone important.
031	Someone important...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
032	I...I think I can relate to that.
033	Darkness is so deep that you can't see the bottom by staring into the abyss. You could be engulfed by darkness and lose control of your power.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0022
034	But if you have purpose with your powers, that will not happen to you.
035	A purpose for my power...
036	I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!
037	Then, for the sake of that child, you must encourage yourself more.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0004
038	...
039	(Ever since I became a member of Button's family, my powers have been used for that child. Other than that, I never had a purpose.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0020
040	(But maybe my actions as a knight will lead to good and would affect Button indirectly.)
049	(If so, I'll be able to prove myself as a knight and make Button proud.)	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
041	Did you find your purpose?	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0001
042	Yes. I think I've found my purpose as a knight.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
043	Even if it may sound a bit childish.
044	All for the Holy Guard.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0008
045	It was the only thing I could think for my strength and power.
046	Good to see. You shouldn't have any worrries. Looking forward to where this takes you.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0010
047	Thank you.
048	I'm trying my best...at being a knight.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
