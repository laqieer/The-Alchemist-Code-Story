001	What is this place?
002	What...? The Albions have awakened...?
003	They must be drawn to this power that I'm sensing...
004	Where is its source?
005	I've never seen anything like this world before.
006	Hm...
007	Interesting.
008	If I could make this power my own...
009	It might be what I need to finally eradicate those bothersome Seven Deadly Sins.
010	To finally carry out my revenge.
011	To make him regret his betrayal.
012	I'll be coming for you, Meliodas.
013	Elizabeth! Wake up, Elizabeth!
014	Mm, just five more minutes...
015	Come on, sleepyhead, this is no time for that! Up! Now!
016	O-okay! Wait, Hawk...? Where are we?
017	I don't know. We were here when I woke up.
018	Be careful. We can't be sure what to expect. Stay close to me.
019	Hawk! Behind you!
020	Buh! Wha—?!
021	Wh-who are you?!
022	My name is Ouroboros, the Observer of Destiny.
023	The observer of...destiny?
024	The natural order of this world has been disrupted. To rectify this problem, I have brought you here, to the Door of Truth.
025	You're the one that brought us here?!
026	I did. An uninvited guest has come into this world, here to try his fortune on the continent of Babel.
027	Babel...?
028	A world apart from your own. That is all you need to know.
029	That one's desire for power was so strong, the boundaries between our worlds were diluted by it.
030	I find myself...uncertain about his character. Virtuous...or wicked? Behold...
031	Waaaaaaaahh!!!
032	...
033	Hm... It seems that it will take some time to make this world's power my own.
034	Still, my original powers are effective even in this world. Then... I suppose...
035	I will start by pillaging what I can from this world.
036	Are those...Albions?!
037	What is happening?!
038	It is a scene I cut out from this world for you to see.
039	You mean Albions are running wild in that world we just saw?!
040	That is correct. There is not much in this world that can repel those giants.
041	That is why I summoned you. I understand you have some means of dealing with them.
042	Just the two of us?
043	I have brought others, but the instability of the boundaries between our worlds has caused some complications.
044	Find the others summoned here. Band together with them and defeat those giants. Eliminate the one who caused this disruption.
045	Those are the tasks I now lay before you. You must restore the natural order of this world.
046	Wh-what?! Wait, why do we have to?!
047	Time and space is distorted by the presence of those from other worlds here. This cannot be remedied while the otherworlder remains.
048	Eliminating them will return this world to what it should be.
049	That will allow you two to return to your world.
050	That's just not right!
051	Wait, Hawk! Think about it. The Albions and the person that caused the disruption...
052	They're causing the people here to suffer, isn't that correct?
053	It is.
054	I understand. We'll do what we can to help.
055	E-Elizabeth?!
056	If there are people in trouble, then we have to help! Our world is infringing upon theirs!
057	But still—!
058	I guarantee a safe return after your mission is accomplished.
059	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
060	Eeek!
061	Fear not, otherworlders. I will prepare a guide for you.
062	...
063	So this is Babel.
064	This really is a different world... Everything seems so odd.
065	Aw, come on! We just got here!
066	Hawk! Stay back!
067	Elizabeth! Wait up!
