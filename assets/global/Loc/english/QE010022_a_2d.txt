001	Look! It's Spandau Castle!
002	That's odd. It's too quiet.	VO_zeke.zeke_sys_0031
003	True... There doesn't appear to be a battle going on.
004	Our main force will charge in from the front. Logi, Dias!
005	You two make your way in from around the back. Deliver Agatha back to the Convent, and then meet up with me.
006	Yes, Sir!
007	Sabareta may be after Agatha. Do not let your guard down until you've delivered her back to the Convent.
008	Don't worry. Logi and Dias will protect me. Stay safe, father.
009	Dias, if we use the hidden passage behind the shrine, we should be able to enter the castle without being noticed.
010	Who would've thought we'd use our secret passage this way? Both of you, let's go!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0032
