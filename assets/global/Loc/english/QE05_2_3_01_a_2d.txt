001	Come one, come all! The freshest vegetables straight from Envylia!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
002	Water and food, enough for two weeks. The cheapest you have is fine.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
003	I can't believe we can't get started yet! We came all the way out here to build some noble their mansion, and we have to wait?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
004	So, this is the Desert Zone, huh?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
005	A bit unrefined, but it's got a good, lively atmosphere. There's something not quite right about it, though...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
006	This place is too put together to have just received Liberation Army and Sephira refugees.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
007	Ow! Hey, watch it!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0043
008	Oh. I apologize.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
009	Hm? Hey, did you come from out of town?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0006
010	Yes, from Gluttony.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
011	Huh! That's rare.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0044
012	I escaped the civil war in Gluttony and came here in search of my friends.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
013	Have you seen any refugees around here recently?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0001
014	Uh, did you hit your head or something?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0030
015	What?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
016	The civil war in Gluttony, right? With the military coup that ended with the general becoming king?	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0002
017	That happened, like, decades ago.
018	What?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
019	That battle against Ceclidis and his forces was decades ago?!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0021
020	Decades?!
021	Was I wandering the desert for that long?! Impossible!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0026
022	If it had really been that long, I would have aged!
023	Alchemy is a deep and varied art. While pushing the limits of its possibilities, at some point I realized I had become more spirit than human.
024	This immortality is my curse for plunging into the most forbidden depths of Alchemy.
025	No... It couldn't be that, could it?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0018
026	If so much time has passed, any leads that might help me find my friends must be cold already.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
027	Still, I can't give up. I swore to find them! I must believe they survived!
028	Even if it was ages ago, there must be someone who remembers what happened! I just have to find them!
029	Are you certain?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
030	Yeah, they didn't have the mark on their bodies or whatever, but there was a community of refugees who escaped Gluttony some decades ago.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
031	Do you know where to?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0002
032	I could tell you, but if you don't mind me saying, I don't think you want to go there.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0031
033	Why would that be?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
034	They are retainers to the nobility. I don't know how or why, but the upper class of this country protects them.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
035	All that can mean is that there's something shady about them.
036	Let me give you some advice, sir: stay away. No need to stir up unnecessary trouble.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
037	But even so...I must try.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0042
038	If you say so...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
039	The settlement is in that direction, beyond three oases. Just be prepared for a rough time.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
040	This is...worse than I thought.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
041	The Alchemia held in the sand here must be destabilizing the climate in this area.
042	This is no place for people to live. Could the Sephira really be here? Well, I suppose that would be a good deterrent to anyone poking their noses around this area.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
043	Halt, traveler.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0022
044	What...?
045	There is only barren wasteland beyond this point. You will gain nothing there.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0003
046	You will not find whatever it is that you seek.
047	On the contrary.
048	What?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0006
049	The people I seek must be here. Those whose devotion to Sephiron and her compassion is emblazoned upon their bodies.
050	You..? Could it really be?!	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0026
051	My name is Kamui. I've come to fulfill my duties as Protector.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
052	You...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
053	K-Kamui?
054	Could you be...Hisham?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
055	It really is you! Your eyes, your face... Everything about you is just as I remember!	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0020
056	Hisham... You've changed quite a bit.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
057	Of course I have! Do you have any idea how long it's been?!	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
058	Everybody I cared for... Everybody we knew, they're gone, and I've... I've been...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0019
059	Hisham, I'm sorry to have made you wait for so long.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0035
060	Uuh... Uuaaaahhh!!!
061	...
062	The soil is withered... Could this also have been caused by the loss of Sephiron?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
063	That's what the wise women who survived said.
064	They said that Babel is adjusting to a new natural order after the destruction of the old one.
065	The expansion of the desert is the result of that? I take it this new natural order does not like humans very much.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0044
066	Life in the desert isn't so bad. There is much to be learned simply by surviving day by day.
067	Heh...	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
068	Hm? Did I say something funny?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0006
069	Oh, no. I was just remembering... You always enjoyed the pursuit of knowledge. You've really grown into an impressive adult.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0008
070	It has been a long time since anybody talked to me like I was a child. This is...somewhat embarrassing.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0047
071	On the other hand, you have not changed at all. I'm surprised that you don't feel worse after all that time in the desert.
072	I know what you mean. It almost scares me, how good I feel.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
073	It has been too long since we were separated on that battlefield.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0022
074	Time turns all emotions, anger, and sadness alike into dust and carries them away on the wind.
075	Yes, I cannot disagree.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
076	I am grateful that you kept the Sephira survivors together, especially since it has made it possible for us to meet again.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
077	Unfortunately, I was not a particularly good leader. We lost many before I gained the experience and wisdom to lead well. By then, I was already beginning to really feel my age...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
078	If we had not been separated from Isidore...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0020
079	...
080	That day, the Jam descended upon us like a tidal wave.
081	Ea-earthquake?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
082	No... I sense that energy that makes me feel like my skin is on fire.	VO_ishido.ishido_chara_1007
083	Wh-what?! Eek!	VO_malta.malta_battle_0025
084	A giant wave of the Jam?! Hisham! Get over here!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
085	I-it's no use! They're gonna...?!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
086	Ngh—aaaaaah!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
087	Isidore...?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
088	Hurry! Take everybody far from here! I won't be able to hold this for long!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
089	O-okay!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
090	Everybody! Hurry, this way!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
091	That was the last person! Isidore, hurry! Over here!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0018
092	Got it!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0004
093	What?! Oh, n—!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0022
094	I-Isidore?! Isidore! No!!!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
095	Isidore and Malta were never found.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
096	I see... I'm sorry. That must have been tough for you.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
097	Yes... The years have been long, indeed.	VO_hisham.hisham_battle_0019
098	That day, the sephirah disappeared from the skin of most Sephira.
099	In addition, we all grieved the loss of Sephiron's protection from this land.
100	And yet...you survived.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
101	Yes, we survived. Sadly, that's all we've done. We haven't managed anything more than that.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0004
102	I don't know how they find us, but there are some raiders that target the Sephira.
103	The nobles of this desert see the Sephira bloodline as nothing more than some resource to be taken control of.
104	If things remain as they are, we will soon be torn apart and forget the importance of our heritage.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0018
105	Perhaps that might be best for the Sephira in the long run, but...
106	It is too early to give up, don't you think?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0031
107	Yes, I do. We must believe there is some purpose to our survival. To that end, it is necessary to continue to protect...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0037
108	No, not just protect. We must also teach and share the Sephira's traditions, crafts, and the compassionate will of Sephiron.
109	A strong bond among the Sephira people is paramount to achieving that.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037
110	Have you decided on a name yet?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0045
111	I have. We shall deliver the Sephira, the fruits of the desert, into the next generation. If that is our task, then—	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0004
112	We shall call ourselves the Fruit Peddlers.
113	A secret society?! Sorry, but I don't know about anything like that.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
114	I see...
115	Besides, those Sephira that you speak of... Sure, some decades ago, a bunch of them came here as refugees.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0004
116	Since then, I've heard that most of them were actually just mercenaries or former soldiers of Gluttony.
117	While they were here, public order went right down the drain.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
118	To be honest, most people don't even like talking about that period of time, so watch who you bring this topic up with.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
119	Thank you for your advice. By the way, could I get one of those fruits?
120	Well, you're a big spender, ain't ya? Most travelers just stock up on water and the cheapest food.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0011
121	Uh, um... I was just going to visit a friend, and I figured it would be rude not to bring a gift.
122	Heheh, let me guess. She's cute and you like her, right?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0044
123	I-it's not like that.
124	Well, whatever. Here you go. I've even wrapped it up pretty for you. Be careful out there, kid.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
125	I will. Thank you.
126	...
127	I should've known it wouldn't be that easy.
128	I came all the way out here with the information I gleaned from mother's stories, but I guess this is the end of the line.
129	I guess it really was just some rumor that Sephira survivors built themselves a community in the desert.
130	Ack!
131	Hey, kid! Watch where you're going!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
132	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I was so lost in thought—
133	Hey, now... Those are some pretty nice clothes you got. You a noble or something?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
134	Well, I...
135	I can't believe this. We work our asses off all day to make a living, while nobles like this waste of space get to take cute little vacations.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
136	I-it's not like that!
137	(He's alone. I'd prefer to talk this out, but he doesn't seem to be willing to listen.)
138	(I'll just make a run for it when I get the chance.)
139	Just looking at you pisses me off! Hey, guys, get out here!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
140	What...?
141	There're too many! I might be in trouble here.
142	Thugs really are the same, no matter where you go.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
143	What?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
144	Do you not find it shameful to outnumber a kid by so many? Let me assist you, young one.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0016
145	Huh? Oh, uh, thank you!
