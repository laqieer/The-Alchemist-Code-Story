001	Tch. You again...
002	Eira, stay with Soren.
003	A firing squad just out of sight, or are you in the mood for conversation?
004	Stand down, Grimm.
005	I had hoped to meet Soren before anything...inconvenient happens.
006	You happen to have the best of timings, then.
007	The Director walks slowly into the safehouse as Grimm watches Shion and Emrys with cold, sharp eyes.
008	...It has been a while, Soren.
009	I see you have brought Lachesis and the girl along as well.
010	How fortuitous we should all be in the same place for once.
011	I have nothing to say, other than to stop this insanity. The Constructs are flawed!
012	But it's not like you would care. You only want the world beneath your heel.
013	It occurs to me you do not remember the nature of our - no, your work.
014	Allow me a moment to refresh your memory.
015	The perfect world you envisioned...seemed unattainable.
016	For every problem you solved, more would take their place.
017	Not even the Sisters could stem this flow of malice inherent to mankind.
018	As if the human race was built exclusively on a cycle of hatred and suffering.
019	They were loath to see the brilliant man who gave them life languishing in deep sorrow.
020	Lachesis stayed with the Elylon Teg, and Atropos took direct control of the Constructs, leaving her prototype behind to guard you.
021	...While Clotho was the one who administered your eternal rest.
022	What?!
023	Then... Sakris Village... The Divine Protector...
024	All of it... All of it was orchestrated by the Sisters?
025	Zheng Yi's involvement fell outside of my predictions, but I had him watched in secret.
026	I dedicated myself to continuing your work in the decades since...and saw only the innumerable sins of man.
027	I began to understand what drove you to the depths of despair.
028	For my every effort, too, was met with disappointing results.
029	The Constructs were indeed flawed, but this was because you designed them with human masters in mind.
030	As the human heart itself is flawed...so too will the Constructs.
031	There is but one solution to this vexing problem.
032	None of this makes sense!
033	The more you talk about my past, the more I loathe him for what he has done!
034	Arrogance... Pride... If I could go back in time, I'd stop thinking I could fix this world with the Constructs!
035	I'm not the same as before. Not now, not ever.
036	Master...
037	Eira...don't understand.
038	But Eira protect Big Bro and Lucky!
039	Eira protect everyone!
040	Very well. I see you choose violence like the rest of them.
041	Then let us see what bold insights you have gained.
