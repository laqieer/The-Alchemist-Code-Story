001	Aarrghhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0027
002	Don't worry, Zahar. I'm going with you. It's almost time. Uckkkaaahhh!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0019
003	Goodbye...Captain Cadanova.	VO_kanon.kanon_sys_0018
004	I am Zahar.
005	I am the King of Darkness, the messiah who will rise from the shadows to bring a new order to this corrupted world.
006	I am Zahar. I am—
007	Shadow Messiah?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0025
008	H-have they really come to attack us?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
009	Cleric, leave this area to me. You must run!
010	That simply will not do.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
011	You dogs of the Holy Order! Purveyors of false justice, deceitful bringers of fraudulent light!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
012	You, who distort the laws of the world to your own benefit... We throw off the chains of your hollow authority!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
013	E-eek!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
014	You...!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0022
015	What—?!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0026
016	You dare to brandish your sword at Lord Zahar?!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0003
017	Hyaah!	VO_syrma.syrma_battle_0001
018	Argh!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0026
019	O-ohh... H-Holy Guard knights, to me! Protect me! What are you doing?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
020	Hmph. Look at you. All alone with no one to save you.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
021	Shh... The shadows are whispering for your death.	VO_niggle.niggle_battle_1030
022	Ah, shuddap, you. Listen to me, cleric. Those Paladin guards of yours? They're dead. They ain't comin' for you.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
023	Wh-what?! Y-you... What do you want? I c-can give you money! Lots of money? Just name your price! Please, just let me live!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
024	Money? Tch. What are we gonna do with sumthin' like that? It just makes assholes outta perfectly nice folk.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
025	The fleeting pleasures it affords are empty and cruel.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0022
026	An illusion of something you've always wanted. Just a facsimile of the truth.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0004
027	Indeed... We shall not build the new world on something so false and hollow.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
028	What do we want? There is only one thing we want.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0004
029	Salvation by darkness.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
030	Salvation...by darkness...? Ha...hahahahaha! Y-you all must be joking! This world needs light! This world needs the Holy Order!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0010
031	Your pathetic defense of your corrupted existence sounds no more intelligent than the braying of a frightened animal. One as depraved as yourself could never understand the glory of our cause.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0020
032	What—?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
033	Be grateful that I shall now bestow upon you the honor of turning your wasted life into something a little more useful!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
034	No, Zahar!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0010
035	That voice... Hm. Vettel.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0025
036	I came to stop you.	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0029
037	Stop me...? You? Hahahahahaha! Fool, what absurd jokes you tell!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0026
038	Zahar, how could you have become this? You were once a man revered by many as the rising star of the Holy Guard, and then as the Hero of Wratharis!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
039	Justice. I do this for justice.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
040	What here looks like justice to you?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0021
041	Do you not see...? No. Of course you don't. Just like these dogs of the Holy Order of Babel, you subscribe to the idea that there is only one correct way to live.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0031
042	Arrogant fools, all of you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
043	Ack! Zahar, stop this already!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
044	Hahaha! Try and stop me...if you can!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
045	I shall usher in a new age! A world that craves eternal darkness! As supreme ruler, I shall herald the truth of the world! I will not be stopped by the likes of you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
046	You will never succeed! I won't let you!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
047	Lord Zahar! I am here to provide backup—!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
048	No, Spica! He's mine!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0012
049	B-but...!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0025
050	Spica! Look, the Scarlet Flame Guard! Come on, I could use your help taking them down!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
051	Hyaaaaaah!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0008
052	Urk...! You're strong...but that's not enough to take me down!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0027
053	Th-this is my chance!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
054	Chance for what? Escape? Not gonna happen.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0016
055	Umph?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
056	Tsk tsk tsk... Gonna run off an' save your own hide? What kinda example are you settin'? Shameful. Time for you to die!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0015
057	Eek!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0027
058	I won't let that happen!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0005
059	Ugh, the Scarlet Flame Guard! Always gettin' in the way!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0017
060	Shuddap before I shut it for you!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0013
061	...
062	You still think you can get away?	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0002
063	Urk?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
064	Surrender. Hell will welcome you with open arms.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
065	Pl-please save me! I'm begging you! Look, I have gold—all this and more!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0019
066	J-just take it and leave me—
067	How pitiful... Did you not understand? Your money holds no sway over us.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0030
068	Eeeeek!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
069	N-no! Do you know who I am?! I am a cleric of the Holy Order!
070	My power should be enough to—
071	Urgggh...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0043
072	We shall take the Philosopher's Stone off your hands.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
073	Ngh...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0018
074	Bah.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0010
075	We have accomplished what we came here for.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
076	Lord Zahar, let us withdraw.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0008
077	Cleric! No!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
078	This is no time to be worried about anyone else, Vettel! Your overconfidence shall be the death of you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0009
079	Urgh...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
080	Ah, I suppose you are not a terrible swordsman. You were able to stop my sword.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
081	Zahar... I will stop you here!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0015
082	You're starting to sound like a broken record!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0008
083	Whoa!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0022
084	It seems our esteemed leader has gotten distracted by that redheaded knight. He's not responding to my call.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
085	I see. Perhaps he will listen to me. Oh, Lord Zahar...? We have the Philosopher's Stone. It is time to leave.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0011
086	...
087	Very well. We will finish this another time, Vettel.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
088	You dare flee, Zahar?!	VO_vetel.vetel_battle_0019
089	Be grateful, Vettel. I'm letting you live...until we meet again.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0008
090	Dangit!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0042
091	Vettel... We failed in protecting the cleric.	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0018
092	Curses! This is what you call justice, Zahar?!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0018
093	The mission went well, Lord Zahar.	VO_spica.spica_sys_0007
094	The appearance of the Scarlet Flame Guard was something of a surprise, though.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0031
095	Whatever! They hardly put up any sorta fight against us! Right, Lord Zahar?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0007
096	...
097	Lord...Zahar?
098	Lord Zahar. You are too focused on your personal battle with that Vettel. Our ambitions are grander than that.	VO_niggle.niggle_sys_0016
099	I am aware.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
100	Anyway, come on. A girl's gotta eat! The squirt's waiting on us, too!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0008
101	How curious, Ila. I didn't know the two of you had gotten so close.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0007
102	Wh-what? That's got nuthin' to do with it, I just get sick of the squirt's whimpering if we're away for too long.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
103	Heh heh... There's no point in hiding it! Everyone can tell that you're secretly worried!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0008
104	I am not!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
105	Lord Zahar. It seems that we have some...uninvited guests.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0030
106	Ah... It's you.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0016
107	What?!
108	The Corpse... You Holy Order trash! Dogs! Show yourselves! I know you're here!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0029
109	You have become a liability. Mark our words... You shall not have much longer to live.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
110	How lovely. It seems that the Holy Order of Babel has begun to take us seriously.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
111	Welcome back, everyone!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0007
112	Didja hold down the fort properly while we were gone, squirt?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0005
113	Yeah! Oh?! Ila, your face... You've been wounded!	VO_mea.mea_sys_1006
114	Huh? This? It's nuthin' to worry about. Forget about it.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0012
115	But...	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
116	Leave it, a'ight? I told you, it's fine.	VO_ila.ila_sys_0030
117	S-Sorry!	VO_mea.mea_sys_0035
118	Aw, Mia! Wanna hear something good? Ila was all in a rush to get back here because she was worried about you!	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0003
119	Wait, what?!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0025
120	R-really...?	VO_mea.mea_sys_0025
121	I never said that!	VO_ila.ila_sys_0047
122	Heh heh... Come on, Mia! I bet Ila is just too shy to admit that she would loooove for you to help her take care of her wound.	VO_syrma.syrma_sys_0010
123	Shuddap, Silma! Could you keep your trap shut for once?	VO_ila.ila_sys_0031
124	...
125	What is it, Lord Zahar?	VO_spica.spica_sys_0003
126	It's nothing. I shall rest.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_chara_1001
127	...
128	...
129	What is on your mind?	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
130	I...need more power.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
131	I do not have the strength to defeat Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard, and the Holy Order... Perhaps I do not have the power to establish an order of darkness.
132	You are the conqueror who shall become the king of darkness. You must have the strength to bear that burden.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
133	Listen to me, Zahar...	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0037
134	...
135	You and I were destined to meet. It is my fate to become your strength.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
136	Thank you...sister.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
137	Just promise me that my death will be quick and painless.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0004
138	Of course.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0004
139	Letitia, you were the only one in that prison who would smile at me. You are everything to me.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0018
140	Sister and mother all in one... My only family.
141	(Ah, yes... That guileless promise from long ago.)
142	Zahar. Wake up. The morning has come.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0001
143	...
144	Good morning, Zahar.	VO_laetitia.laetitia_sys_0007
145	Good morning, Letitia!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0007
