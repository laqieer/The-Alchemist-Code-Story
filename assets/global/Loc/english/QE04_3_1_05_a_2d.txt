001	You dare say we burden nature?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0026
002	Exactly.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0037
003	No...we have not abandoned our responsibility! We live by our own hands!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0013
004	Exactly. That's how we learned of the danger to Saga and are now fighting for our future.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
005	What would an outsider like you know about any of this?! I've heard enough nonsense from you, you invader!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
006	Of course, you wouldn't understand...you fools! Don't you realize it was your own foolishness that brought about this situation?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0016
007	Don't listen to him! He's trying to invade Saga. Of course, he's just speaking nonsense!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0014
008	I know, Lisbeth! His words don't deserve our attention!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0010
009	Whether you heed my words or not is up to you. I merely inform you out of respect for the strength you have shown me.	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
010	Shut up! Enough with your arrogant talk, you invading scum!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
011	Hyahahahaha! Don't you understand how incongruous your words are coming from one who claims to respect the natural order of things?!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_battle_0011
012	Survival of the fittest! That is the law of nature!
013	I told you, didn't I? If you wish to resist invasion, then you must prove it with your strength!
014	...!
015	That's why I am now proving to you my strength! I am not a weakling; I am invincible! Proving this is my justice!
016	If a country is invaded and destroyed then that's all there is to it. Since the time of creation, how many races and countries do you think have perished?	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0007
017	In this world, only the strong remain! That is what history is all about! Whatever tribe may perish, I will not perish...that is my revenge!
018	...Your revenge?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
019	Hmph. I got a little worked up and let a little too much slip. There's no need for you to know about that. Well then, let's continue. Let's decide which of us will survive!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0009
020	Under no circumstances will I tolerate your interpretation of justice! You used the Jam to take countless lives...you will not be forgiven!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0013
021	Oh? So, you've picked up on the movement of the Jam. That wasn't my idea...but, although it may be cowardly, it's an effective plan...and that's what matters in war!	VO_gaiorgeos.gaiorgeos_sys_0005
022	I will not let you do to Saga as you please!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0015
023	Don't let him get to you, Tina! We have no way of defeating him like this. We need to think of a plan!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0015
024	But what kind of plan? I doubt he'll let us escape alive. More importantly, we don't have any time!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
025	Lisbeth is right. We'll just have to find a way out of this. Survival of the fittest, huh? He might have a point.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
026	If so, in order to protect everything, I will become more powerful right now! I will not allow Saga to be consumed! I will protect it!
027	The only reason why I can stand here now is because of you Mocca, Lisbeth, and everyone else.
028	I will not let all of you lose your lives. I will be the strength that protects all of you!
029	Tina...?! But...!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
030	Don't worry. It's taken some time, but I've gotten a read on Georgios' movements.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
031	I will use every last ounce of my strength...I will protect you, Mocca, Lisbeth and all of Saga!!!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1006
