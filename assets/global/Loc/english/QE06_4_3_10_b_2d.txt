001	Tch. This is a lot to ask of just two measly humans, you know!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
002	You never struck me as a quitter, Edgar. Suck it up, and let's make that opening!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
003	Yeah, yeah.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
004	Haaaaaaaahh!
005	!!!
006	Huff...huff... Was that enough?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
007	Yep. Amane's up now.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0011
008	Amane!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
009	Ready. Logi, on my mark.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
010	What is your plan here? I can't piece it together.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0006
011	We're going to get Azami to help us.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
012	?!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0012
013	This sword was once Azami's. So her thoughts and feelings still reside within it.
014	Which means I can reach out to her, and we'll have a Kagomurasaki at our disposal after all!
015	You...can do that?!	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0031
016	Even if I couldn't, I'd find a way to make it happen anyway. We have to believe! Our thoughts and feelings need to reach her!
017	Get ready, Logi.	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0002
018	Understood. I'll do my best to get through.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
019	Now!
020	All my thoughts and feelings, unto this technique, with intent not to kill but to save...
021	Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi!!!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
022	...!
023	Uggrraaah!
024	Azami, lend me your power!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0005
096	Whew, I'm full.
097	We'll be fine.
098	We won't go down. Not yet.
099	At least not until we've fulfilled our oaths.
100	To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!
101	To bring about blissful days of joy!
102	Wadatsumi's future... Our future...
103	With our blades...
025	Wake up, Tamba! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0032
026	...!
027	Tamba!
028	Amane! Hey!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0002
029	...
030	Tamba? Are you all right? Your face tells me you might just be back to normal.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
031	Why...aren't you killing me?
032	Because there's no need to kill you.
033	Don't you realize I'm planning to destroy you all?
034	I know that isn't what you really want. You want to make peace with humanity.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
035	No. You're wrong.
036	Then did you lie when you swore to defend young Mikaboshi and Sumeragi? When you told them you'd protect them, even at the cost of your own life?
037	I spoke out of turn. My thoughts were muddled. I'd already committed a grave sin by that time.
038	Is that enough reason to confine yourself to the horrors of the past? Are you just going to blame yourself forever and continue to deny yourself what you truly want as punishment?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0001
039	...
040	...
041	Agatha?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0005
042	It must've been painful. So, so painful. But it doesn't need to continue like that.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_battle_0019
043	You don't have to suffer anymore. All these people here are trying to reach you. They're offering you a hand to grant you salvation.
044	After what I've done, I don't have the right to take that hand.
045	You do.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0037
046	...
047	The difference between our two species is so trivial. If a mistake is all you're worried about, you can take all the time you need to atone for it. You have that right.
048	Every living thing does.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0004
049	Why are you saying all of this?
050	Because you looked so troubled when you were fighting. I think anyone who stared into your eyes would've been just as inclined to lend a helping hand.	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0005
104	I don't deserve your sympathy.
105	You could very well not. I don't know your circumstances. But I've had people tell me I should've been killed...and then later reach out to help me.
106	That's the whole reason I'm still alive today: because I was given a second chance. Which is why I'm reaching out to you now. And I don't intend to pull that hand away, no matter how many times you swat at it.
051	...!
052	It all comes down to what you want to do. So, what is it you want to do, Tamba?	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0003
053	...
054	There are people here who wish for your happiness. How will you respond to those wishes?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
055	...
056	If you're not going to answer, then how about I connect you to the person you want to see most of all, instead?
057	Amane...
058	Just for a moment, I know. I'm afraid I no longer have the energy to let you savor this reunion for very long.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
107	But the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi was forged from a demon's horn as well. Care to take a guess whose it was?
108	...It's okay. You'll find out soon enough.
059	...!
060	Hey, Tamba.	VO_kaede.kaede_favorite_0005
061	Kaede!	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
062	What is it you actually want to do? I'm dying to know, myself.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
063	...You don't hate me?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0018
064	Of course not. I have a few regrets, and some unfinished business I wish I could've attended to before my passing. But ultimately, that's it. I managed to live every day to the fullest.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
065	The ideals that Koga and I dreamed of were passed down to Mikaboshi and Sumeragi, and somehow or another, they've managed to continue passing them down through the ages themselves.
066	That's all the legacy I could ever ask for. There's no room in my heart for hatred.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
067	But, I... I have to atone, somehow. I just... I don't know how...
068	Somewhere deep in your own heart, I think you do. You've always been a good person, when it comes right down to it.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0006
069	Just do what your heart tells you. Don't be bound to anyone else's will. Don't get taken advantage of. That's all I've ever wished for you.
070	Agh!
071	Huff...huff... Well?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
072	I've lost. I accept my defeat.
073	Heh. I see.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0007
074	I will return this body to its original owner. Though that's about all I can do, I'm afraid.
075	I wonder whether you'll be able to pursue Kaede's ideals to the very end. I'll be watching, to find out.
076	Will you be okay?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0003
077	I should be. Though there is one last thing I'd like to say.
078	...I'm sorry.
079	Looks like we managed to save him after all.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
080	We sure did.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0037
081	Is it over, then?
082	It is. Agatha, could you take care of healing everyone's wounds?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0037
083	The foes we need to worry about now are the Discarnate Power and Judius. But we'll have to rebuild our forces before we can take them on.
084	And before even that...I should take a rest myself.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0027
085	Just hang in there a little longer, Amane. I know you're tired after everything you've done, but we'll need to find you a safe spot for that rest first.
086	I've been waiting for this moment.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
087	?!
088	This body will make a fine vessel for the Demon King. I shall gladly take it as my own!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
109	The Discarnate Power! No!
110	Gah! It's no good!
111	Now there are none left to oppose me! Everyone will bend to my will!
112	Discarnate Power!
113	All of you! All of Greed Dike! All of you will bend the knee! And we'll start by making Wadatsumi into a land for demons, and demons alone!
114	Stop!!!
089	Ah...
090	You? Why?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
091	...! You!!!
092	Hey. Apologies for keeping you waiting. Waiting for much, much too long...
