001	My Dearest Lord Fraise...
002	Time has flown since your arrival in Lustburg.
003	Hehe. Another letter from Lady Eve. She may appear over-confident, but she's surprisingly dedicated.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
004	That being said, the first letter I received from her was beyond the scope of unexpected.
005	An arrow?! Who's there?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0027
006	I-I'm sorry!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0047
007	What...?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
008	I'm sorry! I tried to send you a letter attached to an arrow, but my hand started trembling!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0036
009	A-a letter attached to an arrow?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0016
010	Yes! My name is Eve...	VO_eve.eve_chara_1001
011	I want to become your bride!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0048
012	...What?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0016
013	Yesterday, I saw your body while you were bathing. You've got that slim toned look! It's the ideal masculine body!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0003
014	You made me realize that you're the only person for me!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
015	So...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0031
016	Please, take me as your wife!	VO_eve.eve_chara_2023
017	What...?!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0025
018	She appeared along with her arrow letter before I could even read its contents. It was like she had launched herself along with her arrow.
019	She truly was a woman that resembled the most delicate of arrows...
020	Heheh. Right now, she's training to cook...	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
021	(It might be a good idea to go see her the next time I head to Lustburg.)
022	To make my way to her...
023	There ya go!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0007
024	Oh, if I polish this monster's claw, it'll make a good fruit knife.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0009
025	When it comes to becoming a good bride, it's all about the tools of the trade♪	VO_eve.eve_sys_0010
026	Well then, I'm gonna really work on brushing up those cooking skills!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0023
027	Huh?! Is that a monster...?!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
028	Don't move!	VO_eve.eve_battle_0006
