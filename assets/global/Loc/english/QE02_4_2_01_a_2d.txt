001	Ooooo Ooooo Ooo!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0028_b
002	Squeak! Squ-squ-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
003	Wh-what the...?! Are the Demons raising a cry...?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0027
004	Smoke! There are fires all throughout the city! What is going on?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
005	Don! Bad news...the Demons working throughout the city have gone rogue! Most likely, it's not just in this city...	VO_tango.tango_sys_0022
006	Tango, watch out! Behind you!
007	...?!
008	Whoa! Thanks. You saved me.	VO_tango.tango_sys_0027
009	They're going rampant, but their movements are still clumsy. Even a civilian with a weapon should be able to take them out.
010	Don, what should we do?	VO_tango.tango_sys_0031
011	Tango, you and the men will protect the city. I and the others will head to the clock tower. Protect the city as if your life depended on it.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0010
012	Yes, Don! Come on, men!	VO_tango.tango_sys_0037
013	Yes, sir!
014	Tsk. Is this Alvarez's doing as well?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0016
015	Probably...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
016	No way! Has he already obtained Belphegor?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
017	Don't worry, young lady. If we take the Sacred Stone back from them, everything should return to the way it was.
018	In order to heal this chaos, we must hurry to the clock tower.
019	You're right!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0004
020	Hey, what are you all standing around for?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0002
021	You heard them, didn't you? Right now, even civilians should be able to take them out!
022	Go on and restrain a Demon or take care of the old and young!
023	H-hey...isn't this a really dangerous situation?
024	Huh?
025	Both Wratharis and Envylia were destroyed by Demons. Could this be something similar?!
026	This is pretty serious! Let's get out of here!
027	No! Are you going to give up before even trying?!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
028	Don't listen to the mafia! You'll only get caught up in trouble!
029	You...!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0013
030	Ronnie, you stay here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
031	Huh?! He-hey, wait. What are you saying?!
032	Trust me, I don't want to leave you behind. I'm asking you because you're the only one who I can trust.
033	Huh...?	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
034	Tango and the others have their hands full with the Demons. You're the only one who can organize the confused citizens.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0036
035	Don...
036	As a full-fledged member of the Don Taras family, this is my order to you. Until I return, you and Tango are to protect this city.
037	...!
038	We'll take on Alvarez and you'll take on the danger that threatens this city.
039	Even if we are in different locations, the battle we fight is the same. Do you understand, Ronnie?
040	Tsk. Just promise me one thing. I swore to protect Miss Fiona.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0016
041	You better do everything you can to protect her in my stead.
042	Ronnie!	VO_fiona.fiona_favorite_0005
043	Of course. Leave it to me.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
044	Heh. I promise to quell the confusion within this city.	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0010
045	Just know that if Alvarez beats you...I'll laugh at you from the bottom of my heart!
046	Right back at you. All right...let's get this done and over with!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0008
047	There's another fire here! Edgar!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0027
048	Steady yourself, little lady. I understand that you want to help them, but if we don't take back the Sacred Stone, nothing will be solved.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
049	But...we can't just let these people die.	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0021
050	Squeak! Squ-squeak!	VO_alkemono.alkemono_sys_0008
051	There's a child in front of the Demon!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0022
052	Nooo!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
053	Young lady! Ack... Stop her, comb head!	VO_taras.taras_favorite_0004
054	Tsk! I won't make it on time. Blow it up, massive-arm!
055	Ooooo Ooooo Ooo!	VO_Mmajin.Mmajin_battle_0002
056	N-no...!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0028
057	?!
058	Huh?! D-did I survive?! Th-thank you!	VO_fiona.fiona_sys_0025
059	No thanks are necessary.
060	Your coat of arms...
061	We are the army of volunteers that have assembled under Captain Logi.
062	You're the redhead's underlings?! Tsk. Little lady, step away from him!
063	Bu-but...
064	Do not mistake our intentions. We are here to help the citizens of this city.
065	Help...?
066	Do not worry. We'll suppress these rogue Demons. You said your name was Edgar, didn't you?
067	What is it? What are you scoundrels plotting?
068	Captain Logi said that an action beyond your imagination will be the decisive factor.
069	Please, lend Captain Logi your strength and put an end to Alvarez's violent actions.
070	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
