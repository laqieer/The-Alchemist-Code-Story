001	Saga region. Water Temple.
002	Hang in there! Don't lose faith!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0042
003	Oh...how are...m-my people of the...water tribes?	VO_voda.voda_battle_0019
004	It's all right! There haven't been any further casualties! The damage has been stemmed to the minimum!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
005	What a...relief...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0020
006	So-someone, tend to her! Hurry!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0019
007	Don't worry. I told you I wouldn't kill the Sprites, didn't I?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
008	Besides, she's a woman. I went a little easy on her.
009	Tsk...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_battle_0022
010	Still, I've finally obtained the third one. These Matters really are a lot of trouble to deal with.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
011	You...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0012
012	Honestly. You should be a little more grateful, redhead. I followed your request and kept casualties to a minimum.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
013	In any case...this may not necessarily be the end of it.
014	What are you planning next?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
015	Why don't you ask her instead? Bang.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
016	Ughhhhh!!!
017	Huh...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
018	It appears she was setting a trap. Here I was, ready to end things peacefully...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
019	It can't be! Voda obediently surrendered...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
020	No...it's not that woman.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
021	Aghhh...!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0022
022	...!
023	Uck...ack...!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0024
024	You're...Seida's acquaintance...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
025	You're the one who's been tailing us since we left the settlement of that battle faction.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
026	And you're the one who riled up this tribe, aren't you?
027	The Ma-Matters are sacred crystals that are integral to Saga! They aren't some little toy for the likes of you to play with!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0019
028	You're all losers...with no place in the future of this world.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
029	And, as a loser, you have no right to an opinion.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
030	Y-you don't understand the repercussions of misusing the Matter! You don't understand anything!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0018
031	They may very well be related to the ancient dragon that has been prophesied to destroy this world!
032	The ancient dragon...?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
033	Are you telling me that this Matter might summon that dragon? Hehe...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
034	Tsk! What's so funny?!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0019
035	Haha. How splendid! A dragon would be quite incredible!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
036	You've renewed my interest in gathering the Matters. I look forward to seeing it with my own eyes!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0023
037	Y-you...!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0025
038	However...if that dragon was to become an obstacle for us, then that would change matters.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
039	I don't know what it signifies to you, but...
040	If it stands in my way, I'll blow its head off.
041	...!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0027
042	Come on. Let's go, redhead. Heheh. We may get to meet a legendary dragon, you know?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
043	I-I promise I'll make you regret this! You and all your friends! All of them!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0042
044	...What?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
045	Th-the cries of pain from my dead tribesmen call out to me...spurring me forward!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0019
046	A-all of you...I promise...
047	...Now, why would you say such a thing?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0012
048	...What?	VO_merda.merda_sys_0025
049	It contradicts my philosophy to kill a woman.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0013
050	However, if you're going to make my friends your target, you leave me with no choice but to kill you.
051	...! Oh...	VO_merda.merda_sys_0018
052	N-no! Stop!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0043
053	It's too late. It's in a tribe's nature to try and weed out whoever it is that threatens their people.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0040
054	Hm...?
055	Boar Tackle!!!	VO_merda.merda_battle_0008
056	Uck...?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0043
057	He fell for it! Now!!!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0023
058	Are those...the people from the water faction?
059	Come on! With that bow...we'll avenge all those who've died!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0010
060	Well...who would've thought you'd set a trap like this? Quite cunning.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
061	...?! Wait, people of the Voda faction! It's still not deep enough...	VO_merda.merda_sys_0027
062	...Too late.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
063	Aghhhh!!!	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0028
064	!!!
065	Ho-how...could you?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0028
066	Sorry. I didn't want to kill them either.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0036
067	It's your fault for letting your mouth run wild, you know?
068	Wh...whaa!!!	VO_merda.merda_sys_0027
069	But...as the leader, it's not right for me to break a promise. Will you forgive me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
070	Sto...stop!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0019
071	Hmm. You're quite the looker, but...you're not very popular with the ladies, are you?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
072	?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0025
073	Agh...?!	VO_sol.sol_battle_0022
074	I wouldn't call myself a feminist, but, you know...you've gotta treat women with respect.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
075	Ca-Captain Othima!!!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
076	...!
