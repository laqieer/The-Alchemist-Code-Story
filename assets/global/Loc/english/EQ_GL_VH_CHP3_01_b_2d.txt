001	My lord!
002	Stand down, Master Li Wang, or we answer with steel.
003	All right, all right. No need to get so serious!
004	With a snap of his fingers, Li Wang's men retreat without another word.
005	Only a heated discussion, you understand. We merchants do get passionate.
006	My apologies for the misunderstanding. I shall take my leave now...
007	But before that, may I strongly recommend giving my words some thought, Lord Zheng Yi?
008	After all, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I'm sure we both want the best.
009	Failing that, well... I'm sure you know what happens to those who dare threaten the peace and security of our great nation.
010	I am sorry, my lord. Had I been more swift...
011	It's not your fault. Are our guards safe?
012	None the worse for wear. I found them tied up and knocked out behind a shed.
013	Is there no level he won't stoop to?
014	You and I both know the other nobles will do little and less to aid our cause.
015	Not while Li Wang has most of them in his palm.
016	I can only imagine the extent of his grasp in Greed Dike.
017	If only we knew more about him and Goetia.
018	I've not heard from Shion in some time.
019	Troubling news indeed.
020	It would behoove us to plan our moves accordingly from here.
021	I do not believe Li Wang will make too overt a move against us for the moment, but there is no telling how much worse he will do.
022	Let us pray Shion makes it back safely.
023	Meanwhile, in the streets of Slothstein...
024	Spread out and flush them onto the streets! They couldn't have gotten far!
025	Yes sir!
026	(They're everywhere...)
027	(It's almost staggering to imagine the reach of Goetia's forces.)
028	Shion approaches a concealed door, glancing furtively at her surroundings.
029	It's me.
030	Glad to have you back. Come on in.
