001	Purses and jewelry... He stole a lot of different things, but we didn't find a single egg on his person.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
002	A thief at a festival?! That's the lowest of the low!	VO_pamera.pamera_sys_0013
003	Well... I suppose that would have been a little too easy.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0030
004	I wonder if the person who stole the Imperial Easter Egg took it because it looked expensive?	VO_fujika.fujika_sys_0016
005	If so, rest assured that they will not get off lightly. I cannot believe that someone would try to ruin a festival that everyone has been looking forward to!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0016
006	Not to mention that Neica herself made it, so if someone were to try and abuse its powers, we'd all be in trouble.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
007	For now, why don't we split up and search? Our priority is to find the egg before the public realize that it's missing!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0041
008	Yeah!
009	...
010	(What's wrong with me? Everyone else is searching for the egg seriously.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0016
011	(But here I am, half-hoping that the egg will never be found, so that the whole event will be called off.)
012	All right. Then you and I will search over here, Neica.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
013	Huh? Wh-what?! Y-you mean I get to p-pair up with you, T-T-Teona?! Wh-why? Is this a dream?!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
014	I know that the disappearance of the egg must have come as a shock to you, but I can assure you that this is no dream! Now, let's get moving!
015	Wow! Look at this! There was an accessory inside this egg! It's so cute!	少女Ａ
016	That looks like something Neica would make! I love her accessories, 'cause they're always in style, no matter how many years pass!	少女Ｂ
017	Would you like to keep this one, then?	少女Ａ
018	Huh? B-but that's yours! Thanks anyway, but I'm gonna find my own!	少女Ｂ
019	I can't rely on you for everything!	少女Ｂ
020	Then you've gotta find yourself one so that we can match! These accessories will be our special memory of today!	少女Ａ
021	(A special memory, huh...? Those girls really seem to be having a blast together.)	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0007
022	Everyone is so absorbed in the thrill of the Egg Hunt! It is all thanks to you, Neica, for making such adorable accessories and eggs for everyone to enjoy!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
023	O-oh! N-no, that's just... I-I mean, I really don't even—	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0047
024	Hold that thought! I just saw something glittering over there. I will investigate it immediately!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
025	Ah-hah! Look at this! This egg is beautifully painted and exquisitely decorated!
026	This can only mean that it must be the one, the only... The Imperial Easter Egg!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0024
027	O-oh, um... A-actually, that's just one of the regular eggs I made.	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0050
028	What?! Regular, you say?!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
029	Y-yes. You see, the Imperial Easter Egg is quite a bit bigger, and...	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0001
030	You little witch! I dare you to say that again!	VO_mafia.mafia_battle_0013
031	A-all right. It's quite a bit bigger than these regular eggs, and... Huh?	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0004
032	I'm the one who found that egg! Don't you go stealing it!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0014
033	You wish! I saw it first! It's mine!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0026
034	You want a piece of me?!	VO_mafia.mafia_sys_0017
035	W-wow... So people really do fight over the eggs!	VO_nacre.nacre_sys_0026
036	Indeed! Everyone takes this grand event very seriously!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
037	But that does not mean that fighting can be condoned! Let us put a stop to this, Neica!
