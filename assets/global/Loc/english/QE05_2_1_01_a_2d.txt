001	What the...?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0027
002	The village is burning! How can this be?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
003	That's the Royal Army! How did they get in?! What happened to the barrier?!
004	Dangit! It was pointless to take the long way home to avoid being followed! I could have been here to help prevent this!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
005	Commander! Wh-what should we do?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0018
006	Keep it together!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0012
007	For now, prioritize evacuating as many survivors as you can!
008	Those of you least injured, rendezvous with the guards and halt the enemy!
009	Those of you too injured to fight, follow me to the Chief! We must find out what's going on!
010	Commander, what about Sephiron? Sephiron is on fire!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
011	(It's too late for Sephiron. Nothing could survive after taking a bombardment like that.)
012	(But...I don't dare voice that out loud. I cannot afford for their morale to suffer.)
013	Believe in Sephiron! A bit of canon fire is nothing to the great tree Sephiron!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0012
014	Th-that's right! Come on, everybody! Let's go save our people!
015	Huzzah!!!
016	Malta, Kamui, please be safe!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
017	Chief! Chief, are you okay?!
018	Isidore, you have returned!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0009
019	Chief, what happened here?!	VO_ishido.ishido_favorite_1006
020	They came while we were preparing the resurrection ceremony. The enemy must have known somehow that we would be vulnerable.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
021	But how...?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
022	It isn't such an impossible idea.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
023	We Sephira have lived hidden here for generations, but there have been those who chose to leave.
024	You mean one of our own people betrayed us?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
025	Sadly, yes. Our bond with each other relies heavily on our shared dependence on Sephiron's blessings.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
026	It is very possible that those who left the village found it necessary to sell village secrets to make a living.
027	That's just... No, now is not the time for this!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
028	With the mirage barrier gone, we can no longer protect Sephiron.
029	We must hurry and evacuate the villagers to somewhere far from the fighting!
030	No, we must gather the warriors and assemble at the base of Sephiron. We must stay and protect the tree.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
031	What?! Why?! Chief, do you intend to sacrifice the villagers for the sake of a dying tree on the verge of burning to the ground?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
032	Fear not, Isidore. Sephiron will soon be reborn.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
033	Chief?
034	Malta is performing the resurrection ceremony. With her sacrifice, Sephiron will regain her former power.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
035	That will turn the tide of battle. We must hold on until then.
036	Sacrifice? Did you say sacrifice? Malta?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
037	I am sorry, Isidore. I could not bring myself to tell you. As the next Chief, this is the inevitable hardship that you must endure.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0020
038	Inevitable? What?! What are you saying?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
039	Did Malta know this whole time?!
040	...
041	Chief! You... You...?! How could you sacrifice your own daughter?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
042	Did you agree to our marriage knowing she would be taken away like this?!
043	(—ill)
044	(—ill th—)
045	Urk... Aah...!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
046	(Kill them all)
047	(Your love was taken from you. Betrayed. Then...!)
048	You understand, Isidore. To protect Sephiron is our most sacred duty. Malta's sacrifice will not go—	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
049	(Then you must take everything from them!)
050	Ahhh...!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
051	Wha—?!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0042
052	I suppose...this is how I reap what I have sown.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
053	Wh-what just...?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
054	Chief?! Wh-what have I...?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
055	It's fine. I, too, have felt the rage you feel now. No one can escape the darkness that lurks within.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0018
056	It is...painful to lose...the ones you love.
057	Do not, though, be turned... Do not drown in the temptation of darkness. That will...lead you...to...
058	Temptation of darkness? Did I...? No! How could I...?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0021
059	Haha—ngh! It seems...there was turmoil in my heart as well.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0018
060	But I...need you to understand... We cannot let...our traditions die out.
061	Please! Don't move! I will bring someone that can heal—	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
062	Do not! You cannot...let anyone see this. It will affect...your standing among our people.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
063	This isn't the time to worry about such things!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0020
064	This is...exactly the time... Listen to me, Isidore. I...	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0039
065	I...hereby bestow my title as Chief upon you, Isidore... You must lead the Sephira now.
066	Wh-what?!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
067	Isidore... It is the Chief's responsibility...to bear the sins of this village...no matter how much blood flows.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
068	Our traditions...must live on. We must...never lose hope...in our blood-soaked fate.
069	I cannot! Never will I be able to tell my children to abandon the people they love!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
070	I used...to think that as well.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0042
071	Please, Isidore... Respect the determination...of those who have chosen...to be sacrificed. Do not let their deaths be in vain...
072	Chief? Chief!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0025
073	My love... At long last...I will finally be at your side again.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
074	Wh-what have I...? I can't... I...I didn't mean to...! Why did I—	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
075	Aaah!!! Stop, no! I don't want to d—	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0028
076	Mommy?! Mommy, no!!!	VO_mob-saga_female.mob-saga_female_sys_0020
077	I must focus. There are still...many people that I must protect. There are still many reasons to fight on!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_1021
078	I will never forget what you have done, Chief. Someday, I will see you again in hell.
079	You owe it to this village and its people to grant me the strength to protect them all!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0018
080	Huzzaaaaaaaah!!!	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0032
081	Ngh—gah!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0043
082	Haa... Haa...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0022
083	There's too many of them!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0022
084	Did all the survivors in this area make it out? Then I should find the guards and join them in the fight.
085	I'm sure the Chief must have a plan to get us through this.
086	Besides, I must have a word with him about the resurrection ceremony...
087	Found another survivor! A villager!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0010
088	Ah. It seems like I have to take care of this first.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_battle_0019
089	He's alone, but don't get careless! They can use some mysterious, alchemy-like sorcery!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
090	A mysterious sorcery, huh? There's no need to hide it anymore, I guess.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0007
091	Let me show you what I learned from my mentor, Waginau: the true strength of the Protector!
