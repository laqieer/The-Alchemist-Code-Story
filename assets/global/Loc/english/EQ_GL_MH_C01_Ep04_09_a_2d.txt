001	*snarl!*
002	The monsters stalk close to the party, intent on tearing the flesh from their prey.
003	A few are nosing at the desiccated corpses in the room, as if searching for what little sustenance they can find.
004	HHhhrrrrr...
005	The Construct begins to hum in an unearthly tone. The air grows heavy as a strange essence permeates the space.
006	The monsters pick themselves back up, shaking their heads and baring their teeth.
007	Minerva's jewel reacts to the spike in Alchemia particle density, glowing intensely.
008	It can even alter the concentration of Alchemia particles in the atmosphere.
009	The monsters did not develop a taste for flesh alone... it's the particles they're after.
010	So... this one is similar to that "Divine Protector" from Sakris?
011	Pardon?
012	I met Soren in a village somewhere in the Saga region while on an assignment to investigate aggressive wildlife.
013	He was able to control an enormous golem that was sacred to the villagers, just like this one here, to protect the village from raiders.
014	He was also a target of kidnapping, so I decided to take him along while searching for the perpetrators.
015	I see! And this "Divine Protector" derives its energy source from Alchemia particles?
016	That's what I thought, yeah.
017	If they are so similar, yet are in locations so far apart, then there may be more of these facilities and creations about.
018	So many questions...
019	Grooaaarrr!
020	And plenty of time to think about them after!
