001	Huzzzaaaah!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
002	Well done.
003	Haa... Haa... Haaa.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
004	Nimul. I deem thou worthy of being the chief of the Sephira.
005	Then answer me, Godwolf. Will I be able to liberate my people from sin?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
006	Can I remake this world?!
007	...
008	They who do not stoke the fires of their will have no choices in this world.
009	What do you mean?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
010	If thou hold'st fast to thine will and thine might, it may be...possible.
011	Wh-what?!
012	My powers...can free us from sin!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0046
013	Alas, should the fires of thine will flicker, in mere moments the flames would spread...
014	And in all likeliness devour the very world.
015	What?!
016	This world would crumble under the weight of new sins.
017	Nimul... The future that awaits is thine to determine.
018	Godwolf! Wait! I still have questions!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
019	That's enough, Nimul!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0015
020	...
021	H-hey... What the hell just happened?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
022	Nimul...
023	...
024	My word... Is he really fit to be our chief?
025	There's nothing that can be done. The Godwolf has spoken.
026	Still, the audacity... I cannot believe he spoke to the Godwolf in such an insolent manner.
027	Wh-what is this?!
028	Oh, surely not! It couldn't be the corruption, could it?!
029	...
030	Wh-what're you doing here?! This is the sacred altar of the Sephiron! You must leave here immed—!
031	Ah!
032	L-Lady Lila?!
033	Argh... Haaa...
034	Aaaaaaahhh! P-please, someone, h—!
035	Urgh... Hrgh...
036	Wh-who...?
037	I am one who protects this world.
