001	Tch! At this rate...! Retreat! All units retreat and regroup!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0019
002	You're not going anywhere!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0007
003	Ngh... Y-you...!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_battle_0021
004	Th-they got the general! Aaahh!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0027
005	Halt! All units, halt! We do not need to pursue them!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0037

012	For now, though, we should celebrate. We won the day—we survived.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0007
013	Even if our next battle is just around the corner, our soldiers will need their rest.
014	Yeah... You're right.	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
015	Haaa... Haaa...	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
016	So it's over.
017	With this, we, the Blue Tongues, have come to the forefront of history.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
018	Is this...really okay?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
019	Can fighting really bring peace to Babel?
020	...
021	So... It has begun.
022	It has been so long; it feels as if an eternity has passed since that fateful day.
023	Now, we come to the end of a legend—to the final page in the history of the Sephira...
