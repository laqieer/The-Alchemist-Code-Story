001	We finally made it through the forest.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0030
002	Yes.
003	We're almost at the rendezvous point, but we don't know what might happen. Don't let your guard down.
004	We're going to meet up with the other Paladins outside of the 4th Regiment, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
005	Yes. There we'll meet up once with some of the Regiments and, after that, we'll attempt to catch up with Captain Zain who is ahead with all the Regiments.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
006	To be honest, it'll be all the Paladins excluding the 4th and 6th Regiment.
007	The 6th Regiment? Is that Captain Othima's Regiment? Why...
008	When the call was made, only he wasn't around.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
009	I wonder what he's doing during an emergency like this.
010	The newly appointed Captain Seida of the 3rd Regiment went looking for them, but...
011	Huh? I saw Captain Othima before we left, you know?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
012	Huh, where?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_battle_0019
013	He said there was something he was looking for. I told him about the gathering, but he said whatever he had to do was more important.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
014	That idiot! Fine, let's forget about Othima and the others for now!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
015	What we need to focus on right now is rendezvousing with Lord Zain as soon as possible...understood?
016	Ye-yes! Kagura is okay, right?
017	I don't know.
018	But she's with Lord Zain. I doubt anything will happen to her, but you never know.
019	Captain Yauras...I know it may not be possible, but I have a request.
020	...What is it?
021	I know that you can't discuss these things due to your position, but, in order to not have any regrets, I would like to understand the place we are headed.
022	What exactly is happening in Wadatsumi?
023	... ...
024	Do you promise not to tell anyone?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
025	Of course, Don.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
026	Fine. Actually, the other day, a gigantic Spirit Stone was found in the Wadatsumi.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0037
027	A Ghost Stone?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
028	Yes. It's called the Mikaboshi. That Stone hides a tremendous power that could destroy this entire world.
