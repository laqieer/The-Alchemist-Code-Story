001	Oh, wow! The Halloween Carnival is incredible! Just look at all these costumes!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0044
002	Hehe, I'm totally getting into the Halloween spirit!
003	Ooh, look, they've got stalls! *gasp* Is that a teddy bear? It's adorable!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0007
004	...That teddy bear...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
005	Oh? Seen something you like?
006	No, it's nothing. Never mind.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
007	Why don't we go over our assignment one last time?
008	Good idea. As I'm sure we all know, we're here first and foremost as guards for the carnival.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
009	There are always some people who take the celebrations a little too far.
010	Yeah... Now you mention it, every year gets kinda crazy.
011	Exactly. We're here to make sure that everything goes off without a hitch.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0007
012	The theme of this year's carnival is "Pleasant Surprises."
013	Halloween pranks should all be pleasant surprises, you see. Anything dangerous or harmful is out of bounds.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
014	Our biggest job is to patrol the carnival, making sure that everyone is having a safe and happy Halloween.
015	We're also meant to hand out sweets to the town children and discretely add some extra surprises to the decorations.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0031
016	An extra pumpkin here, a few more candles there... It'll be like one big game of spot the difference!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0045
017	With all the arts and crafts goodies they gave us, we can really get creative.
018	Hmph! I mislike these garish festivities. All this orange and black offends my eyes.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
019	It's because Halloween used to be a harvest festival. The orange is supposed to represent the bounty of the sun.
020	Fascinating! Then this Halloween of yours is a celebration of the sun—and thus also of myself, its successor!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0044
021	But of course. That's why Nefertiti was so pleased that you were coming.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
022	She said she couldn't think of anyone better to liven up the festival atmosphere.
023	My dearest sister said that?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
024	Ah, then what knave would disappoint the beauteous rose of the desert? Not I!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
025	Rejoice, for the Successor of the Sun shall deliver the greatest Halloween this world has ever known!
026	That's the spirit! Actually, I have a very important job for you. Would you mind handing out sweets to the children?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0008
027	Oh, and I'd appreciate it if someone could prepare some extra goodies. We don't want any last-minute arrivals getting left out of the festivities.
028	I can take care of that. I'm a little out of practice, but I used to be quite the keen baker.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0004
029	Wonderful! Then I'll leave that in your capable hands. While the rest of you are getting ready, Rosa and I will start patrolling.
030	She's promised that she'll do her job properly this year. Although only time will tell if she means it...	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0039
031	Say, did Cheryl seem worried to you?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1003
032	Erm... Perhaps?
033	Now, to work! What wondrous decorations I shall create!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0009
034	You've sure gotten fired up.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0044
035	But of course! The Successor of the Sun meets his every trial with the fullness of his blazing soul!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
036	I have promised you the greatest Halloween, and I will spare no effort in keeping my word!
037	Besides, I would sooner die than fall short of my beloved sister's expectations!
038	Hey, you're actually a pretty hard worker. Guess we've all gotta give it our best shot, then! Right, Julia?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0045
039	...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
040	Julia?
041	What? Oh! My apologies. I was lost in thought.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
042	I agree. I think Ramses' attitude is admirable.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
043	We must make sure this carnival is as enjoyable as possible, and as satisfying as possible, for everybody.
044	Okay?
045	Argh! Another failure!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
046	Try as I might, nothing I create can adequately express the brilliance of the Successor of the Sun!
047	I'm not sure what this successor thing is about, but how's this for a sun?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0031
048	Ah... Magnificent! To think that the sun's glory could be captured so gloriously with mere paper!
049	Now, let's get to work on that orange and black card. A cut here, a snip there...and tada!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
050	Is that a jack-o'-lantern? I swear, give you a pair of scissors and there's nothing you can't make.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
051	Please, you'll make me blush! I'm not all THAT talented.
052	Such modesty demeans your handiwork. Be proud! It is no simple matter to create paper cutout art that is so bold yet delicate. It is the perfect representation for the Successor of the Sun!	VO_rameses.rameses_chara_1010
053	Say, how about we make them together? They're a breeze once you know how. Just watch!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
054	A pumpkin lamp! Most impressive!
055	Would that it were within my power to imitate. Alas, such work is far too dainty for my fingers.
056	Mine too, sadly, but I admire that you can put that blade to such a creative use. It's like its own kind of magic.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0006
057	Magic, huh...
058	I have an idea. Why don't we use these cutouts to decorate the town square?
059	I'm sure all the children will love them at least as much as their sweets. They're perfect for this year's theme, too.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0007
060	You really think so? Hehe, thank you!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0033
061	You know, someone very important to me taught me how to make these cutouts. They said it was so I could use my scissors to make people smile.
062	Then these cutouts must be very precious to you, if they remind you of someone you cherish.
063	Yep! That's right!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0004
064	Very well! Then we shall set to work in the kitchen. I promise you delicacies fit to grace my own royal banquet halls!
065	(Perhaps I overstated my abilities. Such delicate work tests even the talents of one such as I.)	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0031
066	(However, I cannot betray the expectations that my beloved sister has for this event. There is no challenge too great for the Successor of the Sun!)
067	Are you all right, Ramses? You seem a little stressed.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0030
068	Ah, Julia.
069	Baking requires patience and care. If you let yourself get frustrated, it will only lead to further mistakes.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0031
070	Why don't you take a break and see how Blanchett is doing? Leave this to me for a little while.
071	Perhaps I shall. I am sure she must be struggling on her own.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0004
072	But before I leave, allow me to say that I am impressed. You are truly a master of the culinary arts.
073	Please, I wouldn't go that far. It was just a hobby of mine, once upon a time.
074	I...see.	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0045
075	(No mere pastime can account for that hint of sadness in her eyes.)
076	Yeah, she seems to have her lonely spells every once in a while. Honestly, I'm a little worried.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
077	You see it too, then. I confess, I had half ascribed it to my own overactive imagination.
078	Nope, it's definitely real. She smiles and laughs along with the rest of us, but sometimes, when she thinks no one's looking, it's like a light's gone out.
079	I wonder what's got her so down in the dumps...	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0022
080	...
081	...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0016
082	Argh, enough! This grimace ill suits me!
083	I am to bathe this Halloween in my radiance, and yet here I am with a face like a thunderhead! No, a smile better befits a pharaoh!
084	You know, you can be pretty inspiring when you want to be.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0001
085	Such is the duty of the Successor of the Sun to his people. Hmm... I wonder only if there is some way to inspire similar cheer in Julia...
086	Aha! Of course! There ever was but one way to brighten a despondent damsel's day: a gift!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0007
087	That's a nice thought, but it's not going to fix whatever's bothering her.
088	Are you certain? My dearest sister was always adamant that it would be most effective.
089	Well, I guess it's not gonna do her any harm. But what could we get?	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_1003
090	...That teddy bear...	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
091	You know, I caught her staring at that teddy bear back at the stalls.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_chara_2006
092	A teddy bear? Perfect! I shall claim it for my own!
093	Roll up, roll up! Fancy your hand at the ring toss? Land a hoop on any of this fine selection of prizes, and it's yours to take home!
094	A trifling trial for the Successor of the Sun! That bear is as good as mine!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0008
095	Hah! Hup! Yah!	VO_rameses.rameses_battle_0001
096	Ooh, so close, but no cigar. Here's your last shot, buddy. Make it count!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mob-saga_omale_sys_0007
097	Come on, Ramses! Put some effort into it!
098	Hmph! I'll show you effort! Hraaaaagh!	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0029
099	Not like that, you idiot! That's WAY too much follow-throu—uh oh.	VO_blanchett.blanchett_battle_0022
100	Oof!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0042
101	Who threw that?! Hey, you! Think you're funny, huh?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
102	Who? Me?	VO_rameses.rameses_sys_0025
103	No, the other guy braining people with carnival rings at twenty paces. Of course he means you!	VO_blanchett.blanchett_sys_0016
104	I'd love to beat your ass right here, but the rules say no fisticuffs at the carnival, so we'll have to settle this some other way.
105	Get on over to the rifle stalls, pal! I'll show you why they call me the best shot in the west!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
