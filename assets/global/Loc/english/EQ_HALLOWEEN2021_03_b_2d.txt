001	They'll get what they deserve!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0010
002	Hyaaaah!!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0032
003	Gyaaaahhh!
004	Phew… They outnumbered us but we took care of them.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0016
005	Glad that we're not too far from the city. Seems like these people can get to the city without our help.	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0037
006	Yes. Is everyone alright? Any injuries?
007	Ow! I'm bleeding…!
008	Huh? Oh…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0025
009	Y-you're no human… with that power…!
010	You... What have you done, you monster?!
011	…!	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0042
012	U-um… I'll be leaving now!
013	Wait, Cordelia!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0016
014	…
015	Cordelia!	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0002
016	Oh… Tethys.
017	Sorry to rush off so quickly…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0006
018	I don't mind that, but what happened back there?
019	Well…I…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0001
020	I got a little scared. I thought they were going to call me a monster…
021	A monster? Why would they say that?
022	Being locked indoors for so long, I realized I was being called that.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0030
023	Being weak against bright sunlight, it was like a vampire's lifestyle. Even though I'm a normal human.
024	What's more, people made rumors that I was a vampire. When I fought back against them, I was further treated as a monster…
025	Just now, it made me recall that time…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0029
026	You were treated like that by everyone around you?	VO_thetis.thetis_sys_0003
027	No. My mother didn't. The housemaid who took care of me and her child, also a girl who was my friend…
028	There were some people who understood me and were friendly with me. But most people would have the urge to kill me.
029	So I got scared. Those people might've gotten scared of me and who knows…	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0027
030	But…you're trying to make bonds with other people.
031	Well, yes, I do. Weird, right? Even though I'm scared of others.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0011
032	I know it's a terrible habit. I'm cautious of what others think of me, so I tried to avoid people…
033	But why?
034	My mother, my friend who used to help me, and Alyu…used to treat me as a normal person.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0031
035	I don't want to be hurt, so I treat people like that as if they don't exist.
036	Before I became a Phantom Soldier, I might not have thought about it, but…
037	I am a soldier now, and the times that I was called a vampire is in the past.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0039
038	And so, by proving my merit in this situation, I thought I could put it all behind me.
039	I don't want to avoid people anymore and I want to make bonds by approaching others.
040	But…all those memories came flooding back..	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0006
041	I'm making an effort, but it's no good by getting scared again. Maybe I have no choice but to give up…
042	Oh, I'm sorry for talking about all this.
043	We were able to save those people, so we should get moving. We have to make sure the costume parade can continue.	VO_cordelia.cordelia_sys_0001
044	Cordelia…
