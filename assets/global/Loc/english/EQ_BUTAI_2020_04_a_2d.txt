001	Why did you go? Why didn't you tell me anything?
002	You disappeared before I had the chance to tell you how happy I was to become Lord Commander.
003	And now that we have finally been reunited, you are no longer able to speak...
004	And I find myself at a loss as to what to say.
005	Yet you never reply to my letters. The words I receive back have never once been yours.
006	And every reply I get from that dark place is addressed to me in the same way.
007	Correspondence Record (Memories)
008	"Dear Mister Blank."
009	"The charity of a unknown benefactor can go a long way in these slums."
010	"I can tell that your actions aren't driven by lust, or anything as obscene as that."
011	"You keep the words coming, even though you're fighting a losing battle. You should know by now that it's futile to stand against the darkness."
012	"Be that as it may, I need to know. Tell me about the situation in Lost Blue, about the dark underbelly of this world."
013	"What do you need? What would it take for you to accept my sincerity? I will do anything you ask of me. Please, just tell me your thoughts."
014	"Do you really think words are all it takes to help people? Do you expect all our troubles to go away just because we share them with you? Pretty sure the world isn't that simple."
015	"Words are our means of describing this world, and bringing its truths to light."
016	"I need to understand your world in order to save it. Furthermore, I cannot hope to guide people whose feelings I don't understand."
017	"Let me get this straight. You think you're capable of understanding everyone who was ever born?"
018	"Do you think you can achieve world peace by making everybody hold hands and telling them to get along? You think everybody is just going to listen to that, when they've got nothing to gain from it?"
019	"It's a pretty vision, sure—but that's all it really is, isn't it?"
020	"I beg to differ. How else do we learn from history, but by discussing it? How can we hope to accept each other, if we do not communicate?"
021	"Some people may never be able to see eye to eye, this is true; but gaining that understanding is still important, Yuvan. It allows us to see who can peacefully live alongside who."
022	"So you'd segregate the population? Must be nice if you get to live on top, but what happens to those of us at the bottom of the barrel?"
023	"What are you going to do to ensure that people with different backgrounds, cultures, and languages are able to coexist?"
024	"What will happen when you extend that crisp white glove of yours, and the hand that takes it is covered in filth?"
025	"You'd turn it away, wouldn't you? And that exchange is just going to leave both parties feeling hurt."
026	"Let's imagine that you want to get fish to live on land. For argument's sake, let's say you can understand fishspeak."
027	"Heck, let's say that you even know everything there is to know about the ocean. Do you think you could save them all?"
028	"Do you think you could make those fish thrive on land?"
029	I...!
030	"What if the fish weren't willing? Would you still try and "save" them?"
031	"What if they died when you exposed them to all that light of yours?"
032	Ngh...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
033	"I envy you, you know. You can prance around in the daylight, without ever having to worry about the predators that would pick you dry."
034	"Mister Blank."
035	What a stupid pen pal I've got.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
036	Lost Blue (Memories)
037	Aren't you taking this a bit too far?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
038	Whatever do you mean?
039	You know exactly what I'm talking about.
040	He wants a conversation, right? I'm giving him one.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
041	You do realize that this whole thing is pointless?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
042	Yeah? So?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
043	Hm...
044	Besides, try looking at it from my perspective. It's not all fun and games, y'know. I don't know the first thing about Mister Blank, but I'm talking to him anyway. Now that's generosity!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
045	That's the point of pen pals. You're supposed to get to know one another.
046	Well, all I know about Mister Blank is that he's some bigshot VIP. Pretty mysterious.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
047	Hm... I should be on my way.
048	Thanks for the delivery!
049	I don't do things by halves.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
050	Huh. You're pretty dedicated to procedure.
051	Please write your reply soon.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
052	Let's see... What did he say this time?
053	Huh? This is just a blank sheet of paper!
054	How am I supposed to reply to this?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
055	Sorry to interrupt.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0001
056	Get to the point already.
057	I came all the way out here in person. You understand what this means, don't you?
058	You got some business for me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
059	I'm looking for someone.
060	Hurry up and give me another job. I'm starving.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
061	Consider this your final warning.
062	...
063	The girl without a voice—she's here, isn't she?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
064	...
065	This is a very simple job. Hand her over, and you'll get your reward. It's as easy as that.
066	Do I look desperate enough to go pawning off people for money? What am I, a beggar?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
067	You aren't? I could've sworn you were a resident of Lost Blue.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
068	I've already given you my answer. I've got nothing to say to you.
069	How touching. You're very loyal, I see.
070	Loyal? Hah. There's no loyalty in Lost Blue.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
071	In a game of chess on the scale I play, one cannot afford to go without a single pawn. It pains me to see that I am missing a magnificent piece such as yourself.
072	I'd like you to work for me.
073	I'd like you to shut up.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
074	What was that?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0006
075	I'm trying to think of a reply to this blank letter, but I'm not going to get anywhere with all your yapping.
076	So quit bothering me already.
077	Tut-tut. You're writing a letter in the middle of our conversation? That's very rude, you know.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
078	I don't wanna keep my pen pal waiting.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
079	Didn't your parents ever teach you that the pen is mightier than the sword?
080	I really don't want to have to kill you, you know.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
081	How's this for a theory?
082	Oh?
083	What if that girl's silence was caused by someone literally silencing her?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
084	Like you, for instance. Maybe she found out about some dirty little secret of yours—something that could undermine your crude designs for world peace.
085	That would explain why you're chasing her.
086	And what secret would this be?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
087	Oh, I dunno... our little arrangement?
088	Some sacrifices are necessary to achieve peace.
089	Does the "greater good" ever really serve the world?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
090	Why, it's serving the people down here, is it not? By sparing them much hunger and suffering.
091	If someone else found out about it, would you do the same thing to them?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
092	Silence them? Kill them, even?
093	Such as that pen pal of yours?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
094	...
095	Do you hate this place?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
096	...
097	No? Then stay hidden. Don't pull another stunt like last time.
098	...
099	Well, I suppose I can't complain. I got a pen pal out of it. Thanks for that, by the way.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
100	...
101	This is a place where anyone is welcome. Even people who are marked for death, and people who can barely afford to live.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
102	The world needs a place like this.
103	So... Feel like writing a reply in my stead this time?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
104	———!
105	When you're done with it, you know who to give it to. Tell the delivery girl I said hi.
106	Studying up, are we, Lord Commander?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
107	Not a trace...
108	Hm?
109	There's nothing! Not a word. I can't find a single mention of Lost Blue anywhere!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
110	Northern Pride: Archives (Memories)
111	I've searched the Grand Library, the archives, everywhere! And yet—nothing. I can't find a thing.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
112	...
113	Isn't that strange? We've both visited it before. We know it exists. So why is it missing from history?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
114	Do people just pretend not to know about it? But why would they do something so cruel?
115	You're wondering why no one has tried to bring it to light?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
116	...
117	You're a good man, Zain.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0002
118	Are you making fun of me again?
119	You know... When you told me that you'd perfect the Holy Guard so that I could resign when it suited me... I was really touched.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
120	I'm afraid I'm hardly any closer to achieving it now than I was back then.
121	You're only mortal. You're overbearing with your subordinates, and stoop to their level when it suits you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
122	You're fool enough to chase me down alone, and you couldn't compose a decent love letter if your life depended on it.
123	Th-that's enough! There's only so much criticism a man can take in one—!
124	On top of that, you're as dense as wooden board, and an utter fool.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
125	But there is no such thing as perfect. You'll never be able to carry the entire world on your shoulders, no matter how hard you try.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
126	...
127	...
128	Kaya?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
129	Zain?
130	Am I not good enough for you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
131	What are you saying?
132	...
133	...
134	I... I mean to say that history's dark recesses may not change, but we could shoulder everything together, if you're willing. Guilt and all.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1004
135	You'd give up on the light?
136	Hmhm...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
137	What?
138	Nothing... Nothing at all.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
139	What's this?
140	A delivery.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1003
141	A letter? But I haven't sent Yuvan a reply yet...
142	I know. I gave him one: a blank piece of paper.
143	What?
144	You looked like you were struggling to find the right words, so I took the liberty of helping you out.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
145	...
146	Go on, take them. These love letters are for you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
147	There are two?
148	Yes.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
149	Why—?
150	Bye.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
151	Kaya?
152	I would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Captain of the Second Regiment of the Holy Guard. Please consider this letter my formal notice.
153	Not again!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
154	Please don't try to get involved with me. Just forget about me instead.
155	...
156	Why am I so blind to the workings of women's hearts?
157	...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
158	Why do I always fail to understand the true intentions of those around me?
159	Lord Zain! Lady Kaya just—!	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
160	I know.
161	...
162	You just got dumped, huh?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
163	It would seem so.
164	That's not like you.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
165	What are you talking about?
166	You look like you've given up already.
167	...
168	You know, I actually really enjoy reading romance novels. Well, okay—I enjoy the part where they help me start conversations with girls.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
169	The point is, I'm kind of an expert on love cliches. And just so you know, the girl always runs away from the guy at the climax of the story.
170	Like, seriously, it happens every single time! I'm pretty tired of reading the same plot over and over again, let me tell you.
171	They always use the same lines, too. "You're a fool!" "You're so dense!" "Bye." "Forget about me."	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
172	I-I've been told all of those things!
173	So, can you guess what the lovestruck lad always does in this situation?
174	What to do with a broken heart...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0030
175	Slothstein: Ruins (Memories)
176	It would seem the time has come.
177	You work fast. I suppose that means this truth I'm investigating is just that inconvenient for you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
178	There is no need for you to know.
179	So you're going to erase me.
180	If you insist on prying into matters that do not concern you—yes.
181	Unfortunately, my curiosity is too powerful a force even for me to tame.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
182	You imply that nothing else is?
183	More or less.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
184	You are so conceited as to believe that no one would dare go after you?
185	I knew that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared... So I made some preparations of my own.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1004
186	The Crimson Dragon!
187	This isn't like me at all, but... it can't hurt to unleash one's full strength... on occasion.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0014
188	We got here as fast as we could, but it looks like we're still too late.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
189	These are the ones who—!
190	Who crashed your last date too, huh?
191	Th-that wasn't a date! And nor is this.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
192	They must have it in for romantic trysts.
193	But this does explain why Kaya handed in her resignation letter.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
194	So then... this was all to put some distance between us, for our own protection? To spare us from getting wrapped up in whatever trouble she uncovered?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0029
195	Not us, you. She was trying to protect you, Lord Zain.
196	You think so?
197	Yup. Unlike you, I actually understand women.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
198	You go chase her. I'll take care of this lot, then catch you up.
199	But—!
200	Don't worry. I've got a plan.
201	All right... I trust you.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0037
202	Just so we're clear...	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
203	It's way too early to conclude this love story. We haven't even got to the happily ever after yet!
204	Die!
205	Don't make me repeat myself.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
206	Oh?
207	You might have come prepared... but so have I!
208	Guh!
209	How are you holding up?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0001
210	You're late.
211	Thank you for trusting me.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
212	This lot fight like paladins.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
213	I've been trying to figure out where they come from, though I haven't once been successful.
214	Without your help, Most Reverend Bishop, I fear that this matter will slink back into obscurity again.
215	I cannot express the depth of my gratitude, that you would risk your own personal safety in order to assist me.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
216	Yes, it is rather kind of me, isn't it? After you stepped down as captain yet again, in spite of my many objections.
217	Resigning is easier than all the paperwork this little excursion would've required.
218	Perhaps I ought to revise some of the Holy Order's bureaucratic red tape.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
219	Perhaps I'll even be there to help you. But first, can I count on your help here?
220	I couldn't disappoint such a pretty face.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
221	Whatever beauty I may possess pales in comparison to yours.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
222	Oh, please. There's no need to be so humble.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
223	Oh, please. There's no need to flatter me so.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
224	Oh, please—
225	Very well. Just this once.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
226	This will be the first and last time, I assure you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
