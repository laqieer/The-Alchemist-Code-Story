001	Hey, Kamui? Do you remember this place?	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
002	We used to play together until dark at the base of this great tree when we were little.
003	Isidore was always the one who came to pick us up so we could all go home together.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
004	Yeah, I remember.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
005	Back then, I never expected things to turn out like this.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0022
006	Malta?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0005
007	Kamui...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
008	We used to spend hours here, talking together.
009	Do you remember? We promised that we'd travel the outside world together someday.
010	Then Isidore's father died, and I became the druidic priestess, so we never got that chance.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
011	Yeah, I remember.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
012	If I were to say I wanted to leave the village right now...	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
013	Would you take me away?	VO_malta.malta_favorite_1004
014	I...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
015	We could find a land more luscious and green than here, where there are no restrictions or duties, and we can live together.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0007
016	We could build a house, tailor some clothes, hunt... We would be free to choose how to live on our own terms.
017	I think a child of ours would be very much like Hisham.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0008
018	Maybe some siblings would be nice, too! So we should have two kids—	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
019	Malta...
020	That can never be. I am now the Protector of Sephiron.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0035
021	I simply cannot abandon the duty given to me.
022	I...yes. I know.
023	You're just as stubborn as ever. Always shouldering the burden on your own.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
024	Is that so?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0047
025	That's how you are even now.
026	I know your commitment to your duties as Protector, and that the civil war continues to spill a river of blood.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
027	I just want to ask you: why must it be you who is burdened with these troubles?
028	I understand what you are trying to say, but...as long as there is something I can do to help...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
029	You're fine with taking the brunt of the hardship.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0020
030	I know it's a naive way of thinking, but I feel better if I am the one hurt, rather than others.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
031	No, Kamui, that is not naivete. That is called kindness.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0012
032	I guess that little Kamui I remember is all grown up now.
033	That's right... Things can't stay as they were. Those innocent days of our childhood when we could laugh so free of care are gone.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0016
034	Malta...
035	...
036	We should head back home.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0001
037	Are you sure?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0001
038	Yup! This was a refreshing change of scenery.	VO_malta.malta_sys_0004
039	Ah, um, if you say so.
040	Let's go home, Kamui.
041	As you wish.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
