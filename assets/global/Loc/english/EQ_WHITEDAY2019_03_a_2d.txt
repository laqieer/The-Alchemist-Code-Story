001	Numa...
002	Phew... Looks like it's finally over.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
003	Jeez... What was the deal with those Rattys, anyway?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0004
004	Maybe the monsters celebrate White Day, too?
005	Huh? No way! That's crazy!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
006	I-I wasn't being serious! It was just a joke... Would it kill you to smile once in a while?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
007	Tch. Shut up.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0012
008	What's your problem?!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
009	Calm down, will you?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
010	Now... Going back to what you said earlier, did you mean what you said about bringing Fraise to his senses?
011	Of course I did. I can't stand watching him act the fool.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
012	I'm gonna show him that love is nothing but a shackle that limits true strength. Then he'll go back to the way he used to be.
013	What do you mean by "bringing him to his senses?" Love is the cornerstone of happiness! It's importance cannot be understated!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
014	How can you stand there and belittle it, without even trying to listen to your brother's side of things?! You're horrible!
015	You kinda are, Gino. Moa's right. You're out of line.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0012
016	Who's side are you on, anyway?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0001
017	On the side of the ladies, of course. Anything important to them is important to me.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
018	Pathetic. You're weak.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
019	Well, it's not like I don't understand how you feel. Standing in the shadow of your big brother must be hard.
020	What did you say?
021	So? What are you actually going to do about it? Are you going to try and get in the way of Fraise and Eve's White Day celebrations?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0010
022	Ohhh no! There's no way I'm gonna let you do that!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0014
023	Besides, how can you even be sure that Fraise has grown weaker because of his feelings for Eve?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
024	Huh?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0004
025	You've been going on and on about love being a weakness this whole time, but you don't have a shred of evidence to back up that claim, do you?
026	Well... Not really, but...
027	She's got a point. Why don't you reserve your judgment for now, just sit back, and watch things unfold?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
028	What do you mean? Sit back and watch...what?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0016
029	Well... The fastest way to find out would probably be to just follow them.
030	Look! They're right over there! Oohh, you can practically taste love on the air! It's as sweet as honey! I wonder what those two lovebirds are up to on their date?	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
031	Tch. Why are we lurking in the bushes like petty thieves? This is pathetic.	VO_gino.gino_battle_0019
032	Don't be like that. You wanted to know, didn't you?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
033	No? I only tagged along because I wanted to see how weak he's gotten, so that I can stick it to him later!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0012
034	Um... No, thank you!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0012
035	C'mon, now. Today's White Day, isn't it? These cacao cookies are super tasty. Just try one, will yah?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0007
036	I told you, no!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0015
037	Are you rejecting my love?! Just take the damn cookies!
038	Enough!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0014
039	What the..? Who the hell do you think you are?!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
040	As a knight, I cannot allow you to harass this woman! You will address any further complaints you might have to me.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0010
041	If you want someone to eat these cookies so badly, then I will take them off your hands! Well?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
042	What?! No way! My love wasn't meant for you! Tch. You'll regret this, you fop!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0027
043	Wow! Fraise is so gallant! Surely you can't call him weak after witnessing that!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
044	Sure I can! He just let that scumbag go free! He should have beaten him to a pulp and left him unconscious on the side of the road!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0015
045	Tch... Watching him mess up like that really ticks me off.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
046	Aaaahhh!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0028
047	Oh, no! My apples! Would somebody please help me?
048	Of course, my lady. Is this all of them? This slope is rather steep, so take care.	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0003
049	Th-thank you so much, sir! All of my apples are accounted for!	VO_mob_female.mob_female_sys_0034
050	Did you see that?! Not only is Fraise kind, but he's got lightning-fast reflexes to boot! There's nothing weak about him at all.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0006
051	Pfft. None of that has anything to do with strength!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0013
052	White Day... Tch. What a bunch of baloney! I didn't even get anything on Valentines—why should I have to give out presents? Urgh... I wanna smash something!
053	Oho! Looks like we might finally get to see Fraise kick some butt!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0005
054	Now, now! No violence, please!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0014
055	Aghhh!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0019
056	Th-that was...brutal!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0027
057	Looks like your cousin is ever stronger than my brother, huh?	VO_gino.gino_sys_0027
058	Eve is wonderful, isn't she?! She's so strong, and bold!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
059	That's what makes the two of them such a perfect match! They're the ideal couple... Perfectly picturesque!
060	You really worship her, huh?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0007
061	Yep! I love her to pieces!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0004
062	...
063	By the way... I guess it's a little late to ask, but don't you have any plans for today, Moa? White Day only comes around once a year.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0003
064	Huh?
065	I mean, you're dressed up all nice and everything. Aren't you going to do anything special?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
066	Well... Today, I'm going to be watching over all the couples I see, making sure their love blossoms...and getting rid of anyone who tries to interfere in their affairs!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0023
067	Hee hee... That's why I'm wearing this outfit! It's perfect for tailing... I mean, for watching over people from the shadows! No cupid worth their wings would be caught dead in anything else!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0008
068	I...see. So you don't have any admirers? Anyone you're interested in? You're about that age, aren't you?	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0045
069	Um... Nope! Not really.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0007
070	Love is something that I live to see blossom in other people, and I will tend to their garden of hearts with everything I have!
071	You're a strange one.
072	So what?! My decisions don't concern you!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
073	Shh! Quiet!
074	Lady Eve... Is something the matter?
075	I thought I heard a voice... It was very familiar, but I suppose I must have just been hearing things. Hm...?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0030
076	Unngh...
077	Hey, there. What's the matter, sweetie? Why are you crying?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0002
078	Unnghh... Th-the b-boy I like...s-said that...White Day is stupid...a-and...that he d-doesn't want anything to do...with it.
079	B-but on Valentines Day, I was really brave... I g-gave him chocolates and confessed, and e-everything... But he never said a-anything to me... Unnghh...
080	What?! How rude! I'm going to go and give him a stern talking-to!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0012
081	She's the one in the wrong! You can't just thrust a gift on someone and expect something in return. And crying is the coward's way out.
082	What is wrong with you?!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0016
083	Both of you, keep it down!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0015
084	I see... So that's why you're crying, hm? Well... I'm sure that this boy you like is just shy.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0045
085	It was good of you to be so brave. And you know what? I'm sure that by doing so you, inspired some bravery in your crush, too.	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
086	Hm...?
087	What are you crying about? Jeez... I can't give you these cookies unless you're alone, y'know.
088	Well, what do you know? Looks like he had something for you all along!	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
089	Oh?
090	Look, I can understand feeling shy, but she overcame her embarrassment just for you.
091	...
092	So don't leave her hanging. You're better than that, aren't you?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0023
093	Y-yeah...
094	Oh, um...
095	I'm sorry about earlier. Here... This is for you.
096	Th-thanks!
097	That was rather sweet, wasn't it?	VO_eve.eve_sys_0007
098	It really was! I'm so glad!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
099	Way to go, Fraise!	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0006
100	Hmph. He's always been good at dealing with children.	VO_gino.gino_sys_0005
101	He's kind, and dependable... I'm pretty sure that every kid in the neighborhood saw him as a big brother figure.
102	That sounds about right.
103	But I'm not a child anymore, and I'm going to surpass him. I'm already stronger than that fool...	VO_gino.gino_sys_0022
104	...
105	Dammit all! At this rate, I'm never gonna get to prove how weak he's gotten!
106	If something big doesn't happen soon, White Day will be over before—!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0031
107	Watch out! There's a Ratty on the rampage!
108	Look what you did!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0014
109	Me?! I didn't do anything! It's just a coincidence!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0017
110	Wh-what on earth is that?! It's heading this way!	VO_eve.eve_sys_0026
111	Oh, no! Eve, look out!	VO_mor.mor_battle_0016
112	Nuuuuumaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
113	Nu, numa...
114	Eve! Are you hurt?	VO_frayze.frayze_battle_0017
115	I-I'm fine! Th-thank you, Lord Fraise...	VO_eve.eve_sys_0025
116	Thank the gods. Let's get going, shall we?	VO_frayze.frayze_sys_0007
117	Wow! That was so cool!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0009
118	Fraise is amazing! He pulled off the perfect romantic scene without a hitch! Ooh, I bet Eve's stomach was full of butterflies!
119	...
120	Hey, Gino! Were you watching that?! You can't deny how strong Fraise is now!	VO_mor.mor_sys_0006
121	You don't have to tell me that!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0013
122	But you keep calling him weak!
123	I know he's strong, all right?! I know that better than anyone!	VO_gino.gino_sys_0015
124	Why don't we all just take a deep breath and calm down a little.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0030
125	There are more important things for us to discuss... Like what the hell is the deal with all of these rampaging Rattys?
126	This is the second time we've come across them, so I'm not sure we can pass it off as just a random occurrence.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0031
127	Come to think of it... What happened to that guy running the sweetshop?
128	Eve was standing over there earlier, wasn't she? Right outside the storefront...	VO_mor.mor_sys_0031
129	Maybe we should check it out.
130	Welcome! Are you here to purchase some of my Purple Cacao cookies, too?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
131	One bite of this, and your sweetheart will swoon at your feet!
132	Purple Cacao? That doesn't sound good... I'd better ask Eve about this.	VO_mor.mor_sys_0020
133	You're not wrong. Stores using purple cacao have to give notice, and unless they're given permission to use the ingredient, they're meant to steer clear of it.	VO_kevin.kevin_sys_0010
134	Of course, those who have been given permission should have their license on display...
135	...
136	Oh, pipe down, will ya?! Cookies sell much faster when they've got the purple stuff in 'em!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
