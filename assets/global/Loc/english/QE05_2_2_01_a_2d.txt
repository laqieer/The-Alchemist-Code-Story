001	Hold the line! Protect the Paladins and the Sephira warriors!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0001
002	To attack from the front is to invite certain death! We must use our archers to get them where we want them!
003	General! The right flank is standing strong!
004	Good! Then we still—	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
005	What is that? The tree in the middle of the village has lit up?	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0027
006	Uh-oh.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_1047
007	Hisham? What're you looking at? We don't want to hold the Liberation Army up after they came all this way to rescue us.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0003
008	S-sorry, it's just... Look!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0043
009	Oh, I've never seen Sephiron glow so brightly.	VO_mob-saga_ymale.mob-saga_ymale_sys_0025
010	How strange. It's somehow different from usual. That strong, bright light somehow makes me uneasy.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0022
011	I hope that Kamui and Miss Malta are okay...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0020
012	Oh, Sephiron, that which has fallen to the darkness, the time has come for me to pass judgment upon you.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0032
013	That is my last duty to you, as your Protector.
014	What?! My strength, it's fading! Waginau, you interloper!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_sys_0043
015	Urk...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0019
016	Ha... I should have expected this resistance.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
017	Lord Waginau!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
018	Kamui, it is not over yet. If we do not break that false stone, he will regain his strength.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0018
019	Wha—?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
020	Interlopers! Pathetic cretins! Do you think one such as I would fall before such low-born pests?!	VO_seclidis.seclidis_battle_0019
021	I will not let you do as you will!	VO_ishido.ishido_battle_0001
022	Huzzah!!!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0032
