001	Th-thank you.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0033
002	No need to thank me. On reflection, as guardian of this forest, it was my responsibility to take care of that kerfuffle.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0010
003	That being said, I can't believe you would step into this ancient forest without the means to protect yourself.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0030
004	Perhaps you're not as big of a fool as I thought.
005	Um, well, usually I would try a little harder, but...ouch!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
006	Are you hurt?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
007	Ah, well, sorry...	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
008	Why do you apologize? Follow me.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0016
009	Huh?
010	I told you that it was my responsibility, didn't I? I'll at least look after your wound.
011	Oh...
012	Wow...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0009
013	Don't stare at everything so much.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0047
014	So-sorry. There's just a lot of rare equipment.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0035
015	It's the shaman's job to brew herbs. There's nothing special about it.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
016	Here. Show me your wound.
017	Um, okay...but it's just a scratch.
018	Wild beasts have poison in one shape or another. It can sometimes be fatal to those who are weak, you know?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
019	Ack...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0018
020	Honestly. All this commotion they're causing is nasty business.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0030
021	Are you talking about those monsters?
022	Not only are they laying waste to this forest, but those fools are also becoming more aggressive.
023	Laying waste? To this forest? Why?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0012
024	... ...
025	Have you heard of a place called the Ancient Dragon Bones?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0001
026	Those steep mountain ranges that run between Saga and Gluttony Foss.
027	Much lore and legends remain in Saga, but that land has an exceptionally exaggerated origin in comparison to the others.
028	It is said, in ancient times, that mountain was a savage dragon that strode the earth.
029	However, with its gigantic form, there was no way it could survive by any normal means.
030	Thus, the son of men thought to themselves...
031	The heart of the dragon must be a lump of Alchemia comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.
032	Is that really true?
033	It's just a legend. However, there are those foolish enough to believe it.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0010
034	And by those, I'm referring to Gluttony Foss.
035	Perhaps something had occurred to the Sacred Stone, or perhaps they were driven by obsession.
036	In any case, they descended into thieves who lay waste to the forest of Saga.
037	But why the forest? This place is far from that mountain range.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0016
038	The reason they come to this forest is to gain the ability to hear the spirits.
039	The spirits are the Alchemy that nature wields. They are the phantoms summoned by the land itself.
040	Their belief was that if you could hear that voice,
041	you could hear the voice of the dragon's heart as well.
042	So Gluttony Foss is after advanced Alchemia sensing capabilities?
043	It's a silly story. Legends are, after all, just legends.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0005
044	They are quite the dreamers to hitch their wagon to such a non-existent star.
045	Well, your treatment has finished.
046	Um. I still can't go home yet.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
047	I understand. You want to discover a way to regain your power, correct?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
048	D-do you know how?!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
049	Of course, I don't. Why would I be responsible for solving your problems?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0012
050	But well...if you have the qualities of a shaman, there are things you will begin to see.
051	Are you talking about...?
052	Within the oral traditions of Saga, occasionally a story emerges about an exceptionally talented individual who can create beasts.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0006
053	These beasts are projections of their past. Mysteries harbored within the memories of an individual whose unreachable nostalgia is seared into their bodies.
054	Nostalgia?
055	The Alchemia that this individual is said to possess mediates a memory's likeness and is projected onto this world.
056	The way of existence for a shaman of Saga is to walk with the forest, to serve the forest.
057	That is why a shaman of Saga will sometimes 'call the forest.'
058	Doesn't this forest feel nostalgic to you?
059	Um...yes. For some reason, I feel calm here.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0004
060	That feeling is most likely your source.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0006
061	Your defense against conflict from the outside world and your craving for a distant home.
062	These have been made obvious through your Alchemia.
063	These are my animals? But then why do they no longer appear?
064	People are creatures who easily forget.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
065	Even the most passionate emotion, the most built up dream crumbles under the passing of days and is forgotten.
066	By doing so, it leads to everyday life. That must be the wisdom of people.
067	But I didn't feel at home at the court.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
068	Still, if you have accepted that location as your place of living it lead to oblivion.
069	Perhaps you had entertained the idea
070	that you were an individual from Lustburg.
071	...!
072	You must accept yourself without any beasts. Eventually, you will get used to it...to being alone.
073	That's impossible! I can't do that. I can't forget them! I have to see them again!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0019
074	What should I do?! How can I hear the voices of the animals again?!
075	What a strong...or should I say sweet emotion.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
076	What is forgotten can never return. However, if that bond remains within you...
077	Live with the forest, child of Saga. If you can recall why you summoned the beasts, the spirits will respond.
078	This is assuming the so-called beasts that you summoned were true spirits.
079	Live in the forest...
080	That being said, right now you are so weak that a single monster can wound you.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0030
081	Well, as a compromise you could live in the village near the forest—
082	Live here, bloodline of Saga.
083	Huh?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
084	What?! You show up all of a sudden and say something like that?!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0027
085	It gratifies me to increase those who can hear my voice.
086	B-but I can't allow an outsider to live here in this forest.	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0024
087	You were the one who said he should live in a forest. Take responsibility for your words, shaman.
088	Ack...	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0022
089	Umm. In other words?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0011
090	One month! I will forgive your sojourn into this forest for just one month. After that, you're on your own!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0016
091	Um. What's this?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0002
092	What are you hesitating for? It's preparation for dinner of course.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
093	Bu, umm, is this fish? I've never touched one before.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0011
094	Ah, so you're a vegetarian.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0009
095	Not really. Um, in Lustburg there are a lot of stores, so I usually ate there...	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0019
096	That's not my concern! There's an old saying: when in Saga, do as those of Saga do. It's the way of the forest for one to prepare one's meal!	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0024
097	It's easy for you to say, but...eh...it's bleeding!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0018
098	You fool. Don't hold a blade with your eyes closed!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0027
099	I-I finished...fetching water.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0026
100	Well done. Or so I'd like to say, but...	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
101	Why did it take until noon to finish!	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0021
102	Be-because usually the animals always helped me.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
103	How cozy of a life were you living until now	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
104	Umf...
105	Wait. What are you doing?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
106	What do you mean? I'm trying to start the fire.
107	Don't rely on magic for something like that!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0012
108	For starters, using that kind of Alchemia in a place with such a high concentration of Alchemia will—	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0030
109	Whoa! The flame is huge!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0026
110	Control the force of your art! And you call yourself a Court Mage or whatever?!	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0024
111	I'm tired. Really tired.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0029
112	I-I'm sorry.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0036
113	Never mind. I'll congratulate you on your effort. You familiarized yourself well with this forest.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0022
114	You have already been recognized as a shaman of this forest.
115	How is it? Has that beast spoken to you again?
116	No, not yet. I call out to it, but it doesn't respond.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
117	I see.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0031
118	Then the connection must already be severed. Spirits bonded only through human thoughts tend to usually be unstable.
119	Very well. There's no turning back now. You can stay as long as you need to until you accomplish your goal.
120	What? Really?	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
121	Don't question my answer! If I said it's fine, then it's fine!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0016
122	... ...
123	Why did you suddenly go quiet?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
124	I was just thinking about how kind you are, Peridot. At first, I felt scared because the way you spoke was really stern, but...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0049
125	Oh? Are you trying to pick a fight?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0044
126	N-no...um, that's not what I meant.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0039
127	I wanted to say thank you for looking after a stranger like me.
128	It would've been horrible to throw you out in the state that you were in and have you die outside. I'd have to carry that on my conscience.
129	Yes. Thank you.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0033
130	We-well then, you still haven't fetched the water for today! Do you want to cause me more trouble?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0003
131	Oh, right! I'll go now!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0005
132	... ...
133	Your snickering is getting annoying.	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0016
134	Good encounters produce good results.
135	What good results? Ever since he came, my life has been turned upside down.	VO_peridot.peridot_battle_0021
136	People are not the same as plants. Just like the shamans of the past, you are a child of man.
137	... ...
138	The shaman protects us spirits, but that is it. They cannot live together with us.
139	Live together? What are you talking about?	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0010
140	He does not have much longer. As a spirit, I am sure you are aware of this.
141	On his back, I saw...the shadow of death. Most likely, some disaster will befall him soon.
142	Court Mage Flamel, huh? You're shouldering quite the difficult fate. Maybe...
143	He may be happier taking root in this forest that is disconnected from the outside world.
144	I know it sounds out of character.
145	I said stop laughing like that!	VO_peridot.peridot_sys_0027
146	All right, this is the last one! I think I've gotten somewhat accustomed to this life.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0032
147	I wonder why the animals don't respond to me.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0029
148	I don't need their strength. I don't need them to do anything. I just want them to be there for me.
149	Yikes. If I have a gloomy expression on my face, Peridot will scold me again.
150	Hm? Is someone there?
151	... ...
152	That's not an animal from this forest. Right, that's...	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
153	Agh! My head...	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0023
154	No! Nooo! I don't want to leave this forest!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0019
155	Give it up, Flamel. This place is no longer habitable for people.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0039
156	Can you hear it? Can you hear the forest scream?
157	This forest will no longer accept people—accept those who are alive.
158	But everyone I know is here! I'll be...all alone.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0022
159	Awooo!	VO_Mwolf.Mwolf_battle_0028_a
160	A wolf? A wolf!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0021
161	No, Flamel!	VO_stknightf.stknightf_battle_0019
162	But...!	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
163	The animals of this forest have been polluted by the Alchemia coming from those ruins.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0015
164	They will eventually transform into monsters.
165	No...that's terrible.	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0021
166	You cannot change what has already happened. That's why you must remember them...how gentle they were and how beautiful this forest was.	VO_stknightf.stknightf_sys_0016
167	After all, you are the last shaman of this forest.
168	That's right, I... Those animals... How could've I forgotten something so important?	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
169	... ...
170	Wolf? Is there something over there?
171	We've completed our search. There are no traces of anyone living nearby.
172	I see. We're deep into the forest, yet I still do not see anything.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0016
173	Is this alleged shaman really here?
174	Yes, Captain, according to the information we obtained from the neighboring village.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0032
175	Is there any possibility that this shaman who can hear spirits has become aware of our presence?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
176	There hasn't been a sound since stepping into this forest. At the very least, I doubt our exact location is known.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0017
177	Are they from Gluttony Foss? A shaman who can hear spirits. Are they talking about...?!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0025
178	That being said, it's a hassle to bring the shaman back alive. At least maybe we can cut off an arm or a leg—	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
179	...!
180	Who's there?!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0020
181	They've noticed me! I can't go back to Peridot's place.	VO_flamel.flamel_battle_0020
182	I will stop them here!	VO_flamel.flamel_sys_0032
