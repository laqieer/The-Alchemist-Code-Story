001	Is this…a tunnel?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0016
002	Yes. Part of the recent development of a red light district in Redington.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
003	Before that, the city was just a standard mining town.
004	Mining?
005	What? What's this light…?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_battle_0019
006	It's…
007	This light is what powers Redington.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
008	Massive Magil crystals that exist in the underground areas of the Sloth Layer.
009	…
010	Amazing, isn't it?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
011	The people were surrounded by Magil. The crystals are used for dragon technology..
012	From Aedith's point of view, your proposal must have been something she really wanted.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
013	…
014	Schmeier?
015	Abandoned by the dragons… Seems to be so… And here lie the remains…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0045
016	What are you talking about?
017	This is a burial ground for dragons.
018	Dragons? What do you mean?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0025
019	For us dragons, we need Magil to survive.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
020	The destruction of the body for us is basically a notion that the time of change has come.
021	Even dragons will one day die, whether after living a long time or giving their life in battle.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
022	A long time ago, this planet had land where we would forever sleep after death. The final resting place was the burial ground.
023	This is the place? So all these Magil crystals are…	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
024	Fossils of dead dragons. With all this power…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0044
025	So Redington's power is derived from burning the fossils of the dead dragons.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
026	There must have been some who resented that. And there was feeling of abandonment. I see… What about you?
027	Me? It's not my concern.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
028	The world revolves in cycles. Death is a resource for life, and that's how the world turns.
029	Right now, it's the dragon's turn.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0006
030	I'm sure Aedith will shed some tears by hearing that story.
031	Really? Well, I'd still like to work together with him someday…	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0008
032	With all these resources, there are many things that can be realized…
033	Wait… What's with this Magil…?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0042
034	Grrroooaaarrr!
035	A beast like before? I get it now. The beasts have gone berserk because of the Magil…!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0039
036	A bit of a long story…
037	Grrrroooaaaarrrr…
038	It's basically like a ghost... Seeing a ghost in a graveyard is quite fitting.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
039	Don't let them attack you! Maybe the beasts will…
040	What a troublesome situation... Fine, let's do this!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
