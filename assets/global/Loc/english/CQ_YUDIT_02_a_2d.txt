001	I...lost.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
002	I mean...I didn't think I'd win easily, going up against the Ultimate Blacksmith and the weapons you created, but I didn't think it'd be so one-sided, either.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0030
003	I'd say it's half-baked, and that's me being generous.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
004	Huh?
005	The weapon performs well, sure. But I couldn't feel your conviction as its creator through it. That's severely limiting its potential.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
006	Aw... Really?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0020
007	But I don't get it! My heart's in this, one hundred percent! My goal is to make a weapon that can protect people.
008	I'm serious about this. Really.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
009	Let me ask you something.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
010	Is that truly what you wish to create? A weapon to protect others?
011	Huh? Wh-what do you mean? Of course I—	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
012	Lord Eizan! My apologies for the interruption, but—
013	Oh...it's you. What is it this time? I'm a bit busy at the moment.	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
014	I do apologize, my lord, but this is an urgent matter.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0003
015	I assume you're here to demand that I make weapons for your master's troops again?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0016
016	My answer hasn't changed. Like I said before, I have no interest in mass-producing weapons.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
017	You are being offered this commission out of respect for your reputation as the Ultimate Blacksmith. We are prepared to pay handsomely—even more than you were previously promised!
018	We are even prepared to provide the rare ores you've been seeking as part of the reward!
019	Would that not help speed your forging enterprise along?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0010
020	Hmm...
021	That's quite a reward you're offering. I'm sure you think it's very tempting, but...	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
022	I refuse. And my response isn't going to change, no matter what you offer me.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0040
023	B-but why?! What if we were to double—no, triple your payment?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
024	Money is not the issue here.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
025	Reproducing the same weapon over and over is just not something I'm prepared to do. It goes against everything I stand for.
026	So, there's your answer. Now leave. Go tell your master that these trips are nothing but a waste of time.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0003
027	Hmph! Very well, then. I bid you good day, sir.	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
028	Are you sure that was a good idea?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
029	Why? Are you here to try to get me to mass-produce something as well?	VO_eizan.eizan_chara_2006
030	No! Of course not. But...
031	Wouldn't those rare materials be invaluable to your forge? Can you really afford to say no to that?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
032	Besides, they seem to really value your skills.
033	I understand your point.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
034	However, I did not become a blacksmith to make money.
035	And I have no intention of doing a job I don't agree with for the sake of material gain.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0017
036	Huh... Okay, so why did you become a blacksmith, then?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0004
037	You need a reason?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0031
038	The same one that keeps me kicking, girl. I strive to forge the Ultimate Blade. Nothing more.
039	That's it?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0021
040	But you've earned yourself a reputation as the Ultimate Blacksmith! There are tons of people who are desperate to seek out your work!
041	True. Many call on me in the hope of employing my skills, and I am always happy to oblige if it's a job I can agree to.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0005
042	But my reputation is simply a byproduct of doing what I live for, and I have no love for it.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0030
043	That so-called title I've earned doesn't get to change my purpose. It does not define me.
044	I continue to swing my hammer for the sole purpose of someday forging the Ultimate Blade.
045	Personally, I believe that's what it means to dedicate yourself to a craft.	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0010
046	What about you, Judith? What do you believe in?	VO_eizan.eizan_sys_0001
047	Me?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
048	I...
049	Before I answer that...would it be all right if I requested another sparring session?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
050	Oh?
051	I think... I think I can show you what I'm all about, now.
