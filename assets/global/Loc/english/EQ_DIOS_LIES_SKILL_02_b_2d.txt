001	Have you had enough yet, Lisbeth?!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0010
002	Why...isn't this...having any...effect?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
003	Think about it. Do you really think you could damage an illusion? Your attacks are futile, so long as her real body remains untouched.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0013
004	Lisbeth, I'll keep her busy! You do something about the weeds!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0042
005	What?! They're all over the place! Do you expect me to yank them out one by one?! We'll be here all day!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
006	There's got to be another way...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0039
007	Muahahaha! I shall bury your bones where you stand!	VO_venus.venus_sys_0023
008	Tch...	VO_dios.dios_battle_0023
009	Dias!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
010	Lisbeth, have you been fighting monstrosities like this during the sky skirmish all this time? That's amazing...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0019
011	What?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0047
012	Now's not the time!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
013	I need to concentrate, but my heart won't stop racing and my head's murkier than a swamp! I can't come up with anything that might work!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_2007
014	I must cool my head and think this through... Cool...my head?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
015	That's it!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
016	Dias, I'm going to cast a spell and freeze this entire area!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
017	Wait, all of it?!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0025
018	Once I'm done, "Her Highness" will finally show us her real body. Then you—	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
019	I strike it with all I've got! Sounds like a plan. You're a brilliant witch, Lisbeth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0044
020	Hehehe.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0007
021	The secret to keeping our attacks in sync is to match each other's breathing. Let's do this, Lisbeth!	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
022	Okay, I'm all set! Hyaaaahhh!!!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
