001	Ack... My head hurts...I really did drink too much yesterday...	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0029
002	I remember up to the point where we beat up those thugs, but...	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0030
003	Well, it looks like changed my clothes properly at the inn before I went to bed, so today I'll focus on fixing my hangover...
004	Eheheh. There's nothing better for curing a hangover than sweets! I just found out about that new shop, so I'll go there now!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0008
005	Oh, there it is! Excuse me, would you have a seat for one...
006	Welcome. It's a little crowded, but if you don't mind sharing a seat outside.
007	Not at all. As long as I can eat the sweets.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0037
008	Well then, this way.
009	Heheh. I'm really looking forward to it. Seriously, if only I didn't have a headache.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
010	That's why I told you to go easy on the drinks.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
011	Y-you...!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0026
012	The sweets here are famous so don't just stand there. Come sit down.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
013	Oh, they really are good.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0009
014	Who would've thought they we'd be sharing seats. Um, Reimei, wasn't it?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0011
015	I'm honored to have my name remembered a master artist of the Pipa.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0023
016	...! You know about me?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0025
017	Yes. You're the Fayrene the Pipa player. Your name is famous in Wadatsumi.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
018	Oh, is that so?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0045
019	Last night, I went to verify who you were in person.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
020	Is that true?	VO_feirin.feirin_chara_1009
021	... ...
022	Heheh. No, I'm joking.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
023	(He's...lying. Perhaps he knows my other face...)
024	Oh! Reimei...!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0027
025	Is something the matter?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
026	A-ahaha. Nothing. Just a little misunderstanding.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0011
027	(Wait, hold on! Is Reimei that assassin who will take out anyone for the right amount...?!)	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0021
028	(Maybe he was the one who killed that man yesterday...and now he's trying to erase me too...?)
029	Hm?	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0006
030	Ahaha. The way you eat the sweets makes it look extra delicious.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0007
031	This is my favorite. I'm sorry if I look a little silly.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0016
032	Haha. No, it's kind of a cute look.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0008
033	Ack...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0020
034	(No. The atmosphere about him. If he was truly here to finish me off...he wouldn't be speaking to me like this.)	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0031
035	I'm sorry about last night. Wait, maybe it's the other way around...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
036	Huh? What do you mean?	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0001
037	After we beat those men up, you collapsed from being drunk and I had to take you back to your lodging.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0004
038	H-huh?! Oh dear...then, you were the one who changed my outfit?!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0025
039	... ...
040	Hey, what's that silence supposed to mean?!	VO_feirin.feirin_battle_0022
041	Calm down. You're spilling your food.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0001
042	Ack...	VO_feirin.feirin_battle_0019
043	I don't know which one is your true nature, but it's best you don't ruin your persona as a virtuoso of the Pipa.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0030
044	Ahahaha... You say strange things, Reimei.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0011
045	Heh. Right back at you...	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0007
046	Well then, now that we've finished eating our sweets, I'll be going now.
047	Oh, ow unfortunate. Just when the conversation was getting started.	VO_feirin.feirin_chara_1009
048	It might be fun for us to talk again over drinks.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0038
049	That being said, don't get too drunk at work and mess up your performance.	VO_reimay.reimay_sys_0010
050	Hey...I don't drink while I work!	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0029
051	Just because he's a little handsome, he's way too overconfident. Don't mess up from getting too drunk at work? Hah! The nerve of him!	VO_feirin.feirin_battle_0022
052	For starters, I've never messed up during a performance. And I never ever drink during work!
053	My work...is my work.	VO_feirin.feirin_sys_0030
054	Work...I need to go now.
