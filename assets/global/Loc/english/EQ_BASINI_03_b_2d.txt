001	The 'Infinite Serpent'...
002	(This new tipoff doesn't match anything in Lord Zain's notes. Which means, in all likelihood...)
003	I've stumbled into a trap.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
004	This will be enough of a pretext for Corpse. Irene will come to eliminate me...
005	And the Holy Order—and Waginau—will claim the blade Commander Kanon entrusted me with: Excalibur.
006	Orion led the Lion Monarch's Charge, but Waginau was the one pulling the strings.
007	He planned to use Orion as a vessel to resurrect Nimul, but he failed.
008	That must be it, then. It isn't my life that Waginau wants.
009	It's Excalibur.
010	He still hasn't given up on resurrecting Nimul.
011	And now, the Holy Guard is too weak to defend Excalibur...and so am I.
021	...
022	The future has been left in our hands. We have to prove that we can handle that responsibility.
023	I'm gonna be the one who protects the peace of Babel, and don't you forget it!	VO_victor.victor_sys_0016
024	It's our duty to build the peaceful future our captains hoped for!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
025	Don't worry. We will tend to the flames you've lit within us.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0011
026	(I have to fulfill my oath.)
027	I have to honor their trust.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
028	But how?
029	Pain, sorrow, hesitation, doubt... They mean nothing before the absolution of order.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0005
030	...
031	Perhaps you were right, Irene.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
048	I've felt the warmth of sunlight and the bonds of friendship.
032	I've learned to hold those things dear.
033	I've been entrusted with that same resolve you're so convinced will bring chaos, and I care about it more than anything else.
035	I've chosen my path. I don't have any need for doubts.
040	Ngh!
041	Disappointing. I didn't take you for a deserter.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0016
042	...
043	I can't say I blame you for running away, given the circumstances...	VO_irene.irene_sys_0030
044	But as Lord Commander, you couldn't have made a more foolish choice.
045	In the name of preserving the balance of this world...
046	I, Irene of Corpse, sentence you to die.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003
047	...
