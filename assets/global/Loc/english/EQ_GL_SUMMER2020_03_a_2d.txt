001	Hmm, what dish could we prepare... what would appeal to the beachgoers...
002	... Shi... Shio... wait...
003	Ah, my apologies Eira, I was lost in thought for a moment.
004	I suppose this would be a good spot to pause and formulate a plan.
005	...
006	...
007	Are you perhaps uncomfortable with my company?
008	ah... no...
009	I see, you're not very accustomed to dealing with strangers are you?
010	You seem quite attached to Lady Morrigan,it was selfish of me to separate you from them, I sincerely apologize.
011	I thought it would be an interesting experience for us both, but I shouldn't have imposed on you because of it.
012	You should return to your friends. I'm sure they could use your help in the challenge as well.
013	...
014	Eira... stay.
015	Are you sure? You don't have to help just for my sake.
016	Stay! ... Eira... help!
017	That's sweet of you. Thank you for taking on this challenge with me.
018	Although, I regret to say I am stumped as to what we should do. There aren't many options in terms of ingredients out here...
019	... Eira... snow!
020	Snow?
021	Snow!
022	...eyy!
023	That was... impressive, Eira! That's something new even to me.
024	... nothing... special
025	You have an amazing gift Eira, and I think you just might be the key to this competition!
026	This snow is simply irresistible in this summer heat... perhaps, combined with some fresh fruit...
027	Thats it! If we gather some fruits, we could make a delectable tropical shaved ice!
028	Fruit... in forest!
029	However, the local fauna is known to be aggressive, are you prepared for a little action?
030	Eira... ready!
031	Very well, then let us proceed!
