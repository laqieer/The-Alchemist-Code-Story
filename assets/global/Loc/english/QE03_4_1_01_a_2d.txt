001	A-are you the guy who came here from Slothstein?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
002	Huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
003	A...a woman?! I-I'm innocent! At least give me some clothes...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0042
004	Umm...why did you get captured?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
005	I just came here because I was encouraged to! When I tried to enter the country, a flying witch caught me and...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0018
006	That must have been the court mage's air defense. But you're a foreigner, right? How could you fly without using magic?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0002
007	That's because I was riding my buddy...oh, wait!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0005
008	My buddy...the witches seized him and placed him somewhere! They better not have broken him?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0020
009	What do you mean by "riding" and "broken"? Was your buddy a vehicle?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0031
010	Hm? Yeah, he's a bit rough around the edges, but perfect for riding at incredible speeds!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
011	So, you're the person who came from Slothstein?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0001
012	Slothstein, huh?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
013	I'm a man who goes wherever life takes him. My name is Edgar L. Leonhart. Where I'm from and where I'm headed, I—	VO_edgar.edgar_chara_1024
014	Excuse me! There's something I want you to tell me!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0048
015	... ...
016	You want to go above the clouds?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
017	I heard there were flying ships in Slothstein.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0006
018	We can fly as well, but...we don't have enough power to go above the clouds.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
019	We thought you might know of some way to do it, Edgar.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1024
020	Flying above the clouds is no easy task.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0030
021	But you entered this country from the sky, right?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0016
022	I had to. The border checkpoints on the road were strict. That's why I had to go out of my way to jump off a cliff.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0013
023	First of all, why were you trying so hard to enter this country?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0031
024	I told you, didn't I? I was encouraged to come here.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0012
025	When you say encouraged, does it have something to do with this?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0001
026	Why do you have that? That witch took that stone away from me. You...totally don't look like that witch.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
027	I just took it from her, that's all. It seems she wasn't lying when she said its life had been exhausted.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0007
028	Now that I've confirmed that, this stone is useless to me. But...	VO_dios.dios_sys_0030
029	Didn't you come to Lustburg in order to revive this stone?
030	... ...
031	Revive the stone? What do you mean, Dias?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0027
032	No way...that stone?!	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0027
033	Huh...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
034	So, it wasn't just any stone after all. That's the Sacred Stone, isn't it, Dias?	VO_alma.alma_sys_0029
035	Whaaat?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
036	It's true that this stone may have once been Belphegor. However, now it's just a rock.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0037
037	That being said, with this country's secret art it could possibly be resurrected. That's why the man must have come here.
038	This country's...secret art?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0025
039	This isn't the time to be standing around talking. We've got guests.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0017
040	Whoa! They're even bigger than before!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_1017
041	If you beat up that many Familiars, of course, they're gonna come at us with everything they've got!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
042	We don't have time for this. I'm gonna quickly take these out. Stand back.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0010
