001	- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -
002	She's still unconscious, huh...
003	I'll leave her in your capable hands, then. Thank you.
004	The Goetia doctor bows and exits, leaving Emrys alone with his thoughts.
005	(To think I'd be reunited with Eira like this...)
006	(What was she doing in that mansion?)
007	A small sound coming from the throne room prompts Emrys to flatten himself against the wall and listen in silence.
008	(A guest? At this hour?)
009	Report.
010	They come for our prize, my Queen.
011	I daresay they will have found...alternative entrances into our abode.
012	As rats do, I suppose.
013	I expected the Holy Guard, but the meddlesome courtesan as well?
014	She must be taught her place.
015	Gladly, my Queen...
016	They won't want to leave after what I'm about to do to them.
017	(Pursuers, hmm?)
018	(Guess I should look into it myself.)
019	- Underground Sewers -
020	Ugh, I definitely don't miss this.
021	Far better than being welcomed with steel and lead, at any rate.
022	Meep.
023	Haaah...
024	Wait. Did you hear that?
025	A shuffling sound issues forth from around the corner.
026	*sniff sniff* Meep!
027	Stop pacing, Roxanne. You're giving me a headache.
028	Ugh!
029	I'm...I'm sorry. I just can't sit still knowing they've got Soren AND Eira...
030	And we've got no way of contacting the outside world—
031	Meep! Meep!
032	Chip!?
033	Wait, how did you—
034	Little guy's got an uncanny ability to slip past almost everything.
035	You've seen better days, Rox.
036	No thanks to you! Where in Babel have you been!?
037	With Shion, no less!
038	Shhh!
039	Shion removes a hairpin and smiles wryly, gesturing to the lock.
040	You can ramble to your heart's content when you leave this sorry cell behind, Miss Roxanne.
041	Assuming you can make it out quietly, that is.
042	Shion, I'll keep him occupied.
043	(It's that man I passed on the street some days ago... The one who looks similar to...)
044	Hold your hostilities. I mean you no harm...for now.
045	My name is Emrys. I only want to know why my sister was at your mansion.
046	You're Eira's blood-brother?
047	The resemblance is quite uncanny...
048	How do we trust you won't bring the whole base down on our heads?
049	Considering I caught you in the act of jailbreaking, it would have been an easy matter to call the guards instead.
050	Please, I need to know.
051	If Eira can fight for you so fiercely, you must be important to her.
052	So that's what the explosion was. Eira was defending Soren!
053	Why would she do that?
054	We met her at Tröstendorf, a village north of Lustberg. She was living out in the forest, relying on scraps to survive.
055	Soren helped get her Alchemy under control. She thinks of him as a brother, too.
056	She came all this way to visit him, and the rest, you know.
057	I see...
058	(...)
059	We can speak later, in less hostile environments.
060	I don't know where Soren was taken, but this base isn't that big.
061	I'll create a diversion and buy you as much time as possible.
062	Wait. I'll go with you. Make it seem like you caught me skulking around.
063	The rest of you go on ahead and find Soren.
064	All right. Give me a good show, then.
065	Don't get yourself killed, dummy.
066	Hah! If only I had a zeni for every time you said that.
067	End of the line, fool!
068	You won't get out alive!
069	Bah! Your security is garbage!
070	Well, well, look who it is.
071	Hello again, Prince Charming. And there's the handsome fox who's been in our employ...
072	...Madam Eliza. I have everything under control—
073	Count me surprised, Emrys. You act about as well as you lie.
074	And I was just thinking of sharing a secret with you. About your sister's disappearance.
075	...!
076	Seeing as you're so ungrateful as to consort with rats, however, I'm afraid our little partnership is off.
077	Nesha, if you would be so kind.
078	Oh, how I LOVE naughty little sinners.
