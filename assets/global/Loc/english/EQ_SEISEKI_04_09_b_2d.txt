001	We've cleaned it all up. So, what is this super-duper invention of yours, Captain Othima?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
002	Well~	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0010
003	It's...a...secret.
004	Uck! I know for a fact that I can't stand this guy.
005	Ahh. I can't stand to watch my teacher get pushed around so much! This Othima is no ordinary person.	VO_almira.almira_sys_0022
006	Shut up, Almira!
007	Enough. This way of talking is inefficient. Step back to minimum distance.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
008	So I have a suggestion. How about we take that mountain route instead of this laid-back trail?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
009	Huh?! Why would purposely take a long way around? This road is the fastest most efficient route.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0016
010	Yeah, but...I'm getting kind of bored of this road.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0029
011	The route over there has ruined and a nice scenery... Don't you think it'll help raise our energy levels?
012	Don't be idiotic! We can't afford to delay it any further!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0015
013	You're such a square, Seida.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
014	No, to be honest, there's something really wrong about this route. Yes. This route is definitely dangerous.
015	Captain Othima, why did you join the Holy Guard?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0012
016	...What?
017	You said you don't like moving in groups, right?
018	Yeah. I hate it.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
019	I'm gonna be frank with you...you're bothersome! Can you please stop relying my knights up any further!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
020	Whoa...you really are direct.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0019
021	If you want to climb a mountain then please do so on your own. We're going to take the shortest route.
022	Hey, hold on...that way really is dangerous.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_0002
023	I can read the presence of monsters through the wind! Right now there's nothing!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0012
024	My teacher's wind-reading abilities are spot on! She can read the enemy's position and the ally's position on point as well!
025	Hmm. But I'm the Captain so I don't want to put my Paladins in harm's way. I'm sorry, but I can't back down in regards to this.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
026	Are you saying that you don't trust my teacher's wind-reading abilities?!
027	It's not that, but...try shooting around there for example.
028	Why would I shoot where there's nothing?	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
029	Hmph. Fine. If this will convince you. Guardian's Arrow!	VO_caida.caida_battle_0001
030	... ...
031	All clear, teacher!	VO_almira.almira_sys_0045
032	Yes. Everything is as planned. Honestly, it's so inefficient. Anyway, I guess this is a blessing in disguise...	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
033	...?!
034	Gyaaaahhh!!!
035	Eeek...! What's up with these guys?!	VO_almira.almira_battle_0027
036	I told you, didn't I? I told you I had a bad feeling about this. You can't use the wind to read what's going on underground.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0007
037	...!
038	Most likely, it'll be the same up ahead.
039	Hey? If we do this well, we may be able to take a shortcut. Let's take the mountain route, Seida.
040	O-okay...
