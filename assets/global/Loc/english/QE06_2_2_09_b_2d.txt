001	…Kaede is with a human?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
002	It's just a rumor…but there may be some truth to it, given recent events.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
003	…!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
004	Where are you going?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
005	I'm bringing Kaede back. There must be some mistake…She'd never be with a human. She might be in a weakened state or in trouble.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
006	…
007	What?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
008	Nothing…you may be right.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
009	...?! Why is that...?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0026
010	We could use this opportunity to glean information from the humans. The important thing is that the demons win in the end.
011	And you want to use Kaede for that?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0002
012	Often the opening moves determine the match.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
013	...!
014	Even we demons are exhausted from the human onslaught. Some are beginning to doubt whether or not we can survive.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
015	We won't allow them to win!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
016	Of course, I feel the same as you do. However...the arts of Phoenix Brigade…and the Kagutsuchi pose a serious threat.
017	That damned art…someday I will destroy it.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0016
018	When? Today? Or tomorrow?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
019	…Well--
020	We have to admit it. They've driven us into a corner.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
021	Tch...!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
022	In fact, some people are happy that Kaede is fraternizing with humans… They think it will lead to peace.
023	Peace?! Have they forgotten what the humans did to us...?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
024	They toyed with our lives time and time again...?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
025	Where was this rage before--when we needed it?	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
026	I've always had it!.. I swear I will destroy the entire human race!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
027	Nothing changes with words alone. The sacrifices we've made thus far are due to your own incompetence.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
028	…!
029	Until you admit your weakness, there will be no path forward.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
030	…!
031	Only the strong survive... If you want the world to kneel before you, you must wield that power.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
032	…
033	If you hesitate to show your strength, it may be too late.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
034	What…?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0006
035	…………
036	…!
037	I haven't been able to devour humans of late… This is the harm it has wrought.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
038	…The wound you received from Kagutsuchi still hasn't healed…?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
039	Human eyes are watching us wherever we go. In order to devour people, we need to address this issue.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
040	So, it may be a good thing that Kaede is visiting with humans…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0001
041	Don't tell me--	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0003
042	Are you suggesting we surrender to the humans?
043	No, not in the least. But...I think it might be better to proceed without fighting.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
044	If we don't fight…how can we destroy them?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0012
045	I'm simply suggesting we avoid fighting in a weakened state. We cannot afford any more losses on our side…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
046	If we are wiped out before we can eradicate the humans and build a kingdom of demons, all will be for naught.
047	…
048	…In any case, I want to see how this situation with Kaede develops.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
049	...I pray it's not too late.
050	..! What the hell have I been doing…	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
051	…Endangering Kaede… Overlooking the wounds of the Discarnate Power…
052	I know what I have to do.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
053	Now then…	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0002
054	Let us see which way the wind blows… I’m interested to find out.
