002	I never imagined you would choose to run.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0016
003	To abandon the Holy Guard is to abandon your role as the absolute justice of Babel.	VO_irene.irene_sys_0003

006	I trust you are prepared for the consequences?	VO_irene.irene_sys_0001
007	I sense a new clarity of resolve in you. Is that what drove you to run?
029	I don't expect you to understand. Nor anyone else, even my comrades in arms.	VO_basini.basini_chara_1008
032	But I'll endure any disgrace to protect Excalibur. That is my resolve.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
008	There is no need for resolve.
009	You're wrong. I know now that human resolve is what safeguards the world.

043	That is the power of resolve!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
044	Now I have you...!
