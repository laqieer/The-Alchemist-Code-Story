001	Ah...
002	Lust, Sloth, Gluttony. You sacrificed your human form to seal those three great sins inside of you.
003	I thought we got you back after we removed the Cursed Beast's cores but...I have to wonder how much is really left.	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0002
004	...I no longer dream. I don't taste the food I eat. I don't even feel pain.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0006
005	...
006	Which means I'm all right. I can still fulfill my duty.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0007
007	...There's still time, you know.
008	There's still time to change things. What is lost might never come back, but even so—	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0001
009	I'm afraid that isn't possible.
010	Emmel...
011	This is my duty. I took it from you to continue standing by my brother's side.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
012	It doesn't matter how heavy this burden becomes, I will not run away from my responsibility.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
013	I see...	VO_eularea.eularea_sys_0022
014	You two siblings really are a pair of knuckleheads...
015	Well then...
016	If it isn't the traitor. Not satisfied with turning your blade on your countrymen, Andechs? What? You think you can come asking things from us now?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0012
017	Whew! Well. I can't really defend myself there.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
018	You're pretty much right.
019	I did betray the Ira Belt...
020	And instead I decided to protect the citizens and people living in the Invidia Belt.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
021	Did you come here to talk nonsense? Get to the point.
022	Ah yes, I came with good reason. We need your power.
023	You understand what's actually happening here, right?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
024	The real reason you were ordered to invade the Invidia Belt is so that the Ira Belt may steal its territory.
025	You should know that it's already far too late for such a strategy.
026	...	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
027	The king of these lands intends to kill the Cursed Beast.
028	That option was never even available to us. I don't think we even considered it a possibility.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
029	I'd...like to see this happen.
030	...There's no point in fighting the Cursed Beasts. They're a part of this world.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
031	Kill one, and another will simply be born in its place... That's what that serpent told us.
032	That may or may not be true, but I'd still like to take this bet.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
033	That guy who owns the airship, Nimul? He keeps bragging that he's going to save the world.
034	...Then you're the same as him. Believing in the future of us humans... Just like the late king Arius.
035	Actually, about that... I want you to tell me what happened while I was gone.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
036	What happened to King Arius?
037	Hah, that's very simple. We... Well, we gave up.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
038	Completely just gave up on the future of the Ira Belt...
039	Let's begin. I'd like to hear from you, as the people who shall lead the charge against Leviathan.
040	For starters, as of right now, not a single one of our attacks will hit it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
041	Oh?
042	What about that light from your airship? I thought that was Anti-Curse magic?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0006
043	Anti-Curse magic is fundamentally a method that makes contact with a target to strip away sinful magil.
044	Basically, if we can't actually make contact with it, it's not going to have any effect. So there's our problem.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0016
045	It's able to manipulate the ocean.
046	Yeah, Leviathan can envelop itself in these corrupted waters to protect itself. It has already repelled our attacks twice.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
047	Nimul figured it out pretty early on, but...that power is going to a real pain to deal with.
048	Especially since all that corrupted ocean water attracts our Anti-Curse magic to it.
049	So all we're doing is extracting sin from the ocean, and that's not going to get us anywhere.	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0019
050	It's basically like it has another layer of armor over its outer shell.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0030
051	Yup, that's it!
052	So if we want to take down that Leviathan, we gotta find a way to pierce through that wall of ocean water first.
053	Leviathan's territory is the ocean, and this kingdom is surrounded by the ocean nearly all sides.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
054	Our odds of facing it anywhere other than the ocean are pretty slim, unfortunately. That is the reality of the situation.
055	In other words...	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
056	We have no methods to defeat Leviathan.
057	But we've decided to oppose it nevertheless. For now, we must think of the things we can do.
058	Of course. We're not about to give up now. We'll continue to gather information about Leviathan and devise a way to counter it.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
059	Thank you. There's just one more thing...
060	Could I ask you to look into a way to repair the Silver Shield?
061	That big shield? We don't mind doing that, but why?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
062	The Legend of the Shield Maiden says that this shield was once part of the ark that protected our people from being swallowed by the sea.
063	If you look into this matter, I feel like you might just discover a way to handle the Leviathan's "ocean" problem too.
064	Understood. Yna and I will look into that.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
065	A weapon spoken of in legends... It may be imprudent of me to say, but it's got me curious. I'll look into it.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0007
066	As for studying the Leviathan's behavior and patterns of movement...
067	Leave that to me and the airship! I'll be able to observe it from relative safety as long as I stay high enough.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0006
068	I'll come along in case things get hairy. It'll be better to have someone around who can operate Libra.	VO_nix.nix_sys_0001
069	Ah yeah, you're right. I'd have to deal with a lag in the initiation if I went about it alone...
070	Sounds good! Where should I go?	VO_mela.mela_sys_0038
071	I'd like you to protect Emmel and Eulalia.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
072	The serpents are likely to target Emmel for being the Vessel of Purification. There's a chance they will try something again.
073	Leave it to me! I'll get ready to ride that big ship...	VO_mela.mela_sys_0007
074	You sure? Not worried that the ship will be too dirty?	VO_nix.nix_sys_0010
075	You little brat! Don't be so rude to your big sis!	VO_mela.mela_sys_0016
076	Imnus, what will you do?
077	I will regroup with the rest of the knights. If we're confronting the Cursed Beast, then half-hearted preparations won't be enough.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
078	Sounds like everybody's made up their minds then. What do you want me to do?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
079	If you're asking, then I have a request.
080	Oh my, a request straight from the king himself? I humbly doth accept.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0009
081	I want you to cheer up the somber knight who is missing from our meeting.
082	Oh?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
083	...
084	Hey, little lady. It's going to get dark soon.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
085	Andechs?
086	Your king asked me to check on you.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
087	His Highness did? But... There's no good reason for him to worry about me anymore...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0011
088	Because you broke that big shield of yours?
089	Exactly. That shield was the pride of the Invidia Belt.
090	And I've gone and tainted that pride. If I was actually worthy of bearing that shield, it would've never shattered like that...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0018
091	...All right, get into position. We'll spar.
092	E-excuse me?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
093	I thought I'd come here and fix things up with some smooth talk, but frankly, I have no clue what to tell you here.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0011
094	Getting some training in is the best thing you can do in that kind of situation! You can clear your head by moving your body! And before you know it, you'll figure out a way to deal with your problems.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0008
095	Ehm, well, but...
096	I don't have my shield...
097	It's not like you can't fight without that shield, right?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
098	Just go grab whatever weapon is easy to use.
099	Y-yes... Okay.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0016
100	Um, I'll go with this.
101	Oh, look at that. That looks battle-worn, yet well-maintained. What a nice shield.
102	This is the shield I used to train with before I was selected as the Shield Maiden.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0005
103	I see, like an old friend then, hm?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0024
104	You ready to start then? Put your back into it and don't give up, 'kay!
105	Ah, no, wait a moment! I got a little caught up in the moment, but when I think about it's there's really no way that I should be trai—
106	Eeek!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0026
107	Gh... Hah!	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
108	Nice move! You're doing better.
109	Perhaps, but...
110	Look, I understand what you're feeling. Really, I do... Not living up to someone's expectations is rough for both parties.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
111	Yeah...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0016
112	But you survived, and that means you can continue to fight.
113	This isn't the end yet. There's still chances to make up for your defeat.
114	But the Silver Shield is already broken...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0042
115	Is the shield really that important? I'd say there's a different, far more important thing to think about.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0017
116	Something that's more important...?
117	You may have lost your shield, but you didn't lose the ability to fight.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0004
118	I mean, sure, that shield was pretty amazing. This whole thing might even be a lot easier if we still had it, but!
119	Shield or no shield, it doesn't change the fact that we'll keep on fighting! So I'm sure you can get back up too.
120	You just gotta close your eyes and listen to the voices that are begging you to save them.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0007
121	...
122	Let me repeat myself. Your shield isn't the important thing here. All that matters is that you remember how to wield it.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0002
123	At the very least, you saved my ass out there, so I feel confident saying the following.
124	You're a brave little lady.
125	In that moment, I could tell you were prepared to lose it all if it meant protecting someone. As a knight, I admire that kind of resolve.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
126	That's just...	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0039
127	Nobody here wants to see you look so down, so have a little more confidence.
128	Lemme tell you, in that moment you were practically a goddess to me, descended from the heavens to come and save my simple soul.
129	...Uhm, now you're just exaggerating.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0001
130	Haha, am I?
131	Well, regardless, this battle isn't over yet. So if you've got time to stare at the twilight, well, why not spend it struggling alongside the rest of us?
132	I won't even laugh if you're a little awkward, promise. I've got no room to talk. I'm certainly no better than you!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0012
133	I'm over here talking big about saving this kingdom, as if that doesn't mean killing my fellow Ira Belt knights with these very hands.
134	If that isn't betrayal, I don't know what is. That's just where we're at now...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0030
135	Do you regret it?
136	No, I don't.
137	I took a vow to uphold justice, and I wield my sword accordingly. If I spend my time wallowing in regret, why, I'd be dragging the name of every life I ever took through the mud. To me, that is blasphemous.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0010
138	Well, at least that's the selfish excuse I tell myself.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0011
139	You're...a very strange guy.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0007
140	Oh? Hmm... I'll take that as a compliment.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0031
141	I will too...
142	(Will there ever be a day that I can look to the future without any regrets about the past?)
143	Hm? Did you say something?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0006
144	Excuse me, Vice-Captain! The lookouts sent us a report!
145	What did they say? More Ira Belt forces?
146	Ah, well, yes, there are, but...	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
147	We spotted their warship, but they're being attacked by Leviathan!
148	Leviathan?	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0025
149	We don't know how we're supposed to respond to this...
150	First, calm down. Report to the castle, and the captain will take it from here.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0002
151	U-understood!
152	...	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
153	Andechs...
154	...I know, they're my enemies now. There's no way we could go help 'em out.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
155	Let's go.
156	...Are you sure?
157	You sat here and listened to all my disgraceful worries.	VO_dafne.dafne_sys_0004
158	I'd like to return the favor, and besides...
159	It's not like the citizens of this land particularly want to see yours wiped out or anything like that.
160	If anything, I hope that this might be the act that could put an end to this war...	VO_dafne.dafne_battle_0019
161	...So, we'll help.
162	I will arrange for a ship. You should go ahead and make your way to the port.
163	Got it!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0005
164	So that's the Shield Maiden...
165	She doesn't hesitate to lend a hand to others, even though she's drowning in her own worries. As long as it's for someone else, she can make decisions just fine...
166	You're already plenty amazing, little lady.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0003
167	Well, I better pull myself back together too!
