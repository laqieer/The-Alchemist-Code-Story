001	Nnrgh...	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0027
002	This...might be bad.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0022
003	Let's see how long you all will last.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
004	Tanosuke!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
005	I know, I know!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0004
006	As if I will let you. I mean, it won't work, but I'd still hate to have to deal with it.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0020
007	...!
008	Captain Tanosuke! Let me—	VO_amane.amane_sys_0001
009	No.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0039
010	But...!	VO_amane.amane_battle_0019
011	You don't want to die yet, do you?
012	...
013	Not getting along? Impressive that you still have the energy for it.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
014	The time will come for your powers to shine. Wait patiently for that moment to unleash it.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_battle_0015
015	O-okay...!
016	You are going to depend on one of your new recruits? All out of hands to play, I take it.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0021
017	How pathetic.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
018	Captain Tanosuke!
019	I don't know what you're talking about. It's just time to hitch a ride with Captain Ugachi's plan.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0005
020	So you noticed, did you?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
021	If you really intended to end this, you wouldn't have a problem against the Discarnate Power alone, not with the techniques of the Black Star up your sleeve.
022	There's only one explanation as to why you haven't used it yet.
023	I really do hate you.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0030
024	I really like you, though. You're so thoughtful of your subordinates.	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0010
025	Huh...?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0025
026	What are you blabbering about? It is all in vain.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_a
027	Huzzzaaaah!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0032
028	Don't make me laugh.	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0019
029	On me!	VO_ugachi.ugachi_battle_0015
030	What the—?!
031	Have you composed yourself?	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
032	Yes, thank you.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
033	Kagomurasaki—!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
034	Now, Amane!	VO_tanosuke.tanosuke_sys_0003
035	Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0001
036	Urgh! This can't be!
037	Yes!!!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0009
038	Go on. Finish the job. You owe me one.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
039	Huzzzaaaah!	VO_azami.azami_sys_0032
040	Impossible!
041	Feel the wrath of my clan.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
042	Are you satisfied?
043	Somewhat.
044	You did what you set out to do. That should be enough.
045	Is that what you would want to hear if you were in my shoes?
046	Don't get cocky.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
047	It's not over yet!	VO_amane.amane_sys_0016
048	I know. I'm still not strong enough.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0004
049	You impudent little brats! And you!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0003
050	You were the one!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
051	What?
052	I did my part. There's no way you can win now.	VO_azami.azami_sys_0010
053	Huh?
054	I hereby invoke the bars set upon the gates of the four gods. The shackles and forbidden gate shall be concealed.
055	All shall be bound.
056	Grr... Aaaaaagh!!! I-I cannot move?!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0028_b
057	Great job, Azami.
058	You bought us just enough time to form the force field.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0034
059	Celis!	VO_amane.amane_favorite_0006
060	You should always hide your ace up your sleeve.
061	How...dare you!	VO_ogre.ogre_battle_0001
062	You can't run now, demon. The tides have turned.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0003
063	You're the one being hunted now.
