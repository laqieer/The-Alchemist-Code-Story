001	It appears that the Lizard Brigade had, indeed, already left prior to our arrival.
002	Just as Gabirond had predicted, Philosopher's Stones aside,
003	it appears they've been collecting the blood from the surrounding monsters and humans to use as a source of power for the Demon.
004	Could the Demon already be activated?
005	No. If it were possible to activate the Demon, they would already be utilizing it in battle.
006	The fact that we have received no such news is proof that they lack the sufficient amount of power to activate it.
007	Do you think they have embarked on collecting Philosopher's Stones as a source of power?
008	The chances are high. We should search areas of Wratharis where Philosopher's Stones are most likely to be found.
009	We leave within the hour. Hurry with preparations.
010	I can't believe things have actually ended up like this. What Agatha feared is now a reality.
011	Are you okay?
012	Hm? Yeah. Fortunately, I don't seem to have suffered any major wounds. I'll be okay.
013	No, I'm talking about your mental state.
014	Right now, you appear to be in an extremely dangerous place. I can understand finally the reason why Captain Zeke left you in our care.
015	What are you talking about? We've no time for idle talk.	VO_dios.dios_sys_0005
016	Dias, once again, I want you to take this to heart. Do not rely on malicious intentions. Never forget the pain that comes with wielding a sword.	VO_bertrand.bertrand_favorite_0002
017	Tsk. What are you trying to say?	VO_dios.dios_sys_0029
