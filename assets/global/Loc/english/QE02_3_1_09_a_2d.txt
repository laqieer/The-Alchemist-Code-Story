001	Whoa! It's really cut in half! What happened here?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0025
002	Just look at this. Do you still think I was lying?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
003	More importantly...where did the young lady disappear to?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
004	This railroad is a single track running along a cliff. There's nowhere to hide.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0031
005	... ...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
006	Hey, what's this trail? Are these...hooves?
007	Hooves...?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0025
008	Of course!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
009	What is it? Did you think of something?
010	Seriously...if you're gonna go on living in the underworld, you should at least recall past battles.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
011	Huh?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
012	The first battle we fought together...
013	Don't you remember how tough the fighting was in Saga?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0010
014	The Vunians? That equestrian race? A horse...?!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0025
015	The well-trained horse can gallop up a cliff. Don't you remember how much they made us suffer?!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0016
016	Don! Bad news!
017	There's a massive amount of androids approaching from both the front and rear! We're trapped!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0028
018	Hey, hold on! That bike...	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0027
019	Huh? We found it in that compartment over there...he-hey...what do you think you're doing?!	VO_mafia-a.mafia-a_sys_0006
020	Hey, buddy! How've you been?! All right. Get on, Ronnie!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0024
021	Sorry, Tara baby, we'll catch you later! Can't keep the little lady waiting!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0007
022	What? What?! You're not gonna try to climb the cliff with your bike, are you?! What the...?!	VO_ronnie.ronnie_sys_0028
023	Ack! That idiot!	VO_taras.taras_sys_0042
024	Don...the buggy's grip is weak. You better not end up sliding lamely back down the cliff.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0016
025	Huh? What are you talking about?	VO_taras.taras_sys_0005
026	I'm saying that, with my graceful moves, I can easily handle this amount of androids. I'm saying that we won't be needing your help, Don.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0017
027	...You're making me cry.	VO_taras.taras_sys_0007
028	Just remember that once we get back to the mansion, we're drinking that bottle of Bleu du Goward.
029	Of course, Don.	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0018
030	All right, men, brace yourselves! We're gonna plow our way through!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0019
031	Feel free to knock anyone who gets in your way off the cliff. Let's go!!!	VO_tango.tango_favorite_0020
