001	More pursuers may come. I can't afford to cause any more trouble for you.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
002	I'll...return to Greed Dike.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0035
003	... ...
004	Why?! You don't want to fight anymore, right?!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0022
005	...?!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0029
006	You look like you're in so much pain when you're fighting.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0020
007	But...I'm Prototype 0...	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
008	I'm a zombie. I have no choice but to keep fighting as a killing machine...even in death.
009	A warm person like you has nothing to gain from being around someone like me.
010	You're not a killing machine! And you're not dead!!!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0012
011	...What?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0025
012	It's true that your body may be dead...	VO_porin.porin_battle_1028
013	But is your heart dead as well?
014	It doesn't seem like so to me.
015	... ...
016	Besides...if your heart is truly dead...I want to bring it back to life!	VO_porin.porin_battle_0023
017	...!!!	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0020
018	You want to bring my heart...back to life?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0002
019	Yes!	VO_porin.porin_sys_0004
020	Why...?	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0018
021	Well, you would fight to protect me.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
022	Also, your eyes are gentle like the spring.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0008
023	... ...
024	See. Your tears are warm. It's proof that you're not dead.	VO_porin.porin_sys_1002
025	...Ah.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_1050
026	Let's find warm days together.	VO_porin.porin_sys_0007
027	We can do some knitting so that you don't get any colder.
028	The room is getting warmer. How about you take off your hat and earmuffs so we can have tea?	VO_porin.porin_chara_1009
029	...Okay.	VO_fengliu.fengliu_sys_0004
