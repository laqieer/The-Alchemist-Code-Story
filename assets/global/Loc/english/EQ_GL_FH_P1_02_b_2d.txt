001	(Damn, her range is too long. I can't get far like this!)
002	Through my sights, I saw the strange man pinned by a hail of fire.
003	It felt as if I knew those movements by heart somehow...
004	A certain kind of savage elegance; a dance of twin blades.
005	...Kh!
006	(An opening!)
007	Hah!
008	*gasp*
009	Ugh!
010	...!
011	- A distant memory... -
012	A gunshot narrowly whizzes overhead as Siegfried tackles Roxanne to the ground.
013	Oof...
014	You good, Rox?
015	Y-yeah.
016	Quick, he's getting away!
017	But your leg-
018	I'll be fine! But he'll be gone if you don't go after him.
019	Yeah, and then I'll still have to carry you around, right?
020	Hmph!
021	...Do you mind if you get off me? You're a little, um, close.
022	Oh.
023	(Again...)
024	The thundering footsteps of Goetia soldiers interrupts their brief moment.
025	As Siegfried stares down at the weapon aimed squarely between his eyes, Roxanne suddenly lowers her rifle.
026	...
027	Get out of here.
028	What?
029	Black Rose'. Remember it.
030	We will meet again here, when it is right.
031	I don't under...
032	...
033	All right.
034	Take care of yourself, Rox.
035	Stop calling me that.
036	I don't even know who...
037	What's the problem?
038	I thought there was an unexpected intruder skulking around.
039	Turns out it was just a haywire hologram.
040	Huh.
041	Grimm's intense stare nearly burns a hole in the broken device.
042	The rest of you, search the area.
043	As for you..that's enough of a detour.
044	Get back to headquarters. The Doktor will be expecting you.
045	Understood.
046	This isn't even anywhere near the designated range.
047	Something's caught her attention...
048	The Doktor barely glances at Roxanne as he flips through the report, mumbling to himself.
049	Hmm... Hmm.
050	Reaction time seems on par... No abnormalities as to physical performance...
051	Slight hesitancy expected... I suppose that is negligible as long as you follow orders.
052	Tell me, did you have any...ah, strange thoughts? Memories perhaps?
053	...Yes, but I could not make sense of them.
054	What were they about?
055	People I once considered friends, I suppose. I do not remember their names.
056	I see...
057	We will need something to...to suppress those disconcerting memories, then.
058	You do not wish to be troubled by them, yes?
059	...
060	That will be all, then.
061	Ah, before you go...
062	The Director would like to see you after you have taken your ease. Something about a new mission.
063	I'll make my way there immediately.
064	Alone in the cold, sterile office, the Doktor scans the stack of reports arrayed upon the desk.
065	To say the inconsistencies in emotional response are insignificant is...an understatement.
066	But even so, we are dealing with something quite different... Quite different indeed.
067	I should like to know how this will affect Atropos...
