001	...
002	Sorry to have gone so far astray. I got a bit sidetracked.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0036
003	What am I to do with you if you can't even follow simple directions?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0002
004	Or could it be you ran into some assassins, perhaps?
005	Can't hide anything from you, it seems.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0030
006	Oh. That was supposed to be a joke! Did you defeat them alone, then?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0045
007	You've become strong indeed, Orion.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0007
008	What's gotten into you? Have you been drugged or something?
009	Very funny. Learn to take a compliment, will you?
046	Indeed. I suppose you're not the only one acting out of character today.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0010
047	A necklace? Heh. It looks like a belled animal collar.
048	I thought it would be best to show my appreciation for allowing me to come here with you.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0002
049	They say the bell is thought to bring good fortune to travelers. I hope it brings some to us.
050	Hmph. So the kitten gives the wolf its collar, then? You might be taking that pet name of yours a little too seriously.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0010
051	If you don't like it, you're welcome to dispose of it when I'm not looking.
052	That's the plan.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0005
053	It seems you've enjoyed your stay in Wratharis, though, if this is anything to go by.
010	Yes, it was quite the experience. It makes me want to explore the whole continent.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0004
011	The whole thing, eh? If that's what you got out of this venture, then I have a question for you:
019	Isn't this the perfect opportunity to kill me? It's just the two of us, here in a foreign land. Is there any better setting for a quick and easy murder?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
020	You've got a point. Though I'm not particularly feeling it right now. Not while my sense of wonder from seeing the larger world for the first time is still fresh in my mind.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0031
021	That's about what I expected.
022	You know you'd be able to explore the world freely right now, if you just cut ties with Mammon.	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0031
023	That way I can get what I want, and you can travel to your heart's content; we both feed our desires.
024	We'd both get what we want, eh? Not a bad idea.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0006
025	You've gotten too strong. I may have to challenge you myself after all.
026	You know Mammon would never allow that. Nor would it be particularly wise to unleash Mammon's power in a place like this.	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0040
027	Still worried about that? That giving in to your bloodlust might cause Mammon to take control of you?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0030
028	Well, fear not, for this can all end now. I'll be taking everything!
029	Hrk!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0019
030	Come out, Mammon! I'm the one you want! Choose me!
031	Grah! Wh-what are you—?!	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0042
032	Have you ever wondered why potential successors aren't allowed outside of the kingdom?	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0003
033	Because the power of Mammon's Greed, and the protection it offers...would be lessened.
034	Nicely deduced. And that's a limitation not even Mammon's future host can overcome!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0006
035	Gahh...	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0022
036	It seems this was worth the trip after all.
037	I've satisfied every condition the emperor laid out for me.
038	Come, Mammon! Leave that weakling behind, and feast upon the blood of one who is truly worthy of you!	VO_langhao.langhao_battle_0001
039	Hrgh...!
040	...
041	Mammon has now chosen me. You rejected the power of Greed, but I, little more than a pitiful attendant, have taken up your slack!	VO_langhao.langhao_sys_0001
042	So this is the real reason you brought me out of Greed Dike on this journey with you? You sought the chance to ambush me?	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_sys_0001
043	You think I can't handle this power, don't you?
044	You know what bearing Mammon entails. That's why I should be the one—	VO_orione_orione-b.orione_battle_0016
045	I'll gladly take all of the despair it gives me.
012	A mix of emotions flooded through me on this first journey of mine to another land, but the strongest among them at this moment was the sense that something just...wasn't quite right.
013	Although Langhao had achieved her goal and gotten her hands on Mammon, nothing—not her words, nor her actions, nor her mannerisms—seemed in keeping with the Langhao I'd come to know.
014	Regardless, I had been bested, as far as I knew. So after a time, upon our return to Greed Dike...
015	We were called before the current emperor and informed that Langhao had officially been chosen as the successor, in my place.
016	Evidently, the arranged marriage had been agreed upon, too. And so, the first empress in the history of Greed Dike came to be, with ties to Wratharis in tow.
017	It should have been a happy occasion for her, but each time I shot her a sidewards glance, she always looked very unsure of herself.
018	I decided to follow through with this observation, and see where the thread may lead.
