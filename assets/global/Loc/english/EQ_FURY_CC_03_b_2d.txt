001	You picked the wrong target.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0010
002	I-I was just giving you a warning! I mean, two girls traveling alone? Let down your guard and this is what you get!
003	What does our gender have to do with it? Pretty sure you're the bad one here.
004	Not like I profited, is it? All that luggage, and nothing but rags! What're you lugging this stuff around for? It's trash!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0019
005	Take that back.
006	What'd you say?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0012
007	Take. That. Back.
008	Why should I?! It's true, ain't it?
009	That's her favorite kimono. Her best one.
010	Like I care! Let me go already!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
011	Y'know, I've really been looking forward to this trip.
012	If you ruin it for me, you're going to regret it.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0015
013	Ikasa!
014	Hey, Button.
015	Oh, thank goodness everything's all right!
016	How is everything all right? Our luggage got stolen.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0029
017	That doesn't matter!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
018	Huh?
019	Look, I'll give everything back, so just let me go already!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
020	Um...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
021	What? You got a problem with that arrangement?
022	May we shake hands?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
023	Huh?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0006
024	Button...
025	Please. Let's shake hands.
026	Are you nuts or something?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0003
027	I come from Wadatsumi. In my homeland, people once lived alongside demons.
028	I'm not here to listen to your rambling!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0030
029	In fact, my nation was built on the relationship between people and demons. That is why I would like to make peace with you. To understand you.
030	Hmph.
031	Tell me. Why do you steal?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
032	I lost a bet at the Colosseum, and am up to my neck in debt! So my fingers just sorta...slipped. Pfft... Bwahahaha!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0010
033	You're pathetic.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
034	How about you, huh? Don't you hate me, lady?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
035	I did think it was quite mean of you to do that to me...
036	But I left emotions like hatred and anger behind a long time ago.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
037	Button...
038	Well, I suppose your fate is in the hands of the law now. Guards!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0041
039	What the hell?! Are you serious?! You're turning me in? After all that? I thought you were gonna let me go!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0025
040	You did something wrong.
041	It is only right that you pay for your crimes. I hope you can forgive me.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0010
042	No one is happy to be cursed.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
043	The magic rites used by myself and the other shrine maidens of Wadatsumi impact our vision, hearing, and sense of touch.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
044	The greater our mastery becomes, the more our senses are affected. Our sense of pain, even our connection to reality...
045	I believe that these powers should not be misused.
046	That's why you'll try and reach an understanding even with criminals?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
047	I merely wish to lead the people of this world to justice and peace with magic words of comfort, rather than cursed rites.
048	I suppose you think that's awfully convenient of me.
049	Nah. I love it.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
050	Wh-what?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
051	I love that about you. I think it's a great way to be.
052	Still...this dream of mine likely won't be possible without my homeland's powers, or without people like you by my side, Ikasa.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
053	Yet I pray that one day, we shall have peace.
054	Peace like the calm waters of Wadatsumi. Peace that brings equality and happiness to the people. Peace so absolute that hatred is forgotten.
055	I wanted to achieve that peace, if only for those around me to start with.
056	Now, however... I am beginning to see that I was wrong.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
057	I don't think so.
058	Prayer alone is powerless, but use force and war will never end.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0030
059	Simply uttering magic words does not alleviate hatred. Instead, its curse will bite deeper and deeper into the spirit.
060	In the end, it appears that a ruler must have absolute control for peace and justice to be possible. At least, that is the truth I have come to see reflected in the world.
061	However, I cannot become a ruler like that.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0029
062	That's okay, though.
063	Even now, I fail to live up to the grace of my name.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
064	Excuse me, Your Majesty?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
065	Huh?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
066	C'mon, is that any way for royalty to behave? Pretend you're the ruler of the land.
067	Wh-what doth disturb ye? Speak! We tire of thee!
068	Mmm... Nope. Doesn't suit you.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
069	That's just what I imagine a king sounds like...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
070	Y'know what, Button? I think it's pretty rare for rulers to start wars.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
071	Then what causes the spread of conflict?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
072	Lots of things. Religion, energy resources, wealth, land, weapons. Who deserves to control which power... The list goes on and on.
073	Like I said⁠—I like your beliefs. I like that you pray for peace.
074	I think it would be great to have a ruler who asks foreigners and criminals for handshakes as readily as they do their knights.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
075	A ruler like that would be beloved by the people.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
076	Ikasa...
077	Excuse me, Your Majesty?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
078	Wh-what is it? Speak thine mind!
079	And thou shouldst bow thine head when you speak to us! And keep thine eyes in front!
080	Huh? Which is it?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
081	Hm? Oh... Can you bow your head while keeping your eyes in front? No, no, that doesn't work...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
082	Heh. Her Majesty isn't sure what she wants, huh? Well, I am but a lowly soldier, but if Your Majesty would allow me to offer her some advice?
083	W-we will permit it!
084	Just go.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
085	G-go? Go where?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
086	To see the world.
087	To the world's end.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
