001	Grk...!!!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0025
002	Kanon!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
003	Good!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
004	Nngh... S-she got me...from behind?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0022
005	Y-you... How did you...?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0027
006	I heard it this time! Excalibur told me exactly where to go!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
007	It resonated with your location, showing me exactly how to find you!
008	That's right... Cadanova, I had heard that you once trained with the Lord Commander Zain...	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
009	That would explain what gave you the chance to learn about Yogi Ku's weapon forging...
010	Indeed, Yogi Ku is an old friend of mine. There's no way I could mistake his work.	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0016
011	It's shameful that it took me so long to realize...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0018
012	However, I cannot understand how you could have gotten your hands on Yogi Ku's work.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
013	Urgh... A-and why would...I tell you...something like...that?	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
014	There's no reason for me to bother telling anything to a bunch of people nearing their deathbeds!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
015	Impossible! He still has that much strength left?!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0022
016	D-don't worry! I definitely won't lose to someone like him!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
017	Ha! This is the Lord Commander of the Holy Guard? The difference in our power makes me laugh!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
018	You might be right... If strength was the only thing I had on my side, I would have no hope of winning this fight.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0017
019	If strength...was the only thing you had...on your side?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
020	That's right.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
021	You may be stronger than me, but I have something that will ensure that I never lose to the likes of you.
022	Ha, and what would that be, little girl?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0012
023	That thing that you gave up on long ago... The determination to do what my heart tells me is right, to use my sword for peace!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
024	I haven't given up on that dream yet!
025	...!
026	This sword of mine... Its duty is to save the world from unhappiness!
027	I will never give up on that, no matter how difficult it gets!
028	This is the vow I made, one that I swore to never turn my back on!
029	Ha...hahahaha! I never thought I'd see the day when I would find myself in agreement with something this girl said!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
030	Grk... You...!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
031	No matter how much stronger you are than me, I will never lose to you!
032	I could never lose to someone who has given up on their own heart and values!
033	Silence!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
034	Huzzzaaah!!!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0010
035	No, Kanon! It is careless to just rush in!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
036	...!
037	Her attack was deflected?! Kanon!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
038	You managed to land one blow upon me due to the element of surprise...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
039	However, as I pointed out before, my strength has lent me the ability to win every battle I have undertaken.
040	Ack...!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0016
041	That said...it has been quite a long time since I last acquired a real injury on the battlefield. I must now ensure that it will not happen again.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0016
042	Ack...?!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
043	How much of his remaining strength was he hiding?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
044	Kanon! Please, run!	VO_spica.spica_chara_1009
045	Run? Haha... To where? I shall reduce this entire space to rubble! No one will be left alive once I am done!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0010
046	This... This is no bluff!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
047	No... It's come to this... I must...	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0042
048	Hmph. I don't know what you plan to do, but it is too late. I have already finished all the necessary preparations!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0044
049	No! It can't be!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
050	Die, Paladin!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0011
051	Grgnhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0027
052	...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
053	G-grahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0028
054	Zahar?! This power is...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0027
055	You have fully unleashed your powers of darkness?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_sys_0025
056	H-hahaha... Did I beat you to the punch? Zehn! This is the end for you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0019
057	What are you doing?! Do you plan to destroy even yourself?!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
058	Don't make me laugh... I will bury my enemies here, and I will be the last one standing!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0010
059	Ha! I'll believe you when I see it! Die, Zahar!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
060	Lord Zahar!	VO_spica.spica_battle_0023
061	Gnngghhhhhhhhhhhh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
062	Huh...?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
063	You do not disappoint me, Zehn... I never expected you would be able to gain access to this much power!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0045
064	However... It is still limited by your human body! One which cannot even conceive of the power that the world of darkness has to offer!
065	Y-you...?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
066	Bow before a powerful darkness that no human can ever know! Unlimited Zero!!!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_battle_0007
067	Agh?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0025
068	H-he's...?
069	U-urgh! Wh-what is this strength?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0022
070	If I hadn't returned to this world, perhaps things would have worked out better for you... Unfortunately, it was not to be.	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0011
071	Welcome the fate I have been brought here to deliver upon you!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0032
072	Gah... Argh...!!!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0043
073	...Nngh?	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0042
074	Z-Zahar...?
075	Nn...Nngh... G-gnghhhhh! Grh!	VO_zaharu.zaharu_sys_0043
076	This is not good! The darkness is beginning to overwhelm him!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
077	The darkness?! Lord Zahar! You mustn't allow it to get the better of you!	VO_spica.spica_sys_0026
078	Ha. Haha...hahahaha! It's too bad, Zahar! It looks like fate is on my side today!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0008
079	He disappeared?! Watch out, everyone!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
080	I spent too much time playing around with you all... It's time to really put an end to this little chat of ours.	VO_zen.zen_battle_0007
081	Do not think we will simply allow such a thing!	VO_kadhanova.kadhanova_battle_0019
082	Allow? Ha! It's time for you to die!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0012
083	Ah... You cannot hear the voice of that sword at all, it seems.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0030
084	?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
085	You... Behind me again?!	VO_zen.zen_battle_0019
086	Did I tell you? I can hear the voice of that sword.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0017
087	What... What is that sound...? The blade is...shuddering?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0027
088	Swords are more than just weapons. They carry within them the legacy our hearts most want to leave behind.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0010
089	?!	VO_zen.zen_sys_0025
090	Not just the heart of the wielder, but also of the maker... I can hear the sadness contained in that blade. It remembers the heart of my father and suffers.	VO_miuna.miuna_sys_0018
091	Miss...Miuna...?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0025
092	You're... Yogi Ku's...	VO_zen.zen_sys_0021
