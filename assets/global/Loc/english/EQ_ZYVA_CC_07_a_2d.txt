001	I believed I could accomplish something. That was how I kept myself going.
002	I thought I was really something. I thought I was one of the chosen ones, destined to change the course of this world.
003	You're mine! I can do whatever I want with you and all my loot!	VO_gluttony-o.gluttony-o_sys_0008
004	What exactly do you think you can do against them? Put away your weapons at once.
005	I feel like a fool who has been dancing on stage for an empty room, all the while believing the world's eyes were on me.
006	They were never real. It was all a lie.
007	Now that the lies have been unveiled, I can finally see myself as I am. As I was.
008	I was a brazen beast, clad in a costume of lies, laughing profanely.
009	I was unsightly filth, lower than a weed.
010	I am worthless.
011	Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0009
012	I did it! I did it, old man!
013	I wanted to kill him. Oh, how long I've waited for this day... With my own hands! Dead! Really, really dead!
014	I don't belong to anyone but myself! Everything I steal, everything I kill...is mine! All mine!
015	Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!	VO_siewa_siewa-b.siewa_sys_0008
016	...
017	Nobody...told me.
018	There is no lie here. I wanted to see what blossom you would bloom into. I long to see your petals fall at the moment of your death.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0010
019	For this, I have watered you. Gently...and with care.
020	You are lacking refinement.	VO_drei.drei_sys_0001
021	But make no mistake! In my eyes, you are a true flower!	VO_drei.drei_sys_0008
022	...
023	Shut your trap...idiot.
024	Sieba...
025	You're finally awake.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
026	This is how I've always been, y'know.
027	What?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
028	I've always survived by stealing.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
029	He misjudged me.
030	I could never become a replication of Yauras. I could never be as graceful as her.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0016
031	...
032	I'm...too rotten inside.
033	Hah!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
034	I've got the mentality of a greedy thief. I can't help but want to show off, and I'm rude and violent.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0022
035	I'm rotten from the roots up. I was never gonna be able to bloom into a flower like her.
036	That's why I like to decorate myself. I plunder and pilfer to embellish myself because I like to hide behind gaudy, dazzling thorns.
037	I don't care if it doesn't belong to me or if it's fake. If it's in my hands, it belongs to me.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0007
038	Heh...heheh... That's certainly some interesting logic you're using there.	VO_fuelie.fuelie_sys_0007
039	Very villainous.	VO_vier.vier_sys_0006
040	That's how I am! I might be unsightly and crude, that's just me!
041	I'm no replica of Yauras—Yauras is a replica of me! That's it! That has to be the truth!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0009
042	How audacious of you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
043	That's what I like about you, Sieba.	VO_zwei.zwei_sys_0008
044	Hell yeah!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
045	You're going to become the greatest dual-wielding swordswoman in the world, Sieba. I can see it.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
046	You bet I am! I'm not gonna hesitate, not for a second.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0037
047	And I'm not gonna stop until I've reached the very top. Both the top of the world, and the top of the Tower Veda.
048	I'm gonna bloom in my own way.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
049	Goodbye...
050	Aghh! Arghhh...!	VO_siewa.siewa_battle_0025
051	What a poor soul...
052	H-huh?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
053	If you are reborn...then you should live...however you wish to live...
054	This is how I will die. I will slip from this world, having lived a pitiful life.
055	A whirl of vivid colors pierced my eyes.
056	Purplish clouds scudded across the skies, soaked in shades of tangerine by the light of the morning sun. The trees gleamed in shades of green, spilt blood glittered claret upon the ground, interspersed with flashes of indigo garb and fluttering strands of golden hair.
057	Amongst it all, the Twin-Blade Knight stood out, as piercingly azure as a cloudless sky on a summer day.
058	The spectrum of light that illuminated her, the Twin-Blade Knight, the Cerulean Rose, lit her up just like...
059	A rainbow...
060	But this is not your rainbow.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
061	What?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0027
062	I can make anything mine, just by taking it for myself.
063	Rainbow...? What are you—?
064	All this time, without any help from you...
065	I've been living my own life!
066	Ah...!
067	It's nice to meet you, Yauras.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
068	Why don't we introduce ourselves?
069	I thought... Didn't you say we've met before?
070	I've met you, but you haven't met me. That's just how it is.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
071	What do you mean?
072	My name is Sieba. I'm the greatest dual-wielding swordswoman in the world.	VO_siewa.siewa_chara_2001
073	I swing my blades gracefully, and with elegance, more brilliantly than anybody in the whole wide world.	VO_siewa.siewa_chara_3001
074	Fine...come at me then. I'll take you on.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0037
075	Try to ask nicely next time.	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0006
076	You rude little tramp!
077	Ack...! What speed!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
078	I cannot overlook what you people are doing...as a knight who lives in the name of absolute justice.
080	Heheh...! That's right! You've gotta be yourself!	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0008
081	That's how I know who I am!
082	Well then! Let's decide once and for all—	VO_siewa.siewa_sys_0010
083	Who the best twin sword fighter is!
