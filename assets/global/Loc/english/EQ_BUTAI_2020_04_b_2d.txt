001	If I could change the circumstances of my birth, I'd make it so that I was born a thousand years earlier.
002	I'd give anything to be able to observe history as it was made with my own eyes.
003	This is why I'm saying goodbye.
004	I'm sorry. I really mean that. The truth is, I —————————————— (The continuation has been obscured by black ink.)
005	I don't want to disappear.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0019
006	...
007	Tell me—what could possibly be so bad that the Holy Order is prepared to resort to murder to cover it up?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
008	It's of little consequence.
009	Then why bother hiding it?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
010	A lot of trivial annoyances can combine to cause a disproportionate amount of trouble.
011	Let me guess—those trivial annoyances...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
012	Would they happen to involve a group of paladins getting a little too close to Lost Blue?
013	...
014	I'm sure it'd be quite a problem for you if the Lord Commander were to shine his light on Lost Blue.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
015	So, naturally, when someone like me, who is very close to him, starts investigating the place... you have to take action. After all, there's a good chance our loyal Lord Commander would follow in my stead and stick his nose where it doesn't belong.
016	You couldn't have that, could you? So you tried to nip the problem in the bud.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
017	I...
018	But I'm not directing my questions to a mere puppet. The person behind all this isn't wearing his hood this time.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
019	Well?
020	What do you have to say about the conclusion of my observations?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
021	...
022	I'm asking you a question, Most Reverend Bishop Waginau.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0003
023	Extraordinary.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0024
024	You've been very busy, haven't you, Kaya?
025	Right back at you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
026	Ngh!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0019
027	Aren't you tired from battling my soldiers? Come, you should rest.
028	When I lay down to die, you'll be coming with me!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0043
029	So you'd rather die a hero's death?
030	This is it!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0032
031	You said it yourself, did you not? If anyone did intend to come after you, they would likely come prepared.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
032	What do you—?
033	You may be confident of preserving your own life, but what of Zain's?
034	Wh-what?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0027
035	You...!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0022
036	The time has come.
037	Should you resist, you will be endangering not only Zain, but also the lives of all of the knights in the Holy Guard. I've made sure of that.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
038	They have nothing to do with this!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0029
039	Do not mislead yourself into thinking you can resist me.
040	Huzzaaaahh!	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0025
041	You've grown careless, Crimson Dragon.
042	Ngh! Haa... haa... Aaahh!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0043
043	You seem distracted, Kaya. What's...? Ohh. I see.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0008
044	Kaya?!
045	Hello, Zain.
046	M-Most Reverend Bishop Waginau?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
047	Zain! Get out of here!
048	You ought to have been more careful, Zain.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
049	Wh-what in the name of Babel is going on here?!
050	Remind me... Who was it you came here to protect, Kaya?	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
051	R-Reverend!
052	Kaya! Just hang in there, all right? I'll—!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0032
053	I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Zain. I'll be eliminating that girl, here and now.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0007
054	We shall stand vigil over her passing together.
055	Waginau!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0013
056	You know... I really had hoped that I could nip this problem in the bud before things escalated. As they say: The best laid plans...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
057	Why are you doing this?!
058	The truth is irrelevant now.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
059	All you need to know is that your little investigation into Lost Blue was a great inconvenience to the Holy Order.
060	What?! What does the Order have to do with Lost Blue?
061	Every day, we of the Holy Order work tirelessly to remove the obstacles that stand between us and world peace.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
062	To put it plainly, we eliminate those who are not to our satisfaction.
063	And the people of Lost Blue happen to be the perfect pawns to carry out such deeds.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
064	So the Order is... using Lost Blue? To assassinate people?!
065	These people have no families, no identities. Even if someone messes up, they cannot be tracked.
066	It's too perfect an arrangement not to make use of, wouldn't you say? Lost Blue functions as the Holy Order's convenient repository of disposable pawns.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0037
067	Th-that's... That's monstrous!
068	I'm afraid you're another on our list of undesirables.
069	"Let's imagine that you want to get fish to live on land. For argument's sake, let's say you can understand fishspeak."
070	I-I have served the Holy Order as Lord Commander—!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0021
071	"Heck, let's say that you even know everything there is to know about the ocean. Do you think you could save them all?"
072	And as a result, you now attempt to trespass upon delicate matters the Order would prefer went undisturbed.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
073	We can't have the Holy Order's relationship with Lost Blue brought to light.
074	"Do you think you could make those fish thrive on land?"
075	I wanted to get rid of you much earlier, you know. Before you became Lord Commander, in fact.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
076	"What if the fish weren't willing? Would you still try and "save" them?"
077	"What if they died when you exposed them to all that light of yours?"
078	I did try. Any idea how?
079	Waginau! Enough! Don't—!	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0028
080	You can't be serious...
081	The girl who worked in the archives was one of my pawns.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0037
082	No!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
083	"You keep the words coming, even though you're fighting a losing battle. You should know by now that it's futile to stand against the darkness."	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
084	Killing you with brute force would have been... a hassle. So, considering your chivalrous nature, I thought that if I employed a member of the opposite sex instead... things might just resolve themselves in my favor.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
085	I was well aware of your bookwormish tendencies, and of how much stock you placed in the power of words.
086	The archives seemed a fitting place for me to lay my trap.
087	She... was working for you? From the very start?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0022
088	Well, I believe she made a living using her powers over the spirit of language back in Lost Blue.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
089	The spirit of... language?
090	It certainly sounds suspicious, doesn't it? While I'm not certain of the extent of their powers, myself...	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0022
091	Practitioners can apparently manipulate the spirit of language to have others reveal their true feelings and innermost thoughts.
092	It's only natural for those who share such things—secrets and fears they've never opened up about before, traumatic events in their past, and the like—to grow close to the one who listens to them.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
093	As such, practitioners are adept at worming their way into others' confidences, and uncovering their true intentions.
094	She... Then she really—?
095	Well, I'm afraid she didn't live up to the stories.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0020
096	I waited a long time, but she never got around to assassinating you. Perhaps she fell in love with you, after all that time you spent together?
097	Then you became Lord Commander, and with all your escorts and duties, a lowly serving girl could never have hoped to reach you.
098	She had become a worthless pawn. Even her unique abilities were no longer of any use to me. Besides, I couldn't have her blabbing my secrets.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
099	As it turns out, the organization that spouts all that rhetoric about world peace is more than happy to do dirty deeds and cover them up.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
100	I tore open her throat, and tossed her in the cesspool.
101	Then he went right back to being some kinda saint, as if she never existed.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
102	Oh, Zain. Zain, Zain, Zain. If only you hadn't stuck your nose where it didn't belong... None of this would have happened.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
103	You... fiend!
104	I cannot have the existence of Lost Blue made public.
105	And I knew it would only be troublesome for me if you met up with that woman again. Who knew what truths she would reveal to you? I couldn't have you walk away with an unnecessary hunger for justice.
106	I was finding it ever so hard to track down that woman, so imagine my surprise when you did it first!	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0010
107	Thank you for that. It was very convenient.
108	You mean... You targeted her because I tried to find her?!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
109	Exactly. This is all your fault, you know.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
110	Z-Za...in!
111	You have only yourself and your impossible vision of justice to blame.
112	It's... all my fault.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
113	Everything that happened to her...
114	That's why she couldn't reply.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
115	How was she supposed to write a single word?
116	Normally, I take the liberty of inspecting and censoring all correspondence that passes through the Holy Order and its Guard.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0016
117	However, there was no means for me to intervene when the letters were delivered by a private mailwoman, who also happened to be the most powerful captain in the Holy Guard.
118	So I was left with only one option. I had to eliminate the sender, before she said too much.
119	No...!
120	Like I said—the truth is irrelevant now.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0005
121	...
122	I care not for the Church and knights of this era any longer.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_battle_0016
123	I await a new divine vessel.
124	What?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
125	Beware our neighbor, the nation of Greed Dike.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0004
126	For it will be your downfall. One day, they will obliterate you, establishing a new world order.
127	You think we're going to let you get away with this?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
128	Careful, now. You would do well to heed me. I warn you of this for your own sakes. Forget about Lost Blue, and abandon any notions you may have of exposing the dark corners of the Order.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0014
129	I could never ignore such injustices!
130	Well, consider this: Even if I were to disappear, agents of the Holy Order would still have your beloved knights in their sights.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0002
131	You...!
132	If you make one false move, or persist in your efforts to pry into the darkness...
133	Every last one of your precious subordinates will be instantly marked for death.
134	No!
135	To tell you the truth, I would rather not lose any more useful pawns.	VO_waginao-b.waginao-b_sys_0030
136	And I do prefer that they remain ignorant and naive—the sort who blindly believe in justice.
137	After all, it would break my heart to have to destroy the place I worked so hard to build. I trust that you'll think the matter over carefully.
138	Do let me know your decision.
139	...
140	Zain...
141	K-Kaya!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
142	Zain... Are you... there?	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0019
143	I'm here, Kaya! I'm right here!
144	Haha... It seems I was right... to resign when I did.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0011
145	Kaya!
146	I just wish... I could've stayed with you a... little longer.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
147	Kaya! Hang in there!
148	And I wanted... to see it... with you. The world... at peace.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1004
149	You will! You can observe it with me! It's too early to...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0018
150	I... should've told you, while I...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
151	Kaya!
152	...
153	K-Kaya?
154	But I won't... say it now.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
155	Whatever it is—I'll listen! Just keep talking, Kaya! Please!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
156	I-I can't tell you... blockhead.
157	Wh-why—?
158	It isn't... like me to... regret...	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0028
159	I'm sorry I... couldn't stay... with you...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0036
160	I just... wanted to be free... to travel. I always thought that if I was reborn... I'd want it to be one thousand years before my time. Truly...
161	But now, I... I wonder... if that's what I really wanted, after all.
162	I'm... sorry.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0035
