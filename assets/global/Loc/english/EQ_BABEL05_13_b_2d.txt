001	I won't make the same mistakes again.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0010
002	It seems the time has come.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
003	...
004	I must admit that I am surprised...	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0030
005	That you are here...and, well, appearing to be exactly as you were the last time we met.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0003
006	You should have been more thorough.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
007	I told you, didn't I? I warned you that if anyone did intend to come after me, they would likely come prepared.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
008	How did you know that I would be in Slothstein?
009	I knew that you wouldn't be able to leave the matter of that mysterious girl alone.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0010
010	So you are here to throw away the life that you once barely escaped with, are you?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
011	I'm already dead.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0039
012	Then what are you doing here?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
013	The justice of the continent, which I once worked towards, has been entirely lost.
014	I cannot return to the past. I cannot continue into the future.
015	I suppose that makes me a restless spirit who can't move on.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
016	It seems to me that you just don't know when to quit.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
017	I could say the same about you.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0003
018	You... What would you know?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0012
019	I know that while there may not be much that a spirit can achieve, there is one thing of which I am still capable.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
020	I can stop you.
021	What?!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0026
022	This isn't like me at all, but...it can't hurt to unleash one's full strength...on occasion.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_0014
023	Did it...work? Is it...over?
024	Are you all right?	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0014
025	D-did I...protect...Lofia?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0002
026	You did. You really did.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0037
027	You did so well! I'm so proud of you, Ravina!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0023
028	Eheheh...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0007
029	L-Lofia said...she's...proud of me.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0008
030	We'll have some dessert together when you wake up.	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0007
031	Heheh... Ahahahah! Yay! I get to...eat sweets...with...Lofia. I'm so...excited...I can't...wait.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0011
032	Ravina...
033	She's fine. Just sleeping.
034	Lofia.
035	...
036	Don't move.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0010
037	Wh-what the...?
038	Guard the deactivated Demonic Soldiers.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
039	Paladins...?
040	We are the knights of the Holy Order who were stationed in Slothstein.
041	We have been in Wratharis for quite some time now, however, investigating the ruins of an ancient civilization of Babel.
042	There can be no mistake that the activation of the Demonic Soldiers and the damage to the city are your doing.
043	What?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
044	Many of the citizens here witnessed a girl with light blue hair attacking Redington with magic.
045	N-no...!
046	As for you, Court Mage Lofia...
047	Yes?
048	You are the one responsible for subduing members of the Holy Guard in the ruins of Lustburg not more than a few days ago.
049	Y-you've got it all wrong! The Paladins who came to the ruins were in Lustburg illegally! They had no right to be investigating!
050	I didn't even do anything to them! The ruin's defenses were what—!
051	What's more, you murdered your fellow Court Mage, Michael, and fled to Slothstein.
052	M-Michael...? A-are you saying that you killed—!
053	Court Mages are primarily charged with the duty of defending their country. A lone Court Mage invading a neighboring nation has the potential to threaten the Alliance of the Seven Kingdoms.
054	Objection!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0015
055	Who are you?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
056	I am Inquisitor Cheryl of the Holy Order of Babel.
057	Is that so? Then there should be no reason for you to interfere.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
058	Court Mage Lofia is innocent.
059	Oh?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0008
060	A sect of the Holy Guard is plotting to have her killed.
061	By utilizing the order of assassins known as Corpse, they have attempted to unlawfully conceal the truth of Alchemy.
062	...
063	The imperative of the Holy Guard is the regulation of Alchemy. The last time I checked, that certainly did not involve turning those skills against the general public.
064	Despite which, at this very moment all across the country, your organization is monopolizing Alchemy while at the same time consistently burying various truths and perils at your own convenience.
065	We of the Holy Guard adhere to the Alchemist Code.
066	The secret you wish to bury revolves around the existence of the calamitous Cursed Beasts—which slumber in each of the Seven Kingdoms—and their connection to the Sacred Stones, does it not?
067	...
068	Should the truth come to light, the foundation of the Holy Guard's position as the sole proprietor of Alchemy would be greatly shaken.
069	Nonetheless, it is imperative that I bring this truth before the Inquisition, posthaste; that they may deliberate it at council.
070	The Inquisition, huh?
071	That's right.
072	I'm afraid that isn't possible.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0015
073	And why not?
074	I've heard you out, but that's as far as this is going to go. Unfortunately for you, you don't have the right to do any of the things you just talked about.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0010
075	This course of action is nothing less than my duty.
076	I guess I'll have to be the one to break it to you... You've been dismissed, Cheryl. You're no longer a member of the Inquisition.
077	What?!
078	Dismissed?!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0025
079	I've got it all here in writing.
080	No... This isn't possible.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0021
081	For forcibly and unlawfully conducting an investigation that exceeds the bounds of her position as an inquisitor, Cheryl is hereby dismissed from the aforementioned role. That's what it says.
082	No, I... I'm pursuing my mission directive even now.	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0017
083	Don't believe me? This is an official document signed by both the administrator of the Inquisition and the Bishop of the Holy Order, Lord Waginau himself.
084	Wh-what?!
085	You have accused the Holy Guard of an outrageous plot, despite having been dismissed from your position. This is a significant crime.
086	Moreover, we have ample reason to believe that you will flee if given the chance. Your accompaniment of Court Mage Lofia says much to that effect. As such, in these special circumstances...
087	Your capture has been deemed unnecessary. I have been given permission to dispose of you here and now.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
088	Wait!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_sys_0026
089	Cheryl!
090	This is far too hasty. I will return to Headquarters and negotiate with—
091	You aren't to be given the time.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0040
092	Ngh!	VO_cheryl.cheryl_battle_0019
093	To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0029
094	No!
095	Ah!	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0042
096	You're the Court Mage, Lofia, correct?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
097	A Paladin? Here in the center of the city?	VO_rofia.rofia_sys_0043
098	To accomplish our aim, we can't allow you to remain alive.
099	Corpse!
100	(So the Holy Guard and the Inquisition were in cahoots all along! Or did Corpse strong-arm the Inquisition into doing their bidding?)
101	Cheryl?! What's going on?! Cheryl!
102	It is time. We will hereby eliminate Cheryl, former inquisitor of the Holy Order of Babel.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_battle_0011
103	(I can't believe that the organization that's meant to be responsible for the justice of the continent is this corrupt! Resorting to murder to cover up their crimes...)
104	Other targets include the blue-haired girl, the sniper in the clock tower, and Court Mage Lofia.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
105	(If this is the future that awaits us...)
106	...
107	I'm sick of saying goodbye.
108	Whoa!
109	L-Lofia?
110	I have a very important promise that I must keep.
