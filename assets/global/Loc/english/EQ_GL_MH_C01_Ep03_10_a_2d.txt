001	Hey, Sieg... Can I ask you something?
002	Fire away.
003	Alchemy is... bad, isn't it? Even if I use it to protect others...
004	...Short answer, yes. Ever since the Great War, only the Holy Guard—sworn keepers of the peace—are permitted to use it.
005	Because people with strong emotions can be easily swayed by its power, Alchemy has been used as a dangerous weapon of mass destruction in the past.
006	I don't know how you came to possess it, but... I want to make sure you don't head down a path of no return.
007	Oh...
008	Aww, Sieg, why'd you have to go and make it sound so grave? Now he looks like a scolded puppy!
009	Since when did I—
010	Hey, cheer up, cutie. It's not as bad as Sieggy makes it out to be.
011	If you say so...
012	Don't call me that! Ugh, I can't believe you still remember that nickname after all these years.
013	O-only because it makes you less scary to Soren!
014	Well, we haven't got time to waste. We have to make sure the ringleader doesn't get away!
