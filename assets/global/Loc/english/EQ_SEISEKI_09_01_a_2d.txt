001	Northern Pride. Headquarters of the Holy Guard.
002	The old man...died?	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1028
003	Unfortunately...
004	When Captain Yauras made her way to him, Captain Monzein was already close to death.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
005	In other words, the rescue party didn't make it there in time?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
006	By the time I rendezvoused with him, he had already endured fatal wounds.
007	No...!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
008	...It's a little anticlimactic.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
009	Huh?
010	For Captain Yauras, it lacks that final touch. How can I say it? Like a joke without a punchline?	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0025
011	I don't want to believe it, but it's true. It hurts but we must accept the truth.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0035
012	His only saving grace was his strength. And now he's dead? Hahah...!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0012
013	It's pathetic. How am I supposed to accept this?
014	...Othima.
015	I've had enough. There's no way that old man would die that easily.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1005
016	He still hasn't even bought me the meal he owes me...
017	You gotta be kidding me. This is such nonsense. I'm not gonna accept it!!!	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0015
018	...Captain Othima...
019	I'm sorry. It's my fault. If he hadn't tried to protect me, Captain Monzein would still be...	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
020	No.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
021	When Monzein died, he used his Burning Seal. He fulfilled his code of chivalry.
022	All that occurred was the result of choices that Monzein made himself. I'll tell you this again: don't beat yourself over the head about any of this.
023	But...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
024	Enough with the mourning.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
025	Monzein sacrificed his life to entrust all of you with the future.
026	And if you repay him by moping...it would be truly putting to waste the sacrifice he made.
027	......
028	Captain Othima... It's difficult for me as well to accept Captain Monzein's death.
029	After all, it was none other than him who taught me how to truly be a knight...but...
030	I know...I know...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0018
031	I just can't be like, "I know what you mean," and accept it right now...
032	I'm sorry. I just need to get it out of my system.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_1013
033	Understood...
034	We're back, my lady.
035	Suzuka, Kazahaya...what's the matter?
036	My apologies. We searched the library from end to end...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0035
037	But we cannot seem to find any mention of the Veda Templars.
038	I see. I wonder if they're a new organization.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
039	They have enough power to take down Captain Monzein...and even Greed Dike appears to be wary.
040	It's safe to assume that they wield a considerable amount of power. Who exactly are they?
041	They are people of the shadow, who live in the deepest parts of this world.
042	They come from different places and their existence is not known to man. Of course there is no documentation on them.
043	Why do you know so much about them?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_1047
044	Well...most likely, they originate from the Lost Blue.
045	Lost Blue...?
046	It's not known to most, but there is a place for those who have nowhere to call their own, those alientated from society...and those who have been dealt a bad hand by life.
047	In some ways, you could call it a lawless land.
048	It should be in Slothstein's underground space.
049	A lawless land...where those alienated from society gather?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_1025
050	Yes. Lost Blue is a deep sea village where there is no sky and light does not shine.
051	The girl that we encountered in Lustburg, Acht...she said that she was from there.
052	There was no such record within all of the documentation material we've gathered from all across the world.
053	Why do you know of this place?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0013
054	It's because, apparently, Captain Othima is also originally from Lost Blue.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1034
055	What...?!
056	I'm not originally from there. I stayed there for a while when I was in my teens.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0022
057	Having been exiled from Lustburg, I moved around from place to place and just happened to arrive at that city.
058	So you know who they are?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_1047
059	No, I don't. After all, I was only there for a while.
060	There were a lot of people coming and going in search of Veda.
061	When I was there, if I recall correctly, there were a lot of people enquiring, but no one really teamed up together.
062	There is nobody more dangerous than that lot.
063	"Veda"... Acht mentioned that word as well. What does it mean?
064	I'm not sure how to describe it.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
065	Lost Blue is said to be a tower that cannot be seen which leads to another dimension.
066	A tower that leads to another dimension?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0026
067	It's quite hard to explain, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
068	Most likely, it is made of a high-form of energy that could be Alchemy energy. It's a tower that exists without a physical form.
069	We call it the Mystic Tower Veda.
070	The Mystic Tower Veda...?!	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
071	Yes. It's quite the mysterious tower. When you go there some of your five senses stop working properly.
072	I guess you could say you feel strangely sharp.
073	What do people go there in search for?
074	The reasons vary, but to put it simply...there are those who go there because they want to discard or forget everything.
075	There are also supernaturalists there who have transcended to a state beyond human knowledge. All of them are fascinated by the tower.
076	After you left the city, Captain Othima...
077	The people who had gathered at Lost Blue became a band of mercenaries.
078	How come?
079	Who knows? They were just a group of uncooperative deviants who happened to be in the same place.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
080	That being said...they did work together as thieves to help support the town.
081	Are you saying that there's a chance that a portion of them were radicalized even further?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
082	It's not hard to consider, even if it's just a rumor...
083	I've even heard that the people of Lost Blue have contracts as assassins.
084	I can't believe there's such a place that offers sanctuary to sinners.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0021
085	Hey wait...I'd prefer if you didn't make outright assumptions like that.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1002
086	I told you that Lost Blue was a place where people who were forced out of their world gather, didn't I?
087	Amongst them there were those who had been removed from their world for innocent reasons.
088	There are others who had been saved by that place...like me.
089	You mean a part of it serves as the final basin that swoops up those who've lost their place in this world?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
090	Yes. In any case, it's not possible to ignore that many people with combative capabilities.
091	I think we need to rebuild our strategies based around the capabilities of those powers.
092	In the underground of the Slothstein area, a city called Lustburg exists, right?	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
093	It'll probably be a waste to send soldiers there.
094	They knew about me. In other words, they must be aware that I can figure out Lost Blue's location.
095	In other words, even if we entered there, we wouldn't be able to get information on the Templars?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
096	They're terrible at cooperating...but they look after their own.
097	Anyway, even if we were to get someone to talk...
098	There's no proof that they even exist so we wouldn't be able to determine any individual traits.
099	If it becomes a cat and mouse hunt, we'll just end up wasting soldiers that we could use elsewhere.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0030
100	It'll be more efficient to focus on Greed Dike's movements right now than to chase them when we don't even know their location.
101	Yeah. They should be accompanying Greed Dike in their quest to seize the next Sacred Stone anyway.
102	I believe we should take measures as soon as possible to protect the countries that haven't been attacked yet.
103	We were able to stop Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus from being stolen, but...	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
104	Envylia's Leviathan was rendered powerless.
105	Next they'll aim for Wratharis' Satna.
106	Or maybe Slothstein's Belphegor?
107	If they've received word about the Saga's Crystal Quartet Matter then there's a chance they may aim to obtain those.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0031
108	Either way, they could attack here at any point...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
109	No...I feel like they won't show up here in Northern Pride for a while.
110	Why?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
111	Judging from what Captain Kudan had been talking about...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0031
112	The Lion Monarch Orion's goal is to obtain the Alchemy Source that Nimul had.
113	Judging from that point...I believe that to be the Tower of Babel that Nimul is said to have created...
114	The tower that stands in the center of Northern Pride will be Greed Dike's final destination.
115	You're right. If that's the case, then the next place that Orion will head to would be...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0045
116	Neither Wratharis nor Slothstein, where the location of their Sacred Stones are uncertain...
117	Saga's Matter...?!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0027
118	I'm not sure. In the past, I might've made that assumption, but...	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
119	He did end up appearing in Envylia.
120	Huh? Orion is famous for fighting at the vanguard, you know?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_1047
121	That's why I assumed he would act counterintuitively. The fact that he hasn't done that surprised me.
122	Counterintuitively...that Lion Monarch Orion?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_chara_1013
123	Yes. Orion displays himself as brash and all action, but...
124	That's just one side of him. In fact...I believe he is actually a calm and excellent tactician.
125	Huh?! A tactician?!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0025
126	That was also my impression having encountered him face-to-face.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0004
127	Since you served under him, what do you think?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_chara_0009
128	Why do you think he chose to attack from the vanguard?
129	Most likely...it's because he obtained something that allows him to have an advantage.
130	The Veda Templars!	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
131	Yes. A tactitian's plans can often be predicted by another tactitian.
132	Because he knows that...Orion went out of his way to introduce a chaotic element into his assault.
133	To be honest, I have absolute no read on the Veda Templars.
134	That can't be. Are you sure you're not underestimating yourself?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0022
135	No. I'm certain of it.
136	That man is mad, but he is also a substantially superior tactician who is playing on a whole other level.
137	Meaning...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0042
138	If he is a tactician, then there is always the possibility that he would extend his reach to countries we might be less likely to consider.
139	It's not good for us to always be on the defensive. I believe it's best if we launch a pre-emptive act.
140	Understood. Captain Othima, please head with Basheeny to Wratharis.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0037
141	What about me?	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0001
142	You make your way to Saga.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
143	Just in case...it's important that Seida remains in Northern Pride so that she can utilize her ability to read over a wide terrain.
144	In that case...I guess I should head to Slothstein?	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
145	Yes. If there are no problems there then make your way to Saga and rendezvous with Kagura.
146	Kagura, Captain Yauras...please look after Saga.	VO_caida.caida_sys_0035
147	Don't worry. Leave it to us. All right then...now that everything's been decided on, we've got no time to waste!	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0004
148	Wait! Everyone...before you leave, please promise me one thing.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0018
149	Promise what?
150	Please promise me that you will come back here alive.	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_sys_0004
151	Huh? What's all that about? Don't be so dramatic.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0012
152	She's not being dramatic, especially after what happened with Captain Monzein.
153	In fact, it would be highly efficient for us to refocus our mental state right now.
154	We need to recognize just how formidable our enemy is. We can make it a lighthearted promise for now.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
155	Yes. Come now. Everyone, let's raise our weapons.	VO_kagura_3s_kagu.kagura_sys_0005
156	Okay.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
157	Not exactly a fancy farewell.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0010
158	Usually, these kind of feelings should be buried deep inside one's heart, you know? But...	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0016
159	I...will accept Monzein's unrefined determination.
160	I promise to prevent any further advancement of Greed Dike's army.	VO_yaurasu.yaurasu_sys_0017
161	Me too! I will not let Captain Monzein's death go to waste!	VO_basini.basini_sys_1019
162	It's okay. Captain Monzein's soul continues to live within all of us!	VO_caida.caida_sys_0004
163	For the sake of the ambitious Captain Monzein, we will not be beaten!
164	Of course. I can just imagine what he would say if I were taken down.
165	I promise to return alive.
166	Thank you, everyone! For the sake of Captain Zain and Captain Monzein as well...	VO_kanon_3s_cano.kanon_battle_0018
167	We will shatter the ambitions of the Lion Monarch with our own hands!!!
168	The Holy Guard have successfully driven off Greed Dike from their occupation of Envylia and Lustburg.
169	However...Envylia's Sacred Stone Leviathan has lost its power and Captain Monzein of the Second Order has died.
170	They had suffered too great a sacrifice to smile.
171	Meanwhile, the threat of Greed Dike continues to grow, led by the determination of one man...
172	This threat will later be talked about through the ages as the largest ever to have arisen in the continent of Babel...
173	This is the memory of the mad monarch bearing the name Lion. And of the great war he began that would overturn the laws of this world.
174	THE ALCHEMIST CODE
175	Sacred Stone Memories -The Destiny Harbored by the Lion Monarch-
176	We will soon enter the territory of Wratharis. Be a wee bit careful now of your surroundings.
177	Understood. Captain Othima, do you really think Greed Dike will show up?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0005
178	We'll have to see. More importantly, there's something I want to ask you.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0031
179	Is it about the battle we fought in Envylia?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
180	No... Do you have a favorite food or something?	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
181	Huh? A favorite...? Why?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0012
182	It's a very important matter. The more specific you can be the better. Can you tell me?
183	Um...okay! Ah, let me see...hmm...maybe...Melpoto mushroom stew?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
184	I see. Nice. Very useful. I'll make it for you sometime soon.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0044
185	Huh? Th-thank you. Um, what is this?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
186	Oh, nothing. It's just you're a tricky one to pin down, so I wanted to know what kind of things you liked.	VO_ortima.ortima_chara_1011
187	Huh?
188	I want to get along with you. You know...since the old man died, I realized I'm the only man out of all the captains.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0020
189	...Ah...
190	On top of that, all the captains are strong-willed women...so I thought you might be a little lonely.
191	Honestly...Greed Dike really messed things up for us.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0030
192	Orion needs a real good kick in the pants for having caused this situation.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0004
193	Yeah... We need to properly lay them to waste.
194	I'll assist you with everything that I've got. It's payback time for what they did to the General.
195	General...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
196	I'm talking about Captain Zain. They corrupted Captain Kudanstein...and drove Captain Zain to his death.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_battle_0022
197	After what they...what they did to the General who looked after me...! I'll do it...!
198	Good. Your assistance shines like a beacon on the road of each land. It's indispensable. I'm counting on you, Kazahaya.
199	Yes! By the way, Captain Othima, there's one thing that I don't understand.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0037
200	What is it?
201	They tried relentlessly to steal Envylia's Sacred Stone, but...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
202	Why did they give up so easily when it came to Lustburg's Sacred Stone?
203	Given their mentality, it's hard to imagine they'd give up until they managed to take it.
204	I feel like the hint may lie in the words "balance of power in this world."
205	Balance of power...?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
206	Yes. By disrupting the balance of power in this world, it will bring about the appearance of the Alchemy Source.
207	Since that's what Orion thinks, his goal is not to obtain all the Sacred Stones.
208	As long as he can disrupt the balance of this world, I think he believes that's enough.
209	I see...	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0044
210	Lustburg's Sacred Stone Asmodeus is kept stored in a special way.
211	It's enshrined high up in the sky, making it difficult to get ahold of.
212	Maybe Orion determined that he didn't have enough time to waste on trying to obtain it.
213	So you think he'll only steal it if it's realistic?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
214	Yes. I think so. Lustburg's invasion was more for show.
215	Most likely, he wanted to cause the Holy Guard to disperse.
216	He also wanted to lure out Seida, who is rumored to hold the Sacred Stone of Gluttony Foss. I believe that was his true motive.
217	I see...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
218	Then that means there's a chance he might not invade Wratharis and Slothstein as the location of their Sacred Stones are unknown...
219	Right.	VO_ortima.ortima_sys_0004
220	Then the Sacred Stone that is definitely in Northern Pride...	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
221	And, if he has received information regarding it, the other alternative would be Matter in the Saga region.
222	Don't you think he's moving towards either one of those?
223	If that's the case, why send soldiers to Wratharis and Slothstein as well? What about heading to Saga?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0031
224	To be honest, I half-suspected there was more to his moves than simple wastefulness.
225	...but it appears he just likes to play games.
226	Huh?	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0025
227	Be careful. It looks like they're going to engage with no questions asked.
228	Greed Dike soldiers? When did they get here?!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0025
229	Who knows? I'll give them hell for depriving me of the lunch that I was supposed to eat.	VO_ortima.ortima_battle_0030
