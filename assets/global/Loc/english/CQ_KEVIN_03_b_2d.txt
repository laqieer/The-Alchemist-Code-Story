001	Let's get out of here!
002	(To think there are those so lacking in character that they would come to care only for their own profit...)
003	(Much like him... For some guy like him, Mother had to... If only I had the power I have today, back then...)
004	...
005	Is everything all right?
006	I was just...thinking.
007	When Mother was working so hard on her own... Had I been stronger back then, I could have been there for her.
008	Being strong now only benefits my father.
009	Then what was the point in growing strong? Why did I want to...?
010	...
011	What the...? This is a...white rock?
012	This is milky quartz. I believe this is the stone for you.
013	Milky quartz, huh? Weird. I feel warm and calmed just by looking at it.
014	...
015	(This feels like...)
016	Mother... She was tougher and gentler than anybody else, and always so much busier.
017	Still, she always found the strength to smile for me when she noticed I was around.
018	What's the matter, sweetie? People won't notice how handsome you are if you're always frowning. Now, smile on the count of three. One, two, threeee!
019	There you go! Kevin, you're going to be so popular with the ladies when you grow up if you keep that up!
020	I'm sure you're going to meet so many wonderful people. I hope that you'll grow up strong enough to protect the ones you love.
021	But even more than that, I truly hope that you'll be happy. Do you think you can do all that for me?
022	Mother was such a strong person. I just wanted to be at least as strong as she was.
023	I wanted to be able to make her smile in return, just like she did for me.
024	Ha... Hahaha! Come to think of it, I was already too late to fulfill my dream when I started my apprenticeship!
025	You can hear the voices of precious stones, right? Can you tell me what this one is saying?
026	Tell me... What should I do?
027	...
028	The stones will not tell you something simply because you want them to.
029	It is up to you to make your own choices.
030	...
031	Gems can protect and support people, but it is up to the person to make the final decision.
032	Gems simply shine brighter to support that decision.
033	I...
034	I'm sure you're going to meet so many wonderful people. I hope that you'll grow up strong enough to protect the ones you love.
035	But even more than that, I truly hope that you'll be happy. Do you think you can do all that for me?
036	...
037	That's right... The decision has already been made in my heart.
038	I'd be a fool to use my power for the sake of such an egocentric man.
039	So...
040	Well... Now that I have power beyond that of an average man, I guess my next step is to go on a journey to discover my purpose for wielding it.
041	I see. That sounds like a wonderful idea.
042	...
043	Hello?
044	Ah! Ahem! Uh, i-it's nothing!
045	(She's beautiful...)
046	(I never knew a woman's smile could warm my heart so...)
047	(If I can no longer bring a smile to my mother's lips, then instead I'll make every other woman in this world smile!)
048	(That's what I'll fight for!)
049	(Your apprentice seems to be doing just fine, Birgitta.)
050	(I was curious when you told me you needed a favor from me since I was headed to Wratharis, but...)
051	(You can be such a troublesome soothsayer. Why couldn't you simply come give him advice yourself if you were so worried?)
052	(Well, I suppose I should consider myself lucky for being able to see a rare, caring side of her.)
053	Oh, my. Would you look at the time.
054	I have a carriage waiting on me to take me to my client. If you'll excuse me, I will take my leave.
055	What?! H-hey, wait a minute!
056	She's gone... What a wonderful person. Like a well-cut jewel, she was so elegant, proud, and dignified.
057	Ah! No! I forgot to get her name!
058	Wait! Stop the cart! Please! Tell me your name!
059	Too late... I didn't even get a chance to show my gratitude.
060	I hope I'll get to see her again.
061	No! I will see her again! I must! I just decided to make every woman smile!
062	By the time you see me again, I will be such a refined man.
063	I promise you, I will bring the brightest smile to your lips!
