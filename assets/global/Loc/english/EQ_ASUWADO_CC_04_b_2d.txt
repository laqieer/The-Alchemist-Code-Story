001	What are you doing here?	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0001
002	I'm slacking off, obviously. The vice-captain can handle anything that comes up in my absence.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
003	I just felt like taking things slow for a bit, away from the guild...
004	And I was rather hoping to run into someone like you.
005	I've confirmed the passing of the client. The mission has been rescinded. So I have no reason to harm you anymore.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0029
006	Carrying out a mission after its cancellation is strictly prohibited.
007	Sure, sure. Doesn't mean another assassin won't come after me, though, does it?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
008	I can't exactly put a whole lot of stock in your infallible creed at this point.
009	But having someone chase after me all the time is kind of a welcome nuisance, in a way.
010	I see. You've distanced yourself from the guild so you can confront any would-be assassins on your own. You don't want the others involved.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0044
011	Why, though? Why would you go to such lengths for your group?
012	Because we all worked so hard together to make it what it is today.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0016
013	I can't allow anyone to do anything that would bring harm to it. It means too much to me for that.
014	You, of all people, should understand what it's like to have a place where you feel like you really belong, that you don't want to see anyone else mess with.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0001
015	...
016	I can't say I particularly approve of Zalam Gaim snatching up orphans and raising them as assassins...
017	But there's a very high probability that if they didn't, those kids wouldn't survive out on the streets. So I have absolutely no doubt that Zalam Gaim saved your lives.	VO_ryle.ryle_battle_0020
018	...
019	And, to be fair, a lot of assassinations serve the greater good, snuffing out huge conflicts before they have a chance to get out of control.
020	Bottom line, I can't say I like what you're about...but I don't exactly feel like taking you down would be much of a net gain for anyone, either.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0002
021	So, yeah. If your organization suddenly collapsed on us, it would certainly be convenient in the short term, but in the long run? Though I guess it's not so much "if" anymore, but "when."
022	I mean, any organization willing to abandon all the trust and honor it's built up over the years for the sake of making some shady profit isn't exactly standing on stable ground, right?	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
023	Trust and honor...
024	"Zalam Gaim is a dark cult of extremist murderers who follow a twisted doctrine, but it's because of their reliance on this doctrine that they can be trusted to follow through with assassination requests."	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0004
025	That's what people are taught about you. That creed of yours is your strong point. It's what sets you apart from roving gangs and the like.
026	Not sure if that's what your founder was going for, exactly, but it's definitely something!	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0010
027	...
028	You, children who dwell in the shadow of death, have no place to live but here. Surrender to our doctrine, and put your faith in death itself.
029	And as long as you heed our teachings, Zalam Gaim will be a place you can come back to—a place you can call home.
030	As members of this organization, you must submit yourself to these stringent doctrines, which include a respect for and acceptance of the sanctity and immutability of death.
031	If you choose to accept our creed, you must also accept the reckoning of death when it inevitably comes for you.
032	"Extremist murderers who follow a twisted doctrine," huh? Frankly, I think that's spot-on. If I weren't a part of that group myself, I'm sure that's how I'd see us too.	VO_aswad.aswad_sys_0045
033	(That twisted doctrine has kept us going for a long time now, though. And given a whole lot of orphans a new lease on life.)
034	And as long as you heed our teachings, Zalam Gaim will be a place you can come back to—a place you can call home.
035	...	VO_aswad.aswad_battle_0019
036	(That being the case, I should do whatever I can to support the order's continued existence...which means I'm going to need to—)
037	Hmm? Looks like someone's heading our way.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0006
038	Lady Najam!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
039	Sakani? What's the situation?
040	They're on the move! I've been observing Dahab, just as you instructed. He and his followers have begun to gather an excessively large number of assassins.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0029
041	They intend to kill the Desert Wings' guild captain...to kill Ryle. And they're not wasting any time, so chances are they'll be here any moment now.
