001	But...it's too dangerous for just the two of you to go alone! Both of you know that the Jam are growing stronger, right?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
002	Moreover, their numbers are increasing rapidly as well. Can't I go along as well?!
003	Asena's forest must not be intruded with great numbers... That has been defined in the law as well.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0039
004	Just like the Ritual of Baptism.
005	But...they have the trial to worry about as well! For starters, what even is this "one's own darkness" business?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
006	All humans have a darkness within them. If you cannot defeat this darkness when it takes on a shape of its own, then Asena will not acknowledge you.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
007	You wish to resurrect the Wind Matter, correct?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
008	Then, of course, you should gain Asena's acceptance and obtain a token.
009	All the more reason why I should go too...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
010	There is no need for a foreigner to intrude. This trial is to be faced only by one of Saga. It is a task for these two alone.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0014
011	But...what if something were to happen to the two of them?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0020
012	You wish to save Saga? One who falls by the wayside cannot speak of the future.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0030
013	Very well. Mocca and I will head to Asena. We will obtain a token at all costs!	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
014	And we will have you attend the Sprite Trio Discourse! After all, I have sworn to protect the future of Saga.
015	Well then. I look forward to seeing whether or not you possess the ability to deliver on your promise.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
016	It's late now. It will be better for the two of you to depart in the morning. Let us all rest for today.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0022
017	Tina...Mocca...are you really okay? Isn't there something I can do to help?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_2048
018	Hehe. Thank you, Lisbeth. Sorry to have gotten you involved in this, but this is a problem for those of Saga to deal with. We can't get you involved any further.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
019	Lisbeth, please look after things while we're gone. The way things are now with the Jam, we cannot let our guard down. And we've promised to protect the village.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
020	There's no need for you to worry. I'll protect this village. The two of you should focus on protecting your own lives.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
021	We'll do so. We'll do whatever we can to retrieve a token from Asena and return here.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0005
022	However, what exactly is a token?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
023	I know! Fuu, when you became a Sprite, you obtained a token, didn't you?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1007
024	Yes. It's called Asena's Tear.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
025	Asena's Tear...?! What is it to be exact?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
026	It is something given to only those who overcome the trial and are acknowledged by Asena.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
027	That one tear alone contains an overwhelming amount of Ouija.
028	And we must pass the trial to obtain one.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
029	Indeed. However, I am not certain whether your power is enough to pass the trial...	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0004
030	Only those who display power appropriate to become a Sprite can obtain one of Asena's Tears.
031	And the defeating of "one's own darkness" that Tehre spoke of...?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0002
032	It is forbidden by law to speak of it. However, there is just one thing I can say to the two of you...don't allow yourself to be consumed by it. That is all.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0035
033	That's it; I'm going! I can't allow just the two of them to go somewhere so dangerous!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_battle_0021
034	No...Tehre is right. This is something that Mocca and I, who are natives of Saga, must overcome. Don't you agree, Mocca?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1002
035	Yes. Of course. Lisbeth, please take care of matters here while we're gone.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
036	But...!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0018
037	Please, trust us for now. We leave tomorrow morning... Tina and I will bring back this token at all costs!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
038	For that reason, let's finish patrolling and rest early.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
