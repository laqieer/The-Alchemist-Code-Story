001	Now would be a good time for any last words.
002	What happened to you?
003	The Rox I knew wouldn't...
004	Well, you're mistaken.
005	Goodbye, whoever you are.
006	The figure on the floor stops moving abruptly, then flickers out of existence, leaving behind a glistening array of particles.
007	What?
008	Huh. Not half bad.
009	The Doktor sure has a weird fascination with this stuff, but so long as it gets the job done.
010	You mean these are...
011	Holograms. Or some clever machination.
012	What matters is that you took them down anyway.
013	...Just doing my job.
014	Good to know.
015	Report back to headquarters. I'm going to check on a few more things.
016	All right.
017	Day after day I lived in this strange routine.
018	An endless array of tests, physical and mental...
019	I don't have much time to myself to think. It hurts to think, anyway.
020	All I remember is waking up on a cold table, being told I was graciously plucked from the throes of death at the behest of one "Director"...
021	...And that whoever I had once stood with were led astray by this mysterious boy named Soren.
022	This city was to be the battlefield upon which my debts would be repaid.
023	Sometimes, if I concentrate, I can feel the ghost of my past walking these very streets.
024	The faint clacks of heels upon the city I...she so loved.
025	Who was Roxanne before all this? Did it matter?
026	...But I suppose there's not much point dwelling on these.
027	I should get back.
028	Looks like the coast is clear.
029	All right. Guess this is my best shot at getting in.
030	...!
031	(Wasn't that one of the holograms? I thought I cleared them all out.)
032	(And why did he make such a strange expression...?)
