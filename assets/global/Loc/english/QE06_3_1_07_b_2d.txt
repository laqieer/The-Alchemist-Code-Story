001	What?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0027
002	As long as we're here in Wadatsumi, your experiment will fail. We'll make sure of it.	VO_celis.celis_sys_0010
003	We, the demon slayers of the Blade Fox Corps!
004	Jubei! Former Captain of the Blade Fox Corps Second Squad, and legitimate heir to the Black Star... Were you not dismissed from the group?!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0031
005	I was. But that doesn't change what needs to be done here.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
006	Jubei...
007	I must apologize again for the grave offense I committed, and for the years of dishonor I brought upon the Blade Fox.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0035
008	What have you been doing all this time?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0001
009	Something seemed off about the demons' movements, so I decided to break away from the Corps and investigate matters on my own.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0004
010	I thought if I found anything worthwhile, I could make myself useful to the Corps again. And to you, Lady Celis.
011	Jubei...
012	Besides, even having been expelled from the Blade Fox, I couldn't give up the fight. We don't just fight for the Corps, we fight for what's right. And that's something I still believe in.
013	I see. So you're the one who broke into the demons' castle.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0022
014	"We shall not allow ourselves to be blind to the plight of those who can be saved." That's one of the vows I swore back then, and I still believe in that, too.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0005
015	And I would've never known about Greed Dike's scheme and their connection to the demons if I'd stayed with Blade Fox all this time.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0003
016	Scheme? You mean, this madman's demon spawns?
017	No, there's more to it than that. I saw it with my own eyes. Greed Dike...
018	Greed Dike has been supplying food to the demons.
019	Food? What do you mean?	VO_celis.celis_sys_0025
020	We're being made obsolete. If the demons no longer need to eat humans to survive, then what purpose do humans even serve in their world?	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0016
021	With no need to hunt us anymore, they're just planning to eliminate all humans from Wadatsumi in one fell swoop.
022	!!!
023	You have become a variable as well, it seems. You should have stayed quiet.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0030
024	But now you see, don't you? With the completion of the Dismortants and a food source other than humans at the ready...
025	Humans and the Blade Fox alike no longer have any place in this land!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
026	...!
027	So, shall we make this the end of our little chat? No matter how much you may resist, the Blade Fox are destined to be destroyed.
028	You fiend!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
029	I commend you, Blade Fox. You've fulfilled your duties well. But now, it's time for you to rest.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
030	Farewell...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
