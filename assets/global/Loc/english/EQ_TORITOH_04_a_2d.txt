001	Commander Kanon is alive? Here?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0021
002	Yes, there's no mistake. I've seen and felt various hints of her presence.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0037
003	I don't know why she came here when she was still alive. I wonder if...Lucifer took her?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
004	Or, perhaps it was the power of Lucifier's Pride, or something else that I don't know about; something that defies reason.
005	Wait a moment. Even if we were to return Commander Kanon back to the other world—
006	Obviously, we don't know what will happen, but whatever it is, it's better than leaving her locked in this world.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0037
007	I know for a fact that her soul will never give in, but...
008	I don't know if she can put up with the pain of this place. I have to get her out as soon as possible.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0027
009	What about you, then? Isn't it just as painful for you?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0001
010	I've already decided that I'll put up with anything just for the chance to see her again.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
011	Lakina...
012	I want to free Kanon from this world as quickly as possible, so please... Lend me your strength.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0018
013	What would you have me do, exactly?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
014	I think we need to get to Lucifer's core.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0002
015	We're going to go there and suppress Lucifer's power. If we do that, we can turn the tables.
016	We'll use that power to get Commander Kanon out of this world?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0045
017	Yes. We'll use it to rip a hole in this place, and in that moment, return Kanon to the other world.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0005
018	This all seems a bit...reckless.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0030
019	And yet you still choose to hear what I have to say.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
020	Toritoh, have you ever been saved by anyone?
021	Yes...	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0006
022	Then I think you should understand this feeling.
023	I had given up on ever seeing her again.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0039
024	Huh?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0004
025	For a long, long time, I sorted and purified souls that shouldn't have become phantoms in the first place.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0030
026	I thought that if I waited just a bit longer, if I held on just a bit more...then I could see Kanon again.
027	Slowly, my heart started to break more and more, and, honestly, I felt it was on the verge of breaking in two...	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0029
028	But the instant I felt her Alchemia, all of that pain was gone.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
029	The moment I thought that maybe I could see the one friend I've made in my lifetime again...I realized I wanted to keep living.
030	I would fight for her sake. That is my conviction.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0050
031	Conviction...hmm?	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
032	So what if it's dangerous? So what if it's hard? Am I going to give up because it seems reckless to try?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0005
033	Absolutely not. If it means I can meet her again, then compared to that, everything else is insignificant.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
034	She saved me, so there's nothing I wouldn't do for her.
035	However my actions might affect the world, I'll do what I must, regardless.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0002
036	Their own way of...? Who cares about that?! I'm not gonna let them get away with this!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0017
037	(You sound a lot like him, Lakina.)	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0022
038	(No matter what I say, neither of you ever bend. She still has her convictions, after all.)	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0008
039	In good times, in bad times... Joy, pain, shame... The maelstrom doesn't discriminate.	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0037
040	It's not all bad. The maelstrom is how humans find the strength and determination to keep moving forward.
041	(Edgar... So this is determination. I finally understand!)	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0007
042	Toritoh?	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0001
043	You have my sword, Lakina.
044	I won't let go of my soul, even if my enemy is Lucifer.	VO_tlitor.tlitor_sys_0003
045	Thank you, Toritoh.	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0033
046	We can't stop here!	VO_lakinna.lakinna_sys_0007
047	Our goal is Lucifer's core!
