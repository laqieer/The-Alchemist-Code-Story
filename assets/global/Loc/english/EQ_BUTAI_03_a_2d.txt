001	Kuza, it was just as you said.
002	Of course. I know him well.
003	All that is left to do is to bring him to our side. Heh. This is quite entertaining.
004	Having Kudanstein on our side would further ensure the success of my conquest.
005	Even if he chooses to reject our offer, that simply leaves us with a good opportunity to crush the Holy Guard. You are a clever one, Kuza.
006	Hm.
007	Keep up the good work.
008	Kuza... I know that one of the terms of our alliance was that you could try for my life at any time, but honestly. Don't you think it's time you let it go?
009	Tch...
010	I...failed. Even with everything on the line.
011	It was not a bad attempt. You are indeed very clever, and quite skilled.
012	Just kill me.
013	Your talents would be of great use to me.
014	I'd rather die than help you!
015	Did you not say that you wanted to protect Wadatsumi?
016	It's...the only home I've ever known.
017	I may still allow you to do so.
113	What?!
114	Wadatsumi has fallen. It is inevitable. There can no changing what is to come.
115	My path of conquest would have brought this fate upon Wadatsumi sooner or later. I accept your resentment without reserve.
116	...
117	But know that Greed Dike acts only upon this unwavering code: strength is justice. The only thing you can trust in this world is the strength that you yourself have cultivated.
118	I will build a world in which the complacent weak are removed and only the strong are tolerated. The true irrationality of this world is when the efforts of those who strive are neglected and left to go to waste.
119	I cannot sympathize with you.
120	You must have some memory that resonates with this. You must feel some of that anger shared by all ambitious people who have been dragged down by the weak.
121	...
122	It is natural for the strong to prey upon the weak. Is that not obvious?
123	Had Wadatsumi been strong, it would not have fallen. Now you can ensure that it never will again.
124	What did you say?
125	You will give Wadatsumi strength! I will allow you to do this under Greed Dike's rule.
018	So then, if I can best you, that would make me righteous?
019	Hahahahahaha! Indeed, that would be true! I will grant you the opportunity to exact your revenge upon me as you desire.
020	Of course, it remains an impossible endeavor.
021	How can I know unless I try?
022	That's the spirit. So, will you serve me?
023	...
024	Place your trust in my strength, for it is the true justice! Then you shall have all that you desire within your grasp!
025	That sharp glare of yours... You do not change.
026	...
027	When all of this is over, I will grant you the position of Wadatsumi's governor. If you serve me well, that is.
028	You don't have to remind me.
029	Does he seem useful?
030	If he's not, I'll crush him. That's all there is to it.
031	How responsible of you.
032	I will not let anything or anyone stand in my way.
033	...
034	Why...? You swore to defend Wadatsumi! What are you playing at?!
035	Kuza...
036	Please, wait!
037	There is nothing more to be said. Your mission ends here.
038	I know that I am no longer bound to this world, but is it so unreasonable for me to want to know the truth?
039	It's all for Wadatsumi. All of it. Always.
040	How is turning to Orion and endangering the lives of our people supposed to be good for Wadatsumi?
041	...
042	Tell me. How can transmuting their lives into Philosopher's Stones be good for Wadatsumi?!
043	Kuza!
044	You've played your part. Put Kagura in the dungeon and go.
045	Kuza...
046	There's no turning back for me now.
047	We have received word from Orion. He said to meet him at the Wadatsumi ruins by sundown tomorrow. He said that he will execute Kagura if everybody is not there.
048	What?!
049	He also said that it is time Greed Dike and the Holy Guard made clear whose idea of justice is truly righteous.
050	Why Kagura?
051	He's trying to set an example. To show everyone that this is the fate of those who stand against Greed Dike.
052	Tch! That despicable monster!
053	Seeing as how he wants all of us there, he probably intends to annihilate the Holy Guard.
054	We must be quite a thorn in Orion's side. I'd be flattered if I wasn't so offended that he thinks he can take us all out so easily.
055	He may try to force me to reveal the location of the Sacred Stone.
056	Well, what are we waiting for? Let us go rescue Kagura!
057	...
058	What are you doing, Kudan?! We cannot leave Kagura to such a fate!
059	I...couldn't protect her.
060	Kudan!
061	Hold it, old man. Hey, Kudan. Listen. I understand how you feel, but we have to do what we can here.
062	...
063	The Demonic Spearman we all know and love isn't someone so easily disheartened. Or at least, I didn't think he was.
064	Well, call on us when you're ready, but...just keep in mind we're pressed for time. I trust you'll come through, Captain Kudan.
065	Will you...give me some time alone, please?
066	As long as you don't forget that you're never truly alone.
067	Was I...wrong? Have I not made any progress since that day?
068	The strong devour the weak... Kuza, is the path you have chosen the right one?
069	Then... Then what was the meaning of the oath we swore?! Won't somebody tell me that? Please!
070	...
071	I said I wanted to be alone.
072	Captain Kudan, did you gain the power of darkness just to brood?
073	What did you say?!
074	I mean, to me, it seemed like you took hold of that power in order to protect something. That's why I took an interest in you.
075	Even I can tell that it wasn't so you could sit here in the dark, being all gloomy.
076	You...!
077	What would you know?!
078	I...don't have anything. So I've always envied you.
079	What are you talking about?!
080	Are we not going? We can't mobilize if you don't give the order.
081	Why...are you saying all of this?
082	I just believe it's what she would have said.
083	Who do you...?
084	Let's go, Captain Kudan! There's nothing we can do for Kagura sitting around here!
085	Kanon...
086	I'm gonna show Orion what's what! It's time for our justice to shine!
087	...
088	His idea of justice is wrong! You always said you'd make a world where the weak are no longer exploited!
089	That is the justice I believe in. That is the justice Captain Cadanova entrusted to me.
090	So I know you're not mistaken, Captain Kudan!
091	What do you know about anything?!
092	I know enough! She's my friend, too! You're not the only one who cares about her, you know!
093	Would the righteous just sit here and let this happen?! Wouldn't that only be affirming Orion's justice?!
094	The Captain Kudan I know is much stronger than that! So let's go!
095	Why are you doing this?
096	I just feel like I need to support you like Kagura always does. Besides, I don't like seeing either of you sad.
097	I fight to make the world full of smiles. That's my justice!
098	Kanon...!
099	You're...a lot more than I ever expected. Impressive, in your own way.
100	And Basheeny! You're still too disrespectful to Captain Kudan.
101	But I appreciate what you came here to do. Good work!
102	Thank you.
103	We await your orders, Captain Kudan!
104	My...justice...
105	I...!
106	Kudanstein.
107	Let's go and face Orion.
108	The 4th Regiment will lead the operation to rescue Kagura. The rest of us will take the fight to Orion.
109	Well?
110	Captain Kudan?
111	Knights of the 4th Regiment! We're moving out!
112	Yes, sir!
