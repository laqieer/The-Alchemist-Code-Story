001	Don't you think it's time you told me your true intentions for willingly following me? What are you playing at?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0001
002	I simply wanted to reduce as many victims as possible—that's all.
003	Hmph. You mean to tell me for that reason alone you've allowed yourself to be captured by your enemies?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
004	I thought I told you that you aren't my enemy. I also originate from Wratharis.
005	That's right. Then, tell me this. Why do you not harbor resentment towards Envylia?
006	Envylia destroyed Wratharis, our homeland.
007	Nothing is born out of resentment and anger.
008	How can you tell yourself that?	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0007
009	You must be aware of the massacre that occurred at the Dawn of Wrath, where Wratharis was destroyed.
010	Zeke, Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, the man you call your father... He was the one who slaughtered your true family, you know?
011	No! My father would never do something so outrageous!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0043
012	He was merely a representative of Envylia in the Alliance of Kingdoms where they fought together with the Holy Guard.
013	That's the same thing.
014	Even if he did not get his hands dirty, he must have been in a position where he could have prevented what occurred.
015	The fact of the matter is that he was complicit in the massacre of your true family.
016	Don't turn a blind eye to reality. The man you call your father happily watched as the people of Wratharis were massacred.
017	No, that's not true!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0027
018	To this day, my father regrets that he was unable to prevent that tragedy!
019	"The enemy's people, too, are the victims of this sorrowful conflict."
020	This is something my father repeats daily!
021	When we as humans resent and hurt each other, it only causes us further pain and suffering!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0018
022	As Agatha shouts this, tears blur her vision.
023	Hmph. You make me laugh. Whatever the case, the past cannot be overturned.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0010
024	Your words do not change the fact that Envylia destroyed Wratharis.
025	Lord Sabareta! The Philosopher's Stones have been gathered!
026	Very well. My apologies, but the time for talk has ended.	VO_sabaleta.sabaleta_sys_0037
027	Philosopher's Stones?! What are you planning to do?!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0025
028	I plan to use the Demon to purify this unclean world. I will show you a new reality.
029	Demon? Wait, you're not speaking about the ancient weapon, are you?!
030	So, that's what you were excavating in the Gilrack Ruins after all!
031	Confine this woman to one of the prison cells.
032	Agatha, who has approached Sabareta, is forcibly pulled away by the Lizard Brigade. Still, she continues to speak.
033	!!!	VO_agasa.agasa_sys_0043
034	No! The Demon is the weapon that brought about the demise of ancient Babel!
035	You can't! Please, Sabareta! Re-think your decision!
036	Keep praying your useless prayers, Sister Agatha, under the Wrath-filled sky of Wratharis.
037	Smiling fearlessly, Sabareta walks away, leaving Agatha behind.
038	Sabareta, wait! No!!!
