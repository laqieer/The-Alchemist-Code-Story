001	...So that's everything we know.
002	The delivery person was attacked by a monster!? That's terrible!	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0012
003	But they weren't hurt. They just had their packages stolen.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0045
004	Hmm, well it's certainly strange. A monster attacking someone not for food, but for holiday decorations?	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0031
005	No kidding... The packages just had the decorations, some ornaments, and other holiday stuff. What interest would a monster have in things like that?	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0006
006	...
007	...What is it, Rochelle?
008	!	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0025
009	What's wrong? You're just staring into space. Are you upset about the decorations?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0005
010	Don't feel bad. It's not your fault. Besides, there's nothing we can do about it anymore.
011	...
012	Or...is it something else? You know you can tell me anything, right?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0002
013	It's just...
014	...nothing.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0004
015	Come on, don't give me that. I can tell when something's bothering you.
016	You worry too much. I'm fine. Really. Besides, our mission is going fine. There's nothing wrong.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0029
017	...
018	Ishi?	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0006
019	...You just won't tell me anything, will you?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0001
020	I...	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0019
021	...Forget it.
022	...
023	Hey, it looks like the festivities are beginning. 	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0003
024	Yeah, the snow sculpture contest should be starting soon... 
025	Speaking of which, do you think that man ever finished his sculpture?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0031
026	I wonder...
027	Hey! Security!!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
028	! W-what's wrong!?	VO_isyuna.isyuna_sys_0025
029	Have you seen my son!?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0035
030	I-I was so intent on finishing the sculpture before the deadline.
031	But then when I looked up, he was gone!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
032	What!? Oh no! Where could he have gone...
033	He special ordered the decorations from a famous craftsman who lives in the forest. "I'll make the perfect snow sculpture! Just you watch!" he said...
034	...! You don't think...he went looking for the decorations too?	VO_lavina.lavina_battle_0019
035	What!? Oh no... He could be out there all alone!
036	Actually... I did see a boy in a red coat heading out toward the forest...
037	Oh no! This is bad.	VO_isyuna.isyuna_battle_0021
038	No way... He could be in real trouble! There are monsters and beasts in the forest. And that delivery person was just attacked...	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0021
039	! I have to go after him!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
040	It's too dangerous to go alone. I'll go with you.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0002
041	Then I'll go too--
042	No, you should stay here and stand guard, Ishi. We can't abandon our duty.
043	I can look after both parent and child. Black and white bears are strong, you know.	VO_rachel.rachel_battle_0015
044	Besides, I was the one who started looking for the decorations. So I want to be the one to see it through to the end.
045	Rochelle...
046	Then let me go, at least. I was there with you from the start. I want to see this through too.	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0003
047	That boy must feel so lost and alone right now. Please bring him back safe...
048	Sounds like we can leave it to the two of them, Ishuna.	VO_lotia.lotia_sys_0004
049	...All right. We'll look after things here, and you two go find that boy. No distractions. Come right back once you've found him.
050	We will. Ok, let's get going.	VO_rachel.rachel_sys_0038
051	We've come pretty far into the forest, but there's still no sign of him...	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0031
052	...! Over there!
053	! Oh no, he's surrounded by monsters! We've got to save him!	VO_lavina.lavina_sys_0012
