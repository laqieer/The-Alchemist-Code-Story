001	Wow! This place is amazing!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0009
002	So many people and buildings! It's not like any of the villages I've seen before!	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0007
003	Yeah, but... This place is unusually crowded.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
004	Huh?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
005	The village we last visited was talking about how their young people were migrating to the cities... That is probably why. The prices of goods are incredibly high as well. I wonder if it is because trade has gone stagnant?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
006	Must be the effects of the civil war.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
007	Um... If you don't mind me asking...	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0001
008	Yes?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
009	What do you do, Mister? You don't seem to be a trader, but you know so much.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0002
010	I guess you could call me a traveling fortune-teller.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
011	A fortune-teller?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_chara_1009
012	Yes. I am a diviner of everything from weather to business prospects, so I must be familiar with the inner workings of many different matters.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
013	I guess that makes sense.	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0031
014	We should find lodging for the night. While we're here, we can search for your—	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
015	Hey there, buddy. You seem like someone who's got money to burn!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0001
016	...
017	Do you know this person?	VO_hisham-b.hisham-b_sys_0027
018	Not at all. I doubt he is of your kin as well.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_chara_1003
019	Yo, yo, yo! Ignoring us? Really? Why you gotta be so rude?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
