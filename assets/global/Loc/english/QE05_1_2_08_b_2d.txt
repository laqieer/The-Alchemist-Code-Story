001	Ack, this woman is stronger than she looks!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0042
002	She's the former reigning champion of the Arena! We can't face her directly, we have to come together and—bfnh?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0012
003	Teona, over here!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
004	Kamui?! Th-thank you!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
005	She has allies?! Where are our reinforcements?!	VO_gluttony-y.gluttony-y_sys_0025
006	I think we've come far enough to lose our pursuers.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
007	Kamui... Thank you.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
008	It was nothing. More importantly, what are you doing here?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
009	I heard that General Ceclidis had come to the South. I came here to see it for my own eyes, but...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
010	Well, you saw what happened. I was able to see what I needed, but then they found me out.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0011
011	Erm, I don't mean to speak so frankly to a stranger, but...I don't think you're really suited to this kind of work.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0030
012	Well, I agree, but...Waginau was quite insistent. He said that there was a reason it had to be me.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0005
013	Are you sure he didn't just plant you here as a distraction?	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0016
014	A distraction? No... Could it be? Wait...	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
015	...
016	Wait, who are you? Kamui, who is this?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
017	A friend.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
018	My name is Isidore. It is a pleasure to meet the first champion of the Royal Arena.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0007
019	Oh! You know me! Please, call me Teona.	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
020	However, for you to be here...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
021	Yes. General Leordas is nearby, preparing for battle in one of our bases.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
022	Waginau took off on his own recently, but he has lent us the support of several Paladins.
023	In other words, this place is to become a battlefield.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0002
024	It's not set in stone or anything, but...the possibility of that is pretty high.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
025	In preparation, we have been secretly evacuating the nearby villages.
026	Miss Teona! Are you alright?!
027	Y-yes! I am!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
028	Excuse me, I must return to our main forces.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0035
029	Yikes. Seems like things are about to get fired up. Kamui, I have another favor to ask of you.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0022
030	No need to ask. I will go to the Chief immediately and let him know what is happening.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0004
031	Please. I will go to the warriors and make sure they are all on the alert.	VO_ishido.ishido_sys_0041
032	Chief, there is a matter which I believe requires your attention.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0003
033	Kamui? Come on in.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
034	Thank you, sir.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
035	What is this? You're out of breath. What in the world is happening?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
036	That is what I am here to tell you about.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
037	So the soldiers of both the North and the South are probing the area around the village, you say?	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
038	Our mirage barrier still stands strong, so I believe they have not yet discovered the village, but...I do not understand their actions.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0031
039	Last night, one of our wise women received a prophecy from the great Sephiron.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0004
040	From Sephiron? What kind of prophecy?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
041	That the Sacred Stone shall make this world its stage again within the next twenty-five years.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0037
042	How could that be? Despite the alliance of the seven kingdoms? What could cause someone to break the alliance?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
043	You must know already that the shadows for what is to come have been born during these days of "peace" under King Narol's rule.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0022
044	Yes. After all, the effects of the war have reached even our little hidden village.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
045	I have even heard reports of drought and deforestation, and even plague outside of the village.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0037
046	If the King were to die at this critical time, it is not unlikely that the next ruler would be willing to defy convention and natural law to gather power and influence.
047	The Sacred Stones are symbols of the righteous kings of this land. It is easy to see how someone might think Beelzebub will grant them the power of a king, and release its curse upon this land.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
048	Ultimately, the result will be the same, whoever releases the curse. Beelzebub's gluttonous power will overrun this country again.
049	We must prepare for its arrival.
050	Yes. It seems that the time we have left to prepare you as the Protector grows ever shorter. That must be our priority now.
051	Yes, sir.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
052	We will verify the purpose of the Royal Army here in these lands with King Narol. Go tell Isidore of this as well.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0001
053	I see...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0006
054	(For a wise woman to receive ill omens about the strange movements of the armies of Gluttony...)
055	What in the world is about to happen...?	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
