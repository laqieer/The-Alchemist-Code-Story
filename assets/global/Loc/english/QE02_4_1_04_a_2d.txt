001	Your way of thinking isn't wrong! Even if history will not accept it...we must find a way to live together as humans!
002	...!
003	You've learned nothing from your predecessors. What a fool.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0030
004	Shut up! If the Sacred Stones of this world were to be used properly, that should be possible as well!	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0016
005	After all, my master...that is, the Elester family were able to prove that it was possible within this country!
006	You speak of ideals. Seeing my country destroyed before my eyes, I realized what I believed in was nothing more than naive ideals.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
007	That's not true!
008	Yes...you might be right.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
009	Huh...?	VO_ethan.ethan_sys_0025
010	The young lady told me the same thing. She said that, if we don't give up, we can find a way to come together.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0022
011	I once pursued those naive ideals, but came to deny them after experiencing sorrow and tragedy...
012	It's taken a little too long, but that young lady finally hammered them back into my head. I'm ashamed to admit that I couldn't give her anything in return.
013	So you're discarding the lessons you learned through your tragedy because of the words of a mere girl?	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0017
014	I think I'm tired of deceiving myself.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
015	I've decided that I want to live those naive ideals after all.
016	Alvarez...I can't afford to hand you this Sacred Stone.
017	I see. It's quite unfortunate that we couldn't reach an understanding.	VO_alvarez.alvarez_sys_0044
018	Furthermore...I'd appreciate if you saved those words until after you've defeated my most prized droids.
019	What...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
020	Gu...giga...	VO_aj5000.aj5000_battle_0020
021	Looks like they've been manufactured to be incredibly tough.
022	Fine. I'll fight them for as long as it takes to make my naive ideal a reality!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0010
