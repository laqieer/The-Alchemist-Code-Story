001	Well done. It seems my faith in you was not misplaced. Despite being backed into a corner, you didn't give up. You chose to survive.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
002	It is no small thing to do so, to wake up every morning determined to carve your own space into the world.
003	However, you have done more than survive. You have thrived.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0007
004	It is good to see you again, Kamui, my last disciple.
005	Wh-what?! This cannot be real... Lord Waginau, you sacrificed yourself that day. For us!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0018
006	Ah, yes. That day, so long ago, the person I was sacrificed his own life. Yet, to me, death has been little more than a short reprieve.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
007	After I was given the Curse of Sin that day, my existence was carved into this world as a shadow.
008	Not entirely unlike yourself.
009	What are you talking about?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0027
010	Have you not realized, Kamui? You died that day as well.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
011	What?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0028
012	Are you serious? Look at him, he is clearly not dead. Are you sure you've got everything screwed on right? Are you drunk?	VO_karla.karla_sys_0013
013	A successor of the Sephira? Hm. Well, I have no use for you just now. Sleep.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0044
014	Huh? Urk!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0025
015	Carla!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
016	This is not the time to be worrying about someone else.	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0016
017	Is this your idea of justice, then?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0013
018	Excuse me?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0005
019	I'm asking you if hunting down the Sephira as the head of the Corpse, is the justice of the man who was once our Protector.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0017
020	You were the one who taught me that justice lies within one's own heart, and that the will to strictly discipline one's self, is the only way to restrain excessive power!
021	Yet, I look at you now...and not even traces of the man I once knew remain!
022	Justice? Ha. Justice?! Kamui, compassion has blinded you.	VO_waginao.waginao_chara_1012
023	What...?	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0012
024	Heal, protect, save... How many times have you done that already? Haven't you realized that it's not enough to redeem the sickness of humanity?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
025	You've lost it. That's all I can assume from what you're saying. You've completely lost your marbles!	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0020
026	Don't you see, Kamui?	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0022
027	No matter how much you pray, no matter how many you save, there will always be parts of the world that are shrouded in darkness.
028	When I taught you to be a Protector, what I showed you was only one face: Compassion.
029	It is time that I finally reveal the shadows I hid from you!	VO_waginao.waginao_sys_0010
030	The other face of Waginau, the immortal Protector: Power!
