001	Is that... the town up ahead?
002	Looks like it. My, it seems rather quaint.
003	The party head into town, finding merchants and shophouses lining the streets.
004	Huh. It's pretty lively. Wonder if they've got a booming trade center or something.
005	Let's get a place to stay while we're here.
006	Why, that woman again...! Is she stalking us or something?!
007	(Uh oh. Sieg...)
008	(I'm not dealing with this again...)
009	Hello. This is a rather strange place to meet, isn't it?
010	Not as strange as why the blazes you're following us around...
011	Pardon?
012	Nothing. Carry on.
013	If you say so. Work takes me everywhere, that's all.
014	Have you come to this town before?
015	Mm, yes. Such a tiny settlement on the outskirts, and yet oddly developed. A contradiction, is it not?
016	Yeah. We're pretty curious why. We're accompanying Teach on a research trip.
017	I see. Hmhm... I have heard snippets here and there from the merchants.
018	This town is under the patronage of a Greed Dike noble, who sought to expand his influence by investigating the local folk legends.
019	As part of his creed to protect the populace, he had security installed and the area well-supplied in case any threat was found.
020	Ah. That is an acceptably logical explanation for its apparent prosperity.
021	Indeed. Well, I do hope you enjoy your time here. It is a rather relaxing place to be, if I may say so myself.
022	What does everyone make of this?
023	I don't buy a single thing that comes out of her mouth.
024	I hope you're referring to that story about the noble and his "protection policy."
025	No matter how I look at it, something else definitely caught his attention.
026	Hmph. Men are all the same!
027	I'm going to book our rooms. Soren, you're coming with me!
028	Wouldn't want you catching his stupidity.
029	Huh? Me? W-wait!
030	Well, this ought to be a fun trip.
031	I have no idea what's going on...
