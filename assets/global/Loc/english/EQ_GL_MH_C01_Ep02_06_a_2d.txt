001	GROOOARRRR!!!
002	Arghhh!!!
003	So... this is the power of the Divine Protector...
004	(There's no doubt about it—this is a work of Alchemy! And it doesn't seem like the villagers know anything...)
005	(This Soren kid, though... The way he activated the golem was almost familiar somehow.)
006	Leave the village at once, trespassers! Or I will bring the Divine Protector's wrath upon you!
007	Grr...! It's going to take more than that to keep me from you!
008	B-but boss! That thing just squished the others like bugs!
009	Shut up, coward! Quit trembling in your boots and fight!
010	What...?
011	GRR... ROOOOAAARRR!
012	Soren!
013	No... The awakening was incomplete!
