001	Ah... Well, they're gone now. So the village has been completely invaded by the Royal Army...	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0030
002	At this rate...
003	Urgh?!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0020
004	W-wait! It's me!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0027
005	Teona? I thought you were with Isidore and the others.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
006	Oh! Isidore asked me to stay behind and help you evacuate.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0022
007	The other two have already met up with the main body of the Liberation Army.
008	I see. That is a relief to hear.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0037
009	Kamui, where is Lord Waginau?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
010	...
011	I...see.	VO_theona.theona_sys_0018
012	We should hurry and join the Liberation Army.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
013	I have been concerned ever since I saw them retreat. They should avoid staying so close to the Royal Army.
014	Huh? Why?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0006
015	What?! What are these strange monsters?! The same ones we saw at the altar?!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1010
016	The Jam! This must be why the Liberation Army retreated!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0027
017	Teona, be careful! Do not push yourself to fight them unless you must. If you touch them, they will imprint the curse upon you!	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0002
018	G-got it!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0027
019	B-but, then what should I do...?	VO_theona.theona_battle_0019
020	I'll clear a path for you using my powers of purification. However, they won't hold long against a hoard like this, so you'll have to hurry.	VO_kamui-b.kamui-b_sys_0017
021	Got it!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
