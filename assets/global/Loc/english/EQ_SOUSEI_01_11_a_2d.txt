001	Nngh! They just keep coming!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0042
002	I suppose Nimul and Waginau have already gone on ahead.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0031
003	Don't just stand there with your sword out! My Engineer Soldiers will catch up to them in no time, so hurry up and—	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0012
004	You go on ahead.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0039
005	Huh? What are you saying?!
006	They're going to need these soldiers if they are to reach the depths of this corrupted creature. You must go. Now, quickly!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0001
007	What about you?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0025
008	There are more enemies than I expected. If they were to damage the ship before we reached the dragon's core... Well, we would be in trouble, to say the least.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
009	So I will remain here, and deal with these beasts.
010	By yourself? That's crazy!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
011	You know, since coming to this region, I have forged a great many weapons, but have had little opportunity to test them.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
012	Go. You are needed elsewhere.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0002
013	Alright, already! But don't you go getting yourself killed, you old dog!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
014	Old...dog? Whatever.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0025
015	Now then...	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0030
016	Don't you think it's about time you showed yourself? Playing it safe really isn't like you at all.
017	Yna Ku. I see you persist in your futile struggle.
018	As I wander, the scenery might change, but my deeds will not.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0004
019	I forge steel, sharpen blades, and aim for the zenith of my art. There is simply nothing else I desire.
020	Fool. You are as sinful as they come.
021	Child of greed... You are unworthy of consideration. This spot will mark your grave!
022	Your blade is a trial I must overcome.	VO_kuienai.kuienai_sys_0010
023	Slave to the Almighty... I accept your challenge!	VO_kuienai.kuienai_battle_0015
