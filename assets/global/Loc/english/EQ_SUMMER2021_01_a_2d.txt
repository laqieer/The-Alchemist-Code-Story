001	Whoa! This ship's fast! No other pirate boat can keep up with this!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0044
002	Indeed. I wasn't sure how this private vessel would fare, but it demonstrates a fine use of magic.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
003	It's amazing! It was fortunate those on shore lent it to us, since they can't sail with all the pirates around.
004	We should reach our destination in no time. We need to hurry to investigate, and restore peace to the waves!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
005	Yes, we do. It's my first time on a treasure hunt, yet with you all here I feel reassured.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
006	Still, I hope I will make myself of some use. The topography is somewhat similar to a desert, after all.
007	By the way, are you planning to search dressed like that, Xiao-Xiao?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0002
008	Huh? Of course! We were originally going to guard the beach.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
009	Yes, but with the area deserted, there's no need for us to protect it.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
010	With the nearby waters becoming flooded with pirates, it's no wonder really.
011	It's to be expected. Pirates can't pass up something like a map with buried treasure on it!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0007
012	True. But deciphering the map with its codes and bits missing is tricky.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0004
013	We figured it out thanks to Su Yi, but it would seem the other buccaneers haven't discovered the cave yet.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0005
014	Fights keep breaking out between the different factions still looking.
015	That is a problem. Treasure hunting seems so adventurous, but it's also a boatload of trouble.
016	The sea should belong to everyone, but this is making mayhem for even those not looking.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
017	You have a point. Things at the beach aren't good. We should try to get this over quickly.
018	Everyone seems to have become acutely aware of the trouble pirates can cause.
019	Is that so?	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0025
020	Yes, I've heard stories... Like there was a pirate who summoned a strange monster from a cave while looking for treasure.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0005
021	It stole swimwear and caused a ruckus. Still, it seems people were able to safely deal with it.
022	Huh... That sounds oddly familiar.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
023	Seems odd rumors have spread surrounding the details with the octopuses... Such a shameful thing. But it is what it is.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0016
024	And yet...the treasure map...	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0031
025	Have you realized something?
026	In our time, the whole area must be dug up. I don't think the treasure will be there now.	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0004
027	And it's odd how rumors of the map have spread so absurdly fast among pirates.
028	True... And it's bizarre how there are copies of the map circulating with the rumors.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0004
029	Hmm...
030	Yes, there is something mysterious about all of it...	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0031
031	But if you think there actually might be a treasure, doesn't that get you excited, Su Yi?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0001
032	Uh, well... I think things seem suspicious, too. Still...	VO_siyi.siyi_battle_0019
033	If the map is real, then I am grateful I get to go on another treasure hunt with you all.	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0001
034	You put it so well, Su Yi! It's the pirate's life for us! One of thrilling adventure and derring-do!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0006
035	That's all well and good, but don't get too carried away with the romance of it. No wandering off in strange ruins again, okay?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0001
036	I couldn't know I was stumbling across an evil cult worshipping a giant octopus!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0016
037	When you get lost...you really get lost. Do you have ANY sense of direction? I hope our ship's heading is correct...	VO_neferty.neferty_chara_1005
038	Not to worry! Su Yi knows the currents better than anyone, and Liu Shen is a master helmsman!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0038
039	Pfew...
040	Oh, that's right! I wanted to check on the supplies you brought on board together.	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0002
041	(Shenmei entrusts the routing, supply manifest, and even helming the ship to her subordinates.)
042	(She seems to have a good sense of how everything works, but... There's something off.)
043	Nefertiti? Is there some reason you've been staring at me? Do I have something on my face?	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0005
044	No. I was just observing the talents of the captain of the Xiao Shenmei.	VO_neferty.neferty_sys_0007
045	What?! An attack?!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_sys_0026
046	Shenmei! There's a ship headed our way!	VO_siyi.siyi_sys_0026
047	Your orders, Captain?	VO_lusheng.lusheng_sys_0016
048	It looks like they're going to hit us! We have no choice!
049	All hands prepare to intercept! Remember, we're borrowing this ship, so try not to damage it!	VO_shengmei.shengmei_battle_0010
