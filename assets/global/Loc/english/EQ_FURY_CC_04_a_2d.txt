001	No more tears, now. Come on, shake hands.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
002	Ngh...unghh... B-but...!
003	I don't wanna! I don't wanna! Uwaaaaah!
004	That's enough. Now, I want you to hold hands for five seconds. This is a magic rite that will help the two of you make up.
005	One...two...three...four...five.
006	Well? How do you feel?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
007	I don't even remember why we were fighting.
008	I guess I was kinda teasing you and stuff. Then, well...
009	I got annoyed and started hitting you, so you hit me back...
010	I'm sorry.
011	I'm sorry too.
012	Now that you've both apologized for what you did, you don't have to be annoyed at each other anymore.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
013	You can forgive and forget.
014	...Wanna play?
015	Of course I do! If I get annoyed, I'll just tell you next time. You're a lot of fun to play with.
016	Heheh. Thanks!
017	C'mon!
018	Let's go!
019	Hmph.
020	(For a demon, she sure is nice. I haven't seen her do a single bad thing.)	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0031
021	(All she does is take in the sights and help kids make up.)
022	Lady Leafah... May we please return?
023	No, I will not! As the warrior poised to become the next general, I will not be satisfied until I have cleansed myself of my earlier embarrassment!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0013
024	More importantly, I cannot allow a threat to our proud nation run around unchecked!
025	Understood. In that case, I shall go meet with our messenger, as we could receive an order to return at any time.
026	Very well. Should anything happen, inform me at once!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
027	(Cursed demon!)	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
028	(Hurry up and do something bad already!)
029	The tallest mountain?	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
030	Yes. Do you know which is the tallest mountain in Saga?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
031	I guess that'd be the Dragon's Nape.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
032	Dragon's Nape?
033	There's a mountain range that stretches east to west across the northernmost part of Saga—well, of Babel, really. It's pretty far away, but you can see it from here.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0004
034	All I see are mountains.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
035	It's called the Ancient Dragon Bone. They say it's actually an enormous dragon that's curled itself around Saga, protecting it.
036	Well, the peak located around what would be the nape of that dragon's neck is the tallest one in Saga.
037	You'll need to pass through Lezario village, get around the Forest of Rukifojio... Then when you reach the Water Temple, find the mountain trail leading further up and follow that.
038	Even the locals generally don't bother to make such a climb.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0031
039	Hey, Button?
040	Ikasa! You've got to try this shish kebab. It's so juicy!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
041	It's got a hint of charcoal to it, and the fat's dripping off just right. It's perfectly seasoned—not overpowering at all.
042	And these vegetables in between the slices of meat are delicious! They are clearly fresh from the field, grown in nature! I think eating outside like this makes them taste even better somehow!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0008
043	Gimme!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
044	Oh! H-hey! No! Ikasa! That's mine! You can't—!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0012
045	Mmm! That's good.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0024
046	I bought you some! You didn't have to take a bite out of mine.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
047	But I wanted yours.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
048	Aw... That was the last bit of meat, too.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0030
049	I'll buy you another one. You're going to need the energy.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
050	Wh-why?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
051	We're in for a pretty difficult climb.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
052	(You've got to be kidding me!)
053	Say it was raining...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
054	And someone tells you, "Just remember: the rain always stops."
055	But that person is standing in a dry patch, where the rain has already stopped.
056	You know what?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
057	I've always found my own name annoying.
058	Ikasa?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
059	When your family picked me up off the streets, an umbrella was all I had.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
060	I don't know who gave it to me, but...
061	It basically became part of my identity, and as because "Ikasa" means "umbrella" in the old tongue, it just stuck.
062	I guess we have something in common there...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
063	Anyway, there's no deep meaning at all for mine.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
064	So, you know where we are?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
065	The top.
066	Yup. You got it.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
067	I will never forget that sight.
068	It was like standing on the back of a dragon, the mountain range fanning out around me like dragon scales.
069	The path we followed was small and narrow. The countries we had passed through on our journey were vague blurs in the distance, and Wadatsumi was no longer visible on the horizon.
070	Look at any map of the world, and you will see that behind these mountain ranges lies nothing but ocean.
071	Where we stand now...
072	Is this...the world's end?
073	Looking down on everything, on the whole wide world...	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
074	From here, you could jump down and give anyone a handshake, huh?
075	You're supreme ruler of the castle up here, Button.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
076	Hmhm.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
077	Pretty surreal, huh?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
078	I'd enjoy this view even if it was an illusion.
079	Button...
080	Yes?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
081	You're beautiful.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
082	Wh-what? I-I... Wh-what?!	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0025
083	Even in these foreign lands far from home, you lend a hand to anyone who asks, no question, no matter what it costs you. You try to understand those who do bad things.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0004
084	Your purity of spirit drives you to perceive everything around you—all the people, all the land, all the countries of the world—as good. I believe that that is truly, irreproachably just.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
085	Y-you flatter me! I only—
086	If you continue to learn about the world, I think you'll find that some things have to be wrong. Justice doesn't rule everything.
087	Wh-what do you mean?
088	A ruler like you couldn't stand to watch on idly from above, so if war did break out, you'd lend a hand for the sake of peace.
089	But wherever your hand couldn't reach, war would rage.
090	Countless rights and wrongs would be perpetrated around you, and you'd probably end up blaming yourself.
091	But since I'm here with you, in your world, at your side.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
092	I don't want to see you torture yourself like that.
093	Ikasa?
094	It's getting kinda mushy around here, huh? Wonder if it's a sign that this spot gets a lot of rain.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0011
095	Ikasa...
096	We should probably start the climb down soon.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
097	Would you...hold my hand?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
098	Is this the part where you shake hands with me because I'm a knight?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
099	Don't tease me.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0013
100	Does this mean you've forgiven me?
101	It's only because I'm a little afraid of heights.
102	Then...sure.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
103	It's beautiful up here, isn't it?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
104	You like beautiful things?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
105	Yes...	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
106	What about dirty things?
107	I suppose that would depend on how dirty it is.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0016
108	Heheh. Good point.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0007
109	Although...I think I could come to like it.
110	Huh. You don't say.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0022
111	Ahah! Insurrection!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
112	Hm...?
113	Haa...haa...! I knew it! I knew you'd show your true colors eventually! Haa...haha! Haa... Ack! Urgh...	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
114	How long have you been following us?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
115	Long enough! I grew tired and wasn't able to hear you at certain points—but I heard enough! You left Wadatsumi on a campaign to rule the world, didn't you?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
116	Oh. That was only a metaphor, of sorts.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
117	You're a demon who's trying to take over the world! That's why you've been buttering up the civilians of each nation! You're plotting world domination! You're a villain!
118	I don't know, if anything that crazy look in your eyes is pretty demonic if you ask me.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0006
119	I've been watching you since the moment you set foot on that boat! I knew you'd slip up eventually, and my persistence has been rewarded!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0007
120	How long and far did you intend to travel, you fiends?! You could have killed me!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
121	Do you have nothing better to do?	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0030
122	Of course I have better things to do!
123	I understand. You just haven't been assigned a task, have you?
124	Shut up, shut up, shut up! Are you calling me a child?! You might think you're being nice, but I don't need your pity! I am no child!
125	Yeah, okay. No one's calling you a kid.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0029
126	But you just did! You just called me a kid! I'll have you know, I am no child! I am far too tall for that! My rank, too high! My age is irrelevant!
127	It's starting to sound like you're actually a child.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0016
128	O-only technically!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
129	Just face the facts. You're a kid.
130	Be that as it may! I have a responsibility to use my powers and abilities for the proud nation of Greed Dike!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
131	As such, I could not let the likes of an occultist wander around the countryside unmonitored! The very thought makes me shiver with fear!
132	Um, Leafah?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0001
133	Yeah, that's me!
134	Whatever you say to me, I will not complain. If you truly believe that I am wrong, then perhaps you are right. However—
135	I-if that is how you feel, then fall! Fall to my blade! For Greed Dike! For my personal glory!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
136	Not sure if you're being selfish, or stupidly noble.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
137	Leafah, listen to me. It doesn't matter how many strong techniques you master—what's important is that you don't misuse them.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0003
138	It's meaningless if you only use them for the benefit of yourself and the country in which you were born.
139	What? Then...for what purpose do you train?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
140	I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences.
141	Join hands...
142	It shouldn't matter which country you were born in. We're all people of Babel, aren't we? I'm sure we can come to understand each other!
143	I...!
144	The world doesn't rule the people; the people create the world.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0005
145	Their suffering, sorrow, ire, joy... These burdens overlap, and when they connect...that is how the world of humans is made.
146	Leafah. When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people.
147	If you do that, the answer you seek should come to you all on its own.
148	Personally, I feel like I've caught a glimpse of the answer I seek during my travels.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0007
149	...
150	If such a thing is possible, I would like to see everyone in this world become one big happy family. I want to see peace reign so completely that everyone feels secure enough to hold hands and sleep alongside one another.
151	Wh-why is that important to you? I thought you were a shrine maiden of Wadatsumi. Why would you tolerate someone like me, from Greed Dike?	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0002
152	What does our homeland have to do with any of this? It is as irrelevant as our age, our lineage.	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0002
153	Hm...
154	Please. May we shake hands?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0004
155	Fine.
156	Good. This means we've made up.
157	Looks like someone beat us to the punch.
158	Who goes there?!
159	You really let that shrine maiden get outta hand, huh?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
160	Stay back!
161	I get it. You want to die under the warmth of the sun. Hell, I don't blame you.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
162	The sky is such a deep blue up here.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
163	Who are you?	VO_fuelie_fuelie-b.fuelie_sys_0006
164	Nature is beautiful, isn't it? Who would've thought such a beautiful sky existed in this world!
165	Doesn't it make you want to tell someone about it? Sing about it for all the world to hear?
166	You mentioned a shrine maiden—that would be me. Did you...want something from me?
167	Nobody to watch your back? Seems like you ought to look more closely at yourself before throwing words at other people.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
168	Some things in this world are better left unknown.
169	I couldn't agree more.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0005
170	Ikasa...?
171	Run, Button.	VO_ikasa.ikasa_sys_0001
172	Wh-what's going on?
173	Business.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
174	Any man who raises his hand against a woman is worse than a dog. That's my philosophy.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
175	But when it's a matter of business, I don't discriminate.
176	It'd be pretty sexist of me not to kill my target just because she was a woman, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
177	I-I don't understand!
178	Then let me spell it out for you. I'm talking about my assassination target.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
179	Wh-what—?!
180	Sometimes we need to do the dirty work in order to reach our goals.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
181	Know what I mean? I get the feeling we're kindred spirits.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0003
182	Tch...
183	Wh-what's going on, Ikasa? Please, tell me!
184	Button! Run—now!	VO_ikasa.ikasa_battle_0019
185	My orders are to kill the cursed shrine maiden.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0007
