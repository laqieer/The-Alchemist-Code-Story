001	The school bell tolls, echoing across the grounds.
002	Guess that means it's break time. I still can't believe how easily they let me transfer here...
003	Hey! Hiya! Welcome! You must be the new kid!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0003
004	Daisy? Wow! Is that a real mech gear?!
005	Hee hee! Pretty cool, huh? Wait—did I tell you my name already?	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0005
006	Everyone knows you, Daisy, because you're always lugging that big thing around. Anyway, nice to meet you! I'm—	VO_berta.berta_sys_0011
007	Bertha, right? Lemme guess—you're aiming to become president of one of the school clubs?
008	Wow! You're pretty knowledgeable for a new kid. That's right, I'm aspiring to become president of the marching band club!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0025
009	Speaking of clubs—that's actually why we're here. Have you picked a club yet? You should totally join me in the mech club!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0004
010	S-sorry! Can't talk clubs today. I'm actually in a bit of a hurry.
011	Aww... Okay. You'll have to come take a look at the clubs another time, then!	VO_daisy.daisy_sys_0031
012	I definitely will. Good luck with the marching band, Bertha!
013	Thanks! I'll keep at it!	VO_berta.berta_sys_0037
014	Hm... Someone's popular.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
015	I'm guessing you don't get a lot of transfer students.
016	I suppose. Although... you latched onto me rather quickly too, I must say.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0005
017	Oh, um...
018	(What am I meant to say to that? Lemme think... Ooh! I've got it!)
019	That's because you're my favorite character!
020	I don't understand what you mean by that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
021	However, I appreciate your honesty. Hm... It's really not like me to enjoy a compliment like that.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
022	Kaya's Affection Level Increased
023	What was that?!
024	What was what?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0025
025	Sorry—I thought I heard... Never mind.
026	Something must have scared you—you should have seen your face. Hmhm... In any case, regarding the method of returning you to your original world...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
027	About that... I've been thinking, and I'm not sure I want to go back just yet.
028	What? Make up your mind, will you?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
029	Kaya's Affection Level Decreased
030	Nooo! Kaya, don't hate me! I just thought that, y'know, it'd be fun to spend some time with everyone from TAC. I've been really enjoying hanging out with you, too, and—
031	Keep your voice down, will you? There's no need to shout such embarrassing things for the world to hear.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
032	It's just... It's like a dream come true! Here I am, in this world I really like, spending time with all my favorite characters... I don't want it to end!
033	I see. I'm flattered, but... hm. This really isn't like me at all.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0007
034	Kaya's Affection Level Increased
035	It went back up! Whoo-hoo!
036	Ngh!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0027
037	Oh, crap! I'm so sorry!
038	This is what happens when you prance around like a child... Honestly. Oh, but you might have just bumped into the very person we need.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0022
039	Oh, no... Where have my glasses got to?
040	Found them. And... there. Well, I suppose I should apologize to you, too, um...?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0035
041	You're Noah!
042	Um... Yes?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
043	I see. Your explanation makes sense, though I'm not sure I believe the part about different worlds.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0031
044	Regardless, this grand library is the pride of TAC Academy, and all students are welcome to peruse its shelves. I would think this is your best bet for relevant information.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
045	You're the president of the archaeology club, aren't you? I'm sure you don't need my help, but if you're interested, the history section is over there—
046	I've already memorized all of those books. Rereading them would just be a waste of time.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
047	Seriously?! Ahem. Sorry... I lost my temper.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
048	Haha... Awkward. Let's just take a look around for now.
049	Good. I'm glad you're on board. After all, you can spend time with the other students while we conduct our research.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0006
050	Besides, there's something I'd like to look into myself.
051	Aw, man... I was kinda hoping that I'd find some hot info about what happens after Chapter 6 while I'm here.
052	I'm sorry? I don't believe we carry any books that are unfinished here.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0025
053	However, all writers want their stories to be enjoyed, so I'm sure the author of your tale must be frantically working to finish it.
054	And so long as people are eager to read what happens next, I'm sure they will continue writing it. I think the best thing you can do is wait, and look forward to reading more. Hee hee.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0007
055	Sorry to change the topic, but isn't there something you should be asking her?	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0001
056	I have so many questions! Like, what's your favorite... Oh, you mean about that. Right... Hey, Noah, do you know if this academy—?
057	Sup, everybody!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0009
058	Emma... How many times do I have to remind you that the library is a quiet place?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
059	Aw, c'mon! Let it go already. I came here to do my homework, like a model student! Just call me diligent!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0012
060	Your homework? You mean you're going to make me help you with everything?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
061	Oh, hey! Are you the new kid I've heard so much about? What're you hanging out up here for?	VO_emma.emma_chara_1001
062	...
063	Um, Emma? Maybe look behind you?
064	Aw, Noah! Don't look at me like that. What're you so mad about, huh?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0016
065	Emma... I'm not going to have you screw up my whole schedule, but I'll take a look if you get stuck on something. Happy?	VO_noah.noah_sys_0022
066	Those two are surprisingly close, considering their personalities couldn't be more different.	VO_kaya.kaya_chara_1017
067	Oh, right! Emma and Noah both go to the Venus School of Magic!
068	Would you please stop shouting in the library?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0012
069	Sorry, sorry. Hey, can I ask you something?
070	Oh? You wanna take me out to dinner? It'll cost ya!	VO_emma.emma_chara_1013
071	Let me see how much I've got in my wallet... Wait, no! That's not what this is about!
072	I just wanted to ask if you guys have noticed anything unusual about this school.
073	(These two attend the Venus School of Magic in-game, so they might know something!)
074	Nope.
075	Nothing that I can think of, no.	VO_noah.noah_sys_0005
076	Huh.
077	A swing and a miss.	VO_kaya.kaya_battle_1018
078	No clues here, then, I guess...
079	Oh!
080	Did you remember something?!
081	Yeah, it's time for me to get to work! Hey—why don't you come lend me a hand?	VO_emma.emma_sys_0002
082	Huh? Forget it—I don't have time for that.
083	Aww, c'mon! There's no good reason to hang around this dusty old place, anyway!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0007
084	What's that supposed to mean?!	VO_noah.noah_sys_0013
085	Uh-oh! Quick, run! Don't let her catch us!	VO_emma.emma_sys_0008
086	Seriously, that girl...	VO_noah.noah_sys_0030
087	Well, at least I'll be able to conduct my research in peace now. My matter of interest has nothing to do with the academy, however...	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0008
088	Hm... It's really not like me to pursue something like this.	VO_kaya.kaya_sys_0031
