001	A gauge... Just a gauge?!	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
002	With the Discarnate Power's body as its base, yet room for further growth on top, there was so much potential from the very start. But potential alone does not a weapon make.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
003	To measure its strength and fine-tune the end product, I needed strong opponents. Regular soldiers wouldn't do, and I certainly couldn't target Greed Dike's forces.
004	But then I found you.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
005	Demon slayers...who exist to counteract the very forces you used as your model...
006	That's right. I gathered all the strongest-willed people of Wadatsumi—those who dared stand up to the demons.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
007	I banded them together into an organization, and trained them to become experts at their craft. Once that milestone was reached, others scrambled to join their ranks.
008	One amazing person after another! The Successor of the Black Star, the descendant of the Kagomurasaki...	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
009	Not to mention a former Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard, with ties to the house of Rising Ashes. How could I not take advantage of the gift that was handed to me?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0003
010	The stronger the group, the stronger my weapon becomes—and the more worthwhile my experiment.
011	So we were just being used? This whole time, it was all for your benefit?!	VO_celis.celis_sys_0020
012	That's right. And with you as commander, the Blade Fox Corps grew stronger than ever—strong enough to conclude these experiments.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0004
013	It's been almost too perfect, really. An organization like the Blade Fox Corps isn't just well-suited to these tests...it's practically ideal.
014	But now that my weapon is complete, the Blade Fox are no longer necessary, I'm sorry to say. I must again thank you for everything, though, before sending you off.	VO_judius.judius_sys_0008
015	!!!
016	Now, now. Don't scrunch up your face like that! You've been so helpful. You should feel privileged for the part you played!	VO_judius.judius_sys_0001
017	And the purging of the Scarlet Flame Guard, on top of it all... I never could've foreseen how well it would all go!
018	No...	VO_celis.celis_battle_0019
019	The Scarlet Flame Guard... Was Greed Dike involved with that as well?!
020	And what if we were?	VO_judius.judius_sys_0010
021	Then you will pay dearly for your heinous crimes!
