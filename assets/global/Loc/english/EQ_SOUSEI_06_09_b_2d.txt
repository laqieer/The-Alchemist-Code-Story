001	…Ah!
002	Did that bring you to your senses? Focus on the crisis at hand!	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0001
003	If we cooperate, we might be able to save Horeb… H-Hey!
051	Her Majesty has forsaken us and now we've gotten trounced by a traitor… How much more of this can we take?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0018
052	If only His Majesty, King Arius, were here…
053	…He's a Fallen, now. His kind-hearted soul has been warped into pure wrath.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0017
054	There's no one left to guide us… We've been forsaken. The world has forsaken us…
055	…
004	It's…no use. We're finished...and soon we'll be wiped out.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0019
056	…When you lost King Arius, you lost your light, didn't you?	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0016
057	He lit your path when you were in darkness. You could always count on his guidance...
058	His guidance…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0025
059	You're right…what we lost was immeasurable…	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
060	King Arius embodied our future.
061	As long as we followed him, we were assured survival.
062	...We came so far because we believed in him… I believed in him.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0022
063	…But he's not here anymore. He's gone…
064	…I know how hard it must be…	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0020
005	But--
006	…Calm down, Andechs.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0014
007	If we don't do something, they'll...die.	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0042
008	…They've lost hope.
009	…Hope.
010	They have no reason to keep fighting. They've lost their survival instinct.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
011	…It pains me to say it, but we don't have the luxury to defend those who've succumbed to despair…
012	Tch--!	VO_andechs.andechs_battle_0019
013	The day my brother fell to corruption...all hope was already lost…
014	You all are my greatest pride. I wish only for your prosperity. Therefore--
015	Live, young one. Leave my corpse behind.
016	…!	VO_slba.slba_battle_0019
017	…Raise your heads!
018	…Huh?
019	Look here! This sword--	VO_slba.slba_sys_0004
020	…That's…the Red Blade…? I thought it was lost along with King Arius… Why do you--	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0025
021	The queen…entrusted this sword to me!
022	Rise up, knights! The moment you clad yourselves in armor you became the king's pride!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0042
023	His Majesty, King Arius, told me with his final breath...that we must live!
024	The survival of our people shall be proof of the king's victory!
025	His Majesty said that?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0030
026	Stand tall! Do that and you'll have returned the kindness he showed us!
027	I, for one, will fight! I won't surrender!
028	I didn't come this far just to die…!	VO_slba.slba_sys_0005
029	You're right… We must--	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0004
030	Live… We can't surrender!
031	This armor my grandfather left me…I've got to do it justice!	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0042
032	Quite a moving speech…	VO_andechs.andechs_sys_0025
033	Agreed. Things are starting to look up!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
034	…Everyone.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0007
035	I've done all that I can. What now? How…are we going to save everyone?
036	…We're going to put a stop to Satna.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
037	But there's no guarantee we can put a stop to this calamity. So--
038	…I see. So, Nimul made the request…	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0045
039	You'll take us in…?
040	Of course. That's what we're here for.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0007
041	Sword and shield regimens! Begin evacuation procedures and lead the Ira people to safety.
042	Based on what I've heard so far, it's likely Satna's calamity will eventually reach here…
043	We'll make our way down to the far reaches of the borderlands where the airship is anchored!	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0001
044	No dawdling! Time waits for no man! Let us prove Invidia knights shine brightest when we have something to protect!
045	Yes, sir!
046	...What about you?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0002
047	…I have a score to settle on that mountain.
048	I see…
049	Please...take care of my people.	VO_slba.slba_sys_0005
050	What kind of land forces children so young to wage war…?	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0042
065	…I mustn't think about that now.
066	…We must do everything we can to put an end to this nightmare.	VO_hymnus.hymnus_sys_0004
