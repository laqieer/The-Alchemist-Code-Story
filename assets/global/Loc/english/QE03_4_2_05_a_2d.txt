001	At this rate, the insects are going to freeze! What should we do?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_chara_1003
002	There's no magic to prevent freezing to death! If there were such a thing, we'd just as well use it on ourselves.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
003	We don't need magic. Liz, take out the caramel jaeger.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0010
004	Huh...? What...?	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0005
005	This is how we're gonna do it!	VO_alma.alma_battle_0003
006	Whaaat?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
007	Oh, yikes. It'll freeze if I just dump it here.	VO_alma.alma_battle_0021
008	I see. So that's what you were trying to do.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0044
009	Thanks, Rebecca. Yep...it doesn't matter as long as they get warm.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0033
010	More than warm, I'd say they're drunk now. Well, spiders get drunk on coffee too, so...	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
011	But wow! I hadn't thought of that.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0046
012	Witches are always so narrow minded in their thinking.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0002
013	What do you mean?	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0025
014	They're always just thinking about getting by with magic.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0030
015	The students are focused on how they can stand out with their magic and join the elite.
016	It's boring how they all think the same.
017	It's true. I used to be like that too.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_battle_0019
018	Just when I was bored with all of that...I met you, Liz.	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
019	Alma...
020	It's never been boring with you, Liz. After all, I can never guess what you're thinking!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0034
021	Huh?!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0026
022	Heheh. True. I would never have thought we'd be able to fly this far.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
023	Sometimes I think you just act without thinking.	VO_alma.alma_chara_1004
024	Come on! I think things through in my own way! ...I think.	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0029
025	You're not even confident about that!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0011
026	Heheh. When you think of it that way, these insects flying around obliviously aren't that different.	VO_rebecca.rebecca_sys_0007
027	Right? Well then...let's chase them off!	VO_alma.alma_sys_0007
028	I am thinking things through!	VO_lizbeth.lizbeth_sys_0002
