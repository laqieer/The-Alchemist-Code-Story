001	Walking across the snow is pretty nice. It never snowed much in that village, so I had no idea...	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0007
002	(According to Flamel, today's the day Mielikki returns to the village.)
003	(He said I should talk to her beforehand, but I'm sure... The moment I see her face, I'll lose all resolve.)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0029
004	(I've been avoiding her, not saying a word... I'm sure I've hurt her feelings.)
005	(That's all I do...cause Mielikki pain. And after all the joy she brought me...)	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0022
006	...Celliers!
007	What?! It's you!
008	...So you were here all along. Most of your comrades were captured. You should've fled back to your land with your tail between your legs.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0001
009	All they would do is send me out to the front lines. And on the front lines, I'd just end up cursed.
010	I can't go back... Not without purifying crystals to remove curses.
011	You're kidding... My crystals don't have the power to remove curses. That's what they all told me.	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0031
012	That's only the case within Lustburg, isn't it?! You never know, it might work against the Jam!
013	I don't know what this "Jam" is...but a curse dreadful enough to frighten the likes of you would be impossible for me to—	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0002
014	I can't go back now! Take a look at this.
015	That's...Mielikki's ribbon? Why do you...?	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0025
016	She's important to you, isn't she? If you want her back in one piece, you'd better come along quietly.
017	...!
018	What did you do to her?!	VO_celliers.celliers_sys_0012
019	Not again... I've put Mielikki in danger again!
020	Yes, that's it! If I can just get that power...!
021	...You bastard. How dare you lay a hand on her.	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0019
022	This cannot stand... I won't allow it!	VO_celliers.celliers_battle_0014
