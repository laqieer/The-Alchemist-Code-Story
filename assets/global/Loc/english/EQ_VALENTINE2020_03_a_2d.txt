001	Hah!	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0002
002	Argh...	VO_thiefm.thiefm_battle_0021
003	That was amazing... Your swordplay was so graceful and beautiful! Wadatsumi swordsmen really are a force to be reckoned with!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0024
004	...
005	We had to be strong to protect what we had.
006	Ah...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
007	...Sorry. That was phrased poorly.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0035
008	Ah! Don't worry about it! It doesn't bother me whatsoever!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_1011
009	Not just for that. For everything. I've been extremely rude. I apologize.
010	I-it's...
011	...
012	I don't quite understand how I should interact with you, the General of Greed Dike.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
013	Please understand that I don't hate you.
014	After that battle, you became general and worked tirelessly to unite Greed Dike and Wadatsumi.
015	It's just that it's hard to shake the instinct that anyone from Greed Dike is my enemy. I can't help but see the shadow of Orion in you and...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_battle_0019
016	...I don't know how to change that. Everyone's already said to me that I can't get stuck in the past but...
017	Suzuka...
018	...I feel like a child. I thought I had grown some after apologizing to Itsuki, but...	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0022
019	It's fine! Really! It's my duty to hear the opinions and voices of the people of Wadatsumi!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
020	It's my responsibility as General, after all.
044	That's the least I can do as the person who carries the responsibility of bringing Greed Dike and Wadatsumi together!
021	That's also my will as a Phantom Soldier! Nothing has changed!
022	Leafah...
023	Suzuka!
024	(Huh?)	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
025	(Wasn't I the one who was supposed to be apologizing?)
026	(What do I do? I still haven't apologized yet! She got to it first! How do I proceed from here?!)
027	By the way, what brings you here, Leafah?	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0002
028	U-um! I-I came to let you know we're about to leave soon!
029	Oh! You have my gratitude. I must hurry.	VO_suzuka.suzuka_sys_0004
030	So...you didn't apologize.	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0045
031	Ack! The timing wasn't right! Go ahead and laugh, why don't you!	VO_rifa.rifa_battle_0019
032	No, I won't laugh. But is that okay? We'll be arriving in Lustburg soon.
033	No, it's not okay...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0039
034	But the timing...	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0031
035	Oh! I have a great idea!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0002
036	Wh-what is it? Tell me!
037	Once this job is over, why don't you make some chocolates with us?	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0007
038	Chocolates?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0025
039	Pour your apology into the chocolate and give it to Suzuka!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_sys_0005
040	You really lucked out, didn't you! Having people understand you through chocolate really is the best method out there!
041	After all, Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known!
042	I-I see! Valentine's day is all about making your feelings known... Just gotta put it in the chocolate...	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0045
043	Alrighty, with that settled, let's get this cacao to Lustburg and destroy any who dare stand in our way!	VO_itsuki.itsuki_chara_1006
