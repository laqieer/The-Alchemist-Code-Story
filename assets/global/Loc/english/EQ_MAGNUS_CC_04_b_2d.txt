001	Don't you think you're overchargin' a bit?	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0031
002	My good sir, this is a high-quality incantation gear! If you were to buy it legitimately, you'd expect to pay at least double.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
003	Just between you and me, this was crafted by an extremely prolific Alchemist of some renown. If you're not interested in it, I'm sure someone else will be.
004	Ooh! Hold on, lass! All right... I'll take it!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0030
005	Excellent. Then we have a deal! Thank you very much for your business.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
006	Heh. Y'know, you'd make a pretty good saleswoman.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
007	I might as well be one, after all the errands I've run for Mister Othima.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0006
008	Ryui! Is that you, dearie? I've been meaning to tell you—that cooking incantation gear you gave me the other day is simply marvelous!
009	Your inventions make my life so much easier! I've been getting a steady supply of water and electricity since you installed those pipes, too. I can't thank you enough!
010	There's no need for that. I'm just glad I can help.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0008
011	Oh, but...goodness, how time flies! I still remember when you were yea tall—now look at you!
012	Everyone's always talking about how much you've improved our little town, Ryui. And for good reason! Where would we be without you?
013	Do stop by again soon, won't you? I'm sure I'm not the only one who misses you!
014	I...	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
015	Oh! By the way, Ryui, you wouldn't happen to have any incantation gear for security or self-defense, would you?
016	Huh? Why?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0005
017	Well, there've been some shady types hanging around here of late, and you never can be too careful.
055	They're not the mafia, either. There's something not quite right about them. They give me the willies.
018	Hmm... I see. Well, how about this? Just press this button here to fill this part with high-voltage electricity.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
019	Then, if someone attacks you, just jab them with it—like this. Easy enough, right?
020	Ooh! This is just what I need. Thanks, dearie.
021	Huh. Y'know, you're almost a different person down here. It's like you're in your element or something.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0001
022	Well, I suppose I am. This is my hometown, after all.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0006
023	Right... You never talk about it, though. Is it a touchy subject?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0035
024	No, not really. Besides, I'm sure you've already heard all about my past from Mister Othima. It's not like I'm hiding it or anything.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0003
025	It's just...it was only through hard work that I was able to make it out of this place.
026	And while I don't hate the slums, they're not exactly full of good memories for me.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0030
027	But when I think about the fact that I was the only one who made it out...even though leaving was my dream, I can't help but feel a bit hollow.
028	I can see that, but...remember this, Ryui.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
029	You are not alone, and from what I've seen...you never really were.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
030	That's funny... Will told me something similar when we were training for the mock battle.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
031	Hey, Ryui! Ryui! Over here!
032	That seed you gave me is starting to grow! You've gotta come see! I've been watering it every day, just like you told me to!
033	Ooh! Really? Show me!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0025
034	Wow! It has sprouted, hasn't it? Great work!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0024
035	I was worried it'd never grow down here... It's like a miracle!
036	It's no miracle, silly. It's growing because you've been watering it every day, and taking good care of it!	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0007
037	Yeah, you're right—but I didn't do it alone!
038	See, I put this little sign here to warn people not to walk on it, and no one has! And people've been reminding me to water it, too!
039	So it's thanks to everyone that this little guy is growing so well! I can't wait to see what kinda flower it'll turn out to be!
040	You keep saying that, but do you know why people don't always put in all the effort they possibly could?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0037
041	Why?	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0031
042	Because it's hard. Now, c'mon, give me one of those bags.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0030
043	(Everyone is working hard down here... How did I not see that? What one person can't do alone, they make possible by working together.)
044	I'm sure it will be a beautiful one.	VO_liuie.liuie_sys_0008
045	...
046	Hey! Where's Ryui?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
047	She's talking with a friend. I'm just giving them some space. Anyway, how are things going on your end?	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0004
048	I got us what we need, but it looks like we're in for a rough time.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0031
049	Apparently, some mafiosos are going to have it out here in a few days. Although...I'm not convinced it's really going to play out that way.
050	See, those suspicious characters who've been sniffing around Real Heaven of late are actually hired mercenaries.
051	I see.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0006
052	So, what are we gonna do?	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0002
053	Well...I don't see the harm in helping out—which makes me think that maybe she's been a better role model for us than we have been for her.	VO_magnus.magnus_sys_0007
054	Sounds about right. But since we're supposed to be her mentors and all, it's probably still our job to steer her in the right direction.	VO_wilhelm.wilhelm_sys_0008
