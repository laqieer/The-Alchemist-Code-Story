001	Long have I awaited this moment.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0007
002	Today's meeting, like the blue moon, was fated since the events of those bygone days.
003	And now, we fight.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0032
004	Yomi!	VO_zin.zin_battle_1028
005	Don't talk to me!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
006	Tonight, you die!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0013
007	Yomi, wait, I...!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
008	A long, long time ago...
009	Humans and demons fought one another, and both were desperate to survive.
010	Demons devoured humans in order to live, and humans killed them so that they would not be devoured.
011	In the end, sadness and hatred enveloped Wadatsumi like a shroud.
012	Why did you kill our father?	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_1028
013	I...!
014	Why did you break your oath? Why did you disappear without saying anything?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
015	Why did you leave me?!
016	...
017	As the battle raged on, humans and demons quickly became consumed by their hatred.
018	Amidst the chaos, a lone human man and a lone demon woman overcame their differences and fell in love.
019	Pushing aside all opposition, they wed. Tired of the fighting, demons and humans alike were moved by their relationship.
020	Thus, a pact was made. The demons swore that they would no longer devour humans, and the humans vowed never to kill another demon.
021	It is because of your foul deed that the honor of the Kagomurasaki Clan was besmirched.
022	We came to be despised as a household carrying the stain of bloodshed, and were ruined for it.
023	Now here I am, the head of the family.
024	...
025	So that she would never have to harm a human like her lover...
026	The demon broke both of her own horns. She fashioned one of them into a special stone, in which she sealed her godlike demon powers.
027	I won't forgive you! I will never forgive you!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0013
028	The grudge against our family, your broken oath, the shame of the Kagomurasaki Clan...
029	All of it! All of it is your fault!
030	Huzzzaaahhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
031	Arrrrggghhh!	VO_zin.zin_sys_0043
032	The other horn, she made into a blade, so that if the demonic powers within the stone were misused, something would be able to subdue the stone.
033	This blade was passed down from generation to generation in my family, alongside my halberd.
034	Come, let your blood rust my blade—Sumeragi!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0011
035	Ngh!
036	Nnnnnggghhhh!
037	I can't die yet!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
038	So you will finally kill me, too?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0010
039	No, I want you to kill me.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
040	Wha—?!
041	Similarly, the demon's human lover devised a technique that could be used against demonic powers, but swore that he would seal it away.
042	They would live out their lives together with mutual trust, as equals. What stood as proof of their bond and oath were the Sacred Three.
043	The Mikaboshi, Sumeragi, and Kagutsuchi.
044	But not yet!	VO_zin.zin_chara_1007
045	You're going to leave again! You're leaving me—leaving everything behind!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
046	This will be my requiem for you! Your death will come at my hands! Today, you die!
047	Yomi!
048	I told you not to talk to me!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0021
049	Huzzzzaaaahhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0008
050	Ngh!	VO_zin.zin_battle_0019
051	D-die!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
052	Die!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0010
053	Ngh! An arrow...? Where did—?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0025
054	Filthy heathens! Stop right there!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0032
055	Seize the heathens!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
056	Get out of my way!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0021
057	Don't let either of them get away!
058	Yomi.
059	No! Wait, don't go!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
060	I'm sorry.	VO_zin.zin_battle_0018
061	No, wait!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
062	Please don't go! Brother!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_1028
063	...
064	Brother!!!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0028
065	The creation of the Sacred Three brought peace to Wadatsumi. Shall I tell you an old story, one that has been around for generations?
066	It's the story of the Demon Extermination.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
067	When I grow up, I'll protect you, brother.
068	You don't need to do that, Yomi. I am sure that I will be able to keep both you and Wadatsumi from coming to harm.
069	I don't wanna be protected all the time! I wanna help, too!
070	I know. You're a hard worker. You'll probably become far stronger than me.
071	That's right! I am a hard worker! I'll get way stronger than you!
072	So it's a promise. Let's protect Wadatsumi together, no matter what!
073	All right. I promise.
074	I mean it! Don't forget you promised!
075	Let's make a wish on a shooting star.
076	Huh?
077	Let's make a wish so that we'll be able to protect Wadatsumi together.
078	Jin!
079	Yes?
080	Say it.
081	I already did, didn't I?
082	No, you have to say it properly. Say you promise!
083	Oh, a shooting star!
084	Huh? Huh?! Where? Where?!
085	Just kidding.
086	Hey!
087	The night sky sure is beautiful, don't you think?
088	Yeah.
089	My wish is that we will be able to look up at this sky together forever.
090	Oh...
091	Ah!
092	A shooting star!
093	Hm. Just a dream.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0018
094	Lady Yomi, please wake up.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0006
095	Old-timer? What is happening outside the mansion?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0003
096	It is the Greed Dike soldiers. Having you in their custody is making them quite arrogant.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0005
097	I believe it was the right choice to have you sheltered here. I could not stand to leave you in the care of strangers, in any case.	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0030
098	I am indebted to the Shiba Senko Clan for helping me.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0022
099	Hoho. You've truly become a splendid leader of the Kagomurasaki. To think that you were such a cheeky little girl, always giving me trouble...	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0007
100	O-old-timer, please. Don't bring up embarrassing stories like that.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0048
101	It is not only the Kagomurasaki, now. In order to protect you, Lady Yomi, even the prosperous Shiba Senko Clan has joined forces with you.
102	They have even agreed to shelter you in the Shiba Senko mansion. I feel that so long as you are here, you will be safe.
103	What about Greed Dike?	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0002
104	...
105	I apologize for barging in while you're still recovering.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
106	W-wait! I did not give permission for so many people to enter my mansion!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0042
107	I don't need your permission.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
108	...Greed Dike.	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
109	So, you are Yomi, head of the Kagomurasaki Clan.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
110	I am Leafah, General of Greed Dike's Army. Please forgive my sudden intrusion.
111	I'm sure you didn't need to come here in person.	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0020
112	I need you to hand over Sumeragi.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
113	What did you say?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0012
114	I heard that it is a sword that has been passed down in the Kagomurasaki Clan for generations. As you are the head of the clan, I have come to ask you directly.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
115	I am hoping that you can help me.
116	You!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
117	Lady Yomi?!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
118	General Leafah!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0018
119	It's fine. She is unarmed.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
120	You...! Who do you think you are?!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
121	I believe that I have already introduced myself as the General of Greed Dike's Army.	VO_rifa.rifa_chara_1008
122	It's your fault that I missed the opportunity of a lifetime!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0013
123	I could have killed him if you hadn't...!
124	It truly was a shame. The Demonic Killer Jin, infamous for being the monster who murdered his entire family... He should not have been allowed to escape.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
125	He only got away because you resisted. I am very sorry.
126	If you hadn't been here in the first place...!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
127	I hear that you are, in fact, siblings. My reports say that your brother killed your father, so you tried to kill him, yourself.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
128	Blood spilling blood...
129	Despicable. How typical of heathens.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0017
130	How dare you!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0012
131	Heathens deserve no mercy.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0010
132	You...!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
133	Argh! Nnnngghhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0026
134	L-Lady Yomi!	VO_mob-saga_omale.mog-saga_omale_sys_0026
135	Arrrrrggggghhh! My body...feels like it's...going to explode! I can't think... I...! Aaaaarrrrrgggghhhhhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0024
136	Is this...the same thing that happened last night?!	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0027
137	Old-timer! Take her to the palace! Have someone carry her! Quickly!	VO_knightm.knightm_battle_0019
138	We must perform the Demon Calming Ceremony!
139	Haaa...haaa...haaa... Ngh?!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0019
140	The soldiers of Greed Dike will lend a hand.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
141	I don't need anything from the likes of you!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0023
142	Don't be like that.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
143	I do feel bad about what happened.
144	Wh-what?
145	Hm.
146	The past cannot be changed. That is why I want to help you, so that we can move on into the future.
147	Wadatsumi is currently in a state of extreme chaos. It is Greed Dike's responsibility to deal with it.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0030
148	We will put an end to the chaos.
149	From here on out, we will join hands and create a path that serves the benefit of all. That is the consensus that Greed Dike has come to.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0003
150	And that is why we need Sumeragi...and you.
151	Wh-what does this have to do with m-me?!	VO_yomi.yomi_sys_0042
152	I'm sure you've realized it by now.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0001
153	The Discarnate Power that lurks in the blood of the leaders of the Kagomurasaki...and within you.
154	How...?
155	You...! H-how much do you know?!	VO_knightm.knightm_sys_0025
156	I studied what was necessary to put an end to the chaos.	VO_rifa.rifa_sys_0004
157	Yomi, the power inside of you has already begun to stir, hasn't it?
158	The corruption caused by these troubled times in Wadatsumi was likely the trigger; coupled with your hatred for your brother, of course—but I'm sure you already knew that.
159	Ngghhhh! Arrrrrggggghhhhhh!	VO_yomi.yomi_battle_0026
160	Something needs to be done about that demon.
161	Yeah, so that's why I've gotta go and exterminate some demons. Or, exorcise? Whatever you'd call it.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
162	Will you really be all right on your own?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0031
163	It's a direct order from my big sis. If I don't go by myself, holy crap, but will I be hearing about it. By that, I mean I'll suffer. Terrible suffering. So much suffering.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
164	Seriously, though, I don't understand anything she says in her letters anymore!
165	You don't understand her instructions, but you're afraid of what will happen if you don't follow them?	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0016
166	Outrageous, right? But it is what it is.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0005
167	She's, erm, rather strict, isn't she? Your sister.	VO_vetel.vetel_event_1015
168	You don't even know the half of it. She's got the kind of strength that can turn your hair white with a single blow!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0018
169	So that's why...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0045
170	Aw, come on. That was clearly a joke.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
171	...
172	I've heard that without anyone left to govern it, Wadatsumi has fallen into a state of chaos. I know that you are capable, Ren, but...	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0030
173	Greed Dike's in the process of doing something about that. Unexpectedly, they're actually trying to fix it. Didn't see that coming.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0004
174	I told you, I'll be fine! I'll come home safe and sound. The Scarlet Flame Guard still needs me, right?	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
175	Of course!	VO_vetel.vetel_sys_0004
176	Hm? Where are you going, Ren?	VO_natalie.natalie_chara_1002
177	Oh, hi, Natalie! I'm just going to pop over to Wadatsumi.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0006
178	Wadatsumi?! By the gods, what could you possibly have to do there?!	VO_natalie.natalie_sys_0006
179	That's a fantastic question!	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
180	What?
181	I have to follow orders, or else. You get it.	VO_ren.ren_chara_2006
182	It feels great to come back to good old Wadatsumi! Now, if only I knew what I was supposed to be doing.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0030
183	Incriminate demons... Incriminate? What was it my big sis said? Something about carnal power...? No—incorporate? De...corporate...?	VO_ren.ren_chara_1006
184	Nah, there's no way she said something like that. Ahh, at this rate, she's gonna be so mad at me! I'm not ready...
185	But I guess that's life. A rule, or a tradition, or something...	VO_ren.ren_chara_2006
186	Outrageous, really.
187	Huh?!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0026
188	Hey! Who are you? Are you a friend of this guy?	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0002
189	Huh?! No, no, no! Nothing like that. I was just passing through.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0025
190	...
191	Seriously? Come on! I only just arrived in Wadatsumi!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
192	I don't care. Let's just kill him, too!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
193	Whaaaaat?! Why do you have to go straight to killing?! Hey, you, say something already!	VO_ren.ren_sys_0050
194	Protect yourself.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0003
195	...
196	What is it?	VO_zin.zin_chara_1002
197	You're...injured.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0003
198	It's just a scratch.	VO_zin.zin_sys_0039
199	Wow. Didn't even try to make it a believable lie. That is clearly a sword wound.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0007
200	...
201	What are you babbling about?! Tch... I don't know whose clan you're from, but it seems like they haven't taught you manners!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0016
202	It must be a puny, pathetic little clan that nobody has ever heard of!	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
203	Hey, what? It's like you've never even met my sister! Oh, wait. You haven't.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0016
204	Fine. I'll help you out.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0037
205	What?	VO_zin.zin_sys_0006
206	Just as long as you protect your own butt.	VO_ren.ren_sys_0001
