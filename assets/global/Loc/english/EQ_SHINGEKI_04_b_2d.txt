001	Grrrrrrrrrrroooooooaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!
002	Ah! Don't let the blood touch you!	VO_judith.judith_chara_1002
003	Ngh! Arrgghh!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0027
004	Watch your step! Its blood will turn this place into a poisonous swamp! You have to watch out for the miasma too!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
005	I see... Not only is it capable of spraying out poisonous gas, but the toxin is also present in its blood. How interesting.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0044
006	Get back here!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0042
007	Dangit! I'm out of gas!	VO_eren.eren_sys_0027
008	There is no need to be reckless. We killed the Titans. This is not a failure.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
009	Right. It's not going to be easy to fight in this kind of treacherous terrain without gas. We'll need a plan of attack.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0004
010	It doesn't seem like our swords are capable of splitting open its armored hide.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0018
011	Armor, huh... I heard about this earlier.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0039
012	Even if we find their weakness, it's meaningless if our attacks can't affect the beasts.
013	So long as we have their weakness pinned down, I should be able to do something with my Mecha Weapon!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0044
014	It does seem more likely to have an effect. As to whether it can actually pierce their armor... That remains to be seen.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
015	Tch. Giant Taurus, Titans, and now Reiner... We have a lot to deal with here.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
016	Why do you keep calling him your enemy?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
017	I will tell you about it when we get back to the Temple. For now, we need to find more gas for our omni-directional mobility gear. We cannot fight those creatures without it.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0005
018	Do you have gas in this world?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0002
019	Of course we do! But, um... I'm not sure if it's the right kind of gas. It might not work well with your gear.	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
020	Do you mind if I take a look at it? I already know how it's put together, but...	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
021	I need to investigate it in a little more detail to see if our gas would be compatible or not.
022	I suppose it can't be helped. Be quick about it. They could come back at any moment.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0030
023	You can count on me! If there's one thing I know, it's machines!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0007
024	Why do you think the Giant Taurus called those Titans anyway? Actually, how did it even know how to do that in the fir—?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0031
025	Wait! Do you hear that?! Is it...?! We're in trouble!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0025
026	Tch. Talk about bad timing.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0026
