001	Ohh, that was so scary!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
002	We were able to fight as usual in this world.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0016
003	Piece of cake, as always!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
004	That happened so suddenly, I was surprised!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0029
005	You're such a scaredy-cat. And it's not like you lack the ability in battle.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0030
006	Oh, don't say that!	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0042
007	Oh...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0010
008	Hey, this fighting has gotten me hungry! To get to know more about this world, why don't we visit a city and get ourselves something to eat?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
009	Well, gathering information is important.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0045
010	Time to eat! Time to eat!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0023
011	Hey, wait!	VO_shaman.shaman_battle_0023
012	As I thought, Yggdrasil is nowhere to be seen. And instead, there's this huge tower. This is not Arcania indeed.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0031
013	Hey, look there! It's a city! I wonder if they have anything delicious!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0025
014	Hey, that's our guild! This city does feel kind of different from Iorys! Ehehe, let's find a place to eat first!
015	If we need to gather information, we've got to find ourselves a bar. Let's go.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0002
016	Huh?! Hmm... I suppose they should have some food at a bar too...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0017
017	Yeah, they probably should.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0045
018	Alright then!<br>Time to eat! Time to eat!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0007
019	Hi Mister! I would like three fried-egg breads!
020	Hm? Where are you from, young lady? We don't have any such thing on the menu here.
021	What?! Are you serious...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0017
022	Judging by your appearance, you don't seem to be from around here.
023	Right, we're from Iorys on the continent of Arcania.	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0037
024	Never heard of that. We don't have this thing you call fried-egg bread, but what do you think about our specialty here?
025	Whoa! It looks delicious!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0024
026	It smells nice.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0009
027	Wait a moment. These aren't yen, but I got my hands on this money earlier.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0002
028	Mister, can I pay you with this money?
029	Yes, food for three people would be 1600 Zeni. The sparkling water is on the house.
030	Thanks a lot!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0009
031	By the way, has anything unusual happened around here these days?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0003
032	Hmm, let's see. I've heard several stories of some unusual monsters appearing in the nearby forest.
033	Some unusual monsters?<br>Could that be...	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0042
034	Were they able to eliminate those monsters?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0009
035	No... The knight faction has been on the job, but the monsters are just causing more and more destruction.
036	They're apparently quite fierce. Some of the knights who got wounded made it back to the city.
037	Hmm...	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0018
038	Hey, we have to hurry to go and defeat them! That girl earlier said they need us for that, didn't she?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0001
039	Did you finish eating already?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0002
040	Oh, n-not yet...gulp...	VO_shaman.shaman_battle_0019
041	There's no sense in hurrying though. We need to properly prepare ourselves first.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0030
042	Thanks for the food, Mister! It was very delicious!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0033
043	Glad to hear that! Oh, could it be that you're about to go and hunt down those monsters?
044	Yes, that's our plan.	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0004
045	There's one thing that caught my attention.
046	?
047	After the reports of the appearance of those monsters, another strange rumor started spreading.
048	Another strange rumor?	VO_reaper.reaper_sys_0031
049	They say there's a female knight called "Black Dame" who has been fighting the monsters, and that she has been attacking the knight faction as well.
050	Black Dame?	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0006
051	Uhhh, that sounds scary.	VO_shaman.shaman_sys_0028
052	I don't know the exact details, but please be careful, just in case.
053	Alright, thank you, Mister!	VO_fencer.fencer_sys_0037
