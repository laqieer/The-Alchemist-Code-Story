001	What? I can't unleash my power! Why can't I beat them?	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0016
002	Perhaps you don't know about Alchemia?
003	Alchemia? What's that?
004	Hmm...I guess I was right. Alchemia works in all things within this world.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
005	Well, what does Alchemia have to do with me not being able to beat them?
006	By using Alchemy to control Alchemia, all the laws of this world run smoothly.
007	Hmm. I guess I should practice this Alchemia—no, Alchemy—and gain strength?	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0045
008	Yes, that's right.	VO_uroboros.uroboros_sys_0006
009	I see. It's good to set goals. Just you wait. I'll unleash my dormant Alchemia soon enough!	VO_vargas.vargas_sys_0032
010	Heheh. You have a passionate soul. Well then, I will observe how you do.
