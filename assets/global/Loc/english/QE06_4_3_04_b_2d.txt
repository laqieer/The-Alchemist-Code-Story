001	Uncle?	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0005
002	Do demons not have that concept?	VO_kouga.kouga_sys_0001
003	That doesn't even matter anymore. Demon or human, a brother's a brother, a wife's a wife, and an uncle's an uncle. Isn't that what you always say, Koga?
004	I don't entirely understand.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
005	But if they are precious to you, then they are precious to me.
006	I will look after them, even at the cost of my own life.
007	Ngh!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
008	Did you remember something?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
009	Or are you still pretending so much of your life never happened?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0031
010	If it's the latter... Aren't you basically just pretending our mother never existed? That her wishes meant nothing to you?
011	Is that really the kind of pretending you want to do, Uncle Tamba?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
012	I must...destroy...all humans...	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0021
013	Must you, though, Uncle Tamba?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0002
014	Or is that someone else's desire?
015	S-silence!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0015
016	If there's something that keeps you bound to this path against your will...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0014
017	...then we'd like to free you of that.	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0004
018	My will is my own!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
019	Then how come Sumeragi could be reforged using your horn?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0002
020	What are you insinuating?!	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0025
021	If it truly is your desire to destroy humanity, then why did your horn respond to our wishes?	VO_amane.amane_sys_0004
022	I dare say it's because somewhere deep inside, you still carry feelings for the Wadatsumi of old. In fact, I'm sure of it!
023	No...!
024	Now, now, you two. Don't go grabbing at your uncle's horns. You'll bother him.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0012
025	...They aren't afraid of my horns?
026	They're too young to understand such things. Besides, you've always been kind to them, so why would they be?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0004
027	I hope they grow up thinking neither horns nor the demons they're attached to are all that scary. Wouldn't a world like that be a nice place to live?	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0007
028	…It just might.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0045
029	Tamba?
030	I've been thinking that perhaps I should snap off my horns and cast off my demon appearance, like you.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0037
031	You don't have to do that! It doesn't matter what you look like. Whether you're a demon or a human makes no difference in the end.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0039
032	We're headed toward a Wadatsumi where there is no divide between demons and humans. And you're one of the people protecting that world.	VO_kaede.kaede_sys_0003
033	I see. In that case, I'll no longer think of these horns as things to be feared, but to be used in the defense of others...
034	Since that's the Wadatsumi you long to see.	VO_tanba.tanba_favorite_0003
035	......
036	Hey, Uncle Tamba? What kind of future do you actually want for Wadatsumi?	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0001
037	Surely it can't be all that different from what our parents and Lady Mitsuha wanted, right?	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0001
038	...Silence.	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0027
039	Because even if you don't remember, we do. Whenever you ruffled our hair, your hand always felt so warm and gentle on our heads.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0004
040	Yeah. Please don't pretend like those times never happened. For our mother's sake...	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0041
041	For the sake of all who wish for peace...	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0041
042	And for our sake.
043	Agh! Why won't you shut up?!	VO_tanba.tanba_battle_0019
044	...!
045	Like I said, our time here is limited.	VO_mikaboshi.mikaboshi_sys_0002
046	We'll have to return to these sacred vessels soon. But before we do, we wanted to make sure to deliver our message to you:	VO_sumeragi.sumeragi_sys_0002
047	Don't forget, there are people here who sincerely wish for your happiness.
048	...	VO_tanba.tanba_sys_0031
049	......
050	Amane!	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0002
051	Huff...huff... I thought...I could go a little longer...	VO_amane.amane_sys_0020
052	That was plenty long. Longer than anyone could've hoped for, I think.	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0039
053	Uh, what just happened, exactly?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0003
054	The rookie finally made herself useful, that's what.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0006
055	I think we got through to him...even if only just.	VO_amane.amane_sys_0031
056	We can only pray you're right!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
057	Indeed. Because if you didn't, we're still in for quite a scrap.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0001
058	Captain Ugachi...!
059	Can we really end this without bloodshed? Tanosuke certainly wouldn't approve of us letting our emotions get the better of us, I'm sure.	VO_ugachi.ugachi_sys_0002
060	So, then... Options?	VO_edgar.edgar_sys_0031
061	Frankly, I don't think we know yet what our options are. We have to wait and see how Tamba will respond. Best not to let your guard down, though, just in case.	VO_juubei.juubei_sys_0002
062	...
063	I...
064	...
065	I was...
