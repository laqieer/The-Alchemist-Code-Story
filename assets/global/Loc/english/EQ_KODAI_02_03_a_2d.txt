001	...Erg
002	Hey hey, Carnet, you're not stealing again, are you?
003	...Will you shut up? I'll win next time.	VO_karne.karne_battle_0019
004	Even so, you're all outta cash, aren't you? Or what, are you gonna steal from Lord Aedith's pocketbook again?
005	It's not stealing, all right? His money is my money.
006	I'm the only reason he's still alive, so sharing his cash is the least he can do.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0004
007	...Speaking of which, it seems there was another attempt on Lord Aedith's life.
008	There certainly have been a lot of those lately. That man has made more than his fair share of enemies...
009	Resentment, grudges, karma... They're all a load of crap.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0030
010	Life speeds by like a bullet, and we've all pulled the trigger.
011	Once it smashes into something, the journey's over.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0010
012	...Well, you're right that we've only got one life to live, I guess.
013	Hey Carnet! Lord Aedith is calling for you!
014	...Time to get to work.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0031
015	All right, well watch yourself out there, Carnet.
016	Lord Aedith cares about you, you know. He couldn't bear to lose you.
017	Thanks, but we're not like that at all.
018	You called for me, Aedith?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0006
019	Ah, there you are, my angel.
020	So? Who am I gonna kill next?
021	Well, you certainly get right to the point. Some of the others around here could stand to learn a thing or two from that.
022	What's with all the flattery today? Did something bad happen?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0001
023	I barely said a thing!
024	Ah, but, well... Just a bit of trouble with someone, but nothing to concern yourself about.
025	I won't. So what's the job?	VO_karne.karne_sys_0016
026	Oh, I have quite the wholesome assignment for you today. There are some vermin infesting this layer and I need you to be my exterminator.
027	Vermin?
028	--Target in sight.	VO_karne.karne_battle_0001
029	Graaaaa!?
030	Kill confirmed. That's gotta be the last of 'em...right?
031	Such a pain in the ass...	VO_karne.karne_sys_0030
032	How did I get stuck out here hunting beasts? When he said "vermin," I didn't think he meant *actual* vermin! What the hell is he thinking...?
033	...Tch	VO_karne.karne_battle_0019
034	Wait, that sound... A dragon?
035	...Well you did better than I expected, at least... But your landing could use some work...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
036	Well sorry, but it's the best I could do given the circumstances.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0035
037	Yeah, it looks like they shot through your wing joint. You're not gonna die, but it's not great either.
038	I don't think I can fly anymore. And becoming a dragon again is off the table for now.
039	*sigh* ...But we sure did manage to escape, didn't we!?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0023
040	This must be...the Sloth Layer? The layers are all in flux here, so it's hard to say just how far we came.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
041	For now, we should just look for a settlement. We need to get your wounds treated.
042	Does something like that even exist out here? I heard the Sloth Layer is deserted.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0025
043	Well, it's true there are no dragons out this far, but there should still be plenty of people.
044	Oh, I see... I'm a bit worried that I might stand out, then.
045	You're not wrong there. But they say this is the kind of place where everyone stands out.
046	What do you mean?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
047	The Sloth Layer is a land of corruption and depravity--a melting pot of all the worst parts of humanity, forsaken by even the most merciful of dragons.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
048	Hey, you over there... How about a little fun? I'm cheaper than I look...
049	How about some gold?! Takes decor to the next level! Cures what ails ya! Or how about a full set of gold teeth?!
050	Watch where you're going! You wanna die!?
051	This is...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0004
052	Yep, the Sloth Layer's largest pleasure district...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
053	Redington.
054	"Pleasure," like...?
055	People don't shy away from their desires here. In Redington, pleasure is life.
056	It looks like it's grown quite a bit since I was last here though.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
057	Come to think of it, you said you were on a trip, right?
058	Yeah, didn't you realize? I'm on my honeymoon... Not. I'm traveling solo.
059	At any rate, this isn't the kind of place you'd want to live.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
060	For everyone here, their own enjoyment comes first. They couldn't care less about anyone else. In other words, it's the perfect place to hide.
061	Plus I've got a few old acquaintances here. They should be able to help us out.
062	...You've been helping me out, so maybe I shouldn't say this, but...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
063	You don't seem like the kind of person who'd have a lot of friends.
064	Pfft, and just what's that supposed to mean?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
065	Or, maybe you hadn't noticed, yourself...?
066	Heh, heh...
067	What are you on about? ...Look, stop gawking at everything around you before you crash into something.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
068	No, it's just I've never seen this many people all at once before and--ow!
069	...Anyway, for now let's just get you treated and get some rest.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
070	Follow me. The inn I used to stay at is down here...
071	...A dragon? Here? ...I should tell Aedith about this.	VO_karne.karne_sys_0031
072	Ow, ow, ow!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0042
073	Stop squirming! This salve from my hometown works wonders, but it stains, so sit still.
074	Oi! I said sit still!	VO_matia.matia_battle_0019
075	...Hey, watch it! You're going to give me even more scars!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0003
076	So then stop moving. ...Ok, that should do it for the treatment. How's the wing? Can you move it?
077	...
078	Not really. I don't think this wound is going to heal so easily. Something about that bullet must be disrupting the Magil...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0030
079	Yishai Ignacio... They say his gun can kill dragons. And from the looks of it, it was no exaggeration.
080	I could sure use a weapon like that...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0044
081	I don't know if you're dextrous enough to handle a delicate weapon like that.
082	Hmph, rude.
083	Anyway--
084	I really appreciate how you helped me, Matia. It's because of you that I escaped from Ophioneus.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0033
085	We had a deal, remember? I'm just holding up my end. Make sure you do the same.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
086	Well, to be honest, I kinda figured you'd take off as soon as I told you how to kill a dragon.
087	Please, I'm not that heartless. I mean, I am heartless, but not *that* heartless.
088	You do realize that staying with me puts a target on your back...	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
089	I'm counting on it. That Yishai guy should make another appearance sooner or later.
090	...What, are you looking for a fight, or something?
091	You know the best thing about you? You've got a lot of enemies. That's why I like you.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0007
092	That is *not* the best thing about me!
093	Hey there, girls! You got a moment?
094	Eep!
095	What do you think you're doing, entering a girl's room without knocking?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0012
096	If I didn't already know you, you'd be dead right now.
097	What about you--trying to kill someone all of a sudden in their own establishment!?
098	Do you two...know each other?
099	Yeah, last time I was in this layer, I saved this poor guy's life.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0005
100	And I gave you free food for a month, so how about a little gratitude?
101	...Did that happen?
102	Yes!!
103	Erm, at any rate, did you need something from us?	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0001
104	Right, right. I was actually gonna ask you to take on a job like last time. You're still broke, I assume.
105	...Maybe.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0016
106	(What does it take to get a straight answer out of this girl?)	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0011
107	There've been some beasts running amok around town lately. The merchants have already been attacked several times.
108	And?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0001
109	In this town, other people's problems can make for a good source of income. The town's leader, Lord Aedith, has offered a reward to anyone who can get rid of 'em.
110	So how about it? Think you're up to the task?
111	Hmm, sounds interesting...	VO_matia.matia_sys_0045
112	Let's do it, Schmeier.
113	Ok, well you stay safe out there!
114	You're coming too. Get off the bed and let's go.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0039
115	But I'm hurt...
116	Come on, just spit on it or something and it'll heal right up.
117	I already told you it's not healing!	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0042
118	Well, we've got no choice. There's no such thing as a free meal.
119	But you got a whole month of free meals!
120	We'll take the job.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0029
121	Well all right then. I'm counting on you girls!
122	...That girl is something else. Never thought she'd bring a dragon guest to my inn.
123	I can't even remember how many years it's been since I saw one of them in this layer.
124	...I'm just going to tell you now: I can't do anything but provide some support.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_sys_0031
125	That'll be plenty. I just need you here to lure in the beasts. They love the smell of blood.
126	So you're just using me as a piece of meat?
127	What's wrong with meat?	VO_matia.matia_sys_0006
128	...
129	GRAAAAAAHHHH!
130	Looks like we've got some takers already.	VO_matia.matia_sys_0004
131	...Hold on. There's something strange about those beasts.	VO_schmeier.schmeier_battle_0019
132	What's with all this magil? Creatures like them shouldn't be able to hold anywhere near that much.
133	Is that so? Well, we'll see how strong they are without their heads. Take this!	VO_matia.matia_sys_0010
134	Hey! Are you even listening to me!?
