001	Strong and gentle... A great and wonderful person, who paved the way to the future for many therians.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0027
002	The person I admire!
003	She’s the only person I can listen to stories about and never feel any pain in my ears. In fact, I want to constantly hear stories about her.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0007
004	No one thought it was possible, but she did it. The great therian who found a place among the humans in Envylia.
005	Nobody expected anything of her at the beginning. But she accomplished everything through her iron will. That’s my goal.
006	Will I be able to meet the expectations that everyone has of me back home? I just don’t know. I don’t like this weak side of me.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0030
007	That’s why I look up to her. Her and her iron will.
008	I want to be like her. I’ll reach for my aspirations and overcome all obstacles.
009	That’s why I have trained so much thus far. That’s why I have become stronger.
010	I will join the Scarlet Flame Guard. If I want to reach and surpass my aspirations, I have no other choice.
011	There aren’t any problems. I’m progressing as planned.
012	...Or so I thought.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
013	This girl is so talented! I’m sure she’ll be the next hero of Nina’s caliber!
014	As you are a representative of the Long-Tail Rabbit Clan, this Greatsword, passed down the generations of therians, is now bestowed upon you.
015	A Greatsword made by a blacksmith to match the athletic prowess of therians. Impressive, isn’t it?
016	Open up a new future for the therians with this! I’m counting on you, Sharon!
017	Thank you very much, for giving me such an extravagant farewell.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0034
018	While he may be of a different race, D’Artagnan was the only other therian, aside from Nina, to rise to the esteemed rank of vice-captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.
019	With your talent, I’m sure you’ll be able to reach and surpass them! We’re expecting a lot of you!
020	I should be happy they have high hopes of me. I shouldn’t have any problems.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0029
021	Why is it that every time I remember that song, my ears hurt?
022	I think about it every time my ears hurt.
023	I’m still weak.
024	And she’s still out of my reach.
025	Are you okay? Does that sword remind you of something?	VO_berta.berta_sys_0001
026	It’s nothing... I can do the drills without any problems.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_1039
027	Um, Sharon. About that Greatsword...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0031
028	Let’s start! Like I mentioned earlier, today we will be hunting nearby goblins.
029	I’ll be grading you on how long it takes you to hunt, how many you hunt, and so on. This is closely related to your future paths.
030	Please give it your all. I’m counting on all of you strong young rising stars to protect Envylia. Instructors, please watch over your students.
031	...All right, let’s begin the drills!
032	(So noisy... My ears hurt...)	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0018
033	Wait! Don’t go ahead.	VO_berta.berta_chara_1010
034	It’ll be fine. I haven’t trained all these years just to get defeated by goblins.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0010
035	But...	VO_berta.berta_sys_0020
036	You can just watch. This won’t take me long.	VO_sharon.sharon_sys_0016
037	I will slice open the future with this Greatsword. So that I can become as strong as the person I admire, and then surpass her!
