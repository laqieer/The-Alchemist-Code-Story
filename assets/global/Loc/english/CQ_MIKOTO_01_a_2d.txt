001	And then? Then? Then what happened?! Oh, now that I think about it, I'm also curious to know how the last story ended...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0002
002	U-um, Shrine Maiden Mikoto... The time...	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0003
003	Oh, is that the time already?! The food will get cold. You can retire now.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
004	Yes, Shrine Maiden Mikoto. I will retrieve the tableware later. Please, excuse me.	VO_knightf.knightf_sys_0004
005	Sigh... Hm? Oh, no, it's nothing...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0030
006	After all, I have the Gods to talk to...
007	Huh? What's the matter? Why do the Gods sound so happy? That's odd. There's a different voice than usual.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0025
008	Sniff, sniff. The smell is coming from here! Come on. It's fine, Kon. If we get in trouble, we can just say we're sorry!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1011
009	Whaaa?! We might not be forgiven even if we say we're sorry! Aww, but it smells so interesting!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1009
010	U-umm... There isn't any food here anymore, you know?	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0003
011	Whoaa?! Sorry! I'm just a passerby!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0021
012	Oh, could you be the new handmaid?! Oh, but you're a passerby...	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0007
013	Oh, ye-yeah, that's it! Yeah! I'm a...passerby handmaid?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0025
014	Um... Isn't a handmaid supposed to be a stationary position?	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0003
015	Aah, Kon, don't get upset! Fine, I'll apologize to her for lying!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0029
016	I'm Tamamo. Something smelled good, so I came to investigate, but...you scared me, so I lied without thinking.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0031
017	...I'm sorry.	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0036
018	Heheh. I see. The Gods don't appear to be angry, so...I'm sure you're a good person.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0007
019	Aha! I'm glad I didn't get in trouble! Oh, but I'm not a person... I'm a fox! Plus, I have nine tails!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0007
020	Wow! That's amazing! I've never met anyone besides the Gods before, so it's an honor!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0044
021	As a sign of friendship, you can stroke my fluffy tail if you want... Oh, what's your name again?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0010
022	I am Mikoto! Heheh. What a lovely day to be able to talk to you like this, Lady Tamamo.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0005
023	Lady?! It tickles when you call me that! You can just call me Tamamo!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1011
024	All right then...Tamamo. Heheh. Your tails tickle too. Oh dear, something seems to be causing a stir amongst the Gods.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0007
025	Hm? Hey, what's the matter, Kon? You have a bad feeling about something? What do you mean?	VO_tamamo.tamamo_sys_0006
026	I sense something strange. It's a far outcry from when you arrived here. A very unpleasant presence is within the grounds.	VO_mikoto.mikoto_sys_0027
027	Eeek! How did the beasts get so far inside!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_battle_0025
028	I know this place is comfortable, but you weren't invited here! Once you receive your scolding, hurry on back to the mountain!	VO_tamamo.tamamo_chara_1010
029	I don't know if I can...scold them...but I'll help you out, Tamamo!	VO_mikoto.mikoto_battle_0030
