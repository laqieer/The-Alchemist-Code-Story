001	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
002	Hissssssssssssssss!
003	Groogh!
004	Hah! Did you see that?! How do you like my Engineer Soldier's beam attack?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0016
005	The corrupted beasts are scattering.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0024
006	Looks like you've powered up the Soldier since we fought it, too.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0006
007	Oh, yeah. The levels of magil are really concentrated around here. The Soldier is almost overpowered!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
008	(I've fixed the Soldier to keep it from absorbing magil from Emmel, but its output is still crazy high... Where is it all coming from?)	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
009	Perhaps it has something to do with Sephiron?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0031
010	It's possible that this "magil" is the same substance as Sephiron Particles.
011	Sephiron...Particles?	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_1018
012	They are a fundamental part of Spiritbonding. Supposedly, the village is full of them, although they are quite invisible to the naked eye.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0044
013	Come to think of it, the Engineer Soldier has been working like a dream since I got here.	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0031
014	It's certainly something I'd like to investigate when we have the time.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0030
015	But for now, our priority is helping Julia.	VO_waginao-c.waginao-c_sys_0004
016	Hold on, Julia... We're coming!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
017	So please... Please be all right!
018	Still...
019	What is it?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
020	Our way forward isn't going to be easy.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
021	Wh-what do you...?	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0025
022	Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
023	Aahh!
024	A mass outbreak of corrupted beasts... If left unchecked, Sephiron will deteriorate to a brittle husk!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0022
025	Don't worry, Nimul.	VO_emmer.emmer_chara_1010
026	Ngh...	VO_emmer.emmer_battle_0019
027	Emmel!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
028	I-I'm fine. I can't afford to rest until we've saved Julia!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
029	Holy hell... There are so many of them!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
030	Don't panic. It's going to be all right.	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0010
031	With your Engineer Soldier, Adaleigh, and my powers of purification...
032	Not to mention my brother's new technique... I know that we will find hope.
033	Hope...
034	Hell yeah! If we team up, we've got nothing to fear! Not even a swarm of those beasts will stand a chance against us!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0004
035	Say no more. Let's go.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0004
036	Graaawwwwrrrrrr!
037	Huzzzzaaaaahhh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
038	(Hope... That's it!)
039	(My hope...is to save Emmel from the twisted way of the world...)
040	(To liberate her from the confines of this world tainted by sin. And I will! She will be free!)
041	The history of this world has been warped countless times...
042	And on each and every occasion, the world has been altered, and so met its end.
043	That cannot be allowed to happen again. I must protect it.
044	I will be the one to protect this world from those who would attempt to change it.
045	Wh-why...?	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
046	Why? Haa...haaa... Why...would you...think that?
047	How can you believe that...you can change the world...by hurting people...defiling the tree...corrupting the land...and casting us all into sin?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0013
048	...
049	Nothing you are doing amounts to protecting the world at all! Can you not see how your actions contradict your very goal?!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
050	There are no contradictions here.
051	Sin is the foundation of this world. It must be left undisturbed.
052	How can you possibly think that?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
053	I heard it from the source.
054	Wh-what are you talking about?! The source? What—?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0025
055	God.
056	What?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0026
057	The one who made this world...or at least the present incarnation of it.
058	I... I don't understand.
059	...
060	Nothing you are saying makes any sense.	VO_julia.julia_sys_0018
061	Humankind has made every effort to survive, despite the weight of their sins upon their shoulders.
062	Struggling, clawing, suffering our way through this cruel world...
063	Yet despite it all, I will survive!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0042
064	For the person I love, and for his beloved little sister!
065	That. That is the sin of humankind.
066	What...?
067	Are you...going to kill me?	VO_julia.julia_sys_0027
068	Taking life is not part of my objective here.
069	How can you say that?! After all the blood you've shed... Did it mean nothing to you?!	VO_julia.julia_sys_0013
070	You would unleash the Cursed Beast upon us, and yet you act now in mercy?!
071	Do you know how many lives you have endangered? How many people will die at the hands of that creature?!
072	I merely did what was necessary to liberate humankind from sin.
073	Do our lives mean nothing to you?!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0022
074	Julia!
075	We're here to help!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0042
076	L-Lady Emmel...!	VO_julia.julia_battle_0019
077	Are you...? What am I saying? You're clearly injured. Emmel, would you treat her wounds?	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
078	Of course!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
079	Lord Nimul, I... Oh... Lord...Nimul...
080	So...this is that black knight you were talking about?	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0001
081	...
082	That's right! He hurt Julia and attempted to unleash the Cursed Beast!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0004
083	Who the hell are you?! Explain yourself!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0003
084	From the crown rises the path that will lead us to the kingdom—Ngh...!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0004
085	...
086	What the...?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0027
087	Impossible. Spiritbonding doesn't work on him?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0020
088	Spiritbonding... The ancient art.
089	No worries! My Engineer Soldier is on the job!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0004
090	Ascend from the depths of the sea, oh shapeless one!
091	What the hell?!	VO_adlai.adlai_battle_0022
092	The beam attack...!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0021
093	It was absorbed into the darkness...	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0020
094	Something as simple as the light of Alchemia cannot harm me.
095	N-no way...!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0018
096	Well, then... How about this?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_battle_0001
097	Huzzaaaaahh!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0032
098	Nrgh!
099	He recoiled!
100	Looks like my new technique works on him after all.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0010
101	What was that just now? Something that is neither Spiritbonding...nor magic?!
102	What is it?!
103	It's a new technique. I developed it myself.	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0005
104	I'm going to use it to make a new world order!
105	A new technique...for a new way of the world. I see.
106	Come forth, servants of the darkness!
107	Wh-what's happening?!	VO_emmer.emmer_sys_0027
108	Where the hell did they come from?!	VO_adlai.adlai_sys_0027
109	Who are these people?!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0025
110	Now, my servants... Go!
111	...
112	Here they come! Get ready!	VO_nimuru.nimuru_sys_0018
