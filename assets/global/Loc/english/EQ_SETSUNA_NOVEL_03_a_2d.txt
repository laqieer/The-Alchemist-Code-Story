001	Hrahh! Huzzah!
002	Very good. That's enough training for today.
003	Heheh. Thank you so much, Setsuna!
004	It's a little later than I thought. Are you okay? Tired at all?
005	I'm tired, but I'm okay!
006	That's good.
007	Hey, why are the lights in the house off?
008	Huh. Maybe Sis isn't home yet?
009	She did mention something about a ritual before. Maybe it's running late?
010	Hmm. I wouldn't know.
011	Well, let's get dinner ready for her so she can—
012	Wait.
013	Setsuna? What's wrong?
014	Shush! There's someone in the house.
015	What could they be doing in there with the lights off? Jayme, you stay back. I'll go have a look.
016	G-got it.
017	...
018	Oh, Setsuna. Welcome home.
019	Macherie?
020	Yes, it's me. Is Jayme not with you?
021	The lights were off, so I had him hang back just in case something was wrong.
022	Lights? Oh, I'm so sorry! I can see without them, so I completely forgot to...
023	Hahah. I'm sorry. I'm just so out of it.
024	Sis?
025	Welcome home, Jayme. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
026	I'm okay, but...are you tired, Sis?
027	Um, yes, my shrine duties must have me worn out a little. I guess this is why I'm still just an apprentice.
028	...
029	If you're tired, why not let us take care of things and go get some rest?
030	I'm fine! Seeing you two has made my exhaustion disappear!
031	If you're sure...
032	Oh, right! I have a gift from the shrine!
033	Cool! What is it?
034	(There's something wrong with Macherie, but...perhaps it isn't my place to ask her about it.)
035	Whoa!
036	You're not focused at all. What's the matter?
037	I-I'm sorry.
038	Hesitation dulls your blade and distractions will slow you down. Remember that.
039	If there's something on your mind, you can tell me.
040	Well...um...
041	It's about Macherie, isn't it?
042	Yeah... Something was up with her last night, don't you think?
043	You obviously know her better than I do, but...yes, I felt the same. You must be worried.
044	She said she was just tired out from her shrine duties, but I've never seen her like that before.
045	Do you want to go investigate?
046	Investigate? You mean the shrine?
047	You're training so that you can protect her, right?
048	Well, yeah, but...we're in the middle of training.
049	Training while you're in this state would be pointless.
050	Besides, if worrying for Macherie's well-being is distracting you from training to protect her, then you've clearly lost sight of the point of all this training.
051	You're doing this for her, aren't you?
052	Y-yeah. I just don't want to get in her way if she's working.
053	Are you afraid of getting scolded?
054	No... No, I'm not! That's... That's not what I'm scared of.
055	Setsuna, let's go!
056	(That's right. To protect the ones I loved, this is what I should have done.)
057	What do you mean Macherie isn't here?
058	N-no need to be so hostile. How am I supposed to go get someone who's not even here?
059	Fair enough. Can you at least tell us where she is?
060	Well, there was the Shrine Monarch's vision... Erm, I mean, Macherie's off somewhere because of her duties as an apprentice, I assume...
061	Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I want to know where she is and what she is doing right now.
062	That's enough, Setsuna. I shouldn't have gotten involved like this to begin with.
063	You've done nothing wrong, Jayme. Your honest concern for Macherie is a good thing.
064	Jayme...
065	All right, all right. I'll tell you, but you didn't hear this from me.
066	We're not interested in getting anybody in trouble.
067	Macherie left the village to go to the ruins alone. For the ritual, she needs—
068	She left the village alone?! She was attacked by a Wildpecker out there not too long ago!
069	Jayme, I'm going to the ruins. You go home.
070	I'm coming, too! I'm just as worried about her as you are!
071	It could be dangerous. I can't allow—
072	Setsuna, please!
073	(He really wants to be there for Macherie. He's such a wonderful kid.)
074	All right. So long as you promise to hide at the first sign of any danger.
075	I promise!
076	Then let's go!
077	I wasn't done talking... I hope they'll be all right. That ruin...they don't know what's waiting there.
078	This must be the place. If she's not out here, she must be inside.
079	I hope she's okay. Look...
080	Monsters like that? Here?! And so many of them!
081	Damn it!
082	(There's no time to hesitate. We can figure out the why later!)
083	I won't let you take her!
084	Oh no! That one noticed us!
085	Ssssssss!
086	I won't let you take her away from him!
087	I'll destroy you all!
