001	Look! Water! There's water!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0046
002	It's been so long since I've seen so much water!
003	It's so cold!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0008
004	She's like a little kid.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
005	Kinda.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
006	Seeing her like this makes it hard to believe what she told us last night.
007	Gluttony Foss has been ruled by one king for the past hundred years.
008	One king?! I mean, I could understand if it was a Great Sprite like Voda, but a human?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
009	Impossible, I know. That's one of the reasons why he's a monster, right?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
010	Exactly. He controls amorphous demons and devours people, robbing them of their Alchemia in order to extend his life.
011	Amorphous demons? You don't mean—!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
012	I heard that they were called the Jam.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0039
013	No!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0027
014	The king's power is now well beyond that of any human.
015	He is the embodiment of gluttony. A monster that devours land, people, and life.
016	The nobility of Gluttony Foss have obeyed him blindly, fearing what may become of any transgressions, but...
017	The situation changed with the failure at Saga.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
018	Yes. The king is weakened after failing to acquire Beelzebub.
019	With the purifying power of the Sephira's Protector, we may now defeat the king.
020	We may now return the country of Gluttony Foss to its people!
021	She wants to restore the country to how it should be. That's not really something that I can understand, to be honest.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
022	Me neither, but there's something about her that makes me feel empathetic.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
023	I think she knew she had to change, that she had to make changes to protect what must be protected, and resolved to do just that.
024	Yeah...
025	I was surprised, though, to hear you invite her along with us.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
026	What do you mean?	VO_tina.tina_chara_1009
027	Well, you're usually a bit more withdrawn with people. What brought about this change in you?	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
028	She...looked sad.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0004
029	I just thought to myself, what would Lisbeth do? And it just sort of came out.
030	Hmm... I think this is a good thing.	VO_moca.moca_sys_1011
031	It's about time you learned to open up to people, Tina.
032	Hold on, look who's talking!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
033	When are you going to start smiling more? Didn't you learn anything from Lisbeth?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
034	Uh, you were the one saying that I should do what comes naturally to me, remember?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0042
035	Yeah, but you're the last person I need telling me to open up to people!	VO_tina.tina_battle_1016
036	Both of you, please! Won't you include me in your little chat?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0030
037	You shouldn't be fighting. We're here to have some fun in the water, aren't we?
038	...
039	...
040	Erm...hello? You're starting to frighten me.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
041	Ahhh! Wait, that's not fair! It's two against one!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0027
042	Oh no... My clothes are all wet.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0018
043	Sorry, Marie. I got a little carried away back there.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0035
044	Here, use this cloth to dry yourself off. Sorry about that.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0007
045	Ah, thank you! Umf...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0031
046	Marie! Don't take your clothes off here! Have you no shame?!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0026
047	Huh? But I'd hate to catch a cold. Shouldn't I at least wring out my clothes?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
048	I guess there's no argument as to who's the most open of the three of us.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0030
049	I'm sorry?	VO_mary.mary_chara_1009
050	Th-that mark!	VO_moca.moca_sys_0025
051	Oh, I've had this since birth. It's apparently called the sephirah.	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
052	Hmm... I am afraid I'll definitely catch a cold like this. Shall we return to the inn?
053	What's wrong? Is there something on my face?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
054	Mocca...	VO_tina.tina_sys_0001
055	Yeah, it's the same mark that was on Georgios. She really must be a Sephira.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0037
056	You know my cousin?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
057	Marie, what did you just say?	VO_tina.tina_sys_0025
058	Georgios is my cousin. Oh, well, of course. If you're from Saga, I suppose you would know about him.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0004
059	He was the general in charge of the invasion.
060	You're related to him, Marie?!	VO_tina.tina_sys_0022
061	Could it be that you two know of his whereabouts?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0001
062	Well, we do think he's alive, but...	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
063	Oh, thank goodness.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0044
064	He was not among the army that returned, so I had thought that he may have fallen in battle. I only hope that he is alive...
065	I have to say, I did not see this coming.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
066	Miss Mocca?	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
067	Well... It's just that you're nothing like him.	VO_tina.tina_sys_0031
068	Yeah. Georgios was sort of...a warrior, through and through.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
069	Whereas you're...sweet? Graceful? Totally different.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0031
070	Heheh. I suppose we are different. I was never blessed with his physical strength.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0007
071	You see this cloth? Georgios purified it with his power.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0001
072	I think I can feel his energy within it, but...your wounds...	VO_mary.mary_chara_1012
073	Ah, they're from fighting against the Jam. We came out to this desert in search of a way to purify their corruption.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0004
074	I'm... I'm sorry. Had I been more attuned to my powers...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0022
075	I fear that I may only be able to delay the progression of the corruption for a little while.	VO_mary.mary_sys_0036
076	Don't feel so bad. We started this journey with nothing.	VO_moca.moca_sys_0039
077	Now we're here with someone of the Sephira. We're making progress!
078	I know that my cousin would have been a better contact for you, but...	VO_mary.mary_sys_0031
079	I am fortunate. I never thought that I would find two people who would cooperate with me as you have.
080	All we have to do now is find the Sephira and return to—
081	Forget it. Such a future is not in store for you. Your journey ends here.	VO_thiefm.thiefm_sys_0029
082	What?!	VO_mary.mary_sys_0006
083	Marie!	VO_tina.tina_sys_1050
084	Ngh!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0019
085	Who are you? Why do you stand in my way?	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0001
086	Why...?	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0018
087	What?
088	Why did you kill that child?! Why?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0021
089	This worthless thing? I could barely extract any Alchemia from it.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0005
090	I simply rid myself of worthless livestock. That is all.	VO_stknightm.stknightm_sys_0007
091	Huzzaaaaaaaah!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_battle_0008
