001	This is the...Mikaboshi!
002	The power contained within this...! I see...it appears to truly be comparable to that of a Sacred Stone.	VO_zain.zain_sys_0024
003	What is this...?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0027
004	Don't worry! Most likely, it's responding to the Kagutsuchi power that you have.
005	This means there's, even more, potential that it will work with your skill. It's a moment to celebrate. Let's begin, Kagura.
006	Yes! I'm gonna finish this with one hit. Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0045
007	All right! Destroy it with one blast!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0009
008	...Umphh...!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0042
009	Hyuk! Wh-what...power!
010	Don't hesitate! You can do it with your power! Just focus completely on destroying it!
011	Y-yes...! You thing!!!
012	Whoa! H-how much power is gonna overflow from this thing?!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
013	When put to the test, is that the best you can do with the moves you’ve mastered? ...Hyaaahhh!!!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
014	Lo-Lord Zain...I'm sorry!
015	Don't be silly. You've just mastered this move. You're doing more than enough. Let's finish this, Kagura!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0020
016	Yes! Hyaaahhh!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0004
017	We're going to destroy it before your Alchemia runs out, Kagura! Let's do this!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
018	Zain!!!
019	?!
020	Kudan...!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0026
021	Ughh! Ku-Kudan...?!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
022	Kagura, I'm gonna save you now! Zain...I won't allow you to do as you please! I'm going to protect this world!
023	Ack! What are you saying?!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0042
024	Don't feign ignorance! I see through all of your plans!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0013
025	Ugh! Ugggh!
026	Oh, no! ...Forgive me, Kudan!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0019
027	?! Aghh!!!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
028	Huff...huff! Argh! It's shallow! Kudan will be here again soon!
029	Hwa-hwaaah!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0001
030	Kagura...?!	VO_zain.zain_battle_0016
031	Pl-please, go!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0012
032	Huh?	VO_zain.zain_sys_0025
033	Stop Kudan...hurry!
034	But you'll be on your own...	VO_zain.zain_sys_0022
035	I-I'll be okay! I overcame all that training!	VO_kagura.kagura_sys_0011
036	I won't...hesitate anymore. I promise to destroy the Mikaboshi!
037	But...
038	Pl-please! Stop Kudan! For the sake of my own hesitation as well, please!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0019
039	All right. I'll come back right away!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0037
040	The Mikaboshi! There's no way I'm going to lose to you! Hyaahhh!!!	VO_kagura.kagura_battle_0016
041	Ack...I let my guard down! Hold on, Kagura!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0016
042	Zain!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0026
043	Kudan, open your eyes! You're making some big kind of mistake!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0012
044	Shut up! How could you put Kagura is harm's way like that!	VO_kudhanstein.kudhanstein_sys_0012
045	In order to protect this world, I will end your ploys here and now!
046	It can't be helped. I'm going to have to make you sleep for a while!!!	VO_zain.zain_sys_0016
