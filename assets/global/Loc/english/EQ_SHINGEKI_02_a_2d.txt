001	So...the seeds of despair have been sown again, before the world even has a chance to fully recover from the effects of the Lion Monarch's Charge. Hm? Is that...?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0018
002	That's...?! What is that?! This does not bode well!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0027
003	As Lord Commander, I will protect this continent, and shoulder the will of those who came before me!
004	So you are from a different world from ours...	VO_voda.voda_sys_0031
005	And this...new kind of Giant Taurus is a threat from your world?
006	This is all a little difficult to understand, but it seems that we have at least established the situation.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0044
007	Allow me to express my sincere gratitude. I thank you, warriors from another world, for saving my life.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0033
008	Hmph. We will find this Titan...uh, Taurus, and the girl who was fighting it. I'm counting on you, Hange.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0007
009	There's no wall in this world... Won't it be dangerous out there?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0002
010	That's the point. It does seem crazy, but if what this guy says is true, then...	VO_levi.levi_sys_0005
011	This is not our world. There is no wall here. They are completely unprepared for a Titan attack.
012	Dang it all... Even worse, we don't have any of the supplies we need, like gas or fresh blades.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0022
013	If that girl can really go head to head with a Titan without omni-directional mobility, then we will be needing her help.
014	I just can't believe that we're in a different world. This is incredible!	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
015	I don't know what's going on anymore.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0029
016	You will simply have to adapt. We need to contend with that new Giant Taurus.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0022
017	We must think carefully about what we can do to avoid further damage to the region.
018	Drats!	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_1047
019	Hey! Where are you going?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
020	I need to protect my people.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0005
021	You are as shortsighted as ever, I see. This is this kind of behavior that led us to lose Alia, and put the entirety of Saga in grave danger.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0017
022	Say what you like. I don't care.	VO_hoo.hoo_sys_0010
023	What do you intend to do, then?	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
024	I will return to the Water Temple, for the moment.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0005
025	I am concerned that Asena's condition may worsen as the threat of the Giant Taurus grows more pertinent.
026	It weighs heavily on my mind, but you should know that neither Fuu nor I take this situation lightly, either.
027	Do not be so conceited as to think that only you care for the safety of the land and people of Saga.	VO_voda.voda_sys_0001
028	I do not need a lecture, thank you very much!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0043
029	Hmm... It seems like the people of this world are not necessarily united, either. Oh? Who's this?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
030	The twelfth Lord Commander, Basheeny, has arrived!	VO_basini.basini_sys_0001
031	You...! You came here alone?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0042
032	Huh?!
033	What have you been doing?! We sent you a request for reinforcements quite a while ago!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0013
034	Do you realize how many people have been killed?! I thought the Holy Guard was supposed to help people!
035	Hey... Why don't you calm down?
036	So you're here, too, Kazahaya.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0006
037	I'm pretty sure I told you that I'd be sticking around for a while.	VO_kazahaya.kazahaya_sys_0006
038	Tehre... I'm sorry it took me so long to get here.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0035
039	I came as soon as I heard about this new type of Giant Taurus. Could you give me a run down of the situation?
040	I see. So...it has a weakness?	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
041	Does this mean your study of this Giant Taurus is going well?
042	Indeed. From a sample of the beast that we happened to get our hands on, we have gathered that they are similar in structure to the Ancient Dragon Bone.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
043	That is, the remains of an ancient dragon that happens to be the largest mountain range in Saga, forming the border to Gluttony Foss. It will be incredibly difficult to pierce such rock-like hide.
044	And these are the creatures popping up all over the continent? I guess we'll need to do something about their armor first. That'll be our focus.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
045	Indeed. Not one of our attacks was capable of making a single scratch on the one we encountered.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0004
046	These soldiers from another world said they'll help us out with the new variation. That's something.
047	I watched them take down one of the beasts. It did not appear to be armored.
048	I see. I think I've got a pretty good grip on the situation for now.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0045
049	Hey! Where are you going?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
050	I only came here to get a better understanding of the threat these new Giant Taurus poses, so that I can take effective countermeasures.
051	I cannot believe this! And you call yourself Lord Commander?!	VO_terre.terre_sys_0001
052	It's not only Saga that's in danger, you know.	VO_basini.basini_sys_0030
053	If I cannot save everyone, I will take measures to save the greatest number of lives I possibly can.
054	It seems that I was wrong to call on the Holy Guard for help.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0018
055	Now isn't the time for that kind of talk. Consider that the danger will only grow as time passes.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
056	What would you know? You are not from our world.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0012
057	Is the investigation of the Giant Taurus progressing? Surely we can get our hands on a sample of skin or tissue, at least.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0002
058	It's important to study the enemy. We need to understand them, so that we can pinpoint their weakness.
059	Hmph.	VO_terre.terre_sys_0010
060	Now, then... What should I do?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
061	You already know the answer to that.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0010
062	Levi! Did you find the girl?	VO_hans.hans_sys_0025
063	No, I didn't. A man named Kazahaya told me to leave it to him.	VO_levi.levi_sys_0006
064	So I went to check on our defenses instead. Thankfully, it looks like we'll be able to fight with omni-directional mobility while we're in the vicinity of this temple.
065	That's the only thing this place has going for it. Before we do anything else, it will need to be cleaned from top to bottom! Anyone who does a poor job will be severely punished!
066	Huh?	VO_eren.eren_sys_0025
067	Is that how you address your captain?	VO_levi.levi_sys_0001
068	R-right away, captain!
069	I don't think this temple is that dirty.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0031
070	We have wounded soldiers here. Hygiene is important, is it not?	VO_levi.levi_sys_0012
071	I suppose you have a point.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0006
072	Your first job will be to make a space for the wounded to rest! I do not want to see a single speck of dust!	VO_levi.levi_sys_0016
073	That Giant Taurus... I can't wait...to see it.	VO_hans.hans_sys_0007
074	What can we do about that armor? Hmmm.
075	What is that?! Is that the new type of Giant Taurus?! It must be!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0026
076	No! I'm surrounded! Is this a new Giant Taurus, too?!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
077	It looks a little different, though. Squishier. It'll be no match for my Mecha Weapon! I'll make it go splat!
078	Huuzzzzaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0032
079	Gnnnrrrrrrraaaaagggghhhh!	VO_TsujouKyojin.TsujouKyojin_battle_0003
080	Ngh! It's not working?!	VO_judith.judith_battle_0019
081	Dang it!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0018
082	Are you all right?	VO_reiner.reiner_sys_0001
083	Wh-who are you?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0027
084	You've got guts, and that weapon of yours is something else... You're just not striking the right place. You can't inflict a fatal wound on it that way.	VO_reiner.reiner_sys_0007
085	Huh?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
086	When you're fighting a big enemy like this, you need to know its weakness, and then attack it with everything you have. That's the best strategy.	VO_reiner.reiner_sys_0002
087	For example...
088	Huurgghh!	VO_reiner.reiner_battle_0001
089	Urrgggggaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!	VO_TsujouKyojin.TsujouKyojin_battle_0028_b
090	So...you slash its heels to bring it down and then go for the back of its neck?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0025
091	A Titan's weakness is its nape. There are several ways to get at it.	VO_reiner.reiner_sys_0037
092	This is one of them!	VO_reiner.reiner_battle_0001
093	The mechanics of your gear are amazing! I can't believe you can fly through the air with it! Where was it made? How does it work?	VO_judith.judith_sys_0046
094	Which knight order invented it? Actually, wait... Who the hell are you?! Whoa! The ground is shaking like crazy!	VO_judith.judith_sys_0001
095	Let's save the chitchat for later, all right? We need to take down these guys first! Give me a hand!	VO_reiner.reiner_sys_0002
096	You got it! Let's kick their butts! Then you can tell me all about that gear of yours!
