001	Well, well. We're certainly a long way from the desert now. This is shaping up to be a last showdown of some sort.	VO_balt.balt_sys_0010
002	You think? I don't know... I feel like I've broken more of a sweat dealing with petty thieves.	VO_karla.karla_sys_0004
003	What kind of thieves have you been dealing with?! Never mind... I'm not gonna let you show me up!	VO_balt.balt_sys_0029
004	Time to bring all these monsters down!	VO_balt.balt_battle_0010
005	Right! I'm not here just to play around, after all. The man who taught me how to use Spiritbonding needs my help!	VO_karla.karla_sys_0006
006	Come on, Sand Hawks! Get ready for the fight of your lives! For our future, and the future of this world!	VO_karla.karla_battle_0040
007	Ugh... Energetic, as always. She even managed to drag me into this mess... This isn't even our country. We're not in the Desert Zone anymore... Always making me do things I don't want to do...	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0030
008	Your words are intriguingly at odds with how well-prepared you look for battle.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0044
009	Hmph. Well, the Fruit Peddlers have done a lot of good toward increasing our profits.	VO_ryle.ryle_sys_0007
010	I don't like to owe anyone anything. I prefer to pay off all my debts in one go.
011	I see. That is good enough reason, indeed.	VO_ankh.ankh_sys_0045
012	That he possesses such strength as to summon and transmute a body like this... That Kamui has exceeded all my expectations.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0031
013	If my eyes do not deceive me, you must be the Chief of the Sephira.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0001
014	No, no. That title belongs to someone who died a long time ago. Hyah!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0029
015	I'm little more than a nameless Sephiran soldier on an anonymous battlefield now.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
016	In that case, consider me the same. Heh! I can't remember the last time I was able to fully concentrate on swinging my sword in battle without worrying about tactics or morale! It makes me feel young again!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0004
017	Ha! Such reckless brutishness! I would have expected more gentility from an esteemed general of Gluttony!	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0010
018	Nonsense! I was a soldier and mercenary who survived countless battles before I became anything else.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0007
019	Being here like this reminds me of who I used to be. I must ask you not to underestimate me.
020	Then I must beg your forgiveness. I had not meant to offend. Perhaps it is a poor apology, but all I can give you is the chance to see our village's most secret of arts.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0045
021	That is more than I could have ever asked for! Too much, in fact! I would never presume to have the right to see what your people guarded so dearly from the rest of the world.	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0044
022	The rules that once governed the Sephira are little more than dust now. Even if they did still exist, they would be nothing more than extra shackles for our people to carry.	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0030
023	What reason have the Sephira to burden themselves further? It is up to old fools like myself to show the future generations of my people that it is time to forge a new path forward!
024	Hah! Fantastic! That was well said for a nameless soldier of the Sephira. I would be honored to bear witness!	VO_leordas.leordas_sys_0008
025	Thank you, friend. "I beseech the supreme...!"	VO_iakof.iakof_sys_0007
026	Really, there's no reason to be so dramatic. Personally, I prefer a less flashy type of change that builds naturally over time, with conscious effort. Some might call it boring, but...	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0030
027	Let them have their fun! A chance like this doesn't come around all that often!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
028	I'm not quite sure how we're connected, stranger, but it feels like a solid match! Care to join me in the fray?
029	...
030	Hm? What's the matter?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0002
031	No, it's nothing. I am simply...unused to meeting new people.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0004
032	However, from your appearance, I can see that you must be a gladiator from Eos. It has been a long time since I've seen one of your ilk.
033	That's right! I'm Teona. I was once champion of the Colosseum!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0004
034	I see. I would be most obliged to have you at my side in battle.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0009
035	...
036	Is there something wrong?	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0006
037	No, it's just... Aren't you...? You are! You're Hisham! Look at you! You're all grown up!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0025
038	I-I have no idea what you're talking about. You must have the wrong person.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0026
039	No way! I recognize that twinkle in your eye! You're Hisham! Wow!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
040	Come on! Let's charge into battle together! We may never have a chance like this again!	VO_theona.theona_chara_1006
041	That may not be the best plan. I'm really more suited to a supporting role on the battlefield.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0025
042	Don't be shy! I'm trying to fulfill a kid's dream!	VO_theona.theona_sys_0008
043	I haven't forgotten. You wanted to be a gladiator once, didn't you?	VO_theona.theona_chara_1003
044	...
045	All right. On three! Make sure you keep up, okay?	VO_theona.theona_sys_0007
046	Honestly... You have far too much energy for me, the lot of you.	VO_hisham.hisham_sys_0022
047	Amazing...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0046
048	They're pushing the Jam back, despite the overwhelming odds!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0024
049	Nngh...grk...	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0022
050	Kamui?! Are you...?!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0027
051	It's nothing. Don't worry about me. We'd best start moving. I can't hold this forever.	VO_kamui.kamui_sys_0030
052	Hurry! We should be able to push through to the arboreal altar now!	VO_kamui.kamui_battle_0015
053	Understood. Agatha, wait here!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0004
054	Huh? Oh! O-okay!	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0025
055	Let's go, Blue Tongues!	VO_logi-b.logi-b_sys_0032
056	What...? Oh, my head... Ever since I saw the light of the Sacred Stone, I've been hearing...someone's voice...	VO_agasa-b.agasa-b_sys_0027
