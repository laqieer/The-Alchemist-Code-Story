001	Most villains that appear in stories, I've noticed, repeatedly challenge foes that have defeated them before.	VO_uroboros-d.uroboros-d_sys_0031
002	Even if they know there is no chance to win.
003	That, I do not understand.
004	Simply dreaming of change will accomplish nothing.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
005	Thinking of the sky will not make one fly.
006	Further than anyone ever has, my prodigy child will charge ahead.
007	That is how he will show his true talents.
008	Will I...die?	VO_sol.sol_battle_0019
009	If the group you organized cannot defeat even me alone, then yes, eventually.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0004
010	It would mean that overturning the world is a goal far beyond your reach.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0010
011	I guess I wasted my time offering myself up as compensation.	VO_eins.eins_sys_0017
012	I figured that was what you'd done.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0020
013	So you knew.
014	I guessed.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
015	I chose it, but if there's no prospect of getting reimbursed...
016	All of this was futile?
017	Probably.
018	...
019	No.	VO_sol.sol_chara_1005
020	What?
021	Thanks for counting to ten.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
022	Everything up until now was nothing more than childish sense of antagonism.
023	My true struggle begins now.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0010
024	Surrender.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
025	Aaargh! Screw this board game! What is up with these pieces?!	VO_sol.sol_sys_0016
026	It freakin' flipped!
027	It's called Promotion.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0004
028	Promotion?
029	Some pieces can be promoted if they invade deep into enemy territory. They essentially power up.
030	Well, you're using some words I've never heard you use.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0044
031	Promoted pieces are turned over, and they may have the power to change the flow of battle.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
032	What do you mean, "may"?
033	Different pieces move differently. It all depends on how they're used.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0002
034	Well, that's it right there. I just can't be bothered to remember how each piece moves.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
035	Such a tedious game.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0022
036	You do remember the faces of the Templars, do you not?	VO_zen.zen_sys_0001
037	Of course.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0004
038	Even those who are no more?
039	If we don't remember them, who the hell would?
040	Besides, none of them were pieces of some game.	VO_sol.sol_sys_0002
041	Indeed. However, if seen from far above, we are all but warriors and pieces of an active battlefield. You, too, are a piece. Not the player.
042	Even me?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0027
043	No, you are the piece that has the potential to change the flow of battle upon the board.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0006
044	...
045	There is a saying that insists the bishop is more effective than the flying chariot in early game.	VO_zen.zen_sys_0002
046	Huh... Bishop? Which of these was it again?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0031
047	It has flipped.
048	Oh, right. What does it become?
049	It becomes the Dragon Horse. By making it deep into enemy territory...	VO_sol.sol_sys_0001
050	One can become a dragon.
051	Cool, right?	VO_sol.sol_sys_0008
