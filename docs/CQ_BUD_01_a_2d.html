<td>警護対象の白砂の翼との合流場所まで<br>もう少しだ。がんばろう</td>
<td>Nearly there—we're almost at the meeting spot. The Desert Wings we're meant to be guarding are waiting for us. We've got to push on.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>はい…！　それにしても、<br>我らが国外の任務とは珍しいですね</td>
<td>Yes, Captain! Although... With all due respect, it is quite unusual for us to be undertaking a mission for a foreign nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>珍しいけど、守るべき方を<br>守ることは普段と変わらないからな</td>
<td>Unusual? Maybe. But that doesn't change the fact that these people need our help. In that respect, it's no different from any other mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>むしろ国賓としてお迎えにあがる方に<br>失礼がないようにしないと</td>
<td>In fact, in some ways, it's an especially important one. We'll have to make sure we don't offend our charges, since they're being treated as guests of our nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>そうですね。一層の注意を払います<br>それに貴重な経験になりますし、<br>しっかり勉強します</td>
<td>Of course, Captain. I will mind my manners. I am honored to be trusted with this mission which will provide me with valuable experience. I'll be sure to be attentive and learn all I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>ああ…白砂の翼のギルド長は<br>相当なやり手だって話だし…<br>俺も学べることが色々ありそうだな…</td>
<td>Good. The Desert Wings' guildmaster is supposed to be pretty talented. I'm sure there's a lot I can learn from him as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>（俺は皆に苦労を掛けてばかりだから…）</td>
<td>(Good thing, too. I've been doing a pretty poor job of leading everyone.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>（…もっと俺ががんばらないとな<br>団長として、皆の力を活かす為に…）</td>
<td>(I've got to work harder. I'm the captain! I'm meant to be helping everyone else put their skills to good use, not—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>あれは…！</td>
<td>Huh?! What's going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>ちっ、また俺たちを狙う輩か<br>最近は特にあからさまだな<br>おちおち昼寝もできやしない</td>
<td>Hmph. You lot again? Tut-tut. You've been reckless lately—and loud. I haven't been able to take my afternoon naps in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>な、なんだ!?<br>お前ら、一体何者だ!?</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Wh-where the hell did all of you come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>俺たちは蒼炎騎士団！<br>俺は団長のバド・クロウリーだ！<br>アンタたち、大丈夫か？</td>
<td>We are the Blue Flame Guard! I am Captain Bud Crowley! Are you all right, citizens?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>ああ…助かった<br>俺はライル<br>白砂の翼のギルド長だ</td>
<td>Oh, yes. We're fine. My name is Ryle. I am the guildmaster of the Desert Wings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…！　アンタがあの…！</td>
<td>Y-you're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>早速で悪いが、奴らを撃退したい<br>頼めるか</td>
<td>The ones you're meant to be escorting, yes. I apologize if this seems sudden, but do you think you could eliminate these cretins for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>任せろ！<br>団員は俺に続け</td>
<td>Right. Leave it to us! We'll take things from here. Blue Flames, follow my lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>はっ</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…………</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>戦闘は蒼炎騎士団に任せていい<br>お前らは馬車と積み荷を守ることに<br>専念しろ</td>
<td>Leave the fighting to the Blue Flame Guard. Just focus on protecting the caravan and our cargo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>（…？<br>あいつ、なんでこんな時に<br>馬車に隠れるような真似を…）</td>
<td>(Huh? What's he doing hiding in his caravan at a time like this?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>とりあえず今は<br>こいつらをなんとかしないと！</td>
<td>Come on! Time to send these bandits packing!</td>
