<td>正義の味方なんていないって思ってた</td>
<td>I didn't think there really were allies of justice in this world.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>私がお腹を空かせていても<br>誰も助けてはくれなんかしない<br>誰かを助けるにはあそこは貧しすぎるから</td>
<td>After all, nobody helped me when I was starving. Where I'm from, everybody was so poor, they didn't have the means to help themselves, let alone anybody else.</td>

<td>弱者を守りたい、世界を守りたい<br>正義の味方になりたい…<br>いや～、みんな、熱いっすね</td>
<td>Look at all these fresh faces! Full of dreams of protecting the weak, saving the world, and fighting on the side of justice... So young, so inspiring.</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>うん、温度高いね<br>…まぁ、聖教騎士を目指す子は<br>だいたいそうなのかな</td>
<td>If you say so. Every fresh batch of new recruits looks exactly the same to me.</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>いやあ、どうですかね<br>たとえばほら、あの子とか</td>
<td>Oho! I wouldn't be so sure about that, if I were you. Take her, for instance.</td>

<td>She's certainly enthusiastic. Wasn't she the one you personally scouted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>えぇ、なかなか見所もありましたし<br>…それにちょっと、<br>気になるところもあったので</td>
<td>Yep. She shows promising talent, for one, and for another... Well. I had my reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…ふーん</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>えー…オホン！<br>それではこれより、模擬戦を開始する</td>
<td>Ahem. Good! Now, we will shortly be holding a mock battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>新人騎士諸君にとっては、先輩に己の<br>錬金術の実力をアピールする絶好の機会だ<br>ぜひ頑張ってもらいたい</td>
<td>The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to display the strength and range of your Alchemy abilities to your superiors. You would do well to make good use of this valuable opportunity.</td>
