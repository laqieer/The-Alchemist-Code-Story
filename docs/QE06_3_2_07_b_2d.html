<td>Hah!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>（数が多い…<br>“カグツチ”が使えればいいのじゃが<br>この乱戦では…）</td>
<td>(There are too many of them! I'd like to try taking them all down at once with Kagutsuchi...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>（ふたりを巻き込む恐れもある…<br>一匹ずつ確実に…）</td>
<td>(...but with all this chaos, I'd just end up catching the two of them in the blast. I'll have to be more deliberate with my strikes.)</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>私たちの邪魔は…させない！</td>
<td>Nothing's going to stand in our way!</td>

<td>ハアアッ！<br>…!?</td>
<td>Hyahh!!!<br>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>うわああああああっ！<br>何か出たぁーっ!!!</td>
<td>Waaaaah! What was that? What did I just do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>（!?<br>あれは！）</td>
<td>What in the world...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…ミカボシ!?<br>墨…？</td>
<td>Mikaboshi! Is that...ink?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…ハッ！</td>
<td>Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>…なんだかわからないけど、<br>まぐれとかじゃなさそうね！</td>
<td>I don't know what it is, but I can do it again, so it was no fluke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>これもまた、意志を繋いで<br>ワダツミをかつての姿に戻す為の力…？</td>
<td>Maybe this is one more power I've been gifted to help return Wadatsumi back to the way it used to be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>かつての…姿…<br>あっ！</td>
<td>Back to how it should be.<br>Oh, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>ミカボシ？</td>
<td>Mikaboshi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>いいこと思いついちゃった！<br>スメラギ、構えて!!</td>
<td>I have an idea! Sumeragi, follow my lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>え…う、うん！</td>
<td>Uh, o-okay!</td>
</tr>

<td>…ハッ!!</td>
<td>Got it!</td>

<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>よし！<br>これでおしまい！<br>一網打尽ってやつね！</td>
<td>Well, that sure did the trick! And in one fell swoop, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>ミカボシ、今のは…</td>
<td>Okay. But what actually was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>前にスメラギが話してくれたでしょ<br>かつてのワダツミの姿…って<br>あれが頭に浮かんでね</td>
<td>The things you were saying earlier about restoring Wadatsumi back to what used to be normal just randomly popped into my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>墨がその形になったらいいなって<br>それを技に応用してみたの<br>一か八かだったけどうまくいったわ</td>
<td>It was kind of a gamble, but I thought maybe I could control that ink and shape it into a representation of that future. Figured it might work as a new technique, and I guess I was right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>名づけて――“鳥獣擬画”！</td>
<td>I even came up with a name for it: Beast Art Evocation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…つくづくズルいなあ</td>
<td>Ugh, this is so unfair. You keep hogging all the glory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>ズルくない！<br>…私なりに、ワダツミの未来を<br>考えた結果なんだからね</td>
<td>I can't help it! It just kind of happened. And it came out of our shared dream for Wadatsumi's future, anyway, so just shut your mouth and be glad I'm on your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>今は相手を倒すしかないけど<br>…いずれ、倒さなくても無力化できれば<br>いいだけの未来がくるかもしれない</td>
<td>Sadly, there doesn't seem to be much choice right now but to kill or be killed when facing demons like that. But I'm hoping that with a little work, we can get by just incapacitating them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>その時の為の備えってわけか</td>
<td>That's the kind of future you were thinking of when you did that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>そう<br>祈りみたいなものよ</td>
<td>Yeah, basically. It was almost like praying for a miracle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>…ミカボシは、優しいね<br>僕はそこまで優しくなれなさそうだ</td>
<td>You really are a kind soul, Mikaboshi, you know that? I don't think I'll ever be that nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>一応私のほうが姉なんだからね<br>崇めたまえ</td>
<td>Well, I am the older twin. That makes me wiser, too, probably. Make sure you don't forget that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>ははーっ</td>
<td>Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>ぷっ…<br>はははははははははははっ</td>
<td>Pff...hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>子の成長は早いというが…<br>目の当たりにすると言葉も出ぬものよな</td>
<td>They say children grow up fast, but I don't think I've ever seen any others grow quite as fast as you two. It almost boggles the mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>その墨を使った技は…<br>かつてカエデが使っていたものだ</td>
<td>That ink technique you used, Mikaboshi? Kaede used it too, once upon a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>母さんが…？</td>
<td>Really? Mother did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>角を体内に取り込んだがゆえ、<br>汝の身体が反応したのか…<br>いや、理屈ではないのかもしれぬ</td>
<td>Absorbing her horn may have triggered a physical reaction in your body, like unlocking a muscle memory or something. At least...that's the best theory I've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>…やっぱりズルい</td>
<td>Showoff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>拗ねずともよい<br>スメラギ…汝はコウガ譲りの<br>意志の強さがある</td>
<td>No pouting now, Sumeragi. You've inherited Koga's fierce resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…ふたりとも、<br>確かにコウガとカエデの子じゃ</td>
<td>The two of you really are just like them. The resemblance is uncanny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>？</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>そして、ミツハ様が育ててくれた</td>
<td>But it's you who raised us, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>だから僕たちはここにいるんです</td>
<td>We wouldn't be where we are today without you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…ありがとう</td>
<td>...Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>みんなで、やるんでしょ？<br>そんな顔しないの！</td>
<td>We're all in this together, right? No long faces allowed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>僕たちのやるべきことは、<br>まだまだ山積みなんですから！</td>
<td>There's still so much left to be done, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…ああ、汝らの言う通りじゃ</td>
<td>No kidding. But we're on our way, and that's what counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>それから私たちは身を潜めながら、<br>“悪意”の根源を探る日々が続いた――</td>
<td>Time passed quickly, and we continued our covert search for the origin of the malice that had settled upon Wadatsumi. It was definitely slow going, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>おお、お前さんか<br>…いつも大変だねえ<br>親御さんを亡くしたクチだろう？</td>
<td>Oh, it's you. Nothin' but bad news these days, eh? There's a rumor goin' around that says you lost your parents. Is that why I always see you skulkin' about by your lonesome?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>おおっと、深くは聞かねえよ<br>…この辺りももう鬼どもに<br>占領されちまうかもしれねえ</td>
<td>Sorry, I don't mean to pry. Such a shame, though. Ain't nobody been spared from a loss or two these days. Heck, won't be long till the demons reach us here, I reckon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>国は俺たちに何もしちゃくれねえ<br>…あまつさえ、城に匿っていた<br>危険な鬼の子が城から逃げたって話だ</td>
<td>The powers that be won't do nothin' for us, neither. And to top it off, I hear them foul demon spawn they been keepin' in the castle have gone and run off, too! Bad tidings all around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…………</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>やっぱり…国が鬼と繋がってて<br>鬼を増やしてるって噂は本当かもな<br>俺たちもいつ死ぬかわからねえ…</td>
<td>I tell you, there might be somethin' to them rumors about the authorities conspirin' with demons, and even bringin' more of 'em in. Just a matter of time before they get us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>長話がすぎたな<br>持って行きな…おまけしといたからよ<br>何かあったら力になってやる</td>
<td>But look at that, I went and talked your ear off! Here you go—I tossed a little extra in there for ya. Just let me know if you need any help, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>素性を隠していれば、みんな温かい<br>この人たちを守る為にも、<br>私たちは“悪意”に立ち向かうのだ</td>
<td>We—or, in this case, Sumeragi—learned that if we hid our identity, everyone would be kind to us. It really drove home that we were fighting malice on behalf of these people, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>その為に、“眼”は鬼を捉え<br>“刀”は鬼を斬り続けた</td>
<td>As the days wore on, my eye continued to seek out demons with malice in their hearts, and Sumeragi's blade continued to cut them down, one after another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>――“眼”と“刀”に自らを宿らせるが如く</td>
<td>It's almost as if we were possessed by the Eye and the Blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>“悪意”という名の“鬼”を見つけ<br>斬り払うその日まで――</td>
<td>And we would continue to welcome that possession until the day we managed to cull the demon named Malice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>ふたりだけではなく、三人で<br>いや――</td>
<td>It helped that there weren't just two of us anymore, but three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>いつの日か、みんなで</td>
<td>And hopefully, at some point, there would be even more. Hopefully one day our ranks would include everyone—all of humankind and demonkind alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>――そう、思っていた</td>
<td>That vision of the future is what kept us going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>――ある日のこと</td>
<td>Until one fateful day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>ご飯、できたよ<br>…ん？</td>
<td>Soup's on! Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>どうしたの？</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…なんだか入口の辺りが騒がしくない？</td>
<td>Shh! Do you hear that? Sounds like a large group of people by the entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…ほんとだ<br>何かあったのかしら？</td>
<td>You're right. I wonder if something's going on outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>いたぞ、こっちだ!!</td>
<td>Here they are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>!?</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>これは…？</td>
<td>Oh, this isn't good...</td>
