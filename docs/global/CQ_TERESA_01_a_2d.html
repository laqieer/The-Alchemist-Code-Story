<td>The only thing I could recover was the charred rock my little sister was holding in her mangled, immolated hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mother died huddling over her, barely preserving her long ponytail. It was the only vestige of my little sister left to help me identify her.</td>

<td>I can't remember...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When was the last time we all laughed together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The only memories filling my mind now are those of flames... The flames I saw on the battlefield lit by the evening glow. The same flames that took my home from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I see the crimson glow every time I close my eyes.</td>
