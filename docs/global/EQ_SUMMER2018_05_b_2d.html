<td>Grrrrrroooooooooooaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right! We took down the demon! Thanks for your help, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Gratitude? What a strange little girl you are. To think you would deign to thank the very Phantoms you summoned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I agree. Why would she throw herself at the demon to protect a Phantom? It makes no sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Liz wants to be friends with Dorothea, so just couldn't help herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's Liz for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Friends... Hmmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Here's your doll, Dorothea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Th-thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It doesn't look like it got ripped or anything, either! We were lucky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It must be well-made, to hold up even in the midst of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course it is! This doll was made to look like my sweetheart, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your...sweetheart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The strong and brawny gentleman who will welcome my love with open arms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-so you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, yes, I love him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wow! So, what does he look like? If this doll was made to look like him, then I guess...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>He looks kinda...rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Not rough, brawny! I have no interest in weak men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I know what you mean! My sweetheart simply must be stalwart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I suppose that I would be inadequate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, yes. You don't look like you could withstand a strong breeze, let alone the full weight of my love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, I'm surprised that you have such good taste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I could say the same of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(These two are more similar than they would like to admit. Never thought I'd live to see the day.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Of course, a broad mind is far more important than broad shoulders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, yes! Exactly! I just know that my special someone would be capable of taking my love without a smidgen of shame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aaahhh! That's so sweet! I want someone to take my love, too! Then hold me in their arms, and...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lisbeth, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahhhhh! Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Did you just imitate Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I don't mean to intrude, but wasn't there something you were meant to be doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ten minutes remaining until the end of the exercise! Ten minutes remaining until the end of the exercise! Take care not to let your power run out, girls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, no! I totally forgot about that! What are we gonna do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oops. We've lost a lot of time. Looks like we're heading straight to last place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I can't believe even I forgot about it. If we're going to try and make a comeback, that restricted area might be our only hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Um, Rebecca...? Are you serious? There are a lot of monsters over there—and the water is pretty deep, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We can't let Alma drown again! That'd be really bad! What should we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, well. I suppose I don't have a choice. I'll lend you my aid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>D-Dorothea?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'll help out, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmmm... I am not sure if it would even begin to compensate for my tomfoolery earlier, however...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Would you grant me the honor of allowing me to assist you, ladies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You have been very kind and considerate of our desires, so now it's our turn to do the same for you! Hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>R-really?! You don't mind?! I thought you all had stuff you wanted to do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Well, they only have a limited time here, anyway. They can't hope to do everything they want to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's a good point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's why I got to thinking... Why don't we help each other out, so that everyone gets what they want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If the Phantoms help us bring down the monsters, we'll have time to make sure that they can enjoy the beach to the fullest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We can save so much time by working together! If we team up, there's nothing we can't do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's how we managed to take down that demon so quickly—by working together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ohhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Um, Aisha? What do you want to do at the beach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hmmm? Well... I suppose I wouldn't mind showing off my dice tricks to everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Okay! I'll gather the other girls for you! Um, what about you, Reido?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ah, yes... I, for one, am curious about the traditional loincloth that is a hallmark of the culture of Wadatsumi. I believe that the practice did relate to the beach, but I know so little about it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh! I think I remember learning about that in class. You should ask our teacher. I'm sure she could tell you all about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And you, Dorothea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I want to search for my special someone, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I thought as much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Okay, got it! I'll do everything I can! I'll make sure that all three of you get to do what you want! So, um...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Five minutes remaining until the end of the exercise. Five minutes remaining until the end of the exercise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh, no! There's only five minutes left! Are we gonna make it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Of course we are! You have me on your side!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's totally something Rebecca would say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>You're right! There's no way we could lose with a team like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>L-Liz! Wait for us! Don't run off on your own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Argh... This is why we can't leave Liz alone for one minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I suppose we should be following them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I guess so! Hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I only came here to search for my special someone, but I guess I don't have to work alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Moreover, leaving those girls to fend for themselves isn't likely to end well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hey! Dorothea! Aren't you coming?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I am! Don't rush me! Hmph. Here I come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>We only get one summer every year, so let's have fun!</td>
</tr>
