<td>Huff... Huff... Not bad, is he, Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm surprised he can keep up with our Space-Time Manipulation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Do you believe the enemy is going to be using this "Space-Time Manipulation" again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They went through the trouble of making fake versions of us. I'm sure they'll be back again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Besides, there's something I want to confirm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The skills you're using... They're different from the Spiritbonding techniques that Waginau and Emmel use, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. I don't even have a name for this yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's an art I'm developing so that all people can match the power of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you mean we might be able to learn it as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's the idea, but I still have more to do before that can become a reality. Are you interested?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Those dark versions of us mentioned that they've never seen anything like it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My guess is that means Asmodeus doesn't know anything about it either, since he's the one who created them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If so, it could be the advantage we need to turn the tables on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's something I wanted to ask you two as well, if you don't mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's only fair that you do. What's up, Wagi-baby?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Excuse me? I will thank you not to call me such a ridiculous thing again. Tell me about the incantations you do when casting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Libra has granted us control, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that the same Libra that Miss Ambrosia used to wound the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, that's... Are we allowed to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are you even able to explain it, Mira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ouch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry, you'll have to ask Ambrosia about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Now children, don't let me down like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You shouldn't be up yet! How are you even awake?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How can I sleep with you two blasting your magil like that in front of the mansion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ha. Not really, but now is no time to be napping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We have an actual chance at defeating the Cursed Beast Asmodeus. You can't keep me out of  your plans.</td>
