<td>Phew, that was a fine workout.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ugh... You just got done with all that training and you still wiped the floor without breaking a sweat. You didn't even need me to back you up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You've got a tough sister.</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>

<td>Ren.</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten about the mission. Though I'd like to point out that I've said before that training too much before a mission makes getting them done a lot harder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Become stronger than me and I'll consider it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I could train my whole life and it still wouldn't be enough...</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I would come here after training to think about my sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nothing about her seemed like she was about to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The three years the doctors gave her were already up, but she was still standing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Though I always knew she could die at any time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I knew that there was no good answer to the issue I was preoccupied with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If only...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I couldn't bear to say the words. "If only she could live."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Those words would only hurt if things went badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hurt who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Me, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Sigh... Jeez!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's time, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yeah, I know. I'm ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We have demons to exorcise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I still sometimes wonder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What was on Natsume's mind? How did she feel about it herself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But I never asked her. Because if I did...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I thought she might disappear like one of those bubbles.</td>
