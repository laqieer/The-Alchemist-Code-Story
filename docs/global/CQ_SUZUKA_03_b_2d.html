<td>That was a good fight. Looks like it was a draw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No...I lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am in awe of your power to draw all the monsters to you instantaneously!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Until now, I've always seen being a woman as something that inhibited my fighting power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I planned to discard my womanhood and pursue the path of a warrior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>However, today, you showed me the power of being a woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I still have much to learn...Master Shayna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please, teach me how to wield my "feminine power"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Suzuka darling...you are strong...but you can become even stronger. So can I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I too am still in the middle of polishing my "feminine power." Rise now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let us aim for the zenith of both our power as a warrior and as a woman!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ye-yes!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hmm...in order to do that, first, that armor of yours? It's really cool and all, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Let's start with removing it and changing your outfit to increase your "feminine power"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>After all, you've got a lot to work with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What?! I thought it was as tight as it could be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm impressed that you picked up on that, my teacher!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No! Teacher isn't cute! We're not teacher and student...we're friends, Suzuka darling!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Friends...! U-understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah...but...one thing...I seem to have a problem with the name "Suzuka darling"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're right. It's kind of too normal. How about we go with Suzuka sweetie? It's cuter, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Suzuka sweetie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yes! I like it! Hey, you can call me Shayna sweetie as wellâ˜†</td>

<td>O-okay! Shayna...swe-sweetie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hm! I still sense some hesitation from you! One more time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Shayna sweetie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's the spirit, Suzuka sweetie! All right, let's change and head back to the dojo!</td>
</tr>
