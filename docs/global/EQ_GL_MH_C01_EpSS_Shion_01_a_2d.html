<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Good evening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Lady Shion! Lady Asuka is waiting for you. Please, come in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Welcome back, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Asuka. You look well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As do you. I'm glad you were able to stop by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Things are progressing rather quickly, but I wanted to check on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You know, this reminds me so much of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The gardens looked so beautiful bathed in moonlight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Remember how we'd stay up just to watch the stars?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, yes. I had to make sure you turned in after a while, or you'd never go to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Shion, will you... will you dance for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Like you used to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Would you care to join me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't tease me like that... You know I'm no good at dancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I could never possess the finesse you have for dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Fufu. All right then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Shion steps under the moonlit swathe, and with a graceful gesture, begins to dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I was born and raised a retainer to Asuka, daughter of the noble house I served.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Where Asuka was groomed to succeed as the future heir...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I was taught to dance, to protect, and if necessary... to kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I stayed by Asuka's side, even when the shadow of Greed Dike loomed large over Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It was then that a sweeping change entered our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As you know, tensions are rising between Greed Dike and Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let us speak honestly and without reservation: at this rate, war will be inevitable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I may be of Greed Dike nobility, but I have no desire to partake in this... unnecessary violence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It is, therefore, with great sincerity that I propose a partnership between our houses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Pardon me for speaking so brashly, but... what are your terms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Straight to the point. I respect that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My house will shelter yours, should war break out between our countries. You will be safe from their aggressions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>In exchange, I seek your aid in furthering a vision of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And the nature of your "vision"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You must be curious, I'm sure. I can tell you this much: it is nothing like what these shortsighted fools seek with mindless bloodshed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>First, I must ask that you pass a test to ascertain your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I would like you to negotiate with someone on my behalf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There is a rather... shall we say, stubborn, acquiantance of mine who is in dire need of a new perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Very well. I will see to it that this matter is taken care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Shion, please continue to keep in touch with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>As you wish, my lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Excellent. I look forward to how you'll resolve this. After all, I've heard good things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hmm. We may have accepted his test, Shion, but I can't say I know how to read into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't worry. Whatever he has in store for us, I'm certain we will be able to handle it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I must admit he is our best bet for safeguarding our house against Greed Dike, if war does happen to break out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And as far as I can tell, he is more interested in a mutually beneficial relationship than one of subjugation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I hope you are right. Be safe, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
