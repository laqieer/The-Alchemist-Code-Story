<td>002</td>
<td>So close...yet never enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ngh... Heh, a former General is not to be underestimated, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(So what do you plan to do? We must do something about that stone in his hand.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I know, but we must focus on stopping the ceremony first.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(That's true. Any ideas on how to do that?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Wait for the signal. Then simultaneously...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hahahaha! Finished already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>To think, you cannot even defeat this old fool... The past one hundred years must have been unavailing for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The years have not been kind to you either, Ceclidis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You cannot even stand on this battlefield without the aid of the Collector of Wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You expect such cheap provocations would prompt me to act?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now, Beasts of Wisdom, wring the life out of your former comrade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Very well. The time of your destruction has come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hahaha! Resistance is futile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Logi, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I told you, it's useless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Leviathan, lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?! What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No! Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That is the power of the Sacred Stones you so desperately sought after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You mean to tell me the Sacred Stone chose this child over me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Now's your chance, Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Waaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You've endured well, my cousin. Let me free you from your constraints!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You will not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What theâ€”?! The amulet of purification!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Something must have happened to Georgios!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you doing?! If you aren't going to fight, stay back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, sorry! Wind Ouija!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tch! How many of the Jam could there be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>They are connected to Ceclidis! To completely get rid of them, we have to take him out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Then it's pointless to be fighting here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Mocca, I'll lend you one of our horses. Take Agatha and meet up with the Liberation Army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We'll meet you there after settling things here! Just go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
