<td>Hah! Is that all you've got?!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>S-Setsuna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's over now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Was that scary? But you have to know that in a real fight—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That was amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Were you not...scared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>N-not at all! You were fighting to protect this village, Setsuna. You fought for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to fight like that. I want to be just like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I want to grow strong for my sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(I knew it. Jayme understands the most important aspect of strength.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Of course. Then we'll need to make sure you also learn how to control your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Jayme! Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness. I heard monsters got into the village, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I figured everything would be fine with Setsuna here, but I just couldn't stop worrying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Setsuna took care of them all! There was nothing to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You know I'm going to worry regardless of—Jayme! Let me see your leg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh, I think I scraped my knee during training. I'm totally fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We must treat the wound immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's important to take care of any injuries you sustain, Jayme. I'm sorry, Macherie. I should have been more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's not your fault, Setsuna. If I'm gonna grow stronger, I can't let something like this stop me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Jayme, don't cause Setsuna trouble. There we go, all better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Jayme is working really hard. You should be proud of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Truly? I am proud of him, of course! Did you hear that Jayme? Setsuna has such nice things to say about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hehehehe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's getting dark. We should get home. Are you done for the day, Macherie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes, I think so. I just came back, so I should be fine to go home now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Came back? Did you go somewhere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>For a little while. I had some apprentice duties to take care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. Well, don't push yourself too hard. I wouldn't want you getting in trouble again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I should be fine. Probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, nothing. Let's all go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'll go help rebuild the fences the monsters wrecked. I don't want more coming in that way again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>All right. We'll go get dinner ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>See you later, Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Perhaps it'll be possible for Jayme.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Perhaps he will be able to walk the righteous path that I could not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Jayme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My greatest wish for you is to be able to protect the things you love with your sword.</td>
