<td>This presence... I recognize it!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That voice!</td>

<tr>

<td>Azami! Don't get ahead of yourself!</td>

<td>I finally understand what Celis was talking about.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The look in her eyes just never changes... But there are other things that have.</td>

<td>Like what?</td>

<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life. Still, if the surrounding environment were to change...</td>

<td>Now that all three of us are members of the Blade Fox, we can't expect things to be exactly like before.</td>

<td>So whatever is emitting this strong presence is the source of Azami's grudge?</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No doubt about it. But...I was sure Celis destroyed it back then...</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>How could it...? Well, there's no point worrying about that now.</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's impossible to forget such extreme sadness.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>On a normal day, Azami would be fine on her own, but if she's lost herself in rage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Right. Sounds like we ought to hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Grrraaaaaaaarrgh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Let's go, Captain Tanosuke! To the castle gates!</td>
