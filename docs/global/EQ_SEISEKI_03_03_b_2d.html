<td>You're amazing, teacher! I'm confident with the bow, but there's no way I could do what you just did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You come from a Saga hunting tribe. You'll learn to do it in no time at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey, come on! Let's really go hunting together some day! We can compete who can catch more prey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No. I'd rather buy my food at a normal shop than doing something so inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Awww...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>More importantly, Vice-Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You saved me just now. If had tried to pull the bridge up on my own, I'm sure it would've pulled me down with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I told you just now, didn't I? It's a knight's basic duty to protect his comrades.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Besides...thanks to that, we've been able to exponentially close the distance between us and the 4th Regiment. So, um...well done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's rare of you to compliment me so honestly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>D-don't misunderstand me. It's not that I've accepted your way of thinking, but courtesy should be repaid with courtesy. That's my personal Code of Chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Seriously. You're so stubborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>B-but...I'm relieved! We managed to save time...and I think we've strengthened our bond!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...True.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What is it this time? Another bridge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No, it's not! The path...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It divides into two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not only that; look over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is that...a blood trail?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It seems like a battle took place here. The bushes also seem to be extremely ruffled. Most likely, it was fought against monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wait...there's something on the ground over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's the coat of arms of the 4th Regiment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It appears that after Kudanstein and the others fought the monsters, they headed down this right path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Where does this road lead to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>To the country of Gluttony Foss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? That means...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? Did you read the wind again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes. I can sense the sinister presence coming from down the left path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It means that the source behind this sinister presence is at the wind shrine up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The wind shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It's a place that is said to collect the wind from all across the world. Sort of a spiritual symbol for the gods of the native equestrian people of Alize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There's no doubt about it. I can still sense the sinister presence from up this left path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Also...I can sense the presence of a lot of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Most likely, there's a settlement of the Alize people up ahead. They're in danger. We need to tell them to run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ohh, which way should we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The right path, of course. It leads towards Gluttony. That country has the Sacred Stone Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If those who are chasing Kudan and the others are after the Sacred Stone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This could potentially lead to something that will shake the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
