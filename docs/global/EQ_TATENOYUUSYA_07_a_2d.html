<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Thank you so much for saving me! How can I repay you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It'd help us out if you could give us any information. We're looking for some people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We're looking for a knight with cat ears and a young girl with wings on her back... Do you know anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A knight with cat ears and a girl with wings... Could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you know something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah. A ton of round monsters appeared in town and those two got rid of them all in no time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Those two did say that they were looking for someone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I bet Raphtalia and Filo are trying to look for us, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you all going into the village? It's a bit difficult to find the first time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I've been there once before. I can show you the way there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is there something bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That monster from earlier normally doesn't attack people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It feels like they're getting more restless the further we head down the road... I wonder if something is upsetting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The reason for their disturbance may be just ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those two went way ahead already. They said they were looking for someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We must've just missed them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You all should rest here for a while. I'd like to thank you for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There's no need to thank us. We couldn't just leave when we saw someone who was in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>More importantly, are any of you hurt at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Not really. I didn't know what was going to happen when that monster got its jaws around me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But the medicine you gave me worked like a charm. I'm relieved I won't have to deal with any scarring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wow! Master's medicine worked like a charm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thank goodness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um, has Lord Naofumi... I mean, a man named Naofumi pass by this town?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He carries a large shield, has black hair, a piercing gaze... And is an incredibly kind and wonderful person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Uh, no... I haven't seen anyone like that here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Not many people make their way in and out of these parts. You should look for them in a bigger village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hey, Raphtalia, did Master come here? And Melty, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'm not sure... But perhaps...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you. We'll try looking for him elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Are you sure? At least join us for some tea before you head out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tea? All right! Do you have any yummy snacks to go with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Come on, Filo! Don't be so rude!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm glad to hear that they're okay, at least...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes, that's a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Are you by chance the Lord Naofumi that Raphtalia and Filo are looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>They're worried sick about you. You should hurry up and find them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thanks. I'm working on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Why did those Balloons appear in this village, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That was indeed strange. Monsters don't usually pop up around here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I have no idea why. Those round monsters just suddenly showed up outside the village and swarmed in on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It's almost as if they charged straight in here intentionally...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Intentionally?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>O-oh, no! Those round monsters are back again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Chomp, chomp, chomp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Get behind me, Melty. They're coming!</td>
</tr>
