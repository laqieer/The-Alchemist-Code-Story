<td>Here we are! This is Claybelle's mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wow! It's so big!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, it does house a whole research facility. If you try to learn and perfect all forms of magic, old and new, from every corner of the world, you're inevitably going to need some storage space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why do you have to butt in? Can't you let me explain all this? I'd do it in fewer words, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, please. That's just how Teach would say it, and you know she's gonna parrot all of that before you have a chance to get a word in edgewise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She's always on about how her research is going nowhere, and how she needs more materials and space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So, Lil, I don't know how much of that you understood, but Claybelle is a big magic and human enthusiast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I just wish she would be more considerate to those of us who have to clean up after her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hu...man? E-enthu...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Humans. Like us. Beings rescued from another world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've been told we're more numerous and diverse in the other Stratums, but that's neither here nor there. Well... I guess it's there, but it's certainly not here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's right. We're witches. And as a witch, it's my duty to protect this land and live out my life here; nowhere else. And I'm proud to do so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Home is where you make it, to put it simply. Besides, it takes the power of dragons to move from one Stratum to another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Feeble little humans like us aren't exactly able to ask the dragons for help whenever we'd like. Those who travel to and fro are pretty special beings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Travel...is special?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Schmeier wanted me...to be special?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There you two are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Here we are, indeed. We're back, Claybelle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey there, Teach. Hope you made some good progress on your research today! Can't wait to hear all about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Please, Quence! Are you trying to kill me?! I need my rest for the mountain of work still ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Making excuses, huh? Like a kid who forgot her homework. I take it today hasn't been all too productive yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hahaha! Read the room, Quence, you numbskull! She doesn't want to talk shop right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Who are you calling a numbskull, you numbskull?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So, you're Claybelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Quence. Ambrosia. Who is this child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That is the question, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>She's lost. I caught sight of her just outside town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Interesting. What's your name, girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm? You were so happy to give your name earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Uhm... I was told that I should be very proper when introducing myself to another dragon...that I need to make sure they know I've come in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, dragon of a bygone age. My name is Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I am the child of Schmeier, the recorder of the passage of time, and Zafeiris, the Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh! And I'm also a friend of Sia's, here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Th-that's not something you need to tell everybody when you introduce yourself, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Claybelle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, uh, it's nothing. Haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hahahaha! It's just... The sheer absurdity of it all! It's like someone's playing a practical joke on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That trickster, Zafeiris! He should have told me he'd developed a sense of humor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Schmeier and Zafeiris' child? Hahaha! I would have never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Educating Ouroboros, and a human family structure... And they choose to go about it all by playing house?! Bwahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But sure, this would absolutely make for something better than the dragons that exist today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about? I'm very confused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>How about we continue this inside, Claybelle? It's kinda chilly out here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah, right! Of course! You are a most welcome guest in my home until they come for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She seems fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>She...does. Which has me feeling a bit uneasy, since she's usually a lot gloomier. Did you say something funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I can hear you, Ambrosia. Now get your butts in here, pronto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Y-yes, ma'am! Let's go, Lil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Okey-doke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Are you sure? You've always told us that you don't have the time or energy to deal with trouble like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You say that now? After you've brought her all the way here?! Hmph! But really, this may be just the catalyst I need. I'll gladly stand against Ophioneus, given the circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We have yet to discover a means of combating the corruption, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There'll be time for that later...somehow. Besides, how could I not get involved? I had no idea the Ouroboros project was this...dramatic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Doesn't take much to redirect your focus, does it? You sure you're not part cat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Another quip like that and you'll be able to decide for yourself, after you get a first-hand look at my claws! Now help me swat some of the flies in here before we begin, will you, Quence?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Haaaa... Yeah, all right. Let's hunt some vermin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Why don't you come on out, vermin? You nameless dragons...or should I say, dragons who've abandoned their names?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Impressive work sensing us, Claybelle, purest saint of the seven great dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Don't ever call me that! It's been far too long, and I can't help but cringe when I hear it now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh. Didn't know you had such an edgy...title?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And you'd do well to forget it, unless you want to wind up a pile of ash on my floor for Ambrosia to sweep up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>How scary! What say you focus that ash-making rage on our interlopers instead, hmm? I'll be more than happy to score a few points on these jokers myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You dare oppose us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Of course we do! You think anyone here is just going to sit idly by and let you mess everything up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Ack! S-so this is the power of a great dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Coming into my domain, and causing harm to my people? I'll see you repent for this from the farthest corners of hell itself!</td>
</tr>
