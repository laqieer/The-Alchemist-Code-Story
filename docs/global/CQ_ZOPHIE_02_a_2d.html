<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(However...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Haaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Gh... You... We won't forget this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Phew... All cleaned up! Work done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're quite strong, aren't you, Zofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Strong? I'm strong! Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Nevertheless, if you don't think about how you're fighting, you're going to get yourself hurt. See? Look at you. You're covered in injuries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In...juries? Always! Fine! Work hard! Always!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You're bleeding quite a lot. It hurts, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hurts? Hurts! But heal soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Come here. I can heal them with my medicine. Let me see, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't wanna. Injuries okay. Always okay. No medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Listen to the grown-ups, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Stop wiggling around and hold still. Hm... From the looks of it, they aren't very deep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wow! Hurt stopped! What's this? Winding?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You've never had anyone treat your wounds before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Aha, hurt gone! Treat...? Don't know. Ahahaha. First time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Alexis, worried? Why? What happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What will happen? It's only natural for someone to be worried about someone who's hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Dunno. Friends don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You've never had anyone show you any kind of gentleness before, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Gentle? Lentil? Yummy? Ah—ahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not what I... Well, anyway, I suppose it's hard to explain. Ach...agha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alexis...hurt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, I suppose it's just a case of forgetting to treat one's self, though I suppose you wouldn't understand that either, hm? However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You worried about me just now. That's called gentleness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm... Don't understand. But Alexis made Zofia's hurt stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, I make Alexis hurt stop! I wanna! Winding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Thank you very much, Zofia. It's the thought that counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Difficult, Alexis. Don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...I like...gentleness. Feel good. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're quite welcome, Zofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Let's eat. Together. Happy food! Yummy food. Together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Alright. After we eat, we'll do your examination. Gently, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Okay! Food, food!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ah—?! Zofia, look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Aghhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Alexis...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You'll pay for what you did to us earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A sneak attack is not something to be used against a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you alright, Zofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm okay. Alexis...hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ha! What about that thing is a kid? It's a monster! You can't hold back with monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>(Ah, the ruckus was enough to call forth some nasty creatures... This may be troublesome.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Zofia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Alexis was gentle. Now Zofia can repay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ha! What can you do all by yourself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Zofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm mad. Mad? Yes, mad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Full power... Clean up!</td>
