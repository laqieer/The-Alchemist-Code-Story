<td>Before the age of humanity, long before the regions became as they are, there was life on this world under a different heavenly order...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Its legacy now reduced to mere stories, which stand as remnants of that life once lived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Though that life is long gone, the generations that followed are all its hopes made manifest.</td>

<td>These are the tales—the final throes—of those who would ultimately reveal themselves to be dragons...</td>

<td>Hierosolyma is obviously not the paradise it once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Yeah... Looks like we've failed, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Well, I suppose that just means it's up to us to see that all is in good order before we leave this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Saving this world is the least we can do, really. We are going to be imposing our will upon her, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>You agreed to stand with us in that, did you not, Zafeiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I did, but still, Schmeier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Oh, don't be so stubborn! We're about to initiate her first test runs! Wipe that grimace off your face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We wouldn't want the first expression our daughter sees to be something so dour, now, would we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>...</td>

<td>Oh, dear! It's time. Come back to the lab.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>That was me, as I was in bygone days. Quite different from what you see now, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I suppose it would be more accurate to call it my past life, given the current state of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Ah, right. I'd almost forgotten that you're a Fallen now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Indeed. Those with souls corrupted and degenerated by sin are no longer the beings they once were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Yes, this is my memory. Because I am a vestige of my former self, you are connected to and can see all that lies within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>You will learn firsthand the power and skill of the dragons...along with the depths of their sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>All of which would come together to form your new flesh and blood.</td>

<td>There you are! About time you showed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Are you...sure I'm qualified for this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I have no experience raising a child. We dragons are spawned complete and fully formed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Furthermore, I've only seen this world through conflict. These claws, and the bloodstained battlefields they've been employed in, are all that I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Do you seriously believe I can play house like the humans do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>It's a little late for such contentions, Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We've already discussed this. She needs an exceptionally stalwart custodian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Otherwise, she'd never survive the coming world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We haven't the luxury of another choice. You know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We dragons have made many mistakes, the worst of which is allowing the Shell of the World to degenerate as it has.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>A system meant to protect us, now devouring the world we inhabit... We cannot ignore this. We must rectify this errancy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>The next generations—effectively visitors from another world—should not be burdened with such impossible circumstance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>The humans who've already rooted themselves in this world have started shaping their own society, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>And more of them continue to drift in unwillingly as we speak. Is there a way to stop that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>There is not. Research on matters regarding this issue should be Ophioneus' domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>I wonder what he's doing now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>I'm sure, like you, these humans are looking into this problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Like us, you mean? Don't make it sound as though you're not with me on this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>It's our beautiful little daughter who's going to save the world, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>All phases finalized. Field structure nominal. Vessel construction complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Perfect! Welcome to the world, little one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Can you hear us, Ouroboros?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Hnng... Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Hmm? Are you not yet capable of functioning properly? Odd. I've designed you with a body comparable to what we dragons possess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Ah... Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Whoa! Careful, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Ah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Schmeier, can she not speak?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>That shouldn't be the case. According to my readings, there aren't any functional issues with her structure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>She's most likely just not yet used to her body. Which stands to reason, given that she was forced into it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Who...are...you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>My name is Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Za...feiris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Right. And you are the physical vessel housing Ouroboros, the consciousness of the Shell of the World.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>Ouro...? Shell? Con...sciousness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Hahaha! Zafeiris, she's just a child, only but a few moments old!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Surely you don't expect her to understand all of that just yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>How else was I meant to explain—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Let's just start with a name. What shall we call you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ouroboros?</td>
<td>A...name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Your own personal identifier. Let's see... How do you feel about...Lil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>It means "ocean" in our old tongue. Perfect for a body full of never-before-seen possibilities, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Lil? I'm...Lil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>That's right, Lil. Don't you worry, though. There's no rush. You'll learn everything you need to learn, little by little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Your body is that of a dragon. It is timeless. You have all of eternity to learn, unlike us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lil'</td>
<td>Learn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>Yes. There's a lot of studying to do. Are you feeling up to it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>We'll teach you everything you need to know to save this world, sweet daughter of ours.</td>
