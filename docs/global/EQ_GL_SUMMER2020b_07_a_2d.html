<td>Sigh... I did tell Roxanne to entertain Eira and her new friend while we weren't around, but isn't this overdoing it a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How did they end up running a food stall at the beach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Isn't it fine? Roxanne's been cooped up all this time, and this way Eira gets to go and see more of the world too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Besides, I can't wait to see her in her swimsuit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I just hope they haven't gotten into too much trouble while we were gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why do you always have to be so gloomy? Can't you just look on the bright side for once?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let's just say that my past few... adventures haven't exactly been very confidence inspiring...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Anyway, that looks like the stall up ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Come now Eira, those are meant for the customers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>*Munch* *Munch* ... one more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You've been saying the same thing since a few shaved-ices ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's fine, isn't it? She shouldn't hold back on enjoying these delicacies while we're here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Mmm-mm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You've been indulging her far too much, Shion. This is turning into an unhealthy obsession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nonsense! This is normal for kids her age! Besides, look! We have visitors to attend to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hmm? ... Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Big Bro! Smart Sis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Eira! It's been a while!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ahh, you look so adorable, I can't stand it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>... Aren't you gripping her a bit too tightly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ehehe... Tickles!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hush, I'm recharging my fluffiness meter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... What even is that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, it's good to see you again Eira... as well as you, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to see that you are in good health.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even though Roxanne told me you would be here, it's still a surprise to be meeting you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, don't sweat the details... besides, aren't you going to introduce me to your new companion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The name's Blair, State Artificer from the Slothstein Inventor's guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh my, it seems the child has grown a lot since we last met.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You've even found yourself such an accomplished partner, time sure does move quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What? You've got it all wrong, we... we're not like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Please don't say such misleading things, I'll never hear the end of it if Roxanne's overly active imagination catches wind of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Speaking of which, where is she? I thought you were all together here at the beach stall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Pretty Sis... went to forest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmm, she said something about going to gather more ingredients... but she's taking a worrying amount of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Knowing Roxanne, she could be getting into all sorts of trouble by now. Shall we go look for her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Why am I getting a bad feeling about this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That would be a great help. Just remember to actually look out for Roxanne, and not get too distracted by each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I... I already told you, that isn't how this is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Grr... Soren, your friend is really ticking me off here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sigh, that's how Shion is. Let's just get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>According to Shion's directions, Roxanne should be somewhere in this area...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nothing seems out of the ordinary... wait, what's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>A small glint of silver flashes amidst some nearby bushes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>This ornament is part of Roxanne's swimsuit! I remember helping design that piece for her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Did it get caught on the bushes when she entered the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Look, there's more on the nearby shrubbery as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There are scraps of torn fabric too, it's almost like a trail... leading deeper into the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Maybe... she was being chased by something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>She could be in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Arf! Arf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Eh? One of Eira's foxes... what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Arf Arf Arfff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Calm down, little guy. Did you get lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No Blair, he's trying to warn us, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Did Roxanne get attacked by these monsters too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We can't know for sure unless we take care of these pests first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Already ahead of you! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
