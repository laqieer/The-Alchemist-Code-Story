<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Well... We'd better get planning, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We are now going to slay the fallen dragon, the Great Nidhogg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We don't have much time. The Cursed Beast stirs, and the area around Sephiron has all but been destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>By sundown, we must take the dragon's powers and use the Matter to conduct the sealing ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yeah, okay, but how the hell are we supposed to take down a giant freaking dragon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just so you know, my ship doesn't have that kind of firepower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's all right, Adaleigh... I have an idea. Yna...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The sword you gave Waginau... It is complete, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are the two of you talking about? What's this about my sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yna forged that blade for you for a specific purpose, Waginau; to slice through the Barrier that separates this world from its brethren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Cutting the Barrier...with a sword?! You've gotta be kidding! There's no way that's possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Within every person is a gate that leads elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those are the words my master spoke to me in his final moments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I realized the truth of them only after I arrived in this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>S-so...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that it?! What was the point?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Uhh... Suffice to say that my new technique has been worked into Waginau's blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In other words, it could be used as a catalyst to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait... I can use the same technique as you, Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well...yes. At least, in theory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You sure don't sound very confident about that. Are you saying you didn't even test it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This blade is the sum of my mastery, and ought to choose its wielder; yet not just anyone can attain its true value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Waginau, your will—your refusal—makes you worthy of glimpsing the profundity of this sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So that's why you gave it to me... I see. But how do I draw out this power you speak of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't overthink things. Just use your Spiritbonding, as usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. That, I can do. Leave it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Waginau and I will use my new technique to carve open a path that leads inside the Guardian Dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It will be seeping with corruption, but we'll have Adaleigh's Engineer Soldiers with us. We should be able to traverse the...interior...without much difficulty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Once we have found and destroyed the dragon's core, control over the dragon's powers will shift...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>From the living dragon core to the Matter we possess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But that won't be enough, will it, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Emmel! Shouldn't you be resting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm fine now, thanks to Julia's care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You cannot seal the Cursed Beast without the Vessel of Purification. Is that not so, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You don't have to carry that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You and I have lived blessed lives, Nimul. We have been given so much. We have been protected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All...for the sake of this very day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Upon my life, I will appease the Cursed Beast, for that is the duty I was born to carry out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh? What's with all this "Upon my life," crap? You're not gonna die, are you?! Why should you have to die?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Waginau! What the hell is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The title of Vessel was chosen by the Sephira for its nuance of...offering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She... Lady Emmel...is meant to be the one to seal shut the earth that imprisons the Cursed Beast...as a human sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I suspected as much. There was a similar custom in my hometown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There was a ritual held to beg for protection, in which a sacrifice was offered up to the malevolent gods and the senseless disaster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Th-that's so...primitive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>But that is how we have come to protect our land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We must not squander the countless sacrifices our ancestors have made over the generations, weeping tears of blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I see... So this is why you loathe wanderers such as myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We are little more than pilgrims. We visit for a time, but lack the readiness to shed blood for the sake of the land on which we dwell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's right. I understand that you have strong convictions and dreams of your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>However, that is exactly why we cannot hope to coexist. You spill the blood of others for your own progress, while we spill our own for the peace of all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yet, it appears that your new Chief holds an equally new perspective. Isn't that right, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Emmel...I have no intention of allowing you to be sacrificed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There's no other way! Surely you know that better than anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast can be killed. I am sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Lord Nimul... Are you quite sober?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Of course I am. I know exactly what I'm saying and how it sounds, but thanks to Adaleigh, we have a chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Until you came, I always thought that what one needed to traverse the Barrier was sufficient strength of will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That would have explained why wanderers like Yna were able to pass through the obstructing torrent, but why nothing else came flowing into our region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Precisely. Hence why there have only been two such arrivals since the time of our birth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>No! You're overlooking something enormous that flew right in, but doesn't possess a will of its own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm talking about this, of course... The airship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Ohhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It is truly an amazing invention. Even Yna and I can appreciate its value, just by looking at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>However, you will note that it is equipped with no special measures against the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Well... That's because I didn't really understand what the corruption was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I didn't even know that the corruption was what turned people into the Fallen until I came here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I just thought it was, like...fate, or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No need to look so down about it. Ignorance is the stepladder to all learning. Now... Why, then, was the airship able to cross the barrier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Let's start with this... What is the difference between this airship and those who have been taken by the corruption thus far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I believe that it has something to do with their levels of magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Magil? Well, this ship has the best power reactor in the world on board, just so you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's it, then! The corruption can't consume high concentrations of pure magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The power of the Cursed Beasts and the corruption are one and the same! Therefore, we can assume that the Cursed Beasts themselves share this same characteristic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Magil is one of the components that makes up this world. It can be found in both humans and machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Then we have Matter; the substance that contains the purest concentration of magil in this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Nimul... You intend to use this Matter to strike down the Cursed Beast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I-is that even possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It is. I'm sure of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Listen, Emmel. The components that make up this world form fixed rules that govern it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Sparks will fly when iron strikes iron, steam will rise when water is boiled... There are laws that govern every aspect of our world, and they cannot be challenged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>These laws formed the foundation of the theory on which I based my new technique.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>There are no exceptions to them...not even the Cursed Beasts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>But all of this is just conjecture, isn't it? You don't know anything for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Maybe not, but I'm as close to certain as I can possibly be. It'll work—I just know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Possibilities that risk putting my people in grave danger simply aren't good enough. They have already suffered enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But Emmel, everything we have learned up until this point leads us to this conclusion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>This way, you won't have to die! No, not only you; no one will have to be sacrificed, and our sins will be erased!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Correct me if I am wrong, but regardless of which plan we opt for in the end, the Matter we possess must be made complete first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Then we should save this discussion for after we have slain the dragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Indeed. Beelzebub is on the verge of awakening. We cannot afford a moment's delay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You agree, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Good. Now, wipe that brooding look from your face, will you? We are going into battle, and all our lives are at stake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Ooh, ouch! That's quite a face. Are you okay, man? You're really red, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I was just a bit...passionate...but that was unseemly of me. My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>No more brooding for me. Now, we're all ready to go, I trust? Adaleigh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Y-yeah! The power reactor is already fired up! We'll be on that dragon's tail in no time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>And...Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I'm coming with you, of course. I'm more proficient with Matter than you, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I will protect Lady Emmel with my life. I hope that you have faith in me and will not worry unduly, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Very well. It's time. After that dragon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Such incredible speed... I can hardly believe that this was built by human hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hah! Well, how about that! So, you're finally starting to appreciate me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Quit crowing like a brainless chick, and keep your hands on the helm! Gods above...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Hey! Are you calling me a child again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Cut it out, both of you. We have arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It looks even bigger up close! Where should I land us, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>On the chest! That's where we'll find the core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Seriously?! If we so much as bump the neck or forelegs of this thing, this ship is going down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Don't worry. Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Matter from the fore to the four, bind to thy will anew the fleshy prison from whence I was born!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Grraaaooogghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Whoa! The dragon stopped moving!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Now, Adaleigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Oh, right! Commencing landing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>This is where we come in. Are you ready, Waginau?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Of course. Let's see if this sword's power can truly pierce the dragon's hide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Be careful when you step out on deck! The dragon's messing up the airflow here, somehow. There's no telling where you'll end up if you fall off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Excellent. Now, with the power of my new technique, we will open up a path to the dragon's inner—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Graaarrgh! Grrrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>What?! The beasts of Suga...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>The dragon's corruption must have tainted them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>How should we proceed? Taking on these creatures in midair without a firm foothold would be no small feat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Ice and snow, become the floor beneath my feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>This is...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I condensed the moisture in the surrounding area to form a temporary foothold for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>It won't last long, so we'll need to finish this quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>We won't need long.</td>
</tr>
