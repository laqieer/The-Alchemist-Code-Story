<td>The forest is beautiful as always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Spirits dance delightfully in the pure air, elf song caresses my ears, and noble Alchemia flows between the trees.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm...? What is that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is that a bard? What is he doing in this forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That instrument he's playing is...odd.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Does he intend to disrupt the balance of this forest with his instruments, forged by hateful, human hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I will not allow it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When I hit my tambourine twice...that means no.</td>

<td>You're an odd fellow, aren't you?</td>

<td>You may not care to know this, but my name is Leon.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Leon, hm? You are...a half-elf?</td>
</tr>

<td>What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Tch. Disgusting. Sullied blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's surprising.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't think that there were any boorish forest elves, but it seems that I was mistaken. What a shame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? Are you mocking me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, I'm sorry. The fault is not with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Even if the parent loses their pride as an elf, the child that they bear is not to blame.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In fact, a half-elf is a victim.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You definitely speak like a high-elf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hnnghh... They heard us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Half of the blood that flows in your veins is elven, at least.</td>
</tr>

<td>Since I pity your situation, I shall lend you my strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Haa... Thanks for the pity.</td>
