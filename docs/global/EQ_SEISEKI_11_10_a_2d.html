<td>Lord...Commander...!</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...! We've arrived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The door is open?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He's already here! Hurry!</td>

<td>The Emperor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Emperor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Where is he?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There is only one person in this world fit to bear the title of Emperor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And that is I, the Emperor Orion. I humbly accept this glorious duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No! This can't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ah... Why, hello, Lord Commander. As you can see, you just missed the festivities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No... Emperor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lion Monarch Orion! You... How could you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hm. Appalling. Is that how you speak to your Emperor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Emperor?! What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Try and keep up, Lord Commander. To spell it out for you, I have ascended to the highest throne of this land. I am now your Emperor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In other words, you now work for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're joking! No one will allow this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Allow...? What are you on about? They are in no position to allow anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I hold the Sacred Stone Lucifer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It is proof that my ascension is the will of the world! This is the law of the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The will...of the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He's serious?! There's no way such shameless justice can be the law of the world! Whatever it means that we have arrived at this point...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...I could never let this be. I could never just accept this violent, high-handed tyranny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>As Lord Commander, and as a person who lives in this world... It is my duty to rise against you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Intriguing... You wish to defy the laws of this world and stand against me, the Emperor...on principle? Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>N-no... Impossible... Such an incredibly large Phantom cannot be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now then, Lord Commander... Here is your chance to decide the destiny of your own justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Survival of the fittest... That is the only way your justice will endure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Ready yourself, Kanon! I will do something about that Phantom... You must stop Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let us begin, Lord Commander. Let us define the start of a new era!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Nngh! He's strong... So this is the Lion Monarch Orion...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You disappoint me. I am not some brute. I have some confidence in my agility as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>?! Behind me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmph. Shameful of you to have underestimated the Lion Monarch Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Kanon, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>N-Ngh... Gah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If it isn't the Flame Dragon King, Cadanova... I never thought I would have the chance to meet such an illustrious man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>How sad that this won't last very long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I apologize, but I'm a rather busy man, so I need to wrap this up quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Agh?! Ngah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>S-such unbelievably strong powers of darkness... H-how is this possible of one who exists in this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This world...? Ah. I did hear that you had been sealed in the other world for a while. You, too, must have seen it... That incredible strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>People have been saying that Orion is a Vessel of Reincarnation for Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>A Vessel of Reincarnation?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...! I see! So that is why you targeted Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>My, my... Cadanova, you also knew what secrets Wadatsumi's royal family was keeping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The secrets of Wadatsumi's royal family?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Grk! This is worse than I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Kanon! We must end this man where he stands, right now! There is no other option... No matter what the cost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>?! O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That...is taking justice into our own hands, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>A-according to the Magna Code, he is due a fair trial for the murder of the Emperor via our justice system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>There's no time for that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>If this man is truly Nimul's Vessel of Reincarnation, then we must stop him before he gets his hands on such overwhelming strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If Nimul's power is revived, we will have lost our window to stop him completely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>B-but... If Nimul's Vessel of Reincarnation appears in this world, shouldn't Emmel's appear as well to quell it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We could send people to each country to search for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That's a waste of time and energy! There's no point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>A waste?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahaha! It seems you still fail to fully grasp the situation you are in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Your presence here is already pointless, for I shall crush you beneath my heel right here and now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Kanon! There's no time to argue! We must destroy him now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Grk... Gah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>N...ngh...grk... He's...so fast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why, I'm flattered. However, is now really the time to be giving me compliments?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Oh no... Kanon, stand back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>W-woah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Ngh...! Huzzzaahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>He deflected my Phantom's sword?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Argh... Flame Dragon - Star!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ugh... Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>If we let this chance to stop you slip away, we may never have another... So, I must devote my entire self...to cutting you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>C-Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Well, well. I think you deserve a round of applause! After all, this is an excellent example of the so-called "absolute justice" that you and Zain espoused so vehemently!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Is it enough to stop me? The Lion Monarch? Shall we put it to the test?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>He got back up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Do not waver, Kanon! You...and your powers of light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>W-will...be the key to...defeating his powers...of darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>C-Captain Cadanova! No... He's using...powers of darkness?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I have...no choice! If we don't stop...him... The world's end...is nigh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Kanon...don't concern yourself...with me. Focus on...ending this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Don't...forget... The fate of this world...relies on the swing...of your sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I... I understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hmph... A bold choice to hang all your hopes on this girl by transforming your own soul into a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch accepts your challenge! Come at me with everything you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Huzzzzaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I have not put my life on the line for nothing! Flame Dragon - Star!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>What...?! The light and the darkness... They're merging?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Nnrghhh...?! Th-this...power is...ngraaaaahhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Nngh! Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>W-we did it... Haaa... You did well, Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>A-and the power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm still...fine... At this level, it's...not too difficult...to suppress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>It's incredible that you could pull off such a thing. I don't think anyone else would be capable of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Ack...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>But I... I am one who was chosen by...the laws of the world! I am nothing like the others! How unfortunate...for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Nngh... This...power... No... It can't be! Nimul...has already begun his...resurrection?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Hehe... The balance of power in the world has already begun shifting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>The time of my triumph is upon us! Soon, we will be connected to that ruined tower and this body will receive the full power it deserves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>There are none that can stand in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Nngh... I must...push the limits...of my darkness...as well. Grrnnghhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Hahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Ah... Ack... Wh-what is happening?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Do you not know of the Alchemy Source? There is Emmel's Alchemy of Compassion, which can give people strength...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>And N-Nimul's Alchemy of Power, which allows one to draw out strength that dwarfs the rest... No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hehe... I am a generous man. It seems that Captain Cadanova needs a little extra...push.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>After all, what was it that you said...? "No matter what the cost"? This is no time to be saving your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Hrgh...! Nnnghhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Oh no! It can't... Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Oh dear. Are you unable to handle the powers I have bestowed upon you? I do apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Haaahhh! Hrnnghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Captain...? Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Nngh... Ex...calibur...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ex...calibur... A sword which...draws in...the hearts of...people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Wh-when you...are down... Believe in...Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Believe...in Excalibur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Gnrgh... K-Kanon! You must...not allow...him to live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>You are...this world's last...line of defense against...the darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Tsk, tsk... Cadanova, you're contradicting yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Did you not say that the world's fate rested on that last swing of yours? In other words, having failed... You have forfeited this world to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>K-Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Ugh. I'm sick of you. Die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>!!! Captain...Cadanova?! No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>...?! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Ah, Lord Commander... All alone and at my mercy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>Ack! ...Gah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Now, even you are nothing more than a defenseless little fly compared to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>My body is overflowing with power! Hahaha...haha! Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>H-hrgh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>This is the end! I shall finally fulfill the destiny that has marked me. I will finally go to that promised place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>The final showdown between Northern Pride and Greed Dike has finally begun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch has resurrected the power of Nimul's alchemy, using it to overpower the Emperor and take the Sacred Stone "Lucifer" into his possession.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>And yet, his ambitions stretch even higher, to the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Can it be that the founders of Alchemy, Nimul and Emmel, truly approve of his actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>Will Orion finally fulfill the ambitions he has thrown the whole world into chaos for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>The Lion Monarch's Charge has left not one country on Babel untouched.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>Now, they spiral toward their final demise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nngh... As if I could...let things end...this way! I will...never...!</td>
