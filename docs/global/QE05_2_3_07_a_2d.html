<td>That power is...!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. I am one of the few who remain whose roots are the same as yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What the heck, dude? You couldn't have said that earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>In these distrustful times, I figured it'd be easier to show you rather than ask you to take my word for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I guess it explains why you knew Hawk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't wish to cause you further pain, but if it is possible...could you tell me what happened to Hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh... Hawk must have left an impression on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Even now, I think about how I could have saved him...if only I had been stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He and I were following different paths. At the time, I thought it was for the best, but now... Perhaps I made a mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If only I had thought to bring him with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Or if I had considered that his path might lead him to danger...I could have changed his fate, if only I had been more willing to lend him a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That is why I wanted to speak to you, to accept whatever recrimination or bitterness either of you might have held against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No... Hawk was never the type to hold a grudge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>He was a passionate, straight-forward kind of guy. That was one of the best things about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whaâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Where'd that shot come from?! All I see around us is desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They're probably using some kind of concealment technique. I'm just not sure how to pinpoint their location!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Whoever it is, they're not alone! Who is doing this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It must be the Corpse! They must be taking advantage of the mayhem that Greed Dike wrought to attack us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Are you serious?! We don't have time to guess at the politics of this mess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Well, if they're using a concealment technique, they probably aren't able to protect their actual bodies right now. So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What? You can do that with Spiritbonding?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aim for where the sand is floating in mid-air! We should take them out before the wind blows it all away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Right!</td>
