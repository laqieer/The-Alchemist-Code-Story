<td>D-dammit! I hate you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh no. They've gone. They seemed upset for some reason... Was it something I've said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Not sure. They were saying something about Valentine's Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is there some connection between Valentine's chocolates and White Day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I don't know. I've been told White Day is when one gifts sweets to another, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Excuse me, you two. If I may explain what White Day is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Well, I suppose that's not necessary as long as the party preparations move along efficiently.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No... Never mind. Miss Plumeria, have you brought the sweets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I have! Now all we have to do is make them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Indeed, all we have to do is make... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Miss Plumeria, did you perhaps purchase not the sweets themselves, but instead ingredients to make them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And you not only do not deny the accusation, but announce the truth of it proudly. Did I not direct you to the patisserie to purchase the sweets from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You did! The sweets there did look really nice, but I felt like that would be lacking somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lacking? What could possibly be—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I used to have this tutor who taught me something I hold dear to this day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Make sweets with love, so they might bring warmth to another's heart. Only then can words locked deep in one's heart be heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I remembered those words and I thought making the sweets ourselves would be much more meaningful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see. Then I entrust that task to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>(Uh oh, he's clearly not happy. His words are pleasant, but that tone is not. And yet...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yay! Thank you for trusting me! I will do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, if she doesn't care, why should I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Anyway, handmade sweets, huh? I wonder how they'll turn out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah, I'm so sorry, Reimei. I knocked over a few plates and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This looks like way more than just a few.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And...plates aren't the only things you knocked over...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I was trying to put away the plates, and I fumbled a little... I kind of...knocked the tea set off the table, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This is...the tea that Ankh brought. Uh oh. He's not going to like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I was just so anxious about making this White Day party a success...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've always wanted to be helpful to someone and bring a smile to their faces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So I really want this party to go well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Right. But why insist on White Day for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, that's because White Day is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, watch your step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I forgot I spilled whipped cream on the floor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What is going on here?! Oh my.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sigh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm actually amazed how much mess you were able to make in such a short period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(This wouldn't have happened if she had just bought the sweets I'd asked her to. Pathetic, useless...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry! I'll clean this up right away! I underestimated how clumsy I could be. I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But! I will persevere! I will give my all to make this an A+ party that everyone can enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I pray you too will maintain your composure, Master Ankh. After all, you are of noble birth, destined to stand above others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>As long as you do not forget that feeling of hospitality, then I do not mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It is much like potting flowers for the house you serve. Your master may not notice them, but it will be there to soothe their mind if they do happen to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Always be sure to act for others and not for your own sake. I will take care of this mess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, p-please, allow me to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's fine. I cannot risk you causing any more trouble in the kitchen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I-I'm so sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I would appreciate it if you would go purchase dishes to replace the ones that have been shattered, however. We will be needing more than these few that are still usable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Absolutely! I will find dishes worthy of an A+!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Great...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Good job holding it together, Ankh. I thought you were going to explode for sure this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Gotta be impressed by all that motivation of hers, though. Can't imagine where it's coming from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Tch. Who knows? I've never encountered another quite so frustratingly and destructively a hindrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You seem to be worried for her. I'm surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Trying to ignore the sincerity of people like that never really works. They're just too earnest about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Unfortunately for me, that does not negate how frustrating it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Phew! I finally found the best plates. I asked the store to deliver them for me so that I wouldn't accidentally break them again. I think I did well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, why is it that I make such a mess every time I'm in a kitchen? I've caused them both so much trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Still, the things Ankh said... To be sure to always act for others and not for my own sake. He cares about this party as much as I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Goodness... That's exactly why I can't not do my best to help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I must do what I can to ensure Ankh and the party guests can smile happily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Excuse me. I'd like to order a bouquet, please. I need a gift for my girlfriend for White Day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Flowers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I know! Flowers! A little bit of extra hospitality for the guests to enjoy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A little bit of floral decorations should make the party venue even better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>If I can find some flowers that perfectly display my passion for this party, I can surely get Ankh to smile!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Well then, I must be off to pick some flowers!</td>
</tr>
