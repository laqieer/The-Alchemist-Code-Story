<td>Oh dear children of the world...is there no greater happiness for this old man than to see your smiling faces?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's so cool, Michael!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You sure do cherish the Winter Holiday spirit. Is Lofia also helping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh yes! I'm indebted to her highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, count me in then! I want to help out with the winter holiday too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Please, Michael! Let me help you raise the holiday spirit with you and Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Being with you two is bound to be fun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Looks like everyone's having a good time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What's wrong? Why the long face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Birgitta...Klima... Why are you two here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just on the lookout. It didn't snow last time, so I'm hoping it'll be different this year...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I understand. It should be okay this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even the Maruda tribe are insisting it will be a snowy holiday this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's why we are giving Carol and Hazel a helping hand with preparing for the party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey, wanna give us a hand? Looks like you finished decorating the streets, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, I have, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's wrong, Ravina? You seem down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, if you say so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Don't just say, "If you say so..." You should try to express yourself, Klima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>"It's the happiest time of the year, turn that frown upside down," is what you wanted to say, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's the Winter Holiday season. It's filled with parties and fun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>And Klima loves Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Sorry to say, I'm not so big on Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>W-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Well, it's because I can't be with Michael and Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah, that's right. Those two are always busy at this time. They're doing security this year, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's just... I want to work security. To be with them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But, won't they be joining us once they're done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Right? So don't worry! ...look who's here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hi! Is Ravina here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey, Lotiyah! What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Um... I bring word from Lofia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh, Lofia! What did she say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>She said that she and Michael are still busy with security details, so they won't be able to come back just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She also said, "I assume Birgitta and Klima will be at the party, so please wait with them until we return."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Jeez...talk about terrible timing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Are Lofia and Michael busy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Seems so. Since there's a lot to take care of for Winter Holiday, it's no wonder they're busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I thought so too. They're probably the busiest people on Winter Holiday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...I'm not surprised. Security is tough, after all. I wanna help them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ah, well, they seem to have enough people though. So, I don't think they need any help...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But, they're busier than everyone else, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I mean, that's true, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Come on now, Ravina. Lofia and Michael have been entrusted with this job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>They have their way of doing things. If you show up all of a sudden, it might be distracting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If those two ask for help, then you should go help them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>That's right! Since you've finished your work, you should kick back and relax!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I'm sure Santa has something nice for everyone who's worked so hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...I'm not so sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What?! So...maybe no presents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'm sure Santa has something nice for you, Klima, you've certainly been good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...but me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Why? You're sure to get something. You've been good too you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Exactly. Hard working boys and girls are all good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>And Santa always brings presents to good boys and girls!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's why Santa will bring something for Ravina...and Lofia too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...and Michael?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Michael works hard, but is he also a good boy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Well, to say Michael is a "boy" is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...I see. By that reasoning, Michael must also be a good boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Umm... Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wait, Lotiyah! You're agreeing with her, Ravina? That geezer isn't young enough to be a good kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>With animals, they can be good even if they are old, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So, yes! Michael is certainly a good boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're such a good person, Lotiyah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Oh! You mean it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Heh, well, you must be naive to call that Archmage a "good boy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Is that what you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Well, that old man would be happy to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...this party...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ravina, for the sake of those two, this party can't just be some regular old party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Should be more bigger. Let's have the most amazing Winter Holiday party ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Let's show how much we appreciate Lofia and Michael by throwing a huge party for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Something that will wow them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>That would please the two of them, and in turn, that would please you too, Ravina, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That way, you would also have a great Winter Holiday, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Klima...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Now that we're outside... What do you think would make the greatest party ever?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>No clue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>No plan, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Well, in that case... Let's first take a look around the Winter Holiday market!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Slothstein has a large market. We might find some inspiration there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Look! There are Winter Holiday trees everywhere. Big ones, small ones, white ones, green ones, brown ones...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Wowww, so many sizes! What kind of tree do you two like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>What kind? Ummm, I have no idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Thoughts, Klima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Errrm, I think a big one will do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>We have to get the biggest tree in town. Then Ravina will decorate it and make it look very merry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Yeah. Having a huge tree would be great as it is, but then we'll make it all shiny with decorations. They'll surely love it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What do you think, Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...the biggest tree...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Yeah, sounds good. Like, maybe this tree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Nah...we need something that really says "big."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I'm sorry young lady. This is the biggest tree we have in the shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Aww.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>...! Klima! Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Uh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Are you okay, Ravina?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'm okayâ€¦ What just happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Stop! Thief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Really?! How could something like this happen on a festive day like today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Alright, then. I think we better give security a helping hand.</td>
