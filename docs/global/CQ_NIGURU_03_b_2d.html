<td>Calm down, Ila!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I can't stand it! I just can't! The Holy Guard took everything from me! I hate them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(This is not good. Things are going to get much worse if Ila continues to unleash her Alchemia in rage.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(Perhaps I should prepare for the worst.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(...?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Haaa...! Haaa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh no! Somebody, come quick! The Paladins...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ila, we're leaving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>H-hold it! Make way! Move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Things have gotten out of hand. I can no longer continue my investigation like this. You really couldn't resist, could you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Y-you're blaming me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I kept my cool! I was this close to losing it and beating the absolute crap out of those Paladins, but I didn't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>To be honest, I am surprised at that. I'm proud that you were able to somewhat control yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I mean, I do absolutely hate the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But there was someone else who was just... Ooh... Just really pissing me off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I take it you mean me. Was it that unbearable to see me considering the informant's proposal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't stand it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We could have gained some useful information by accepting his request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I mean... Maybe... But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But you hate being an assassin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>To endure something you hate doing, even for the sake of the Shadow Messiah... I just can't stand it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You can tell...that I hate killing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't underestimate me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course I can tell! I've been observing you closely so that I can beat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, the Shadow Messiah can find some tome without you having to endure what you hate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And yet you were still going to... I just can't stand it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmph...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wh-what? What are you sighing for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I never said that I was going to take that job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whaâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whether that man even had any information on the missing researcher was questionable, so I was trying to suss out the truth of the matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>O-oh... Well... Fine! I really can't stand you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I am not saying that you did anything wrong, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And the fact that you were able to keep your temper in check is a definite sign of growth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Even in the skirmish with the Holy Guard, you were fighting very efficiently. Your training is bearing fruit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-where is that coming from?! You never praise me like this! I can't stand it! This feels weird!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(The ark that will spread our will to the rest of the world, once our new order has been established...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(Even a wretch like me, so stained in darkness, may yet be able to leave something worthwhile behind.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I see... Hehe, you two sounded like you were having so much fun, I almost thought I was hearing a family on vacation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Heh, I left that house to cut ties with one family, only to find myself bound to another... How ironic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(Still, if this is what a family can be, then perhaps it is not so bad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What are you on about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I was just thinking that if you're keeping an eye on me like that, I have to step up my game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I...still don't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Anyway, you couldn't find what you were looking for, right? What are you gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I'll ask you to help me find the tome from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A-are you sure?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Depends on how you do in your next training session.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All right! Just wait and see! I'm gonna blow your mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The darkness within whispers to me...that I'm looking forward to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're starting to get the hang of it. That's it, Ila. Listen closely to the whispers of the darkness within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're speaking nonsense again! Ugh, when will I ever beat this guy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Not until you can handle an entire platoon of Paladins on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Grr... Dammit! Fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hehe, you two really do sound like a family having fun together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You still think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Then I suppose I could still be even more strict with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Oh my.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey, Corvus! What are you doing?! Training's not over yet! I can keep going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Geez... The stamina of children these days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All right, then. I can humor her for a bit longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That is what the darkness within me whispers.</td>
</tr>
