<td>Hrahh! Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Very good. That's enough training for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heheh. Thank you so much, Setsuna!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's a little later than I thought. Are you okay? Tired at all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm tired, but I'm okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That's good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, why are the lights in the house off?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh. Maybe Sis isn't home yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She did mention something about a ritual before. Maybe it's running late?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmm. I wouldn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Well, let's get dinner ready for her so she can—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Setsuna? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shush! There's someone in the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What could they be doing in there with the lights off? Jayme, you stay back. I'll go have a look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>G-got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, Setsuna. Welcome home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Macherie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, it's me. Is Jayme not with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The lights were off, so I had him hang back just in case something was wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lights? Oh, I'm so sorry! I can see without them, so I completely forgot to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hahah. I'm sorry. I'm just so out of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Welcome home, Jayme. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm okay, but...are you tired, Sis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um, yes, my shrine duties must have me worn out a little. I guess this is why I'm still just an apprentice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you're tired, why not let us take care of things and go get some rest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm fine! Seeing you two has made my exhaustion disappear!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you're sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh, right! I have a gift from the shrine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Cool! What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(There's something wrong with Macherie, but...perhaps it isn't my place to ask her about it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You're not focused at all. What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hesitation dulls your blade and distractions will slow you down. Remember that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If there's something on your mind, you can tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well...um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's about Macherie, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yeah... Something was up with her last night, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You obviously know her better than I do, but...yes, I felt the same. You must be worried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>She said she was just tired out from her shrine duties, but I've never seen her like that before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Do you want to go investigate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Investigate? You mean the shrine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're training so that you can protect her, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Well, yeah, but...we're in the middle of training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Training while you're in this state would be pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Besides, if worrying for Macherie's well-being is distracting you from training to protect her, then you've clearly lost sight of the point of all this training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You're doing this for her, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Y-yeah. I just don't want to get in her way if she's working.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Are you afraid of getting scolded?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No... No, I'm not! That's... That's not what I'm scared of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Setsuna, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(That's right. To protect the ones I loved, this is what I should have done.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What do you mean Macherie isn't here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>N-no need to be so hostile. How am I supposed to go get someone who's not even here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Fair enough. Can you at least tell us where she is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, there was the Shrine Monarch's vision... Erm, I mean, Macherie's off somewhere because of her duties as an apprentice, I assume...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I want to know where she is and what she is doing right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's enough, Setsuna. I shouldn't have gotten involved like this to begin with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You've done nothing wrong, Jayme. Your honest concern for Macherie is a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Jayme...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>All right, all right. I'll tell you, but you didn't hear this from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>We're not interested in getting anybody in trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Macherie left the village to go to the ruins alone. For the ritual, she needs—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>She left the village alone?! She was attacked by a Wildpecker out there not too long ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Jayme, I'm going to the ruins. You go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm coming, too! I'm just as worried about her as you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>It could be dangerous. I can't allow—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Setsuna, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(He really wants to be there for Macherie. He's such a wonderful kid.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>All right. So long as you promise to hide at the first sign of any danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Then let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I wasn't done talking... I hope they'll be all right. That ruin...they don't know what's waiting there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This must be the place. If she's not out here, she must be inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I hope she's okay. Look...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Monsters like that? Here?! And so many of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Damn it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>(There's no time to hesitate. We can figure out the why later!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I won't let you take her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Oh no! That one noticed us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Ssssssss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I won't let you take her away from him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'll destroy you all!</td>
</tr>
