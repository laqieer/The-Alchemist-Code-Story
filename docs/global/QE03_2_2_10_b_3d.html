<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Unbelievable!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>He-Headmistress...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She won...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huff... huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack...I can't die here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My body...it's healing itself...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've helped a lot of people in this way until now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Only a child can surpass and save her parents. Are you still afraid of this power, headmistress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Eleonora...I've seen Lisbeth's power. It's far from ominous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I've seen her save a small life with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Still, she should not reach for the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Please! I don't mean any harm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I will put an end to the curse of the Sacred Stone. Please teach me how to reach Asmodeus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...I will not tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>What is there to tell? As I said, no witch has ever reached for and grasped the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't believe that even the headmistress doesn't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You cannot reach the Sacred Stone...that's what I was taught growing up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Our curriculum is incorporated in a way that prevents young witches from wanting to seek the cursed Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You mean like some kind of psychological influence or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're as quick-witted as ever, Alma Haas Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This country's education is approached in a way that prevents us from getting close to the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There must be a reason why they've distanced us from Asmodeus other than that it being a dangerous power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If that's so, then we may learn some truth from the person who created the curriculum as well as the school!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you talking about...Queen Venus?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As for a clue...there's a lot that only the queen knows. You're going to the Royal Palace, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yep! Although...I might get caught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How about I lend you hand so that you don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We've come this far together already. I'll go with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wh-what is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>No...it's nothing. Just be careful. Those at the Royal Palace will not be so easily reasoned with as myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So you've entrusted it to that child, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yes. I've entrusted her with the magic of hope that we ancient witches once looked to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That child may have the power to melt the ice of this country.</td>
