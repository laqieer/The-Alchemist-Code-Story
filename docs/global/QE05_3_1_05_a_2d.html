<td>Gluttony Foss has been ruled by one king for the past hundred years.</td>

<td>Impossible, I know. That's one of the reasons why he's a monster, right?</td>

<td>Exactly. He controls amorphous demons and devours people, robbing them of their Alchemia in order to extend his life.</td>

<td>Oh, thank goodness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>He was not among the army that returned, so I had thought that he may have fallen in battle. I only hope that he is alive...</td>

<td>Whereas you're...sweet? Graceful? Totally different.</td>

<td>Heheh. I suppose we are different. I was never blessed with his physical strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>You see this cloth? Georgios purified it with his power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I think I can feel his energy within it, but...your wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>
<td>Ah, they're from fighting against the Jam. We came out to this desert in search of a way to purify their corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I'm... I'm sorry. Had I been more attuned to my powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I fear that I may only be able to delay the progression of the corruption for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/moca.png" alt="Mocca" height="128"><br>Mocca</td>

<td>Now we're here with someone of the Sephira. We're making progress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I know that my cousin would have been a better contact for you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>I am fortunate. I never thought that I would find two people who would cooperate with me as you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Marie</td>
<td>All we have to do now is find the Sephira and return toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
