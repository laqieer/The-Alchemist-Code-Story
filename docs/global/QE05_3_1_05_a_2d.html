<td>Look! Water! There's water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's been so long since I've seen so much water!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's so cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She's like a little kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kinda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seeing her like this makes it hard to believe what she told us last night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Gluttony Foss has been ruled by one king for the past hundred years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>One king?! I mean, I could understand if it was a Great Sprite like Voda, but a human?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Impossible, I know. That's one of the reasons why he's a monster, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Exactly. He controls amorphous demons and devours people, robbing them of their Alchemia in order to extend his life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Amorphous demons? You don't mean—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I heard that they were called the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The king's power is now well beyond that of any human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He is the embodiment of gluttony. A monster that devours land, people, and life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The nobility of Gluttony Foss have obeyed him blindly, fearing what may become of any transgressions, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The situation changed with the failure at Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. The king is weakened after failing to acquire Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>With the purifying power of the Sephira's Protector, we may now defeat the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We may now return the country of Gluttony Foss to its people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>She wants to restore the country to how it should be. That's not really something that I can understand, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Me neither, but there's something about her that makes me feel empathetic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I think she knew she had to change, that she had to make changes to protect what must be protected, and resolved to do just that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I was surprised, though, to hear you invite her along with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, you're usually a bit more withdrawn with people. What brought about this change in you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>She...looked sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I just thought to myself, what would Lisbeth do? And it just sort of came out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmm... I think this is a good thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's about time you learned to open up to people, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hold on, look who's talking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>When are you going to start smiling more? Didn't you learn anything from Lisbeth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Uh, you were the one saying that I should do what comes naturally to me, remember?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah, but you're the last person I need telling me to open up to people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Both of you, please! Won't you include me in your little chat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You shouldn't be fighting. We're here to have some fun in the water, aren't we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Erm...hello? You're starting to frighten me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ahhh! Wait, that's not fair! It's two against one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh no... My clothes are all wet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sorry, Marie. I got a little carried away back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Here, use this cloth to dry yourself off. Sorry about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah, thank you! Umf...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Marie! Don't take your clothes off here! Have you no shame?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh? But I'd hate to catch a cold. Shouldn't I at least wring out my clothes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I guess there's no argument as to who's the most open of the three of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm sorry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Th-that mark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, I've had this since birth. It's apparently called the sephirah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hmm... I am afraid I'll definitely catch a cold like this. Shall we return to the inn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What's wrong? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yeah, it's the same mark that was on Georgios. She really must be a Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You know my cousin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Marie, what did you just say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Georgios is my cousin. Oh, well, of course. If you're from Saga, I suppose you would know about him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He was the general in charge of the invasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You're related to him, Marie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Could it be that you two know of his whereabouts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Well, we do think he's alive, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>He was not among the army that returned, so I had thought that he may have fallen in battle. I only hope that he is alive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I have to say, I did not see this coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Miss Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well... It's just that you're nothing like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yeah. Georgios was sort of...a warrior, through and through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whereas you're...sweet? Graceful? Totally different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Heheh. I suppose we are different. I was never blessed with his physical strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You see this cloth? Georgios purified it with his power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I think I can feel his energy within it, but...your wounds...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ah, they're from fighting against the Jam. We came out to this desert in search of a way to purify their corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm... I'm sorry. Had I been more attuned to my powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I fear that I may only be able to delay the progression of the corruption for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Don't feel so bad. We started this journey with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Now we're here with someone of the Sephira. We're making progress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I know that my cousin would have been a better contact for you, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I am fortunate. I never thought that I would find two people who would cooperate with me as you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>All we have to do now is find the Sephira and return to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Forget it. Such a future is not in store for you. Your journey ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Marie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Who are you? Why do you stand in my way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Why did you kill that child?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>This worthless thing? I could barely extract any Alchemia from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I simply rid myself of worthless livestock. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
