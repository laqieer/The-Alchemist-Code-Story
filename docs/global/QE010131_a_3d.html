<td>That's odd. Dias and the Holy Guard should've caught up with us by now. I was prepared for an attack.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Do you think it was Logi? Oh, father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's all right. He may still be soft around the edges, but Logi is a responsible knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Besides, ironically, with Alchemists and the Lizard Brigade near him, he'll be okay.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. Logi and the others are helping us down our path.</td>

<td>For everyone's sake, we need to somehow obtain an audience with the king and have him listen to our proposal.</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>Exactly. Look, there's Spandau Castle.</td>

<td>Once we get inside the castle, I'll head through the corridor straight for the throne room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We'll be in a tough situation where we can't be the ones to initiate an attack. However, please do your best to suppress the Holy Guard's attacks!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's no need for you to worry about us, Captain. Our hearts are always with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>

<td>014</td>
<td>Agatha, youâ€”</td>

<td>I will go with you father. After all, I am the one who began this talk of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well then, let's go! We must make the king understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We will sever this cycle of hatred with our own hands!</td>
