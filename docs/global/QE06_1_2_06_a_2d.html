<td>002</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Go, now! Leave this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>How is it so hard to find one of these?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Azami! Glad to see you're safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Amane. You too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Have you found any Hidden Ogres?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh... Well, let's search together. It should be more efficient that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let's be cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Just as I thought. Your acting is flawed, Hidden Ogre.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Tch! How did you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You may make yourself look like her, but you can't copy her perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amane would never even think to use the word "cautious."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. You would've suffered less if you had simply let me devour you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you all plotting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Plotting? We are not doing anything like that. This is merely what we do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Aren't you humans the same? You eat when you feel hunger. It's as simple as that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It is sheer stupidity to expect some grand plot behind every action made simply for survival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If it was only to satiate your hunger, there wouldn't be any reason for you to engage in any extra maliciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I don't need to explain myself to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>See? So you are hiding something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, it's irrelevant. It doesn't change the fact that I have orders from Captain Ugachi to eliminate you all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Then why did you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Knowing your end game will allow us to predict your next move. This will help us kill you off more efficiently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I need you to understand how it feels to be persecuted and have your entire kind slaughtered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It's only fair, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Grr!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I wouldn't be able to exterminate all of your kind if I couldn't even handle little old you, now could I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So, disappear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
