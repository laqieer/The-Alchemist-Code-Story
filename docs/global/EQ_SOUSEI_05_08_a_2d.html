<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>My name is Andechs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've been entrusted with King Arius' wish to preserve peace between our kingdoms—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, I'm basically your everyday righteous knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A righteous knight, you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Does that make me the villain responsible for ravaging your Ira Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? Oh no, that's not what I was trying to say at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm not here for any underhanded business, I just have a message to deliver.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hm. A difficult thing to trust. And yet I can tell from your bearing that you have no intention of casting yourself as my enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's no doubt that you're a skilled warrior, but I sense no hostility from your posture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So I'm guessing you're not here to assassinate this old man then, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You got me! You're pretty cheeky for an king, you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Truthfully, that's something of a relief for me. I'm not the best at formality myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>All that proper etiquette and beating around the bush just to try to slowly guess at each other's intentions? No thank you, that's just not for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then be at ease. I myself am not so fond of such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I always like to think that I am a human first, king second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's all too easy to forget that you're still just a person, no different from your people, when you're the king.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you don't mind yourself, it's all too easy to become a tyrant that's grown unable to understand the general public.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sounds like ruling is no simple matter, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But that isn't here nor there. We've got ourselves quite the pickle to deal with first, so I'm here to get your cooperation through any means possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Oh? Is the Ira Belt is asking for our help?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Does this happen to be related to fact that your soldiers are attacking us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Fraid so. We don't have a lot of time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>At this rate, Satna's flames are going to raze the whole place down before half the month is up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You believe your Cursed Beast was roused by that incident too then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right. Well. It's more accurate to say that the root of the problem has always been simmering under our feet this whole time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The fire-breathing Cursed Beast that sleeps at the foot of the holy Mt. Shinai, Satna... It wakes once a decade and brings forth great calamity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We have to survive its "night of fire rain" one way or another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's why I came to your country for aid, for a power said to chase away even the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We want to borrow your Silver Shield's divine protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whew! It really is just one thing after another in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This Cursed Beast really gets free reign to go wherever it pleases 'round here, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This isn't the time to admire it! Imnus, we have to retreat now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's going to hit our fleet head-on if we don't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Everybody retreat! Leave arms and other ballast behind! Lend a hand to the wounded if you're able!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes, sir! You heard the man! We're fighting against the clock here, so move it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Huh? What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The captain told us to help the wounded, I'm just following orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You're helping your enemy? Did you forget we just invaded your country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who cares about such things when the battle is over? We won, and losers should listen to the victors. If you have a problem with that, you should've tried harder to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...You're a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hurry! Board the faster ships! Ships at full capacity should leave immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>(This isn't good, everybody is still exhausted from the fight. We're too slow...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hey, Nimul! How many people can fit on the airship of yours?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>A couple dozen at best, and it'll be hard enough to escape with that many.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If only the Silver Shield wasn't broken...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Evacuate as many people as possible. I'm going to try and buy us some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...All right, I'll leave this in your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Adaleigh, did you copy? How long is it going to take to ready the Valley of Siddim?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I thought it might come to this, so I made sure to stoke Libra's fire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But I don't have Mira and Nyx here, so I won't be able to keep it going for long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>That's fine. I'll take every second you can give me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Alrighty, let's fire this baby up then—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Initiating Anti-Curse Beast Binding Protocol! Redirecting magil from the reactor to rapidly pressurize Libra!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I need a bit more time! Keep 'em busy a little longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...I'm not going to let tragedy repeat itself in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>That's why we've come here! To prevent such things from happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I will stop it! I will spare this place the grief and sorrow!</td>
</tr>
