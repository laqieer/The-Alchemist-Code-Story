<td>001</td>
<td>Whoa! What's this!? There're so many lovely flowers! And so many beautiful decorations!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Let's see... Pretty pastel flowers and entertaining music in the air... Is there a festival?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ooh! How lucky! I wonder if we can join in after we've fulfilled our duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Huh? Is that...? And in dresses!? How cute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, it's Shayna and Chihaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Lucia! And Lucretia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Are you two also security for this fair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No, we've been tasked with tracking down some bandits. We were just headed elsewhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We were given this mission because the local bandits have been growing in strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, I'd heard something about that. We've also paid some attention to criminal activity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If you've been summoned, then it's serious enough measures needed to be taken...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Nothing. Just talking to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is that so...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So by the way, what in the world is this event? The town looks so gorgeous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And you two are apparelled far too glamorously for security. Those look like bridal gowns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I was curious about that as well! You both look so lovely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hehe, thank you. We're trying to blend in with the fesitivities as bridal fair security.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's a bridal fair?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>A bridal fair is a festival with wedding-related events and presentations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Exactly! You can try on dresses, have a wedding rehearsal, and see a cake-cutting performance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The cake cutting sounds so fun! They'll be using a wedding knife made of Felici ore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I bet the blade will be really shiny...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Doesn't it sound wonderful? I really want to make a Felici ore wedding knife again, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, Lucia is certainly excited. But what exactly is Felici ore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's a rare ore used in making wedding knives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's said a couple who uses such a special knife in their first act together forms a bond no one can break.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Because of the legend, many folks seek out such a knife, and rumor is they'll have them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've heard stories like that. It's like a ritual implement as we would say in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A bond so strong nothing can sever it... That sounds so romantic! Right, Chihaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Y-Yes. I suppose it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So the town's all decked out in decorations for wedding things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I simply adore your adorable outfits! I'd love to try on something similar myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And you should! There is this glimmering attire over there that would suit you both.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Really!? Well then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hang on! We can't do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I can't believe you have to ask. We're right in the middle of dealing with the bandit situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But once you've taken care of that, can you? I'll find something special for each of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well, I'm not so sure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What would be the problem? Once you fulfill your duties surely it'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How do I put this? In the beginning, a wedding was a sacred ceremony uniting houses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And though I have danced in a wedding ceremony before, it was a very solemn occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is to say that wedding clothes are not to be worn frivolously...even sample attire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I understand what you're saying. A wedding is a very important and meaningful event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I've heard how marriages can be fraught with expectations and obligations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>But all who come to this fair are looking forward to being in a wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>There's no need to let heavy thoughts trouble you. Our dress also fulfills a sort of duty to bring color and joy to the fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, I'm enjoying myself anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>A sort of duty? Yes, I see. The way you are dressed is a reasonable choice then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hm? What's the commotion over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ah, well truth is that the fair organizer asked rather suddenly to cancel the event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Cancel the fair!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, so now we're trying to coordinate with the staff. They all seem against it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Of course, they are. There are people planning to wed here today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>With the criminal activity around the area, I can understand the organizer being worried about danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>With us acting as security there should be no problem. The staff have worked so hard to prepare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Still, the organizer wants everyone to feel safe, so canceling makes the most sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I suppose so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Still... It's no good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Huh!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Do they really intend to cancel this bridal fair!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What's with you all of a sudden!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It's just they can't! An opportunity as magnificent can't be wasted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>That's all well and good, but look at this map of the damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The problems caused by the bandits is extremely worse than in previous years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Well, then all we have to do is deal with the bandit problem, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If that's the case, you can trust that we'll ensure the fair's safety!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You'll do all that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Of course! That's why we came here in the first place. Right, Chihaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Y-Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Very well. Then leave it to us to deal with the bandits. We can handle it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Um... Shayna!? Can you wait just a moment!?</td>
</tr>
