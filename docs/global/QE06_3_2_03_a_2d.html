<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>—That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The demons are invading quicker than anticipated. Can we fortify our ranks any further?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm afraid we can't. We're already being criticized in the castle-town for indiscriminately moving our men to these distant villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The people are scared everywhere. They believe these demon invasions may release the seal upon the Demon Paragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>On top of that, we have suffered innumerable casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm all too aware. That's why I'm working on devising a solid plan to deal with these attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But at this rate—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>As I said, I'm well aware!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Though I also said I'd take responsibility...yet I've allowed the demons to invade. And there seems to be nothing I can do to mitigate the damage or quell the people's fears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm losing their trust. That's another thing I'm well aware of, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Moreover, the fact that I'm raising demon children here is spurring on even more distrust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ma'am, that's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My apologies. I won't be able to protect anyone or anything if I allow such worries to consume me. I must bear this burden and act decisively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Evacuate all the survivors from the destroyed village to the castle-town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You mean to abandon the village?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If we're running so low on troops and can't send any to their defense, it's the only way to protect its residents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll take full responsibility for this action. Now hurry, before there are any further casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, Ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you look tired. You must rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's no time for that. There's too much to be dealt with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Are you also concerned for the seal on the Demon Paragon, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We need something stronger. Since we can't kill it, we need to find a way to make the seal last for all eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If we can do just that much, the people would at least feel a bit more at ease. And there is a way, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you know a way to do it, why not see it through? Is it simply a time-consuming process? Or could it be there's something about it that gives you pause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This is the Demon Paragon we're talking about—the Discarnate Power itself! Strengthening the seal upon it would require an immense fortitude and nearly superhuman resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We would need a human sacrifice to serve as its Kago—its "cage"—and a family line to keep watch over it once the sealing is complete. And even that wouldn't quite be enough, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The Kago would need to take in demon blood in order to bear the burden of its duties. That is the only way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>A human sacrifice...and demon blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No one would ever wish to fill such a role. And if I were take up the role myself, there would be no one left to oversee Wadatsumi's affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And that's saying nothing of the negative effects one would suffer after taking in demon blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you needn't bear this burden alone. We stand with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then tell me, who will do it in my place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The people are saying that this wouldn't have happened if we hadn't made peace with the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But the fact is, for a short time, we did achieve true peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>None of that matters now, though. We—I—must address the problems that lie before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Just remember, milady, that those in power are always subject to criticism, whether or not their rule is fair and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Be that as it may, I am my own critic as well. And I know I still have a long road ahead before I can properly represent the will of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I wish you wouldn't be so hard on yourself. Just remember, if there is anything at all I can do, please do not hesitate to ask. I will assist however I am able.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Koga... Kaede... You weren't wrong. You weren't mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This is the product of malice. And it's my fault for being unable to hold it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But blaming myself will accomplish nothing. I must set my guilt and regrets aside, and do what I can to salvage as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey... Heyyy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Su-me-ra-gi, are you even listening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm bored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Good for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So let's do something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I don't have time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Of course not! You're always too busy reading, or drawing pictures, or both!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then why did you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't get how you can read every day and not get bored. Is that a cookbook? And are you drawing pictures of the food?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's not a cookbook. It's got more than just recipes in it. This was Father's journal, so there's a lot of information about him in here too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>He did a bunch of research on the history of Wadatsumi. You should read it sometime. it's really interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't want to just sit around! I want to go outside and move my body! It's boring always being cooped up in here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You can always explore inside the castle—with Lady Mitsuha's permission, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Come on, you know that's not what I'm talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If you go outside, you're in danger. Cross the wrong person's path and you'll wind up dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The people hate us, you know. And with those horns, you especially would stick out like a sore thumb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I know that! But still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Hey, Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Was what our parents did really that bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I don't think so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All right. Well, in that case—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Let me finish. I don't think so, but the people of Wadatsumi do. And there's nothing we can do about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hello? May I come in?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>How are you two getting along today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You asked the same thing yesterday. You don't need to worry about us so much, Lady Mitsuha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I suppose I can't help but worry a little. But you're right. I don't want to be a bother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You said that yesterday, too! Don't worry. You've already done so much for us. We're fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I just wish I could do more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You've taken very good care of us. I'm grateful to you, and so is Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Thank you. That's kind of you to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ohh, is that a smile?! I haven't seen one of those from you in forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You always look so tired. We're worried about you, too! Right, Sumeragi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I'm sorry you have to go through all this trouble just to keep us safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>That's why we're happy to see you smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>All right, you two. Get in here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Thank you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>If ever there's anything you want from me—anything at all—please, let me know. I'll do whatever I can for you, always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That sentiment alone is more than enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I...want to go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>We didn't do anything wrong. It was our parents, not us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>But we're the ones who can't go outside? That hardly seems fair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It...isn't fair. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We know there are a lot of people who say we should never have been born. But, even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I want to go outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>If only I didn't have these horns...maybe I could've played outside all this time, and nobody would've known!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I know I'm just being selfish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>No. No, you're not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you know you don't have to take care of us, right? If we're causing you trouble, we don't have to stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It's not like you're our mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Mikaboshi, stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>But it's true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>There's no need to apologize. What you said is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>No, it was rude. Please accept my apology on her behalf. She doesn't mean it the way it sounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>There really is no need to apologize. I swore to Koga and Kaede that I would take you in and keep you safe. That's the relationship we have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>And it's why I think of you as if you were my own children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>But that's just how I think of you. You don't have to feel the same way about me. I understand that it's probably quite...difficult for you to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I want you to always tell me the truth—how you really feel. Even if it's selfish, I won't mind. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I decided, back then, that this was my responsibility to bear. And I remain committed to that resolution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I'll come back to check on you again later. Please, take care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Mikaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I-I didn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I don't want to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I'm sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>If you're going to apologize to anyone, apologize to Lady Mitsuha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I know. That was selfish of me to say. Lady Mitsuha is having such a hard time because of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I just want to see her smile more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Why didn't you say that earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Because if I did, I know she'd just work herself even harder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>It's to realize our parents' dream of a peaceful land, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>I know that! And I know how much Lady Mitsuha cares for us. I really do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Hmph. Then you need to work on communicating that a little better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Tell you what. It's been a while. You want to spar a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Huh? Really? What's gotten into you all of a sudden, Mr. I'm-Too-Busy-To-Hang-Out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>You'll feel better if you move around. Then we can go apologize to Lady Mitsuha together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>That sounds nice. Thank you, Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Anytime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Don't think I'm going to go easy on you, though! Get ready to behold the true power of your sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Maybe go a little easy on me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>You wish! Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
