<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>—That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The demons are invading quicker than anticipated. Can we fortify our ranks any further?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>I'm afraid we can't. We're already being criticized in the castle-town for indiscriminately moving our men to these distant villages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>The people are scared everywhere. They believe these demon invasions may release the seal upon the Demon Paragon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>On top of that, we have suffered innumerable casualties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm all too aware. That's why I'm working on devising a solid plan to deal with these attacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>But at this rate—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>As I said, I'm well aware!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Though I also said I'd take responsibility...yet I've allowed the demons to invade. And there seems to be nothing I can do to mitigate the damage or quell the people's fears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'm losing their trust. That's another thing I'm well aware of, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Moreover, the fact that I'm raising demon children here is spurring on even more distrust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>Ma'am, that's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>My apologies. I won't be able to protect anyone or anything if I allow such worries to consume me. I must bear this burden and act decisively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Evacuate all the survivors from the destroyed village to the castle-town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>You mean to abandon the village?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>If we're running so low on troops and can't send any to their defense, it's the only way to protect its residents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>I'll take full responsibility for this action. Now hurry, before there are any further casualties!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wadatsumi Soldier</td>
<td>Yes, Ma'am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you look tired. You must rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>There's no time for that. There's too much to be dealt with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Are you also concerned for the seal on the Demon Paragon, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>We need something stronger. Since we can't kill it, we need to find a way to make the seal last for all eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>If we can do just that much, the people would at least feel a bit more at ease. And there is a way, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>If you know a way to do it, why not see it through? Is it simply a time-consuming process? Or could it be there's something about it that gives you pause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>This is the Demon Paragon we're talking about—the Discarnate Power itself! Strengthening the seal upon it would require an immense fortitude and nearly superhuman resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>We would need a human sacrifice to serve as its Kago—its "cage"—and a family line to keep watch over it once the sealing is complete. And even that wouldn't quite be enough, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>The Kago would need to take in demon blood in order to bear the burden of its duties. That is the only way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>A human sacrifice...and demon blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>No one would ever wish to fill such a role. And if I were take up the role myself, there would be no one left to oversee Wadatsumi's affairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>And that's saying nothing of the negative effects one would suffer after taking in demon blood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Lady Mitsuha, you needn't bear this burden alone. We stand with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Then tell me, who will do it in my place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>The people are saying that this wouldn't have happened if we hadn't made peace with the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>But the fact is, for a short time, we did achieve true peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>None of that matters now, though. We—I—must address the problems that lie before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>Just remember, milady, that those in power are always subject to criticism, whether or not their rule is fair and just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Be that as it may, I am my own critic as well. And I know I still have a long road ahead before I can properly represent the will of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Civil Official</td>
<td>I wish you wouldn't be so hard on yourself. Just remember, if there is anything at all I can do, please do not hesitate to ask. I will assist however I am able.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>Koga... Kaede... You weren't wrong. You weren't mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>This is the product of malice. And it's my fault for being unable to hold it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mitsuha</td>
<td>But blaming myself will accomplish nothing. I must set my guilt and regrets aside, and do what I can to salvage as much as possible.</td>
