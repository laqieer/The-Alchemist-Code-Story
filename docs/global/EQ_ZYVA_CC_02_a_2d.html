<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Reason for applying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I want to do something meaningful. Your principles of world domination left an incredibly strong impression on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I am seeking a new post, and I would very much like to work under you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Tell me... Why would a member of Greed Dike's Imperial Elite Guard elect to venture all the way out here to Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The assassination contracts issued by Greed Dike were taken up by people from this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your expertise is well valued in my homeland. It is said that you achieve the greatest results while causing the minimal amount of damage, and evaluations of your speed, magical resources, and martial prowess are always favorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If it is world domination that you seek, then I do believe that Greed Dike, the nation of avarice, would serve you best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Or if you would borrow a power greater than your own, perhaps you might pay a visit to our king, Dead Nine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're quite cautious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am merely a coward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And if I were captivated by you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That would truly be frightening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, my apologies, madam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Move it, lump.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oho...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Not likely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As you can see, this region is little more than a cesspool where the dregs of the world gather.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I would prefer people to value their lives, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I am sick to death of my homeland, where life is, sadly, wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I abhor it; there is nothing worthwhile for me to do back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>As for your suggestion regarding your king... He is far too reckless for my liking. I will not pander to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Should we succeed in turning this world on its head, there would be more than a few casualties. An extensive purge would be called for, in fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I would enjoy that. Oh, so very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I thought lives ought to be valued?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Contrary to appearances I am, in fact, quite picky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You know, you still haven't told me your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah, yes. My apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You may call me...Giudecca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hm...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heh... I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Do you? Are you certain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am. That's why I'm going to take you on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Am I correct in assuming this means that I am hired?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Starting immediately. Your first task will be to retrieve what that filthy sneak-thief stole from me just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ahh, I was so hoping that it hadn't escaped your notice. Splendid! What did she take?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Something that ranks third only to my own life and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Terror itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I wonder how many days it's been since I've eaten...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hahah... Ahahahah...! That fool's bag is so...heavy. Must be something worth a lot of gold...and food...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nothing but books...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Philosophy textbooks, apparently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Aaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'm afraid they aren't worth a single Zeni to you. You can't sell those here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Y-you were with him...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Would you be so kind as to give those back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hah. As if. You should've been more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Are you interested in philosophy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm interested in surviving.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>From a philosophical standpoint?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Anyway, I stole it, so it's mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Very well. How about a trade? Tit for tat, this for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?! B-but that's mine! When did you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I stole it, so I believe that makes it mine, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Don't you know stealing things is wrong?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I could ask you the same question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That's mine, because it's mine! This is mine, because I stole it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What is in here? Something...valuable?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Don't you dare open it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Oho...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Keep your slimy hands off it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You really are piquing my interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Nnrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You should have been more careful.</td>
</tr>
