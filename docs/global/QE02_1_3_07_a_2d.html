<td>I see. It definitely feels ancient. I can see how it might've existed since the founding of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Elesters founded our country in this land right after the ancient Great War of Alchemy. It was pretty much an age of legends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's even a folktale about how this clock tower was built as proof of this countries founding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Folktale?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Long, long ago, a group of evil wizards started a large war using large Demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He-hey, wait a minute! Have you already started telling the story?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course, aye! No need to thank me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Honestly, are you planning on telling the folktale at that sloth-like pace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>To sum it up simply, Philosopher's Stones—such as those collected after the Great War of Alchemy—were discarded in this land, which, at the time, was under the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why are you telling the story, Ronnie?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You mean this land...Slothstein used to be under the sea?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's what they say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>By sinking the Philosopher's Stones into the depths of the sea, the continent of Babel regained peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, that was only for a fleeting time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, it's fine when Fiona tells the story, aye?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones give birth to wealth.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Drawn by such rumors, those who aimed to amass a quick fortune gathered from all across the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Gradually, this land became a symbol of slothfulness and was named 'Slothstein.'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's almost like a gold rush of sorts. I guess people's greed haven't changed since the old days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Exactly. Even the capitalist, the very symbol of greed, began to show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>They would use the slothful individuals, who would gather here, to expand their excavation work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Eventually, Slothstein began to form as a self-governing country. Ow! Ouch! Let me go, Alkemono!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And so, a disparity began to grow between those who used others and those were used!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aye, those who were used were the ruffians of the world, to begin with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>As peace began to deteriorate, Slothstein eventually became a lawless land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Allie! I'm sorry, Ronnie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Anyway, it was my ancestors, the Elesters, who brought order to this chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Order? How did they bring order to such ruffians?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Overnight, they vanished the source of all the trouble—the sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Seeing the sea transform into land, the people turned their ears to hear what the Elesters had to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In time, the Elesters made a clock tower in the center of the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Thus, they brought law and order to Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They made the sea...vanish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't take it literally. It's a folktale, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>More importantly, look at this. This door built of rigid iron is shaped like the shadow of a spiral staircase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, this is the Elester family's coat of arms!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>So, this is a private entrance for your family? Things are getting interesting!</td>
