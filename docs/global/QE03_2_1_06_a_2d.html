<td>You want us to talk with the headmistress? Isn't that almost the same thing as turning yourself in?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But nothing is gonna change the way things are now! I'm sure the headmistress will know a way to take care of Asmodeus!</td>

<td>The only witch who got her hands on Asmodeus was the one who made an agreement with it, which transformed the country into the way it is. I think they call her Mother of Sin.</td>

<td>I think this power should be able to accomplish things a witch wouldn't be able to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's why I'm gonna ask the headmistress about how I can get Asmodeus using this power!</td>
</tr>

<td>So Alchemy isn't enough for you, and now you're seeking the Sacred Stone...you pest!</td>
