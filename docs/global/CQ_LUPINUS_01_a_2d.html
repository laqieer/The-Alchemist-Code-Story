<td>Ah, Lady Lupinus! The guest for the ritual still has not arrived yet...</td>

<td>One called Peridot...she is a shaman from the Saga region.</td>

<td>A shaman from the Saga region...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Apparently, she usually resides alone deep within the forest and rarely makes public appearances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She lives alone...deep in the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. Apparently, it is only recently that she has taken to leaving Saga. Our country has taken advantage of this opportunity...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I wonder what it feels like...to live all alone for so long...</td>

<td>...Lady Lupinus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She must've been lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>U-um, excuse me! Please, allow me to escort her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...want to become her friend!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Um, what? Lady Lupinus?! Lady Lupinus!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(I-I leaped out on a whim, but...I'll need to apologize to all the courtiers later.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Still, the fact that she's been alone for so long...I know just how lonely that can be!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...U-um...hey, you, listen...! Huh, wait, where are you going...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why does everyone run away when I try to talk with them? I'm just looking for a shop, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>(By the look of that girl...is it her?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>U-um...Peri...dot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...?! Eh, um, what do you want with me...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Jeez. They've chased me this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Heheh... Now that she's left her forest, this is the perfect opportunity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh? What? Whaaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...I have no intention of getting you involved. Stand back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, um...I don't really understand the situation, but...I'll fight too!</td>
