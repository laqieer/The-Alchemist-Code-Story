<td>002</td>
<td>Come on. There's no time to be tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I know that! Rrraaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Grraaaaaaaarrggghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, we're in the middle of a trial here. Didn't anyone tell you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It's been going on long enough. If they can't defeat the demon after all this time, they shouldn't be allowed to pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's Ugachi's right hand for ya. Strength is everything, eh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But I'm the proctor this year, so I'll be the one making the decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You're too soft on them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Looks like you could use some brushing up yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, hello there, Captain Ugachi. You're looking handsome as ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You'd better watch that attitude of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If you're the proctor this time around, I suppose we can't expect much from recruits this year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If we left it to your standards of strength alone, we wouldn't ever have new recruits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Why recruit so many if they'll only end up dead? How about we retrain your feeble Third Squad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Who cares which squad defeats the most demons? Don't you think it's more important that we can protect those we meant to protect?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You've always been a smart aleck. Let's go, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You should forget about becoming a member of the Blade Fox.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you can't even handle a demon like this one, you don't belong here. It's too late to regret anything once you're dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'll cut down your share of demons in your place. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Azami!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well, that was severe. Is she like that at home too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Azami moved into the dorms recently, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>To bring about blissful days of joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>With our blades, we will clear the way for Wadatsumi's future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All righty then. Let's go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We got rid of all the demons. I see no reason to stick around here anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A-and the trial? How did I do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hm. Let's talk about that once we're back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
