<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Too proud to be worked as cattle. Too blunt to be serviceable as a tool. I suppose your only worth to me would be as a lapdog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Tch... Sh...shu...shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Didn't your parents ever teach you the way of this world? It's survival of the fittest, whelp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>All the beasts, bugs, and plants of this world follow it, so don't go thinking you're exempt. It is the folly of humankind to reject the natural way of things, simply because of a lacking strength of spirit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A weak mind breeds laziness and self-indulgence. Why do so few seek to surmount their weaknesses and hone their strengths?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I alone stand as an embodiment of strength. You could not wound me, even if you had every last Intelligencer fight alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I know not hesitation. My enemies will be invaded, slaughtered, obliterated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For I have a right to wield the powers I have obtained through training, and growing in strength. Do I not, whelp?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Y-yes... It is...as you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>P-please, my lord, have mercy! These are the fiercest warriors in our nation! We cannot afford to lose anothâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I only have need of quality tools. Defects must be disposed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You are no fool, Na Zhu. You must have known how pointless it would be to turn against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And yet...you do not seem displeased with this outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're enjoying yourself...aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hah... Ahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>See? You're welcome...for the laughs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hah! You're something, Na Zhu, I'll give you that. I knew I liked your gumption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So, what is it you seek from the paws of this lion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will do whatever you wish of me, my lord, if you will only remember my name. As for what I desire, well...how about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The position of head of Imperial Security?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Greed Dike, Imperial Hinterlands - Anti-Imperialist Outpost</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, my. Look at all this blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tut-tut. Do you know how difficult it is to get bloodstains out of white fabric like that? One would have thought you'd be more careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I heard...that they had stolen something bound for Wadatsumi from a Greed Dike trade ship.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Indeed. That "something" was myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I am a sacrifice meant for the lion. You had better bring me up to the castle quickly, before he begins to roar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>A...sacrifice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, exactly. I can only hope I prove a satisfying one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Why...don't you run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's not my duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My name is Mitsu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why are you telling me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>To hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, I may not have a fancy katana, but there are many more ways to hurt someone than with the sting of a blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Doesn't it pain you, to know that this humble sacrifice has a name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>'Tis the emblem of ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Or have you forgotten what pain feels like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Come, rise and fight, brethren!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I would expect you'd have to do away with sympathy altogether, to fulfill a role like yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Blood-red winds blow dry and cold, sweeping me into the numbered fold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Unlike you, I have no means of changing my course. I am but a sacrifice, a good to be traded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Like a surrendered blade, I have no will of my own. I am fated only to be carried from place to place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Eternity awaits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>My apologies. I tend to run my mouth a bit when I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The empty vessel rings when hit; its sound fills the world around it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Or, if I am to be reborn, do you think I will find love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>When you hear the melody of a perfect bull's-eye, that's the signal to hoist the curtains high!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yet don't you sometimes find thrilling plays a bore? Aren't poetic monologues enough to make you snore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Hark, impetuous youth, your audience I crave! You mustn't miss the parting phrase of the evil knave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"Fools! You will regret this!" Doesn't it always end the same?</td>
</tr>
