<td>W-wow! That was some attack! I kinda feel sorry for the monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Well, it was doomed from the moment it decided to approach those two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Since we took down this big guy, do you think we'll get some bonus points?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If we get the Phantoms to help out, we might be able to turn this around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Y-yeah, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's no good! No one's having fun right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm sorry, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wh-what are you prattling about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What's wrong, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've been so selfish! I dragged all of you here, and just assumed that you'd help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That was wrong of me. You all have things you want to do, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm really sorry! You don't have to fight with us if you don't want to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>L-Liz! What are you saying?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This is something that we should be working toward togetherâ€”the three of us, as a team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If that's what Liz wants, I'm all for it! What about you, Rebecca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I suppose it can't be helped. Liz was the one who summoned them. It's her call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Let's do our best, okay? We won't give up until the very end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huzzzaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Mmmm... It's a little difficult to enjoy oneself after listening to all that, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, quite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmph. This isn't my problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(I don't have time to waste standing around and playing protector for these pip-squeaks! I have something important that I must do!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Rebecca! Alma! Over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Got it! Bffggrrrlllppp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Aaaaaahhh! A-Alma! Don't drown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Like I said, this isn't my problem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ahhh! What is a demon doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Grrrrrrooooorrrgggghhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What is it?! Why are you bothering me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Grrrrooooooaaaaaarrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Aaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Aaaaaaarrrgggghhhh! No! My doll! My precious doll!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey, you! Give that back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Y-you?! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That doll is important to you, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I was hoping that we could be friends, so I kept trying to catch your eye, and that's why I noticed that you were always cuddling that doll close to you! It must be really special to you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>So I'll get it back for you, no matter what! Huuzzzzzaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what is her problem? Friends? Why would she say something so ridiculous?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I can't believe she would risk herself for that girl! Liz really is softhearted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahaha! It's one of her best points!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. That's just who she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All right! Here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't think you can outshine me!</td>
