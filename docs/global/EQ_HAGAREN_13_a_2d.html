<td>According to our intel, Selim is waiting in the shrine's northeast sector. Toritoh, which way should we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This way! Trust me, I was raised in that area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>She's right! I can sense Amestrian alchemy in that direction!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ughh! The pain... It feels like my chest is being hollowed out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is the pain from the soul being torn away. Seems the people of this world can feel that as well. I thought of these beings as inferior. How interesting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Selim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Prepare yourselves, invaders!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is our glorious leader you see before you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Bow before the great Selim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Listen to me! There is nothing glorious about him! He's the real invader, and he's just using you! He used all of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's too late. You can't reach them anymore. They've made their decision to follow me, like lambs to the slaughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I have them, and the Dimensional Gate, in the palm of my hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wha... No! This is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It can't be! Is that...Amestris?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urghhh... It hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Stop! If you open the Gate any further...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Scream, human! Appreciate how wonderful it is to have first-row seats to the destruction of not just one, but two worlds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We're taking the Order down one member at a time, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is taking too long! At this rate, we won't reach Pride in time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You have some gall to even try! Come now, my sacrifice... Open the Gate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Urghhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Toritoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Th-the Gate is opening...! Amestris is getting closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So many bright lights... Are those...the souls of the people of Amestris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Haha... Hahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Quit laughing, you third-rate villain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ngh?! Wh-what?! My Phantoms...were transmuted?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ignoring me and attacking my little brother? Disgusting. You'll never rise above third-rate like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Edward Elric?! The Fullmetal Alchemist?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Al! Oh, hey! The Colonel's here, too...and the Lieutenant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I don't really get what's going on, but I'm going to take you down, Selim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>He jumped through the Dimensional Gate on his own, without even knowing what was on the other side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He's even forced the Holy Order to completely break ranks! This is ridiculous! If this continues...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I could just open the Gate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why won't it open any further?! My transmutation circle should have absorbed all of the souls by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>N-ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hm... I thought I had already taken your soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But you had other plans, I see. You're using your position as a sacrifice to defy me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You think your human determination can match the strength of the Dimensional Gate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Don't underestimate me. I won't let you take my soul! There are still a thousand things I have left to do in this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Impertinent human!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is our only chance! Hey, Shor—I mean...Blondie! Edward! Ed! Hey, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm also Ed! The name's Edgar L. Leonhart! Your brother, Alphonse, is a good friend of mine. Could you help us out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah? Thanks for looking after Al for me. I don't hate the idea of two Eds, either. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let's take that Selim brat down!</td>
</tr>
