<td>God doesn't answer our prayers.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>True.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've seen God, you know. You've gotta believe me on this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>God helped me transcend my humanity. Ever since then, I've been a changed man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Here's a question for you: if, one day, you suddenly lost all sense of everything you once knew, how would you feel? Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You'd struggle to believe it, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You must be my target. Formerly pious disciple of the Holy Order of Babel, member of the top-secret Corpse divisionâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What do you think happened to the fool who tried to find God for his mama's sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>God saved him! Isn't that incredible?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But what do you think happened to the fool who transcended his humanity? Aha! He is free. He can do anything. He is almighty. Unchained from the commandments!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But there was a catch! You see, being almighty makes life oh so very boring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Like playing a game without any rules or stakes! There's no joy in a guaranteed victory, in playing the field when there's no one to match you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So the troubled fool prayed to God, and his fate was as I have described. Now, even though he has seen God with his own two eyes, he has stopped believing in the Almighty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In time, he grew so sick of it all that he told his mama that he wanted to die. And do you know what she said to him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"Good for you." That was all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ahahah... Hahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that why you left Corpse? In search of a game that wouldn't bore you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hahahahahahaha! Exactly! But, in the end, all I found was another boring farce!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you talking about the time you jumped into the Gluttony Foss Colosseum and killed everybody inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What? Who did that? It wasn't me! "I did it! It was me!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You trying to make it seem like you have multiple personalities or something? Like I give a damn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, please! Believe me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Not much chance of that, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I've been searching for a VIP seat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My client is very angry with you. They're calling you an embarrassment to the Holy Order. A blasphemer in the eyes of God.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Then perhaps, at long last, I'll be granted the satisfying end I've been yearning for! Oh, please say the bliss of the grave awaits me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yep. They want you dead, no matter what it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It has to be like this: I'm lying on a comfy bed, sipping on exquisite liquor while listening to gentle music, and there's a soft breeze running through my hair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Mama and I have the best seats in the house. Yes, we're watching our favorite play, and, ever so slowly, I begin to drift off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There's a faint light shimmering through my eyelids. I feel cozy and warm, right down to the tips of my toes...and, just like that, I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nothing less than this will do! It has to be a VIP seat. It has to be!</td>
