<td>Won! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I thought we were here to deal with Wildpeckers. What's wrong with these guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The sudden appearance of the Wildpeckers must have stirred them into a frenzy. Let's have a look around, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You know, you're not bad, Strie. I guess I misjudged you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Perhaps I should say the same to you. You're not all talk after all, are you? You're quite a capable young man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey... How come you let me tag along on this job? You could've easily taken care of it yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The pay is most generous—profitable enough to be shared, I think. That's not the only reason, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The village must be in an awful lot of trouble for them to offer such a sum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I suspect that the villagers must have scraped it together amongst themselves, as a community... I wanted to get the job done as quickly as possible, for their sakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm... You're a good person, Strie. I wasn't thinking about anything other than lining my own pockets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What? That's why you came along? You were so reluctant to accompany me that I was sure you must have had some other, far more pressing reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?! What's that supposed to mean?! What's your grand reason for wanting all that money, then? You're nothing but a gambler!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well... You're not wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You see...I come from a very poor village. I pass all the money I make onto the people of that village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>H-huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Having money allows me to indulge in my passion for gambling, as well as bring joy to the people of my village. That's why I wanted the reward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I would call that a rather grand reason, wouldn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm, uh...sorry. About what I said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh? You don't need to be, dear. You merely said what you felt, and it happened to be the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The truth... Huh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Are you hiding something, Won?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wha—?! What makes you say that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tee hee. You'd make a terrible gambler, if that's your poker face. I assume you have your reasons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>My reasons... Well, maybe, but they're nothing so grand as yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I never got along with my dad, so I ran away from home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My family is famous for its swordsmanship, and I'm the heir to it all, but our technique...it's designed to kill.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I could never bring myself to accept that. I didn't want my dad to find out where I was. I came all the way out here to find work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't want to be bound to that fatal technique, or to my dad! That's why I decided to use my fists to liberate those in trouble, as a jack of all trades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well, I left my apprentice behind in Greed Dike when I came here, so I've gotta go back eventually, once everything's settled down. But I don't have the funds to turn back yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Doubt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is that the freedom your heart desires, I wonder?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>To me, freedom means money. Money allows me to buy the children of my village their favorite things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What does freedom mean to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? What does it...mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wildpeckers! We've finally found them! Let's do this, Won!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>R-right!</td>
</tr>
