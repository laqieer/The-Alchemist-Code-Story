<td>...I am truly looking forward to seeing you again, Lord Fraise. Yours truly. -Eve</td>

<td>She really gave me quite the surprise at first, but, now that I think about it, her everyday bride training almost resembles my code of chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? A visitor...?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Lord Fraise!</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>L-Lady Eve?!</td>

<td>007</td>
<td>You came running here?! From Lustburg...?!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. I wrote about it in my letter, right? Actually, I found a really delicious ingredient. It's important that it's fresh, so I hurried over here.</td>

<td>Fresh? Is this a monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. It's a really rare one. Even some in Lustburg have never eaten it before...</td>

<td>012</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>

<td>Wh-why? I thought I killed it properly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I've read about this type of monster in a book before. When it senses danger, it pretends to be dead until the danger passes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wow! Lord Fraise, you're so smart! Mmm! I'm so proud of my future husbandâ™ª</td>
