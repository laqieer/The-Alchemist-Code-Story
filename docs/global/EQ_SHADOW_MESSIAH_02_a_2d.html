<td>001</td>
<td>Lord Zahar? Dinner is ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We're having sautéed rabbit meat tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Yup, that's right! Caught by yours truly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>And me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. You lot went hunting, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I took them. It was part of their training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Good. Keep it up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You betcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>On that note, I have something to report, Lord—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Must you be reminded again, Corvus? You should know by now that Lord Zahar doesn't like to be bothered during mealtimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Right... Sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Now, let's eat. We wouldn't want our dinner to get cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It looks so good! Doesn't it, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Y-yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Om nom nom nom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ugh. Ila, use your knife and fork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why should I?! It's easier this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hmph. One of these days, I'm going to need to teach you table manners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Urgh! No, thanks! Those sound boring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist. You eat like a pig.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Aw, don't be like that, Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When she first came here, Ila couldn't eat anything, remember? But now she joins us at mealtime every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So what if she's a little messy? At least she's eating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmph. Fine. I suppose there's no rush.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Spica? Is it not to your taste?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, um... No, it's… It's nothing like that. I just don't have much of an appetite.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, dear. That's no good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>C'mon, Spica, try some! It's really good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah, okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That was excellent as always, Letitia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm so glad you enjoyed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Psst! Hey, can I ask you something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I've been wondering this for a while, but does Lord Zahar only eat Letitia's cooking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't think I've seen him eat anything but fruits and vegetables when Letitia's not here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>He's always been like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He only ever ate bread and vegetables when he was in the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Considering he is apparently of Elven descent, I didn't think he would eat meat or fish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But when Letitia began preparing meals for him in Wratharis, he ate whatever she served.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm sure he wouldn't touch it if it wasn't for the fact that Letitia made it, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't like her, but she cooks good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I don't think that's why he likes it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Ahem. Yes, my lord?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Actually, all of you should hear this. I'm going away for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're not going to tell us, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>U-um... Can I go with—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I only need Letitia and a few of our rank and file to join me. In fact, Letitia's presence is essential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I... understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Will you not share your plans with me, Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hmph. There is no need; I won't be gone long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Very well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>During my absence, I will leave the Shadow Messiah in your care, Corvus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Babysitting duty, is it? Oh, joy of joys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Keep a close eye on Spica in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We need to rid her of her doubts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Doubts, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Aaargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hah. It was a good idea to try for a sneak shot, but your execution needs work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Yup. It was super obvious what you were going for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Dang it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>C'mon, Spica! How long are you planning on moping around for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Chin up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>If anything, with Lord Zahar gone for a while, now's your chance to make a change!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>This is an opportunity for you impress him! You've gotta train really hard, until you're strong enough to beat Corvus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I-I can't do that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But, Spica... If you don't start getting stronger soon, Lord Zahar will abandon you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You want to be with him, don't you? You don't want him to leave you behind, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>(Of course not... That's why I'm here. I want to be with Lord Zahar.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Thank you, Silma. You're right—I'll see what I can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>That's the spirit! You've got this, Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Erm... Sir?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What is it? Did something happen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Not exactly, no. I was just wondering what we're going to do about dinner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Dinner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yes. Lady Letitia isn't here, so I was hoping you would have some instructions for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Oh, right. She always takes care of meals, doesn't she? Well... Let me think...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I'm sure he wouldn't touch it if it wasn't for the fact that Letitia made it, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Corvus? I-I'll do it. I'll make dinner!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Huh?! B-but, Spica—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I insist!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>(Wow. I've never seen Spica so serious about something before.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Very well. Dinner is your responsibility tonight, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>S-Spica? Are you sure about this? It's not too late to back down—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Silma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>This is my chance to grow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>This isn't what we talked about at all and you know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>But I will grow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>(The darkness within me whispers unsettling things.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>(I'm... concerned.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Lord Zahar? We have almost reached Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Why didn't you bring Spica with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>She seemed very eager to accompany you. Tee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>I'm just teasing. But you've been worried about her, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>She's weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>True. She's a kind soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Yes, and that's part of her chosen role—but right now, her kindness is merely weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Strength in kindness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>That's to be Spica's role in your new order, isn't it, Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>She must be trained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Well, that's Corvus's responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Hee hee. I certainly couldn't do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We are the will. Corvus and the others exist to put our will into motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>As you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Did you hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yes... Something's lurking here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>A mythical beast? Corvus mentioned that one of the creatures was hanging around our base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Come to think of it... There were signs of animal experiments being conducted in the basement facility of the Holy Order we raided the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>And one of the guards said something about not having time to deal with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Because of the runaway test subjects, perhaps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Hmph. Sounds about right. Then I suppose the creature hanging around here must be the escapee in question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Oh, what a mess they've left us with! Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>At any rate—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>I say we clear our path of all obstacles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>As you command.</td>
</tr>
