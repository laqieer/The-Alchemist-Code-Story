<td>001</td>
<td>A Few Days Earlier... Gula Belt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>There's a crack in the Cosmic Egg?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, how wonderful. It seems we're all on the same page now. That, my friends, is why I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What's going on here? And what do you guys know about it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Unfortunately, we aren't completely sure about these things ourselves. One of my comrades, Icona, suspected that the Cursed Beasts are the pillars of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Pillars...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(Cursed Beasts and pillars? This guy talks just like Zafeiris. What is the connection between those two...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You must have a lot of questions right about now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For starters, I'm sure you're wondering about the idea that "all Cursed Beasts are an evil that must be destroyed".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's good, you should question the things you know. It's the first and most important step in the right direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's exactly because of you lot that I've come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Now that you understand the situation, I have a proposal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Work with us, Pursuers of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course, we're not asking you to work for free. We are prepared to offer—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I have no reason to believe any of you. Let me guess, you're going to try to trade information you've been withholding for our cooperation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You could very well be trying to lead us into a trap by providing false information. We'll pass.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then I suppose I'll back down quietly for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Only, it seems our comrades in Invidia Belt were having some trouble handling the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I was just thinking about landing them a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Wait! Did you say the Invidia Belt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We are done here. Quence, mind lending me a hand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tch, you only ever think about your own convenience. Fine, but don't think I won't be expecting a favor in return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He leaped into the air?! That magil, it looked like Space-Time Manipulation... Why would that guy—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent... Are they headed for the Invidia Belt next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't understand what they're trying to do with the Cursed Beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But if their methods endanger the lives of the people of this world, then I'm not going to let them get away with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I was planning to focus on the reconstruction of Sephira Village before doing anything else, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It doesn't look like the world is going to wait for me to finish that before it hurtles into something new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We shall head for Invidia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Zafeiris, who plunged our Gula Belt Region into sin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We must understand what his organization, the Infinite Serpent, intends to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>The airship is ready to go anytime!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>All good on this side too. I've finished replacing the weapons we lost last battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Libra is ready! If we encounter another Cursed Beast we'll show 'em what's for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...No, this time I'd like to avoid interacting with any Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh, why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That rift that appeared in the sky the other day... Don't tell me you believe slaughtering the Cursed Beasts caused it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Whoa, no way! I thought it was just the weather acting up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's no world where the sky shattering is just odd weather...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It is as Nyx said. I'm afraid that fighting the Cursed Beasts caused this predicament.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>These Beasts that make us suffer, that turn us to sin... Not even Ambrosia could fully understand them, their goals or purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They may be tied to this world in a way that goes beyond our current understanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>In other words, we must no longer kill the Cursed Beasts, and find a different method to deal with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, we must still defeat them, or else all humans in this world will perish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Even Beelzebub continued to spread corruption after being sealed by Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There is no future for us as long as the Cursed Beasts wander this Earth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>So what you want is "the right way" to kill the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>There was this brief moment when Beelzebub's core got purified by alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It made me think we could overcome 'sin'. I don't think I was merely imagining things either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>To begin with, sinful magil is produced by us humans, so I'm certain that we can do something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's why, if we could just amplify this alchemy and light up a wider area at once, then surely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Agh! I don't know what's what anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Our plan is to chase the Infinite Serpent, and, for the time being, interact with the Cursed Beasts as little as possible, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes, that's the goal. Of course, we might have to chase off any Cursed Beasts if they start to attack innocents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then we should start by gathering information about the Infinite Serpent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>They definitely know something we don't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Let's proceed with that in mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(Icona was the same...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(Even Ambrosia couldn't tell us a thing about the Cursed Beasts, yet I got the feeling that Icona knew something she wasn't telling us.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>This is definitely some kind of trap, but if the Infinite Serpent is planning to use the Cursed Beasts for something or another, then we must stop them regardless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'm sure more things will come to light as we do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>And that's why we must go to the Invidia Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yes, there is no other choice. I shall slay all Cursed Beasts with these very hands if that's what it takes to reveal the truth behind this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...And to save this world stained by sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>All right, leave Sephira Village to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I will ensure that the Sephira have returned to their former glory by the time your business is settled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Thank you, Waginau, and my apologies for always burdening you with such troublesome things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Wait, Waginau, you're not coming?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Right now, my priority is the restoration of Sephira Village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Things might be better than they were, but we need time to return things to how they were before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Friends, family, and neighbors... Resources, skills, techniques... Many things were lost and it'll be no easy feat to replace them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>The people of Sephira have a long and hard road ahead of them if they wish to get things back to the way they were... They'll need someone to guide them there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I see, originally that would've been me, but now...hm...well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You've always been bad at this kind of thing, haven't you, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Well, I think we all understand what he wants to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Ahem, so Waginau will remain in the Gula Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's a shame I will no longer be able to accompany you on this journey, but I have a feeling you'll be able to handle yourselves just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Heh, of course! We'll bring back good news, so look forward to that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I expect no less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I suppose that's all for our current plans. I fear there will be many more hardships to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>However, I know that we can overcome whatever is thrown our way! We will find a path to a bright tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>To the Invidia Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Grrrooooooaarrhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I can't believe this! We just arrived in the Invidia Belt and we're already dealing with something like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Focus, Adaleigh! I understand how you feel, but let's deal with this situation first! Is the Valley of Siddim operational?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>It's ready! Here we go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>In the nick of time! Valley of Siddim, all outputs stable! Oi, you guys down there! Move back or you'll be caught in the blast zone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Grrrooooooaarrhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We've managed to extract a significant amount of magil thanks to Libra! Initiating purification! Heh, with this we'll turn the tides!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>We can't hold this for much longer though! Hurry, Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Yna! Eulalia! Are you ready?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I wasn't expecting to run into a Cursed Beast right on arrival...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But the airship's engine and the Sagittarius are both ready to go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>That just leaves—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Sagittarius: Anti-Curse activated! Spiritbonding successful. Preparing to forcefully purify the magil around the Cursed Beast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Analysis of Leviathan's Sin... Complete.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>"I embrace the supreme..."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>"This world is covered in sin and sinners, yet we embrace virtue and temporarily release the pain."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Sweet! That's a hit! Just a little more—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>No, it didn't work...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Eulalia's arrows didn't pierce the beast's shell. Is that...water?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>It's using a wall of water to protect its magil! So that's something the Cursed Beast of this world can do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>This isn't good... Right when I said we'd stop killing the beasts, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Adaleigh, how is that ship below us doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Ah, let me check, uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Oh! They didn't sink! They must have one hell of a balance unit aboard to make it through a wave like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I'd say it was pure skill and maneuverability on the crew's part. There doesn't appear to be any special equipment on board.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Let's talk to them, and maybe we'll get to the root of this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Oh my, it's incredible! It looks just like a regular ship, and yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Indeed. This is the first time I've witnessed a ship that can fly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Absolutely astounding! Do you think there's people inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I'd love to have a chat with whoever is on that vessel, but I fear not even Selsieg can jump that high.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Bzzp bwrip!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Lady Nicaea, please don't get too close! They might be dangerous, so I implore you to stand behind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Dangerous or not, that ship did just save us. Surely they are not so bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>You might be right, but still—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Oh, look! They're coming down! Their vessel does look like it'll float on the ocean just fine, so perhaps they're landing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Sorry for the sudden interruption. We'd like to hear what went down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>With all due respect, before that I require you to answer some questions. Who are you and what business do you have here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Excuse my ill manners. My name is Nimul. I'm not really sure how to start explaining myself but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>We've used this airship to come to the Invidia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Please tell us your tale, then we will aid you however we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>In other words, we're allies... At least I'd like to think we are.</td>
</tr>
