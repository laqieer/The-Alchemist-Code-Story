<td>Waginau... Have we received what we need from him yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Unfortunately, no. I apologize. It seems the task may have been beyond his capabilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heh. No matter. What I really want from him is the disruption of the battles he inflicts upon the Holy Guard to buy us more time, which he is doing splendidly at.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That is true. It allows us to focus our attentions on the Tower of Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Exactly. At last, Waginau, the time is ripe for us to collect our just rewards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Indeed. Now...shall we proceed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The complete annihilation of Northern Pride is about to begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Our priority must be to claim the heads of the Emperor of Northern Pride and the Lord Commander Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If we take out those two, the country will collapse under its own weight. Now, let us proceed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nimul. Come forth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Greed Dike's main force has started speeding up. Ready yourselves, Paladins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We just got word that the left and right flanks are moving as well! The front line is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Basheeny and his people are moving to intercept. It's not the time to panic yet. Battles are not won with sheer numbers. We must stand strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Understood! We of the Holy Guard are the last bastion of "absolute justice" in Babel! We must not fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must not let them gain any ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We have received word that there are immortal soldiers in all of the enemy platoons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Send reinforcements to support the advance guard! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>They're already here? They were much faster than I expected...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I spent all that time prepping Excalibur for a big battle, and now I wonder...what was the point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...! What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What is this incredible power of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hm... I'd better get over there. Seems like something pretty big is happening!</td>
