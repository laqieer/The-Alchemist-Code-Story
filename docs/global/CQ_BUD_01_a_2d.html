<td>Nearly there—we're almost at the meeting spot. The Desert Wings we're meant to be guarding are waiting for us. We've got to push on.</td>

<td>Yes, Captain! Although... With all due respect, it is quite unusual for us to be undertaking a mission for a foreign nation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Unusual? Maybe. But that doesn't change the fact that these people need our help. In that respect, it's no different from any other mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>In fact, in some ways, it's an especially important one. We'll have to make sure we don't offend our charges, since they're being treated as guests of our nation.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/b_flame_knt.png" alt="Blue Flame Knight" height="128"><br>Blue Flame Knight</td>
<td>Of course, Captain. I will mind my manners. I am honored to be trusted with this mission which will provide me with valuable experience. I'll be sure to be attentive and learn all I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Good. The Desert Wings' guildmaster is supposed to be pretty talented. I'm sure there's a lot I can learn from him as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>(Good thing, too. I've been doing a pretty poor job of leading everyone.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>(I've got to work harder. I'm the captain! I'm meant to be helping everyone else put their skills to good use, not—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Huh?! What's going on over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Hmph. You lot again? Tut-tut. You've been reckless lately—and loud. I haven't been able to take my afternoon naps in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandit</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Wh-where the hell did all of you come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>We are the Blue Flame Guard! I am Captain Bud Crowley! Are you all right, citizens?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Oh, yes. We're fine. My name is Ryle. I am the guildmaster of the Desert Wings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Y-you're...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>The ones you're meant to be escorting, yes. I apologize if this seems sudden, but do you think you could eliminate these cretins for us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Right. Leave it to us! We'll take things from here. Blue Flames, follow my lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/b_flame_knt.png" alt="Blue Flame Knight" height="128"><br>Blue Flame Knight</td>

<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryle.png" alt="Ryle" height="128"><br>Ryle</td>
<td>Leave the fighting to the Blue Flame Guard. Just focus on protecting the caravan and our cargo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>(Huh? What's he doing hiding in his caravan at a time like this?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bud</td>
<td>Come on! Time to send these bandits packing!</td>
