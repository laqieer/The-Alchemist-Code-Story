<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, Rimuru! Did you explore a little? This Babel place is pretty fascinating. It has all kinds of things I've never seen before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, of course I brought you souvenirs, too! Here you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh, uhm. Thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Souvenirs?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Just let it go...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heheh. Nice to meet you! I'm the one and only Dragonoid known as the Destroyer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The Demon Lord Milim Nava!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Demon Lord?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I've already had a lot of fun in this world, so I figured it was about time I join you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I can't believe you found us such a good place to mess around in! Just what I'd expect from my bestie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I didn't exactly go looking for one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I've basically just been snarfing down a bunch of food since I got here, so I was starting to crave some action! Let's get this show on the road!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The energy in this world feels all weird. Not sure how that'll transfer to a battle, hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It might be a lil' hard for me to hold back...but, eh, I'm sure it'll be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(That's not going to be fine at all!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(This is bad news... If Milim goes all-out, she's going to wipe this whole country off the map!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Uhm, hey, Milim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but I wanted to ask you to sit this one out. The fight with the Orc Disaster, I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Whaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why?! Rude! That's so boring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Why are you the only one who gets to have fun?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>U-uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh, right! I remember now! I ate this super delicious thing earlier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've never had something so good in my entire life! I bet you can't get it anywhere else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wh-what? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You ate something that good without me?! What is it? Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh man, it was soooo good! I think there's only one left, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Not fair! Not fair! You meanie! You sly slime! I wanted to eat one, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm? Oh man, what am I going to do now... I only just have this measly single one left... What to do, what to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nnnnhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>F-fine! I'll listen to you this once! That'll be enough, right? Right? Right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Phew. That worked.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your Milim-handling skills are improving every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's because you guys keep putting that responsibility on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Were you talking about the deep-fried water lizard? That was pretty good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Really? I thought it was a little hard to look at... Wait! This isn't the time for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oops, you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hunger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...Rimuru already saved roughly 150,000 of these orcs once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>He gave them a warm world and future. One where nobody has to has to starve...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And now all of these guys have to die without ever realizing there was a much better world waiting for them out there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Benimaru...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not really in the mood to fight them, huh, Benimaru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Different timeline or not, these guys could have eventually become our comrades. It doesn't feel right to cut them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Yeah. I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But I won't hold back in a fight, nor will I forgive any orc that lays a hand on you. That's what I told Geld back then, and I'll stand by that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A Samurai General that can't even back up his words is a lousy excuse for a Samurai General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...I want to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Devour... Feed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Great Sage... How's it looking? Is it possible?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Answer: Theoretically, consuming the Orc Disaster would make it possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Good enough.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I promised Demon Lord Geld that I'd devour all the orc's sins for them, so...let me do the same for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Let's finish this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Graaaaaarrrgghhhhh!</td>
