<td>What's the matter today? It's rare for you to ask me out for a walk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I really wanted to talk with you, Mocca. You're leaving tomorrow morning, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I heard that you're headed to Asena... Oh, and about the trial!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why can I never be of a help to you, Mocca?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Tamis, calm down. This is something that I must overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's what you always say, Mocca! You always try to shoulder everything on your own! There's no need for you to do it on your own, Mocca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tamis...I am not shouldering this burden alone. Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Besides, I promised you that day that I would protect you, didn't I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hey, here comes Tamis. I know she can't see, but she's so bothersome walking around like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I heard she was blinded so that she could see no corruption...but, to be honest, it's creepy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah. Rumor has it that she's related to some extinct tribe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's something sinister about her... She's probably the one that's brought misfortune to our village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Shh! She'll hear us. Apparently, since she can't see, she can hear really well. Seriously. What a menace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Leave this village, you useless menace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>......!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What are you doing to my sister?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mocca...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Who threw that rock just now?! Who's the one who hurt my sister...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I will not forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Is that...the power of the wind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If you have any problem with Tamis, then you'll have to go through me! I'm going to protect her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Tamis, are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mocca...that power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Never mind that. You're bleeding. I'll bandage you now. Why don't you say anything back to them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well...my blindness is part of my vocation. I don't care what anyone says about me. More importantly, are you hurt, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't worry about me! ...I'm sorry for making you shoulder everything, Tamis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm all right. Are you sure you're not hurt? You're always protecting me, Mocca.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You worry about me too much, Tamis. I know you're my twin, but it's me who should be supporting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I've decided that I'm going to protect you from everything out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's the one thing I can do for you, Tamis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Mocca...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And...one day, I'm going to show you Saga...and all the world. Until that day comes, I will be your eyes and your shield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This I promise you now, as your brother: I will protect you, Tamis!</td>
