<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Like you've observed...I am from Lost Blue...just like you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I knew it. It's been a while since I've heard that name. Brings back memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Lost Blue...? Weren't you from my country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, after I was chased out of Lustburg...sorry, out of this country, I moved around from place to place, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>After a few years, I finally arrived at Lost Blue. Although, the period I was there wasn't too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I've heard much about you along with many anecdotes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They say that Captain Othima of Lost Blue is a hero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh...?! Aww, come on. Stop it. That was a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>For you, Captain Othima, it may seem like a long abandoned past, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>For us from Lost Blue, you are a symbol of hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ah, no, it's not necessarily a past I've abandoned...um, you know it's not really good to do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's a bad habit of people from Lost Blue to always think of things in a negative way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Do you two know each other? Wait, don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey...don't get any strange ideas! I don't know anything about her! We just happened to be from the same village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Perhaps it's best to call it the same province?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, that's it! The same province! We're from the same province! That's the only thing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>As this is the case, I have been requested by our leader to deliver a message to you, Captain Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>From your leader? To me? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>As you are also from Lost Blue, would you like to join our cause?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh? Are you saying that you want me to quit the Holy Guard and join you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yes...to put it bluntly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmm. I appreciate the invitation, but that'll be a little difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Is it because you want to abandon your past in Lost Blue?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, it's not a matter of that. The truth is that, more than an adventure-filled life, I'd like to live a calm and stable one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Besides, more than anything...I don't think I can keep up with your principles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You do not hesitate to kill people to achieve your goal. That's what you were just doing right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Placing your objective as the main priority seems like the standard thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't intend to change my opinion about your way of doing things. Just thinking of becoming one of you is enough to make me feel sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>In other words, you won't agree to my proposal? If you cannot accept it, I was told that I must take your life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I thought as much. That being said, I don't plan to go down so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Are you sure about that? Sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>?! ...You're fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Uhaa! You're so dangerous. What's with that speed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Uck...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, you won't manage that! She'll already have her blade at you before you can finish chanting the spell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Your Highness, please just focus on avoiding her attacks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>In that case, what am I supposed to do? You won't have enough time to chant your spells either, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's true. What should we do about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>My apologies, but I must obtain the Sacred Stone. That's all there is to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No way...! How did you come up behind me so fast?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Agh-aghhh!!! ...What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ughh...! A magic fortification...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You're too fast for me to keep up with, so I have no choice but to make you come to me instead, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You made an opening on purpose...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I don't like the idea of turning a girl from my province into solid ice, but the situation calls for drastic measures. Don't think badly of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whew. I'm sorry, Your Highness. I don't know how to put it...I got you involved in my past as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No...but her magic attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's all right. I've already poured the highest amount of energy into her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Not even the strongest magic defense in this world will be able to penetrate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As someone who shares some of my past, I feel responsible in helping her see the error of her ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I feel...honored...that you would think that way of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Wh-what the...? Her left eye is glowing red...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...! Get down!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...Axe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No way! Argh! Was it too shallow? Ill Atmosphere!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Her left eye is shining red again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Is her left eye melting the ice?! Is it a Philosopher's Stone or something?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Thank you...Sol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Your Highness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I won't lose to you...as long as I'm protected by the power that you've given me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That impossible. Why doesn't it work?! Using a Philosopher's Stone shouldn't be enough to melt my ice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>This ice...it's warm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We are still...living in that lightless world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Compared to that painful life...even your ice radiates warmth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>!!! Ac-ackk...! Piercing Light!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Behind you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I am one of the Veda Templars...Acht, the 7 Tactics Master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>In order to realize the ideals of Sol...I cannot afford to lose. Gauntlet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
