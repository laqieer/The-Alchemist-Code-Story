<td>"Instant Tanuki Teleportation!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Owwww!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ouch... Shoot, that didn't work either... I can't travel to the place I'm thinking of like I'm trying to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If I can't, I'll never become a special soldier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have to become a special soldier so I can protect Rin... I have to get stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, Hayate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, there you are. That soldier you look up to, Nowaki, is back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Really?! He's back? He finished his guard mission at that human village? I'm glad it went well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Sounds like he won't have to the leave the village for a while. Why don't you ask him to watch over your training?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's not every day you get the chance to have him teach you in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! Training is something you do alone. It's not something you rely on others for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, sure, but... You're not getting anywhere with that technique on your own, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I think it'd be better if you asked Nowaki for help rather than trying to go at it alone. I'm sure he'll be able to teach you to get it right, no problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Besides, you're trying to become a special soldier that can travel to human settlements like Nowaki, right? Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's the point! He didn't need any help when he saved me that time I was surrounded by dozens of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I want to become like that. A strong man that can fight alone... That's why I've gotta try to do this by myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see... Well, if you that's how you want go about it, that's fine. Just don't push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But I gotta push myself! If I don't, there's no way I can become a special soldier like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have to get stronger fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ow ow... Haa... It's no good. I can't remove it... How did I get caught in a trap like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm hungry...and thirsty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>All right, what trick should I play today... Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're a person?! You scared me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What are you doing in a place like this? You're stuck in a trap? Are you okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I-I'm fine! I can get out of this all by myself. Ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ah! You'll only hurt yourself if you do it that way! Let me do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh? W-wait, you'll get hurt—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>If you do this and put this here... There you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Y-you got it off. I couldn't even get it to budge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(I'm always getting saved by other people... Not just Nowaki, but now this girl! I've still got a lot to learn.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hehehe. Amazing, right? Your foot probably hurts, so let me treat it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Thank you. You're amazing. Being able to remove traps by yourself and even giving first-aid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Really? Hehehe, thanks!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh... U-um, what's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Rin! What's yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>H-Hayate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hayate, huh! That's a cool name!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Cool?! N-no, it's not cool or anything—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Is that your stomach growling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>N-no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Being hungry can make you feel kinda helpless, right? Good job enduring that on your lonesome!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I didn't feel helpless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Really? There's no need to push yourself! I hate being alone myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I don't have many friends in the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Maybe because I only have one tail? No one wants to become friends with me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And I became alone in the village... I was lonely and I hated it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh, but there's a human girl I'm friends with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>A human? You've met humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Yup! I love humans! They're interesting and they play with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is that all right? It's not dangerous or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's fine! They're all kind, good people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>And if I go to the human village, she'll be there with me. So I'm not lonely at all now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Although, I do get a little lonely when I have to leave their village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh! Oh no! She's waiting for me right now! Well, see you later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wait! S-she's gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Lonely, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I swore to myself that day that I'd never let her get lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Doesn't matter if it's a human village or anywhere else, I want to be with her. I don't want her to feel lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If I could go to the human village with her, I could make sure she isn't lonely on the way there and back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Plus, I want to protect Rin from the dangerous grasp of humans who make traps like that one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But in order to do that, I have to master this technique as quick as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Oh, I lost it. Where did it go? Oh, it's Hayate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wha—?! R-Rin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Oh, wait! I want to ask you something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>A-ask me something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Oh, good. It stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I heard something strange a little while ago. So I chased after it and popped out here. Did something happen to go past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>S-something? Like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I don't know what it was! That's why I'm curious about it. I followed it and here you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Maybe it was from you? Although, it did sound like much a smaller animal... By the way, what are you doing here, Hayate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, um... Training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Training?! Are you practicing a Gyobu tribe technique?! I wanna see! Try doing something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What?! But I'm still working it out...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Besides, training is something you don't show to other people. So no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What?! Come on. It'll be fine to show me just a teensy bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Or are you having trouble with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>N-no, that's not the case. It works sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Isn't there someone who has already mastered it? Get that person to teach you! Have them tell you the trick to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You work hard, so I'm sure that if someone teaches it to you, you'll be able to do it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I think it'd be better if you asked Nowaki for help rather than trying to go at it alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Relying on someone else makes you weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Training is for improving oneself. It's meaningless if you don't do it by yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It has to be that way... If I can't be a strong man who can fight alone, let alone a special soldier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Hayate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'm going to go train alone... Don't follow me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>W-wait, Hayate! Ow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>A-are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hehehe... I fell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Are you hurt?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'm all right... Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What is a baby Ratty doing here? And it's hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Grrrrrrrrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Numu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Did those monsters attack it? It's all right now, tiny one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I'll defeat any bad guy who picks on the weak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>W-wait! It's dangerous to go in by yourself!</td>
</tr>
