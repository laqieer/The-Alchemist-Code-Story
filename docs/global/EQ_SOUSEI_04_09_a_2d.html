<td>Agh?! Ngah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I was...killed. By Nimul. How am I still alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do not tell me that you thought an injury like that would end you, Julia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Your Highness? What is the meaning of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Even after succumbing to corruption and losing my original body, I am still human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sinners are not exempt from death. That was my sole salvation, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That would be correct, if you were a mere Sinner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you talking about? I am a Sinner! The unyielding greed and grudge that sustains me is proof!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You are mistaken. Sinners have no such cravings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They are nothing more than beasts that have fallen and been devoured by corruption. They have no mind, nor desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But you are different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Julia, you have not been consumed by corruption. You were chosen. You are the priestess of Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Chosen...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Most Sinners lose all ties to their previous lives and live new ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But you carry so much... Too many memories, too many emotions...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That's not true! I only feel an ever-churning and yearning gluttony in my heart, one that cries out for me to consume everything and become one again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That urge is not your own. That is a phantom pain, caused by Beelzebub accumulating sinful magil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You are linked with the Cursed Beast, Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You cannot be destroyed. You cannot die. So long as Beelzebub exists in this world, you will too exist, undying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And that is why you are the key to awakening Beelzebub fully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That hunger that has taken root in you and that you feed with your longing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That will be what truly arouses Beelzebub from its slumber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My body...? No, I can't... I don't ever want to go back there again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Pitiful soul lost in sin... I can give you one last mercy. In the end, you will be with your master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So my conclusion is that the Asmodeus and the Belphegor we are seeing aren't the real ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Could you explain in detail?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah. First off...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>All of the Cursed Beasts we've encountered so far have had what we can call "sanctuaries".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>These sanctuaries are what we can call their territory. In a way, it shows their sovereignty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's because all the sinful magil the Beasts have gathered fills up that region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So basically, their territory is like its home base, I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's why our abilities have been weakened in their sanctuaries. Pretty dangerous, really...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But as far as we can observe, the two Beasts' sanctuaries aren't expanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's a good sign, but...do we know exactly why this is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The current prevailing theory is that it's because they no longer have their cores as Cursed Beasts. It would make sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I think we said this in our first report, but those are shadows of their true forms... Little more than chunks of magil that have taken shape.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Perhaps something is happening with the cores sealed away inside Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>We believe that's the most likely reason for the illusions of the Cursed Beasts we've seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To Emmel herself?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I know. If we get thwarted here, there's no way we can save Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So basically...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The Asmodeus and the Belphegor there aren't real. Even if we don't attack with our full forces, we should be able to handle them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So... This is just a proposal, but how about spitting into three groups?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>To divide our power like that sounds...risky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I realize the danger, but right now we don't have many other options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Corruption keeps spreading, and with the Cursed Beasts showing up... And we don't know if Emmel is safe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We can't afford to leave any of these situations be. It'll be rough, but we've got to move forward, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That's right! This is such a pain to deal with but we've gotta handle it all at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What do you think, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I think that Adaleigh's proposal makes sense...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>But if anything goes wrong and our forces are scattered, or if this plan itself is a mistake from the start...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even if it's an illusion, a Cursed Beast is a Cursed Beast. If it is not put down, it will affect the other moving pieces of our plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I want to make sure we have as much power as possible to handle Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We'll handle Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Yeah. I guess it was always going to come to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Then I'll handle Belphegor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Can you really handle it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I know from our previous fight that Belphegor is a destroyer of the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If I attack from the air, it'll always be a step behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That is why Icona was able to restrain it back in the Acedia Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>With Antares and the rest of the airship's defenses, I should be able to deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I also have the benefit of knowing most of the Beast's behavior already. If all goes according to my plan, I'll be more than a match for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>On our end, we've got a plan that Ambrosia cooked up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Since the beginning, subduing Asmodeus just as our Master wished has been our plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>If we fail to defeat an incomplete, coreless Cursed Beast, then we'll definitely have to revisit our training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Noooooo! That'd be the worst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>In that case, I will leave this to you three.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Great.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Then, we'll lead the warriors by land through the path Adaleigh will open up for us, and slip into where Beelzebub lies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And from there, it will be your turn to shine. Can we count on you, Eulalia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I will play the part of priestess of the Sephira and put Beelzebub to sleep. That's what you need from me, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes. And then Yna, Waginau, and I will settle things with Zafeiris and save Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>We will finish Beelzebub off after that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(There is already proof that we can use Alchemy to eliminate corruption. All that's left is simply a matter of output.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>(I now also have the power I gained from the Reincarnation Ritual; the protection of the Godwolf Asena.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>(By combining the power of Alchemy with this magil, I should be able to completely purify any corruption of any Cursed Beast.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>(More importantly, Emmel will no longer have to bear her burden alone!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>All right, so our battle plan has been set. The war starts from now. Let's all get ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>We depart tomorrow morning. It is likely that the decisive battle for this world is tomorrow. Let's make sure we win, and everyone returns safely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hmm, I need a wrench! A wrench...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Is this it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ah, thanks. What's up? You're not usually by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Because this is within Libra's range. I'm connected with Mira by Space-Time even if we're physically apart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I'll go ahead and change the topic. That lack of interest is rather harsh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>You could say that, but it's more that I'm busy right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I have the maintenance of the Engineer Soldiers and the airship to do, and I've gotta do it all by myself, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Small talk uses up too much precious brain power right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Anyhow, didn't you come here to calibrate Libra?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Not really. Our preparations are the same as usual. It's all we can do right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Don't make that face! So what's up? You just came to chat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>That's not quite it. There's just one thing I've been wondering about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Wondering about what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>When will you tell Emmel about your feelings?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Wh-whaaaaaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to catch you off guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>When did you notice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>From the very beginning. Everything in your attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You're the very definition of someone who has their heart on their sleeve. Everyone's already knows, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What? You mean, Emmel too...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Eh... I don't think she's ever even considered herself as someone who can inspire feelings like that, so...probably not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That sounds about right! That's a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Uh, isn't it kind of a bad thing. Unless...you plan to part without telling her anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>I haven't been planning anything like that... Even after we take care of Beelzebub, we'll still have four more Cursed Beasts...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Even so, this journey will end at some point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I can't. Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I'm still too much of a kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Oh. I didn't realize you were self-aware now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Back off, okay! It's just... I can't protect Emmel as I am now. It's not practical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>A spineless man such as myself has no right to confess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I've gotta get stronger, cooler... I've gotta grow up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Well, if you're fine with that. I have nothing else to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Anyway, why'd you bring this up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I've just been wondering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Uh, okay. Whew! We still have a ton of components! With these, we should be able to go all out tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>There should be some in the hangar. If you're free, you mind checking if any of the magil tools need any fixing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Yeah, I'll take care of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Cheers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>This isn't something I want to say but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>I don't know if she has enough time left to wait for him to be ready...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Eulalia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Hey, Mira! Do you need anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Well, not exactly, but...I'm a little free now and I was curious, so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>What were you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Paying my respects to the people of Sephira that have fallen so far...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I see. That's what a priestess does...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Every battle is a tragedy. Every time blood is spilled, the spirits of the land and the forest cry in agony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The voices of the spirits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Since the day I was born, I've lived alongside those voices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>The lands and the skies have their own will, and which is embodied in the voices and surround us every day as we live our lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>I've always thought that the Cursed Beasts might have a voice as well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>But if we can end this, I think we ought to. This sad, sad way of things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Yes, we can end this. We must. So I must also do what I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Even if...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>If what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>It's nothing. I'll be off now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>I think...we feel the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Lord Waginau! The Sephira warriors are ready to move out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Good! Warriors, fall in line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Our adversary is the Cursed Beast. This is the largest, most threatening being in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>However, we are led by Lord Nimul! We have a leader that has weathered many battles; a crew of seasoned warriors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>You all have exhibited exceptional strength. It will be more than enough to carve our way forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Warriors, recall your training! Cut them down with your Spiritbonding, and remember your oaths of compassion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>The great tree Sephiron is always with us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Great vigor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>(Tomorrow's battle will be fierce. It will be a battle of life and death.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>But we will show that we can overcome this. This is what Nimul... No, what we all desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Victory will be ours! We will restore peace to the land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I've missed this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Yes. We had many conversations here while I hammered away at steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>It seems so long ago, now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You're too young to talk like that, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>You're probably right. But for me, this was the first time I've set off on such a long journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Everything from that day... Washing up in this region, meeting you, becoming friends... I feel like everything has led up to this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Yna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I am a graceless man. My demeanor is poor and I cannot get along with the people of this village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Now even I earnestly feel that I want to save this region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Next will be your region. I promise I will save all the lands with these hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Then we certainly cannot lose tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Yes. We must win. We will open the door to the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>This is the last blade I needed to work on. It is time to ready myself for what will come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Lord Nimul! The warriors of Sephira have been assembled!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>There is no guarantee that we will return from this battle. Have you all prepared your hearts and minds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>Yes, sir! We will quell the spread of the Sinners over the land!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>All have set aside their fears and are ready to lay their lives down to fulfill their oaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Soldiers, fall in line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>The time has come! The mission to retrieve the Vessel of Purification has begun. We will settle the turmoil that has come upon us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>We people of Sephira value compassion and harmony, but this is the only option we have in the face of this corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>With this offensive, we will purify our land and take it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>All right, let's move out! March!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaaahhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>Okay, we're ready for liftoff! Mira, Nyx, are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>Yeah! Leave everything to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Libra is at the ready. We are just waiting for instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>All right! Then let's get this party started!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>I can't believe this. Our once fruitful land has become this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>It's certainly horrible. But this is why we must return the blessings of the great tree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Morale looks to be high...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>It's to be expected. This is our land. You returned, along with the protection of the Godwolf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>We can't afford to lose. The longer we wait, the more destruction there is. We all understand that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Yes... It's quite a heavy responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>The time to fulfill that responsibility has come. Here we go: a horde of Sinners has showed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>You've finally made it, Pursuers of Sin. However, you've arrived too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>Now, shadows of the Cursed Beasts! They have come to attack you! Retaliate to your hearts' content!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Grrrooooooggghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Grrroooooaaaagghhh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>Ugh... Lord Nimul! The Cursed Beast is here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>Go forward without fear! Believe in me! Believe in your comrades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>We're going to take back our home! Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>Ah... This doesn't look good, Nimul! It's looking to trigger its earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Grraaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>Hey, hey! You don't think we'd just let things go according to your plans, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>Valley of Siddim Protocol activated! Time to bind it to the ground!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>The magil output is stable! It won't be able to move anytime soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>Thanks! I'll manage things here. Your battlefield is over there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>Separation of Libra is complete. I won't warn you not to take unnecessary risks, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Haha, I'll do it if it comes to that. You two are the same, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>...Take care of yourself. We'll see you on the other side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>What is up with all this manly energy here? Did you forget that I'm here, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>Of course not. To do such a thing would surely be equivalent to shooting myself in the foot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>Wait, Nyx! Are you telling me that you have some complaints about having a sister as adorable as me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>Haha, if you two can squabble like that at a time like this, then I'm sure we'll be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Nimul, we'll take care of things here. Go to Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>Onwards, to the village! There's not a moment to spare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>Warriors! Forward march!</td>
</tr>
