<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Did you hear? I heard that the shops in the city were ransacked by bandits again today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Those castoffs of Wratharis again. The city guards can't do anything about them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What's your plan, Tango? Are you still not ready to take over as boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't be dumb. The Don is the head of Heaven district. There's no way I can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sure, but where in the hell is the Don? I don't see him anywhere around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aren't we working together to find him right now? I'm sure he'll show up soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You don't think he left the country, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's possible. He's a man of action that doesn't listen to what other people say. When he says he's out, he's really out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Darn it... It's unbelievable how he just left. It's like he doesn't even care about anyone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Now's not the time for arguing. Let's focus on the bandit problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Bandits hailing from Wratharis are always end up targeting our country... If the boss is still absent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yeah, this country is just a loosely guarded treasure trove to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I know that. But to think the Don would thoughtlessly put everyone in jeopardy like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We've got bigger things to worry about! We're getting more reports of attacks every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>On top of that, it looks like some members of our family have started to side with the bandits from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The only reason they've been so quiet is because of the Don's reputation. We gotta get a new boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's only a matter of time before they swallow Redington up whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I said I know that! You know I'm not gonna let some villains threaten the citizens! I just need a little more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...Villains...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I see. Hahaha... I get it now, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Tango?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, tell everyone to sit tight and leave the bandits be for the time being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hey, what about the mayoral election?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>With Don Taras gone and Heaven district quieting down, I think things are looking peaceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Are you asking me if I would vote for Mayor Edward? He's the guy who got in bed with Don Taras. He's probably cozying up to other mafia right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>True. Well, with all the bandit attacks, it's doubtful that an election will even be held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Cozying up, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And to think, I didn't even get paid for all this "cozying up" people seem to think I was doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>D-Don Taras?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Stop, pinhead. If you don't wanna die, give me what you're wearing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>B-bandits!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Run! They're coming for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Why are you messing around? Just kill him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hey, you blockhead over there! You too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>W-wait... He's... Isn't that Don Taras?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I see the petty trash Wratharis tossed out is making quite the scene.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-hey... This is bad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>B-but they said he was kicked out of his Family...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>H-help!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>These guys are a cakewalk for you, right? Let 'em have it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No can do, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>W-why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm not a mafioso anymore. I have no interest in getting involved in other people's turf wars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>They say that me being here corrupts the city, and I don't want that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Heh. Sorry. Now I'm just some boring passerby checking out the sights of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Heh, heh. You mean you're not involved with this city anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's not that I'm not involved, exactly. I'm here, aren't I? It's just that I'm not gonna fight you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Heh...heheh! You hear that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Without Don Taras, there's nothing to fear! Hey! Contact main command!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Take everything, roots and all! If they resist, kill them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Eeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong. I said I won't be raising a hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Don, aren't you having a little too much fun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Who, me? You don't have anything better to do than talk to me? I'm not your boss anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You're the one with a lot to say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Hey, mafiosos! Crush every last one of these sneaky scumbags!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Wh-whaâ€”?! This isn't the last you'll be seeing of us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>That was a little much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Haven't you said enough? I'm not listening to you anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hehe. Then why are you here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>To wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Wake up? You look pretty awake to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Please stop deliberately misunderstanding me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Just like these citizens, I'm trying to wake up from this fake dream of taking peace for granted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hehe. You got true grit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Well, I learned it from one of the greatest villains of our time.</td>
