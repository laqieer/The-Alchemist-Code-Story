<td>Did you hear? I heard that the shops in the city were ransacked by bandits again today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>Those castoffs of Wratharis again. The city guards can't do anything about them...</td>

</tr>

<td>Don't be dumb. The Don is the head of Heaven district. There's no way I can do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>Sure, but where in the hell is the Don? I don't see him anywhere around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tango.png" alt="Tango" height="128"><br>Tango</td>
<td>Aren't we working together to find him right now? I'm sure he'll show up soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling A</td>
<td>You don't think he left the country, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>It's possible. He's a man of action that doesn't listen to what other people say. When he says he's out, he's really out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling A</td>
<td>Darn it... It's unbelievable how he just left. It's like he doesn't even care about anyone else.</td>
</tr>

<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>Now's not the time for arguing. Let's focus on the bandit problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling A</td>
<td>Bandits hailing from Wratharis are always end up targeting our country... If the boss is still absent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>Yeah, this country is just a loosely guarded treasure trove to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tango.png" alt="Tango" height="128"><br>Tango</td>
<td>I know that. But to think the Don would thoughtlessly put everyone in jeopardy like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling A</td>
<td>We've got bigger things to worry about! We're getting more reports of attacks every day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>On top of that, it looks like some members of our family have started to side with the bandits from Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tango.png" alt="Tango" height="128"><br>Tango</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling A</td>
<td>The only reason they've been so quiet is because of the Don's reputation. We gotta get a new boss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Underling B</td>
<td>It's only a matter of time before they swallow Redington up whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tango.png" alt="Tango" height="128"><br>Tango</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>With Don Taras gone and Heaven district quieting down, I think things are looking peaceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Citizen B</td>
<td>Are you asking me if I would vote for Mayor Edward? He's the guy who got in bed with Don Taras. He's probably cozying up to other mafia right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Citizen A</td>
<td>True. Well, with all the bandit attacks, it's doubtful that an election will even be held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>???</td>
<td>Cozying up, huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/donta.png" alt="Don Taras" height="128"><br>Don Taras</td>
