<td>Huzzaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hrgh... Curse you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Get ready to pay for your crimes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Actually, I think this may be the end of the line, Ishuna. At least, we ought to toe that line and retreat, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry. We'll take things from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Tch... Don't touch me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Don't think you're getting off lightly, you monster! You're going to cough up every last coin you owe us for the work we've done here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, excellent. I think we can safely leave this matter in your many capable hands. Now...let's see here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Uh...Icona? What're you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh! Don't mind me. I just found some things of surprising worth down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We owe our freedom to you two ladies, I take it? I'm sure I speak for all of us here when I say thank you, both of you, from the bottom of my heart! My only concern now is getting these baubles into town, but...at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Leave it to me! I'll have those baubles delivered in a jiffy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Truly? If you could manage that, I'd be most obliged. And you can tell the merchant to pay the usual price, no premium required!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yay! Now everyone will get their Winter Holiday gifts on time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Guess what, kids? I have presents for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yay! Thanks, Papa! Ooh! It's one of those shiny baubles—one of the special ones! Hee hee. It's got a cute little snowman on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Awesome! Mine's got a Ratty in a Santa suit on it! Thanks, Dad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey, um... I'm really sorry about earlier. I shouldn't have lashed out at you like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's quite all right! No need to apologize, my good man. I understand. This is a special time of year, after all. I wish you a Happy Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Gee, I... I can't thank you enough for your generosity. A Happy Winter Holiday to you, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Everyone's in such a good mood! I'm so glad I made it back in time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, you really saved the day, young lady! Here. It's only a trifle, but I want you to have this, with my thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Is this...a bath bomb?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Indeed! It's a Winter Holiday exclusive. It's normally quite popular with young children, so I do apologize if it's not to your liking, but I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Are you kidding?! I love it! Thanks so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey, um, Miss? You brought these shiny baubles into town, didn't you? I saw you running here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah! Thanks for bringing them, Miss! We wouldn't have had any presents to open if it wasn't for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh gosh... I, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(The way these kids are smiling at me reminds me of me, when I was thanking Rochelle and the others for the kindness they showed me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(No way I was this cute, though... Hehe.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(Still...maybe I haven't done such a bad job after all. If all that fighting I had to do for the Unicorn Knights is even part of the reason for those smiles...then it was totally worth it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Everyone looks really happy, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You know, having seen how those baubles transformed the mood around town, I'm starting to understand the importance of this occasion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Wait, really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. I realized that, when it comes down to it, "spending time with loved ones" really just means sharing experiences. Even I can see the value in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>For instance, the time I spent conducting research with my talented little brother was highly productive, leading to many new discoveries that wouldn't have been possible without our combined efforts. This is the same sort of thing, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I originally thought that there was no such thing as a "special time," but now I see why spending time with others is potentially deserving of just such a description.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, um... That's...good, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>However, what astounds me most of all is the scope of the effect you've had on this town just by caring for the people here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I would never have believed that simply being honest and straightforward could produce such results, and yet...here we are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You really are honest and straightforward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>There's a kind of strength in believing so much in someone else, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I didn't do it alone, though. You helped me out more than once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Looking back, that's how it's always been for me; I've been lucky enough to have the full support of all the people around me. Thanks again, Icona. I mean it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh? Judging by that smile, I'd say a great weight has just left your shoulders. Have you found your resolution to that problem we discussed earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I think, on the whole...I'm happy with how I've handled things. I've done well. I can see that now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Good. A sound analysis should lead to accurate results; that's a universal truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Perhaps humans and machines aren't so different after all—from a researcher's perspective, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>R-right... I'm not sure I agree with that, but... On another note, I think I'm ready to face Glanz and Rochelle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm going to tell them that I'm okay now, and...show them how much I've grown, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ishuna! Icona! There you are! You two pulled off a real miracle, you know that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, Lotiyah! Thanks for covering my shift for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, there's no need to thank me! Of the two of us, I had the easy job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Anyway, now that everything's wrapped up, I was planning on joining the party. Are you two coming, or...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I am! How about you, Icona? I guess you'd prefer to go back to your workshop, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Actually, I've changed my mind. I will be attending the party.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hmm? I didn't think it would come as that big of a shock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Sorry! It's just...you really didn't seem to care about the Winter Holiday at all, before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I did think it all quite pointless at first, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>However, now that I understand the purpose of the occasion, I'd like to participate. After all, it will be a whole year before I get another chance to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Still, I'll have to prepare some gifts for everyone, so I might be a little late. You two go on ahead—I'll meet you there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wow... Never thought I'd hear those words coming out of her mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Me neither. I guess this is what you call a Winter Holiday Miracle? Tee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yeah... I have to wonder what she's planning on giving everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Happy Winter Holiday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That tree is huge! And look at all these decorations! Don't tell me you two set all this up on your own?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hee hee. Surprise! And, yeah, we did. It was tough work on such short notice, but we did our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Yeah... I can't wait to see the looks on Lofia and Michael's faces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh? What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Hi, everyone! Sorry for the delay, but I'm here for the party!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Uhh...Icona? What's with all these machines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Well, that noble we dealt with had quite the collection of fascinating materials. I liberated everything I could carry, started experimenting, and...these are the results!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>"L-liberated"...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>A fair tradeoff for the extra work we did, wouldn't you say? Working for free just doesn't make sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Anyway, I figured this gathering would be the perfect opportunity to do a little trial run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What're you waiting for? There's no need to be shy! Come on over and get your present from Icona Claus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I take it back. No miracles here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yup. Same old Icona... Haha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>(I wonder when Glanz and Rochelle will arrive?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What's wrong, Ishuna? You look lost. The bathroom's over there, if you need it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh, uh, no! I'm fine. Don't mind me. Just...enjoying the decorations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>But, hey, are you leaving already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'll be back soon. I just need to pick up a few things we ran out of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Oh, okay! Want me to come with? I can help you carry stuff!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Are you sure? Wouldn't you rather stay and enjoy the party?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Don't worry! If we work together, we'll be done in a jiffy! Besides, I was kinda thinking you could help me run a little errand on the way back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>What sort of errand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Well, two of the people we invited have yet to arrive, and...I was hoping we could meet them in town. I want to be the first one to welcome them here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh! I see. They'd love that, I'm sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hehe. I hope so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>(Once I've apologized and said everything I need to say...I'm going to ask if they want to have a bath together, like we used to.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>(After all, what better way to use up this special Winter Holiday bath bomb? Hee hee!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>May your winter holliday be merry and bright !</td>
