<td>Hah!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Argh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That was amazing... Your swordplay was so graceful and beautiful! Wadatsumi swordsmen really are a force to be reckoned with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We had to be strong to protect what we had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...Sorry. That was phrased poorly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah! Don't worry about it! It doesn't bother me whatsoever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Not just for that. For everything. I've been extremely rude. I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I-it's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I don't quite understand how I should interact with you, the General of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Please understand that I don't hate you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>After that battle, you became general and worked tirelessly to unite Greed Dike and Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's just that it's hard to shake the instinct that anyone from Greed Dike is my enemy. I can't help but see the shadow of Orion in you and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...I don't know how to change that. Everyone's already said to me that I can't get stuck in the past but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Suzuka...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...I feel like a child. I thought I had grown some after apologizing to Itsuki, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's fine! Really! It's my duty to hear the opinions and voices of the people of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's my responsibility as General, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's the least I can do as the person who carries the responsibility of bringing Greed Dike and Wadatsumi together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's also my will as a Phantom Soldier! Nothing has changed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Leafah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>(Huh?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>(Wasn't I the one who was supposed to be apologizing?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(What do I do? I still haven't apologized yet! She got to it first! How do I proceed from here?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>By the way, what brings you here, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>U-um! I-I came to let you know we're about to leave soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oh! You have my gratitude. I must hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So...you didn't apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ack! The timing wasn't right! Go ahead and laugh, why don't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No, I won't laugh. But is that okay? We'll be arriving in Lustburg soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No, it's not okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But the timing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh! I have a great idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wh-what is it? Tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Once this job is over, why don't you make some chocolates with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Chocolates?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Pour your apology into the chocolate and give it to Suzuka!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You really lucked out, didn't you! Having people understand you through chocolate really is the best method out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>After all, Valentine's Day is all about making your feelings known!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I-I see! Valentine's day is all about making your feelings known... Just gotta put it in the chocolate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Alrighty, with that settled, let's get this cacao to Lustburg and destroy any who dare stand in our way!</td>
