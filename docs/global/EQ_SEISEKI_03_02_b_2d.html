<td>All right. We've taken out the monsters! Let's cross the bridge now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?! Why are you stopping us?! Are you a spy after all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No! That bridge is dangerous! We can't cross it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's headed in the right direction. It'll take us onto a side path, but should be able to reach our goal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm talking about its durability, not its direction! From the way it looks, it can collapse at any moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Seriously?! It looks really sturdy though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I agree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It looks old, but I can't see any visible rot or breakage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's a little hard to believe your observation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You too, teacher?! Please, trust your local guide more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That being said, when there's a bridge right in front of you, it's hard to not want to take that option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If we were to avoid the bridge, we'd have to head back onto the mountain road and suffer attack after attack from the monsters there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'd prefer to take a risk than over something so inefficient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I told you, no! Fine...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Beeeeep!!!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh, what's that? What's the matter, Almira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hey! Something is flying towards us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Is that a...hawk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's my buddy! We usually go hunting together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Just watch! I'm going to make him land on the bridge! See!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You're joking...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The bridge...it collapsed from just the weight of a hawk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>See, I told you! If I hadn't been here, you'd all be splattered across the valley floor by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm sorry for doubting you, Almira! Thank you! You saved us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Indeed. But...what should we do then?</td>
</tr>
