<td>Is it here...? She really must be a famous fortuneteller if even the thieves know about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've snuck in, but I'm sure she'll get suspicious if she finds me. I'm pretty much a thief again at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Maybe I should come back tomorrow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Good evening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...! Oh, um, well, I bear you no ill intentions...even though my sneaking into your house makes that pretty questionable, um!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hehe. You don't need to get so flustered. I knew you would come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The stars told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The stars...? Wait, you were the girl who was just walking outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. The stars were beautiful tonight. That was when the stars told me you were coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Um...sorry! I wasn't going to steal anything, I just wanted to meet you as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh my. How passionate you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, that's not what I meant! My name is Retzius, and, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My name is Deneb. So...who are you looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh...how did you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The stars see everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wow! You're the real deal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. Please, tell me the purpose of your visit here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Um...where should I start...oh! I don't know the name of the person I'm looking for...is that still all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If the stars guide us it will be all right. But why this person?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well...I'm not sure how to put it, but...or where to start...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The stars will not miss out on even the smallest of details. Please, begin as you'd like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Um... I was a thief, but I quit. I did it in order to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's why, well...I never thought about what I really wanted to do...or what I really believed in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Still, there was an obscure part of me that wanted to live a straight and just life. I know that doesn't sound very convincing coming from a former thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But, when I met that guy, his words, actions...I don't know...they sent shivers down my spine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>He was the embodiment of what I envisioned a man should be. He was cool, determined, and strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's why I want to be acknowledged by him. This is the first time I've ever felt this way. I want to start there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I see. It sounds like it was the encounter of a lifetime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. Oh...sorry, I've been doing all the talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No. Thank you for telling me your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Can you really tell my fortune with just what I said? I was prattling on and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Shhh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Deneb...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>When stars are drawn to each other, their light grows brighter. Once this happens...they cannot return to their former light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>A brighter light does not always mean happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sometimes, it can rush you down the path to death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Do you still wish to meet this man? Have you resolved yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Without that resolve, I cannot tell you where he is. And I will have to ask you to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't understand the details, but I get that you're speaking in earnest, Deneb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Still, I want to me him. Even if you don't tell me where he is, I'll search the entire world until I find him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I mean, for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm walking on my own two feet. I have absolutely no regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A newborn star shines radiantly as if basking in its glow. You have certainly shown me how brightly you shine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...Then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. I'll tell you. The stars will lead you from here. May they protect you in your journey ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Yes! Just you wait, bro! I'm gonna find you!</td>
</tr>
