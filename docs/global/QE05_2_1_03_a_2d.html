<td>General Leordas is on the far end of the village, taking in any survivors that manage to escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Both of you should head that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Leave this place to the Liberation Army for now! You should fall back and reorganize your forces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Understood! Isidore, can you move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Aah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They got the jump on us here. Cursed Ceclidis! He must have had his eye on this village from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This must be the hidden village of the Sephira, the elusive tribe that protects the great tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I estimate the enemy has five times our numbers. In addition, the village's defenses have been nullified, and there are likely still reinforcements due to arrive from the royal capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This battle may mean certain death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It does not matter. The Liberation Army cannot forsake any of those who live in the South!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We must first find and rescue any survivors. If the enemy takes any hostage, we will lose any advantage we might have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tell me, are you willing to follow me even in the face of certain death?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Lord Waginau has commanded us to see this fight through to the end. Besides, the slaughter of innocent people is unconscionable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This battlefield is heartless, merciless, and, above all, lacks justice. It is our duty to remedy that situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Warriors of the Liberation Army!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Behold! This is the barbarism of the Royal Army! This is Ceclidis' answer to the cries of our people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The nobles of the North no longer consider us to be people! They will seize, destroy, and exploit all that we have built!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It is clear what we must do! It is clear who we must protect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You all know what must be done! Now, warriors! Take up your swords for the sake of our compatriots, and for justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Forward!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huzzah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This roar... Is that the Liberation Army assaulting the Royal Army?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We should hurry and meet up with the other villagers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Isidore! Are you all right? Here, show me your wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm fine. I don't hear the voice in my head anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Voice? The voice of Sephiron?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, but not the Sephiron we grew up with, filled with warmth and light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It was more like a resounding echo in a hollow place, beckoning me to sink deeper and deeper into the abyss. It is...horrible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Enough. Do not force yourself to speak. Let's just make our way to the Royal Army. Everybody should be there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yes, you're right.</td>
