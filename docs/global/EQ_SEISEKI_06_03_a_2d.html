<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey, what's the meaning of this? Didn't we avoid the gassy areas?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>W-well... oh no... I didn't know that this area had gotten...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You fool! Do you even know your way around this mountain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Geez, don't get me started now! You didn't listen to a word I said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Weren't you saying you were suffering from dehydration?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Be quiet already! Instead of sweating the details, as the Lord Commander, why don't you come up with a solution here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's easier said than done!<br>Whah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tsk!<br>What would Lord Vettel do in this situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>And what on earth would Lord Zain or the other captains have done here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Uhrrr!<br>Whhooaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You fool!<br>Don't rely now on some people who aren't here!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Don't think you can solve anything by copying someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Grasp the future with your own two hands! If you can't do that, you should quit being a knight altogether!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...<br>With my own two hands...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Kanon! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Whah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>?!<br>M-Spica?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let's go. We can leave this to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You should prioritize the restoration of Excalibur now. Come on...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?! Are you planning on just leaving Chloe and Captain Monzein behind like that?! I could never...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>What's this wind?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What is this?<br>It's sweeping down all of the monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>“We left,” you said?<br>I've really been looked down on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Geez... why do I got to leave the Holy Guard, huh? That's just too unreasonable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Seida!<br>But why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Why, you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Didn't you say we need to restore Excalibur to release Kagura from Othima's Philosopher's Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Seida...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Come on, let's hurry up and take care of the rest. We don't want to be wasting time here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hm! As such a latecomer, don't say that as if it's so easy! We got affected by volcanic gas...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I thought I just blew all of that gas away with that gust, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!<br>It's true, the feeling in my body seems to be returning!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Any other problems?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>None!<br>All right! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ugh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Pant...pant...<br>Did we clean them all up for now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes!<br>Thank you, Seida!<br>This was all thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Phuh! You don't need to thank her! Why were you late in the first place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It's not like I was loafing around somewhere, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I was looking into Lord Zain's notes once more, because I wanted to look something up about Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Something about Excalibur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It seemed too unreasonable to look for a hidden blacksmith's forge on such a vast mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I wanted to find some sort of clue! But actually, it made me aware of another concerning factor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Another concerning factor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Well, all hope isn't necessarily lost, but it's possible that we may not be able to restore Excalibur anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>W-wait a second...<br>What are you talking about?<br>Can't you say something, Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Right. Before that, I need to have a word with you. What exactly is your objective here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I had the chance to observe the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Leading you into an area with gas, and moreover, an area with a lot of monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Why did you act in such a roundabout way? If you're after Excalibur, it would have been more reasonable to just take it from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hey, what are you talking about, Seida? Spica merely led us in a way to avoid the areas with eruption danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Well, let me tell you first that the eruption risk of this mountain is just a tale for the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Lord Zain called this an active volcano and marked it as forbidden territory, only to hide Yogi Ku's forge from the eyes of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The chances of Ramproad mountain ever erupting is very low, and there's no way that the mountain's own guide wouldn't know about that, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That axe looks like it's seen a lot of action. You must be powerful...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There should have been an opportune timing to snatch Excalibur away from Kanon, wasn't there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well... it's like you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Like I thought! You're not actually serving Yogi Ku, are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But yes, why have you been going about it in such a roundabout way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Couldn't you have just come to snatch Excalibur away after we'd gone to restore it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I couldn't decide whether to steal Excalibur or not... without getting to know you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I just wanted to talk to you... to find out what kind of people you all are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>“You all?”<br>Which means, me too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I was really wondering... what kind of people killed Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Zahar... Is she talking about the one who was sealed into the Door of Truth truth along with Captain Cadanova?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>So... are you from Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I do seem to be at a disadvantage here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Phuh! She ran away?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Since she works for Zahar, we can't just let her get away.<br>Seida...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Right.<br>Kanon, you guys should head for the limestone cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>According to the notes Lord Zain left behind, Yogi Ku ought to be there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I don't believe he'll be working for us though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We'll meet up again later.<br>Please just hurry for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wait, Seida!<br>Please don't hurt Spica if it can be avoided!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>Why wouldn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I think... she's not a bad person. I think you'll understand if you talk to her. Please, Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Geez, what a troublesome Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Tsk!<br>I can't make any promises!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Wait a second!<br>Don't you know she's on the side of that infamous Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>But... we don't have anything to attain by getting rid of her, do we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Anyway, we need to head for the forge.<br>Let's go, to the limestone cave!</td>
</tr>
