<td>Are all the Phantom Soldiers destroyed?!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Shouldn't you be protecting your back?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>

<td>There's no way you can continually deflect the AJ5000 Series' 3-unit combo attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In battle, where the circumstances change from moment to moment, this is the perfect combo attack! This action is only possible through the ability to sync information!</td>

<td>Did you really complete the Messiah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This artificial intelligence called Messiah was originally developed in order to accommodate the accelerating industrialization of this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you just say, â€˜this'? Is the Messiah here right now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However, during the development process, I discovered the possibility of syncing countless Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Think about it. If we can sync all the Alkaroids that populate this land, we can obtain information from all across the country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We can obtain the eyes to see through the entire world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ack! Where is it?! Where are you hiding it?! Look for the Messiah! If we can just destroy that artificial intelligence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Agh! Wh-where is it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Seriously what are you looking for? It's right here in front of you. All of this is thanks to Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Ethan. Before you stole Belphegor, I'd already completed this ultimate artificial intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I-It can't be...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Messiah means savior. Having obtained the eyes to see everything in this world, I will become its savior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Y-you...imbedded the Messiah in your own brain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As long as I have these eyes, the chances of one of your attacks penetrating my defenses is one in a million.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Agh?! Agah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>AJ5000, recover the Belphegor. Let's go, Ethan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wh-where...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Where do you think? To the place where the Sacred Stone's power can be unleashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The clock tower.</td>
