<td>I'm almost out of arrows, Kamui! How do you want to proceed?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>This... I... There's no way for me to defeat this monster on my own. No matter how many I purify, he will simply replicate more to take their place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The only chance we have is if we can find the real Ceclidis and defeat him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That sounds like a plan. We have to get ourselves out of this situation! There's no reason to waste our energy on an enemy that won't die if our true target is somewhere else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You say that, but how are we going to make that happen? We're surrounded by the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I will clear a path with my Spiritbonding. Once I've done that, you two should go on ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Find Adelbert and the others, and make your way to the stronghold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The stronghold...? Not the altar?</td>

<td>That they drew us here at all means that they figured out what our plan was.</td>

<td>Logi! Tina! Go! I will hold them here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What? Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I thought you said that you were going to protect her? Go, Logi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You'd better be alive when I see you next, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Protector, you are braver than I had thought... Or is it foolishness that makes you believe that you are enough to face us on your own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I guess we'll find out.</td>
