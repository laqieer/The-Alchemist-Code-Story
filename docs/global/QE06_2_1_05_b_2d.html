<td>Wadatsumi, slumbering isle of sin--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Long ago humans existed on this island--humans alone…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…Only humans? Then where did the demons come from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They were there from the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But you just said there were only humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What...is this? What am I seeing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Beings split from mankind--these are what we call "demons."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Split…from mankind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's true--the way Wadatsumi was long, long ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No way…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Humans and demons…were once one and the same? But…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The alchemy dormant on the island permeated mankind after many years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Demons devoured man. Thus, man feared demons. Man racked his brain in order to fight back and the conflict continued for many years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Demons were blessed with stature and power surpassing man. Thus, man was hunted down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Man's only hope was his intelligence, which he channeled into skills--ultimately ensuring the survival of the species.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That intelligence culminated in the creation of "alchemy"… Man made use of chakra and a technique that was especially potent against demons…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...Kagutsuchi</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Passed down from generation to generation of the Aquila Rubrum royal family…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The advent of Kagutsuchi spelled the downfall of the demons' reign, and the tides of war turned in the humans' favor…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But the demons could not be eradicated. The grueling war raged on and on--with neither side delivering a decisive blow. Both succumbed to exhaustion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Why are you telling me this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…I want you to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…Alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What follows is the most important part--the story of how mankind joined forces with demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Joined forces? Are you talking about that old fairy tale?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's no fairytale. It's all real and it all really happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What I'm about to tell you is the true story of the inhabitants of this island who lived side by side.</td>
</tr>
