<td>They're attacking us from downstream as well?! The villagers are a disorderly bunch...they shouldn't be able to use any of the arts!</td>

<td>No! It's the wind! It's pushing our attacks back. The villagers are taking advantage of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>At this rate, we're sitting ducks!</td>

<td>Ack! How can we be driven back by the wind?!</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>This is unbelievable! Quickly! Open a path!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Sorry, that's not happening!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So you were the ones who opened this path! How dare you!</td>

<td>Can't you hear the voices of the trees? They spent tens of hundreds of years growing here!</td>
