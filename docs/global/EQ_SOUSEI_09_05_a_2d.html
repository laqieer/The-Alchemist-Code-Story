<td>Enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...I grow weary of this nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Did it work?! I think it did, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My hits simply aren't powerful enough. If only I could purify the corruption within her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What the...? The ground is...shaking?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't tell me this tower is collapsing...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If I fall from this height, I can't possibly survive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why would this tower be so fragile?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Because it doesn't have enough offerings to sustain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The things that hold this tower together are the cores of the Cursed Beasts and the magil collected from Superbia Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However, the one who controls those cores now is you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So the only thing supporting this feeble tower is the limited magic you have to offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So...because I was suppressing the wild magil before, there isn't enough fuel for the tower to remain standing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't regret it. I won't! Power taken from the deaths of those I intended to save is not power I desire, regardless of the circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But...at this rate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(I can't fight. I can't even run away!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>With no foothold, you cannot stand against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What is she...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>At last, I have obtained it. This tower is made of magil, just like my Shell. In addition...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Agh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A new attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Finally, I've come to a conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alchemy... Like me, it takes Truth and manipulates it to create distortions within reality. Its scope is more limited than my own, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It exhibits a more focused application of magil, capable of actualizing the reality contained within the record of the magil itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Th-that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Those flames are representative of the heat from the restless volcano in Ire Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That ice recalls the freezing cold of the blizzards in Luxuria Belt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You take what you have learned of other worlds and add it to your repertoire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Which means you should be able to do this as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What? How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(We're much too high up. There shouldn't be anyone here with us! What...was she saying...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've finally realized, no?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No. It can't be. No! Did she create them with...Alchemy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmm. Intriguing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(No! If my intuition is correct, then that's—!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There is no reason for one such as I to bother fighting a human child who can barely hold this tower together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>However, it is a good chance to give you a little test. The right opponent for you would be another human who's just a little ahead of the game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let's see how easily you can defeat someone from the past, child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(A single glance is enough to know that they're made entirely of magil.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(A magil of an even higher density than the average human's!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Such an imposing presence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(Not even standing before Lord Kubera did I feel fear like this. I can't stop myself from shaking.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmph. How disappointing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I thought I'd have a more exciting opponent, having been called to the battlefield of a god.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>But you are no warrior. You're strong, sure! But you don't have the heart of a killer. You've probably never even entertained the idea of stealing from someone, much less ending a life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're a sickening pillar of righteousness, standing tall in a heaven of sinful corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I actually rather like it like this, Matia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Isn't it a good sign that this world is at peace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The mere existence of such a person implies that they've been raised right, in a just world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>A world in which no one has to fight to live... Melvillei has always said that that's what awaits us, one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Well, well. You haven't changed at all, have you, Mesarthim?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I must disagree. Humans are weak. So weak, it practically brings me to tears. Surely you must know this, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm not weak. I'm tough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Are you? I suppose in some ways. But you can be rather soft, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Anyway, since we are here, we might as will fulfill the role we were called upon to play. Let us test whether this generation of humans has inherited the will to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Certainly. I'm quite keen to see how well humans have honed their animal instincts. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>How much have you strayed in your quest to assert your humanity? Let's find out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(This isn't good. That's—)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Nrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Wh-what was that? They...dodged my attack?! How did they get so close to me so quickly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I defended myself with Alchemy. I'm almost sure I did! I clearly blocked that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>But, my left arm... When did they get that hit in?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Ah... Tsk, tsk. Two against one hardly makes this a fair fight, now, does it? Too bad, so sad!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Yes, but he did manage to block my strike. I didn't expect that from a toothpick like him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Really? Then I'll let you handle him. It's much too boring for me to bother with someone who couldn't even perceive my attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I expected better from a member of my beloved Sephira. How the mighty have fallen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>(I can't panic here. I've still got a chance. They're underestimating me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>(The problem is...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Even just one of them is clearly more powerful than I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So what are my options? I'm not sure I have any. I should retreat for now, and live to fight another day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Nnngh?! Another vision?! Are you trying to say something to me? I don't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Taking one's eyes off the opponent? Not so smart, are you, child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Nngh?!</td>
</tr>
