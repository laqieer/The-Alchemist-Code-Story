<td>Dammit! I didn't know Ankh was that skilled! And that wretched woman, too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You're aiming straight for the vitals! That ain't the respectable way to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That stance... That blade technique...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Impossible. You're Najam of the Zalam Gaim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(They say that Najam is the top-ranked assassin in Zalam Gaim and that she's never failed to complete any contract she takes.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I knew she was an assassin, but I didn't realize she was the cream of the crop...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You're Najam, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What's it to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Najam of the Zalam Gaim! I'm making the request for you to kill him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sorry, but I won't take that mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Wh-why?! I'll pay you whatever you want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just pay the assassins of Zalam Gaim and they'll kill anyone you want them to, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're correct.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>However, how would it look if I accepted a contract from someone I had already been contracted to kill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hrk—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>So your target was that man all along...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah. Thanks to you, the target was drawn into an area away from the public eye. I'm lucky you came.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wait a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's it? You aren't even going to try to kill me? That man—my brother—must have put a hit out on me with the Zalam Gaim too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You're a Zalam Gaim assassin. If your group finds out that you just let me go, won't you be in trouble?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's nothing for you to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I only carry out the work issued directly to me. I haven't been assigned to kill you, so I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If I get the order, I'll kill you. That's my job. That's the reason I live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see. For you, that's what doing what you have to do means.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm not someone who ordinarily can respect someone who kills for a living.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But...strangely enough, I get the feeling that you are a surprisingly noble person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Noble? That's the first time someone has ever called me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Did I offend you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No... You didn't, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>This is just the way I live. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You surprise me, too. You live as if you are not the target of assassins across the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Usually someone like that would try to hide a little better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I suppose I'm used to it by now. And the number of assassins coming for me has really gone down lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Quite a number of Zalam Gaim assassins have failed in their attempts to take you out. There was one just the other day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(Ryle must have taken them out before I even realized they were there...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The white sands of this desert are my domain. I won't let anyone kill someone who has come here seeking shelter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of course, it looks like things get complicated when the guildmaster of the Desert Wings is involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But regardless of who the target is, should I get the order, I will complete the job without fail. We'll likely meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I suppose that's just the way things are... I've decided to do what I have to do, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I look forward to seeing you again. As Vice-Captain of the Desert Wings, I'll be sure to show you the appropriate hospitality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>A Vice-Captain won't have the personal time to go looking for anyone in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That which allows you to stand a head above others is not your fortune, but your commitment to the precepts of nobility and dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You mustn't forget. Even if you lose your standing as nobility, you can still live a dignified life as long as you do not forget it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(I wanted to know what he really meant. He was my idol. I thought that if I could understand what it meant to him, I could find my truth and my path forward.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Dignity? Nobility? What does that mean to me now, in this new life?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>(But now I think... I think that's something I get to decide for myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well. I'd better get back to the guild soon. I should tell Ryle that I accept the position of Vice-Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I owe him my life. Whatever dignity or nobility I have, it is worth putting towards supporting him.</td>
</tr>
