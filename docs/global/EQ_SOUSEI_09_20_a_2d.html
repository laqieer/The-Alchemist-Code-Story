<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>We finally did it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We made it through this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We really did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hey, Adaleigh! Fix those clothes! You're looking sloppy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've come so far already, you know. What lies ahead of you should be no big deal at this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I won't be there to pull you out of trouble! You know that, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Icona? You're leaving?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well, I've got one last thing to take care of first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, right. You should hurry to their side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please, do anything you can to save Nimul and Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>And I am ever indebted to you for your support, Lord Kubera.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But of course! Being called to aid in such a situation was an offer I simply could not refuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And being able to test my strength and have this place to hone my skills further, even in death? I could not be happier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That sounds like the Lord Kubera I know, for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There's not much need for change when one is dead. Yet even now, I relish the day that Nimul bested me and took my life. I never felt more alive than I did when I was dying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That is why I answer his call as well. I am certain there is even more I can learn from him about this power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We part ways again here, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It's hard to believe that I'll be continuing to fight even after my passing. Haha! What a tremendous turn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can indulge to my heart's content here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And seeing your skill on the battlefield was a rare treat, as well. But, do not fret! We shall handle matters from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So that was Alchemy. What incredible power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It really was amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hey, Yna? Can you stand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm afraid not. I've used every last bit of energy I had. You?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Absolutely not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Looks like we'll just have to leave the rest to Nimul and his phantom army, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So it would seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What's this? There are magil abnormalities all over the region!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This light... Is that what I think it is, Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Yes. This is my own "Dragon Realm."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It is a sacred art which allows me to share all of the experiences and all of the knowledge I've gained with everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's the quintessence of Alchemy—the great treaty known as the Magna Code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is the world we've been trying to create all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Don't make me laugh. This pallid imitation of the Dragon Realm cannot withstand the crushing force of my will. It is only a matter of time before—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...! You can also summon those who have died?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Of course, they are but phantoms of humans, weak from the start! There is no way they could ever hope to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"Space-Time Manipulation: Ignition!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>"Death at Dawn; Wahrheit!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Those are your companions' techniques!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I am an Alchemist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>And Alchemy is naught but the power that spawns from one's resolve to change this world. It is accessible to anyone with the will to use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>As such, it only stands to reason that I should be able to wield every technique that's heretofore borne the banner of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Using the Dragon Realm to alter the Truth of the world... Even with the tower for aid, the human body should not be able to tolerate such stress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yet you've come to wield your companions' techniques...and further claim that all of Alchemy is at your disposal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>This strongly contradicts all previously accepted concepts of human power limitation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You've thus far only possessed the wisdom to become vessels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What awaits you now is either your human souls being weathered down to nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Or a complete inability for the people to handle such immense power, leading to the absolute destruction of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>As long as humanity exists, I am confident we will learn to wield this power for good and righteous ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We—humans—must choose how to live on our own. I've always believed that to be the only proper path for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We do not need your guidance, Ouroboros. We will create our own tomorrow with our own free will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>An amusing prospect. Show me your resolve, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Show me that you truly have the power to take the future into your own hands. Prove yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Gladly!</td>
</tr>
