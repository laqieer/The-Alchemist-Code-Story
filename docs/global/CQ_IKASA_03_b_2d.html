<td>Grrooooghhh!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(What power... I've never seen the captain fight like this before.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(He's clearing the area and taking down enemies one after another without hesitation.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(The slashing attacks are so strong that there is no chance for the enemy. How incredible the captain is.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(But...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But that's why I also feel danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You have no mercy in taking down enemies. Your powers don't hold you back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(There's no time to think. My duty right now is to take down the enemy in front of me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Groooaaarrr!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>HYAAAAAH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Urgaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Great hit. You did well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you very much. Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Or is it that you sense some camaraderie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>â€¦I'm sorry if I offended you. But I'm not even sure what I'm thinking now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't worry. What you feel is right. Like swinging a double-edged sword. Basically, it means you and I are alike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But it's being able to use the power effectively that will make things right. To move forward, you have to challenge yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You can't just repress the darkness within. You need the strength to reach the darkness as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What do you mean...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There's more to be said about this. But now is not the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If there's one thing I can say, it's that there's truth by looking into the darkness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Okay, so for example, I took you under my wing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you skillfully use your power to the extent that the Holy Guard expects it to be, you will benefit the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That means... This was all deliberate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Possibly so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well... I as a knight choose to shine light for someone important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Someone important...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I...I think I can relate to that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Darkness is so deep that you can't see the bottom by staring into the abyss. You could be engulfed by darkness and lose control of your power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But if you have purpose with your powers, that will not happen to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A purpose for my power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I swear my love and loyalty to you, princess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then, for the sake of that child, you must encourage yourself more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(Ever since I became a member of Button's family, my powers have been used for that child. Other than that, I never had a purpose.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>(But maybe my actions as a knight will lead to good and would affect Button indirectly.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(If so, I'll be able to prove myself as a knight and make Button proud.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Did you find your purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. I think I've found my purpose as a knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Even if it may sound a bit childish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>All for the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It was the only thing I could think for my strength and power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Good to see. You shouldn't have any worrries. Looking forward to where this takes you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm trying my best...at being a knight.</td>
