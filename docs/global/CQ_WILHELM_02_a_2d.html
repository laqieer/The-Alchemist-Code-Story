<td>Ugh, I'm wiped out. I am not looking forward to getting chewed out after all that training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Listen up. You two are still in training. The next time you cause a problem, I'll throw the book at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You might even be stripped of your Paladin status. Don't forget that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And don't forget that if even one of you causes a problem, you both will be held responsible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't believe he went on for so long that everyone else chose their dorm rooms first, and we wound up as roommates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, c'est la vie. Heh, looks like we're really going to get to know each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Good grief. Don't cause any problems for me, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I didn't become a Paladin just to get drawn into your messes and get fired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll do my best. I'll be in trouble if I get fired, too. After all that effort escaping and all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Escaping?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Uh... Never mind that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, why did you become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That came out of nowhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I didn't get a chance to ask you earlier. You said you'd tell me if I won that bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>And since I saw through your little attempt to cheat, that means I win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I never agreed to that. But fine. It's not like it's a big secret or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The reason I became a Paladin is because I could do more Alchemy research if I joined the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nothing, just that it really wasn't a funny reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You thought it would be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's really just because you like Alchemy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Yup, that's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alchemy is interesting. The fact that it's got limitless possibilities is exciting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh. Well, I guess that's a good enough reason. But still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What'll you get from researching Alchemy? Hasn't it been pretty well researched already? Seems kind of pointless to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What'll you even get out of doing that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Pointless? Hmph. Maybe you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You might spend your life on it only to wind up with nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>But it'll still be my life. I'll get to live my life doing what I like even if it was pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, what about you? Why did you become a Paladin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>My mom was a kind person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We lived in the cursed country of Lustburg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In a country where women were generally valued above men, she was always kind, desperately loved me, and feared I might become a bug.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I felt that the pity at the heart of that desperation and kindness rendered it all empty, and became child who was unfilial and difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But as a person myself, I have to interact with other people in order to survive, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So I became a Paladin. It was the fastest way for someone like me born in that country to start interacting with other humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That's it. Pretty boring, right? That's why I said it wasn't worth talking about. It just makes you sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's all meaningless. Which is why I don't take anything seriously and do what I want. You have to have fun in the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Pointless? Hmph. Maybe you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But it'll still be my life. I'll get to live my life doing what I like even if it was pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Man, I just had the worst dream. I should not have taken that nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Magnus is...not back yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Is he messing with the senior knights again? He's always telling me off about it, but he gets tired of pretending to be good after just a few days too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That or he's in the research lab. He's gotten pretty interested in something recently that's got him all fired up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That aside, it's still pretty late for him. He usually returns just before lights out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Now that I think about it, the knights he was messing with before were making a racket earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>(The library will be closed at this time. The only places open right now are the training grounds and the lab... He's probably in the lab.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>(But if he's really in trouble with those knights, that'll be a real problem.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Great, I was right. He's really getting into it with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>You're a cocky twerp. Don't get all puffed up just because they're calling you a research genius even though you're new.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Alchemic research is for captains. Anything you do is pointless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>How mean. Picking on your juniors just because you lost a little at cards isn't a good habit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Besides, I'm the one that'll decide whether it's pointless or not. It's none of your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What you say doesn't matter. Research is the only reason why I joined the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(What's up with him getting so mad over something that's probably meaningless?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(Why is he...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Looks like you won't learn until you get hurt, so we'll just have to teach you a lesson right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Oh, you're all having fun without me. I wanna play, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Why are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If we're both going to get in trouble if just one of us gets in trouble, I might as well join in on the fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You really are a troublemaker, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm going to take that as permission to do what I was going to do anyway.</td>
