<td>It seems like you guys are too inadequate to handle my love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is where your life ends. I will not allow you to cause any more misfortune in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>St-stop! Don't get any closer...I'll cut this doll!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You! How dare you hold the doll of "that man" hostage! You coward! Hey, don't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you being...serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Of course! That doll is really important to me! It's both family and friend to me!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If so, why bring it with you into battle?! If it really is family...then why did you place it in that scum's care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He-hey, shut up! Who are you calling a scum?! Also, both of you, stop ignoring me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I'm taking the doll back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Agh...owww...! So, your carelessness was intentional...tsk! You'll regret that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, that was out of character...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's important to have something to hold onto. I know that well. Still, I'm surprised you picked up on my movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, I assumed you were playing your own version of "hard to get"♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It really all is some kind of romantic game for you, isn't it? You're a real piece of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's that man's doing. He made it explode so that we wouldn't be able to chase after him. Still, the Demon has been prevented from entering the market.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Aswald, what are you doing?! Let's go! If you hang around observing the Demon, you'll be buried alive!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Stop ordering me around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm not ordering you or instructing you! I'm worried about you! Come on! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...I see. You're right. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now...all that's left is to finish off that man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wait. Did you think I'd let you do that? You seem to have forgotten, but I still happen to be his bodyguard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right...I forgot about that!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A little too shallow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh... Well, you're still no match for "that man," but you were able to handle quite a bit of my love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That man? Are you talking about that doll?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. It happened when I was fighting against the Envylia soldiers as a mercenary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The moment I tried to take out the commander..."that man" appeared...with his rippling muscles and that scar across his face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, wait... Is this going to be a long story?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Heheh. Did you let your guard down? I finally managed to get you from behind♪ I guess playing hard to get finally paid off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So, you imitated me in order to invite my attack...yet, you still have a lot to learn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...? My body...it's numb...I...can't move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It seems like the poison is finally taking effect. You purposely allowed me to inflict that wound, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My mission was to conceal the existence of the Demon...and to take out that man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You were not part of my mission. You knew I wouldn't kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>All I did was place a little trust in that "efficiency" of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Besides...you want that man eliminated as well, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...Well, I would prefer if more orphans like me didn't show up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...I see. You as well, huh? What's your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm surprised you're interested in me... I'm Dorothea. Next time, I'm gonna beat, Aswald♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...Next time we meet, I won't go easy on you...Dorothea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sigh... Playing hard to get, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I guess you can't judge a book by its cover. There are those who fight and live like she does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...Hehe. This is the first time I'm giving a girl's name to one of my dolls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well then...let's see if I can regain my mobility before the shop closes!</td>
