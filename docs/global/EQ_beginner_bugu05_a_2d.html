<td>Do you understand so far? By the way, the current technology on the continent only allows you to evolve until 5★.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All right, from here I'm going to give a little more advanced lessons that are important for becoming stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>According to a unit's Limit Break Count, the number of pieces of gear that are equippable increases.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>At first, all units can equip one piece of gear. Limit Breaking 10 times allows two, and 25 times allows three pieces of gear to be equipped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In other words, a unit can equip a maximum of three pieces of gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Also, there are three different types of gear. Weapons, Armor, and Accessories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I mentioned this at the beginning, but the gear chooses the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Some gear items are special and can only be equipped by specific Jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>There's no point in someone who fights with a sword carrying a gun, right? In other words, a sword-fighting Job should carry a sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Also, I said you can use a maximum of three pieces of gear, but you can only equip one Weapon and one Armor each.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You can equip up to three accessories. However, you can't equip gear with the same name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>No making your repertoire Doll, Doll, and Doll. You can't do that and it's just too cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>When two pieces of gear have the same effect, only the stronger one will have an effect, so no duplicate effects can be used. Use caution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>For example: if an HP +100 Armor and HP +50 Weapon are equipped, the HP +100 effect will be prioritized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well then, from here I'll teach you the about the strength of gear. In other words, your gear's true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Depending on the gear you use, some have special powers. Those are the gear with souls.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If you equip these, you can use their special skills. These can range from Magic to Recover, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>For example: even if your Job doesn't have a Recovery Skill, you will be able to use that skill when using certain gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This may allow you to drastically change and improve. Although, on the flip end, it's not your regular skill, so it can sometimes consume more Jewels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Amongst those, there is gear specified for certain units. If a unit uses one of these, it will serve them well in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Such gear is powerful. Depending on the user, it can allow a powerful Gear Ability to be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>There is a noticeable difference in strength between units that can and cannot use Gear Abilities. You should try testing it out in the Arena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Phew...I'm not really this talkative usually, so I'm a bit tired now... Well then, let's try to evolve to 5★.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In order to evolve to 5★, gear needs to be at Lv 25. Also, it requires 100 Moon Star Armor Shards.</td>
