<td>002</td>
<td>Oh, looks like there's going to be a festival!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Fons, Reeves—stay close to me, all right?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Grr.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lots of people are gonna need to take hangover-prevention meds beforehand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>All because they have to go work the next day! Poor adults.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It'd be better if they just didn't drink so much that they needed to take the medicine, but what would I know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Welcome!</td>

<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A bottle of hangover-prevention, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That'll be 800 Zeni.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?! Not 600?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We had a bad harvest for the herb we need for the medicine, so we had to bump up the price a little. You know how it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uh-oh! But the village mayor only gave me 600 Zeni...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aw, man. I just don't have enough. I'll be right back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>All right. Sorry about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yah done, kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh! Uhh... Yeah!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh! Sorry for staring.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No, no. I am impressed that you have tamed some Tigferes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You know about Tigferes, Mister? Haha, these two are my family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Really? Well, well. That is impressive. Perhaps I might even be inspired enough to lend you the remaining money you need for that medicine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa! You'd lend money to a stranger, just like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thanks for the offer, Sir, but I'm good. I'll just come back later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Alright, then. If you say so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yep. Well, I'm gonna head out now. Bye!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whew. This seems like a good place for Fons and Reeves to cool off, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>C'mon, Fons! Reeves! Let's share this kebab I picked up from that food stall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Grrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I've been looking for some exotic animals like these. I don't suppose I could take them off your hands?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I bet creatures as magnificent as these could learn at least one trick... I think I could make better use of them than you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Excuse me? There's no way I'd hand them over to you! Fons and Reeves are my family!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey. I saw them first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh yeah? How about I show you my fist in your⁠—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>G-Gormalas?! What're you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You're Gormalas, the infamous pirate?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Tch! Noisy brat. Pipe down and let me deal with the problem at hand first!</td>
