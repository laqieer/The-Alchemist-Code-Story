<td>Kaya... Why are you so interested in ruins and ancient texts? Why did you want to be an archeologist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's the only thing that can satisfy my curiosity. To put it another way...I don't feel attached to anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Even I think that's a troublesome trait...but it's fine. There is value in staying objective and observing from the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's the complete opposite of your way of thinking. You're always trying to embody the justice of the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right. That's because that's what Cadanova and I were trying to achieve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then you should leave. If you leave now, you can still make it back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I know that, but still...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You don't need to take responsibility for this. This is something I want to do. I told you that you should keep facing forward, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I won't disappear...like Cadanova did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I should say it clearly. You... You're afraid of losing me... Isn't that right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's... That's not true!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Can you really say that? You understand your duty and what you truly want to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And yet you're still following me. You know what I mean. I know you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's all right. I won't disappear. I'm just trying to walk a different path from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I see... That's something you need to witness and understand for yourself in order to move forward...isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I didn't realize until now the shadow that losing Cadanova cast on your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your stubbornness really is troublesome...but I think that's just how you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>However, it is something that you must overcome as Lord Commander. Although, I am sure you know that better than anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I pray that you find that understanding within yourself soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Hehe. It really isn't like me to lecture. Let's hurry, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I've got a long way to go. I'm still not even as good as Cadanova once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yauras... What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Lord Zain?! With Kaya...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Training alone? You've always been so ardent, Yauras.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>N-no, this isn't what it...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don't tell me... You're not always training when you're not out on a mission, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My blades could never touch Cadanova...and now he's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I have to at least surpass the Cadanova I fought that day. If I can't, then I'm not as magnificent as they say at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is promising. You're trying to move forward, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yauras...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Are the two of you...on a mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>That's right. We're in the middle of a very important mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yauras... Will you bout with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>With you, Lord Zain? What's this all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm the man who fought Cadanova as his equal. I'm sure there's no one better for you to test yourself against.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Zain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see... Lord Zain, would you do me the honor of sparring with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Of course. If you're trying to move forward, I want to support you with everything I have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But not as your Lord Commander. Yauras... Let us fight as the friends who sparred at the volcano!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I understand! All right... Zain, here I go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heheh, they both have such fire. I suppose I'm a spectator, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Come, Yauras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hyaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
