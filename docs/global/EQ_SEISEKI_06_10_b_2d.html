<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Y-you're strong!<br>I can't believe you were concealing such power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Is that all you have? Do you really think you can carry Excalibur with such mediocrity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I suppose Lord Zahar could have truly been the righteous inheritor of Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ugh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're wondering about Monzein and Seida?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Both of them died in vain, putting their lives on the line for your sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?!<br>Seida and Captain Monzein are dead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes. They were getting in my way, so I eliminated them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>With your degree of power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>you could not save Kagura and your comrades, let alone the people of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I will take Excalibur from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I will show you that I can save everyone! Kagura, my dear comrades, and all suffering people in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What makes you believe that you can actually say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Lord Zain's, Captain Cadanova's, and many of my comrades' hopes are on this sword!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I am supported by all of their wishes.<br>I will not hesitate any longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do you mean to say you can open a path into the future with sheer willpower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I do! After all, that is my strongest weapon! I won't run away any longer!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Double Edged Execution!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Alchemia Nova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ughh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I-is this your true power, the power that stopped Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Since everybody's hopes are resting on my shoulders, I cannot allow myself to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-I'm happy that I got to talk to you.<br>Now... please finish me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Excalibur is meant for saving people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's not meant for meaninglessly hurting people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>W-what do you mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That should be my question to you. Why don't I feel any intention to kill in your attacks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You will never be able to turn yourself into a true avenger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Also, you didn't truly kill Seida and Captain Monzein, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Could you please explain to me your reasons for that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This whole time, I've been serving Lord Zahar, whom I greatly adore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There was something I noticed by always being by his side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I noticed that his ambitions grew more inflated by the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And little by little, his heart became absorbed by the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But I wasn't able to stop Lord Zahar when he chose the wrong path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>My words could not reach him.<br>And then, that day came...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You mean, the day that we stood against Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Right. Of course, that's where he lost his life. Part of me did feel like holding grudges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But more significantly, I felt gratitude towards you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? Gratitude?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I always continued adoring Lord Zahar, and I didn't want to see his further deterioration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You two fulfilled that earnest wish of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And that really made me feel like getting to know you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I started wondering what could be the difference between us, since you two had been able to stop Lord Zahar where I couldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But... I feel like standing against you in battle like this made me understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I feel like you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>With the help of Excalibur, you should be able to save people like Lord Zahar, who chose the wrong path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You are truly the one who should wield the Holy Sword Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Spica...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>T-the earth is still trembling?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Kanon! This is really bad! Take Chloe with you and evacuate yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>The dark energies from Guren Blade have triggered the volcano!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ramproad Mountain's fault line started moving, in desire for the dark energies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It wouldn't be too strange if the mountain started spewing magma any time soon, so hurry up!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>D-do you mean it could be erupting?! If a huge mountain like this were to erupt...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>We don't have time to think about consequences! Just get yourselves out of here for now!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>This mountain's fault line started moving in desire for the dark energies?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes, probably!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>It is said that when my ancestors originally crafted Guren Blade, it also caused the volcano to erupt in desire for the dark energies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>So... would that mean that this fault line could possibly calm back down again after sending down large amounts of dark energy into them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Theoretically, I guess.<br>But we really don't have time to be standing about here, so get yourself out of here already!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No... it's probably going to be okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Let us go, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Spica?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Kanon, I would really like you to turn your ideals into reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Spica?!<br>Don't tell me you're heading towards the crater!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Stop! Don't go with her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Have you forgotten already?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The future of the world is resting on your shoulders! If you were to die here, who could possibly lead the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ugh! B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Kanon! I'm sure you have it in you to stop the spiral of suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Please use your powers to build a world where people don't get lost in sorrow like I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Whoaaaaaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Spica!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Uhh!<br>Whah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Huh? The trembling seems to be calming down! Could she have truly calmed down the fault line?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Geez, Zahar must have had massive amounts of dark energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Seida?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I'm sorry, we got a little held up.<br>I know it's really unreasonable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Seida, please!<br>Please save Spica!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Spica headed towards the crater to stop the volcano from erupting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Are you seriously asking us to do such an unreasonable thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I suppose the volcano is happy enough with Zahar's malicious soul alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh man, that was hot. I was about to get caught into the magma with this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Spica!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Oh my, that lady sure has a way of escaping danger. And you too, for that matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Phuh! Well, I never thought the day would come that I'd be saving a follower of Zahar. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Seeing the chivalry in this fellow knight who was considering the fate of the world, I couldn't possibly let her go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>...Right!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>So... is Spica alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Don't worry, she merely lost consciousness. I put her to rest along with Chloe inside the sanctuary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Thank goodness.<br>Thank you, Seida.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>More importantly...<br>I just hope we're not too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Hey, please don't say such an ill omened thing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Don't worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>This is the first chance for the new Excalibur to prove its worth. Put your spirit into it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Excalibur, please bring Kagura back to us safely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...Kaguraaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>T-there's some kind of shape...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Hey... are you sure you didn't mess up the way you cut it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Uh...<br>K-Kanon...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Kagura!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Oh... right... I got trapped into Captain Othima's Philosopher's Stone in Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>A-are you really Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Captain Monzein...<br>Why are you staring at me like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>W-well, it's just...<br>I guess... you've grown up quite a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>...You foolish boar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Hmm... Hey, what about Lord Zain? I remember that Kudanstein came...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...!<br>Oh, right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Well... a lot happened while you were sleeping. We'll have plenty of time to fill you in later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Okay...<br>Yawnnn... Sorry...<br>I feel like sleeping just a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Anyway, we did it!!!<br>Miuna, thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>What are you talking about?<br>You have only yourself to thank for all of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Ahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Well... I suppose we could take a breath of relief for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Right! It would be wonderful if the other captains also returned to us now though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>At this point, I suppose I could tell you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>I don't know about Captain Kudanstein, but... Captain Yauras and Captain Othima never left the Holy Guard, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>They're just investigating Greed Dike right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I didn't say anything until now, because I didn't want to distract you from Excalibur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Both of them are still acting for the sake of the Holy Guard, just like before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>R-really?!<br>Thank goodness!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>H-hey, wait a second!<br>I never heard about that either!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>You wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face in front of Kanon, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>So I thought it was reasonable to just keep it secret altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I see! I'm relieved!<br>Thank you, Seida!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You don't seem too surprised though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Well... that's because I always kept believing in them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Hehe... I see.<br>Well, why don't we head back then... Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>...Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>U-urghhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Chloe!<br>Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Y-yeah...<br>Well... I noticed Spica sleeping next to me though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>D-does this mean...<br>that everything turned out well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Yes! Look, we even managed to get Kagura back unscathed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>She does look a little different though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I see... thank goodness.<br>H-hey, could I just make one request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>What would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Well... Would you mind informing Lord Vettel about my involvements here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Geez, Chloe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Many truths were whispered into my ear, and many truths met a pitiful end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Among all these waves of truth, flowing like a big river, that one man's face stood out above all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>His words caught my attention more than anything else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>I need to confirm these truths he spoke of with my own eyes!</td>
</tr>
