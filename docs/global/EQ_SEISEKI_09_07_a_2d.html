<td>N-no...! I can't even sense the bombardment... How is that possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I can't sense the bullets? I can't even hear the onslaught, let alone the vibration of it buzzing through the air?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No...! This is all wrong!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wha-wahh! Whaaa!</td>

<td>No! Your mind is taking over your body! At this rate, your life really is in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No...it's not just Kanon. Soon a large number of the soldiers will lose consciousness. There's no time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>In order to remedy this situation, I need to attack the conjurer and stop this hallucination!</td>

<td>No...calm down...it's going to be okay. You're just hallucinating. I'm going to find the conjurer.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This violent flaming wind...and the constant hail of bullets...is all intended to distract me from thinking clearly.</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I cannot give in. I need to hold on to my mental strength.</td>

<td>Huff...huff...haa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Kanon...I promise to protect you...even if I have to do it on my own. I'll protect everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We survived just now. If we'd been trying to make it on our own, we would've been dragged into the bottom of the valley by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I told you before. As knights, protecting each other is a given.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Besides...thanks to that, I've gotten much closer to the 4th Regiment. Um...how do you say...? You did well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...! That's rare for you to give me such an honest compliment, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Do-don't misunderstand me! It's not that I'm admitting you were right. I'm just exchanging niceties. That's basic chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Honestly...you're such a stubborn person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's a joke. I was the one who was stubborn. I'm the one that should thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>At that time...I was truly happy to have been accepted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Because of those words from the captain, I was able to believe in myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yes...I need to have confidence in myself! Captain Monzein accepted me as a knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I have it in me to find the conjurer at all costs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ack...! For one second...if only the wind would stop for one second!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?! Projectiles, too?! Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It doesn't work! ...Ack! You've gotta be kidding me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I cannot die without helping my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I can't afford to go out like this!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Lightning...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>No... I finally found you. You're one of the Templars, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Very impressive, Captain Seida. I am one of the Veda Templars...FÃ¼ry, the Gatling Curse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
