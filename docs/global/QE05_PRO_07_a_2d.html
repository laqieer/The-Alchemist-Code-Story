<td>Where is the intruder?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We've sealed every corridor, but we still haven't found her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Urgh... That woman has some sort of mystical power! We have to think outside the box to catch her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>

<td>Found her! Over here—grk!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Stop! We've got you surrounded! Seize her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>She jumped out the freaking window?! Quick, we need to send soldiers after her!</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Where'd she...? Impossible! There should be no way to get around the blockades!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>She'll head to the border! Send more soldiers to bulk up the defense on the wall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(Something's not right.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... There it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Insolent girl! How dare you defy the authority of Greed Dike?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Your blasphemy is unforgivable! You have earned the wrath of the great Sun King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(What is this sensation? I feel uneasy...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What a peculiar thing to say. I, Zechs, would be very grateful if you might elaborate on what you mean by that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You...! Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Urgh! I-it's just a dust cloud, push through! Don't let her escape! Kill her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(This, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To be honest, this is child's play compared to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Beast Art Evocations! Book One, Ophiuchus!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She allowed herself to be swallowed whole...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No! She intends to escape beyond our walls! After her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>(Here, too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>

<td>Thank you, Orochi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Maybe I'm overthinking it... I must...hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm impressed. You managed to steal the Mikaboshi from right under the noses of all those Greed Dike soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Who's there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Really, how short-sighted can you be? Did you really think it would be that easy to make it out of here alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Edgar L. Leonhart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Your end game leaves a lot to be desired. It's like you're not even trying to escape death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Edgar?! Don't tell me you've become loyal to the Sun King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Loyal to...? Don't be ridiculous! I'm the only one who decides when to pull the trigger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Then...you always planned to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You just couldn't lie low, could you?! Go to hell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Again...? Why must our noble will be defied yet again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Nevertheless, this sorrow...will not be forgotten. It will be passed down through generations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Even if this life is to come to an end...the flames of this soul will...never...die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nnrk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'd really appreciate it if you could pass that message on to your so-called Sun King.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I told you! Death was chasing you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You didn't even try to run! Unbelievable. Just muttering about "the flames of this soul" instead, like you had all the time in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I-I was just—forget it! It's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Here they are! Found 'em!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Ah, crap. This is why we need to lie low! Why do you just never listen?! Come on, jump on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Do you want to get caught?! Get on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Nnnrgh... G-get...them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Ha! You wish! Just try and catch us with the wind on our side! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm not seeing any of our pursuers... Looks like we're in the clear for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Hey, so... I wasn't expecting anything over the top or whatnot, but...I mean, I did save your life. A "Thank you!" might be nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>How strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This is all going better than I expected. Almost too well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Wh-what is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>It is said that the Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance of power has been disrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The disruption of that power balance will cause the founders of Alchemy to descend upon this world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>N-no...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What's happening? You okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>P-please... Keep...gura...from...the...kaboshi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>No... No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Noooooooooooooooooo!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What?! What should I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>G-get...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Get out of my sight! Get away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I can't do that. I'm not the kind of guy that can just ignore a woman's tears. That's part of my code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I don't need your pity! These aren't my tears!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>What? What are you even saying? Those right there are definitely tears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You're wrong! These are just—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Look, I didn't just save you out of the goodness of my heart, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I accidentally made a big show out of it, but I'm also thinking about whether or not you're planning to use the Mikaboshi for ill-gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Are you saying you refuse to do as I request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Then I have no choice but to remove you by force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you serious? Is this really necessary?!</td>
</tr>
