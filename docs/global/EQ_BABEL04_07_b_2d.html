<td>How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Aaaaahh?!</td>

<td>How are you so kind? You've always been like that, even when we were young.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You just endure all the pain without uttering a single complaint.</td>

<td>What...are you...saying?!</td>

<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Fight me, Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Release the tension...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Release it just as one might spin a top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If I can spin the top just right...</td>

<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I can bring joy to my brother the same way he brought happiness to me.</td>

<td>You're so terrible at hiding your true feelings... How could I fail to notice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Seriously, man. Worst ninja ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Keeping your story straight is subterfuge 101.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Anyway... Yomi, he wants you to move on. He did all this because he's your doting big brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So, the past has finally come to light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I suppose, it could have been worse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I've always wanted to...unload all this...baggage...off of my shoulders, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>No... Please, Jin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Let's...make a wish...on a shooting star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>A...? What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Let's wish...on a shooting star...that we'll be able to protect...Wada...tsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>To...ge...ther.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The night sky...sure is beautiful, don't you...think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I...do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>My wish...is that we...will be able to look up...at this sky...together...forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Oh...</td>

<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Ah!</td>

<td>086</td>
<td>Jin, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>N-no. No... Aaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Jin!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>When I grow up, I'll protect you, brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You don't need to do that, Yomi. I am sure that I will be able to keep both you and Wadatsumi from coming to harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I don't wanna be protected all the time! I wanna help, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I know. You're a hard worker. You'll probably become far stronger than me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>That's right! I am a hard worker! I'll get way stronger than you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>So it's a promise. Let's protect Wadatsumi together, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>All right. I promise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I mean it! Don't forget you promised!</td>
