<td>Huff...huff... We're finally...here! This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Trial Ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Phew... That said, we've been fighting non-stop to reach here, and I'm—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Exhausted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ca-Captain Vettel!</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>N-n-not me! She's the only one who's exhausted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm Chloe from the 1st Rank, and I remained filled with vigor and energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hey! That's not fair! I'm Kanon, and I'm filled with energy as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Seriously? You've been out of breath all this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's going on here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Eeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ohhh...it's the Flame Dragon King!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If you're here to play, then go back now. It's not going to be easy from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I-I'm...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Knights, fall in line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is the Trial Ruins, where you will undergo your final trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Your actions from now will determine whether you will become a Paladin or not. Understood?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I-it's finally begun! Our final trial! All right, let's go, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ye-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Cadanova...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Let's wait and see for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hm? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Who would've thought a wimp like you would end up becoming the captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey, come on now. I'd say the same about you. We used to call you Mininova. Now, you're the captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Come to think of it, we met at a joint training similar to this one 20 years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah. I remember those days we were both aiming to become Paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Now, here we are, following separate paths. How strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I still believe that, with your amount of talent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Cadanova. Don't you remember what I told you that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm aiming for a world without Alchemy. I believe that power alone will not lead to true peace. My thinking hasn't changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
