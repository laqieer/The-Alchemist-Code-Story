<td>Emma!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Haaaahmmn... What do you want? I was having such a great nap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you mean what do I want? What are you doing?! Don't you know class is in session?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But I finished all my assignments, and I'm so freaking bored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You need to read the textbook and review the lesson just like everybody else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>And look at your uniform! Your skirt's too short! You're wearing too much makeup! You need to focus more on your studies instead of—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Looking this cute? I thought witches were supposed to be alluring!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That does not excuse you from breaking school regulations! Why must you be like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your performance and test scores are excellent, but you are sorely lacking in manners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Lacking...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You need to take yourself more seriously!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm sure you had to work hard to become a scholarship student. Why can't you act more appropriately? You're embarrassing yourself in front of your classmates!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(Aw, come on. Do I really have to act all goody-goody just because I'm here on a scholarship?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>(My grades are some of the best. I really don't think she has to tell me off like this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, my. You look quite displeased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Professor, isn't the next class about to begin? I can take over lecturing her if you'd like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Goodness gracious, look at the time! Well, if you wouldn’t mind, Ms. Celine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Not at all. Now, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We’re finally alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't be scared. I’ve been wanting to have a little chat with you for a while now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>And why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well... You stand out from all the other students. They're all so earnest and diligent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You’re the only one with any nerve. Devil-may-care, that’s what you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah, I guess. They're all goody two-shoes, aren't they? I can see how I'm kinda out of place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But it can't be helped. Hard work and effort and all that crap just isn’t my thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Oh, really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(She's not like the other teachers. It's like she can see right through me... I don't like this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Anyway, Emma... How would you feel about helping me with my research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Research?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>You’ll be paid, of course. I find your magical aptitude to be very valuable indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Your other attributes are also very...stirring. Hehehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(E-eww...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>So, what exactly is it that you want me to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Various things. Organizing files, cleaning, tending to the monsters I keep for research...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now and again I might also ask you to recapture escaped monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Urgaahhh!</td>
