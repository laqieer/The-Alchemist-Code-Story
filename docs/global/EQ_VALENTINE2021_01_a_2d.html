</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Hmm? Well, I am a little curious, but... It's just not something ordinary citizens can get their hands on, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Ugh. Yeah, don't remind me. The distribution of Rainbow Cacao is strictly monitored and controlled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Oh, but if it's for you, Lizzy, I can try to make sure some of it gets out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>It would be better if you didn't. The powers that be have exclusive purchasing rights over Rainbow Cacao. It's very much banned from public wholesale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Aw, c'mon! You know I was just joking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>I should hope so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I'm actually rather surprised you came out here directly to get this stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>We tend to feel uneasy until all the Rainbow Cacao is securely in our hands. We've had incidences in the past where deliveries were stolen just before we could retrieve them, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>There are still many in town whose...curiosity, shall we say, about these infamous beans is strong enough that they would undoubtedly make such an attempt even now, given the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Curiosity, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>And all this despite the inherent danger. We really must take steps to reinforce our regulations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>I, for one, disagree. I think the current laws regarding Rainbow Cacao are far too strict, even as they stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>We can't even distribute it to witches who intend to use it for research!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage B</td>
<td>If we make the rules any stricter, the black market for it will only slip farther underground, making its distribution even harder to monitor than it already is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>I grant that that's a possibility, but it's certainly no cause to tempt fate by giving people easy access to such dangerous materials. Surely you can see that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>Whoa, now! This debate is getting a little heated. Let's all take a deep breath and calm down, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Ah... Our apologies. That was most unbecoming of us indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>Not at all! You're both just trying to look out for the best interests of your citizens. You only came to a head because of how much you care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Indeed. Although you may disagree on matters of policy, you both argued your stances for the sake of the people. It speaks highly to your characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>For what it's worth, as a merchant myself, I can't say I'm particularly happy about all these regulations. These used to just be run-of-the-mill magical components, after all. Now they're practically taboo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>When the government suddenly forbade all sales of them... Well, let's just say my bottom line had definitely seen better days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>It is easy to see why the laws were enacted, though. Rainbow Cacao is potent to the point of being potentially very dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>Especially Purple Cacao. Just a tiny bit of it is strong enough to charm humans and monsters alike, and even the smell of it can get you feeling intoxicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Really? I didn't realize it was so potent. It's such a shame I can't use any for my medicines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Enough chit-chat. Our job is to guard all of this and make sure nothing bad happens to it, so let's get to guarding, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>Right. We have to make sure Valentine's Day doesn't get waylaid by anything or anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage C</td>
<td>Excuse me for the interruption, but it seems another individual has fallen ill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Another one? And with the same symptoms? Have we confirmed if they've ingested the same thing as the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage C</td>
<td>Yes. It appears they purchased it from the same vendor, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Everyone who's eating stuff from the same place is getting sick? That doesn't sound good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>My, my! What could they have ingested? Perhaps it wasn't food, but medicine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Elizabeth. I...don't mean anything by this, but just to be absolutely certain, you wouldn't happen to have anything to do with this incident, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Hmm? What do you mean? How could I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/itsu.png" alt="Itsuki" height="128"><br>Itsuki</td>
<td>You know—that stuff you were making yesterday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Ohh, that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about that. I did make some medicine yesterday, but it wasn't enough to spread around. Rest assured, I had no hand in this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Good. I'm glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Of course Lizzy wouldn't be the one behind it! She would never make anything that would hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>(It could certainly have some nasty side effects, though... But that's beside the point!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>She only makes medicine to help people. In fact, it was her medicine that brought me back from the brink of death ages ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Exactly. Yesterday's medicine was an energy booster; nothing more. It does have a tendency to make you sweat chocolate, but that's a small price to pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>I really don't know how to feel about that... But if Elizabeth's medicine isn't what's causing people to get sick, then what is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>Rainbow Cacao, naturally. Everyone who has fallen ill did so after eating chocolate made from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>What?! But what of the ban on distribution we were only just speaking of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>As my colleague insinuated, there exists a black market from which one can procure the cacao in secret. Based on our investigations, we believe its base of operations to be somewhere near the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage C</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt again, but I'm afraid things have gone from bad to worse! I've just received word that someone else has become sick as well, in just this short time. We must return immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Court Mage A</td>
<td>I will have to call our conversation here, it seems, as I must see to these patients. I'm counting on you all to give your best effort in guarding the materials. Do take care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>So there's a literal black market, then? Something must be done about that, and soon! Things could easily spiral out of control very quickly if it's left unattended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I'm happy to look into it. I can do some market research on how to deregulate sales, while I'm there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Are you really willing to go so far just for Elizabeth's sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Hehe! Of course! You'd be so happy if I could help do something to relax those distribution laws, wouldn't you, Lizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>You really are something else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Besides that, though, I have some personal qualms over how tightly regulated Rainbow Cacao has become. It just...rubs me the wrong way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I understand that Purple Cacao is dangerous because it can attract monsters, but is it really fair for all the other varieties to be lumped into the same ban? There are so many uses for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>And so many people who want them. The demand is ever present. And it is, after all, a merchant's job to meet her customers' demands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>The court mages even confirmed this, stating curiosity from the general populace as a reason for the increased risk of robbery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I have. And that's why I think it would be best to confirm these illicit sales with my very own eyes! It's my duty as a merchant, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>I could sure use some help, though! Perhaps you'd care to join me, Caris? I would so appreciate the assistance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>What? Why me?! We've barely just begun the job we were hired for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Why don't you ask Elizabeth for help, since you love her so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>What are you even saying? How could I possibly bother Lizzy with something like this? It's preposterous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>But I'm fair game?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Come on! Please? If I really find any Rainbow Cacao at the black market and have to confiscate it, I'll need a way to transport it, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Your motorbike would be the perfect thing for that. I bet with how fast you can go, we'd be in and out of there in no time at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/chal.png" alt="Caris" height="128"><br>Caris</td>
<td>Fine. You win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leafa.png" alt="Leafah" height="128"><br>Leafah</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about things here. We'll guard the Rainbow Cacao and hold down the fort while you're gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Thanks so much! Lizzy, I'm going to head out for a bit, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Are you, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/eliz.png" alt="Elizabeth" height="128"><br>Elizabeth</td>
<td>Well, why don't I go with you, after all? I'm quite curious about the Rainbow Cacao myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/marg.png" alt="Margaret" height="128"><br>Margaret</td>
<td>Really? You'll come with me?! Hooray! This is going to be so much fun! Let's not waste a moment, then; come on, team!</td>
</tr>
