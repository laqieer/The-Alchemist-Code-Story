<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>The whole town decked out in Valentine's decorations, and every woman in sight turning to a young girl at heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This is the best! Everyone's going to be so much looser with their purse strings; I just know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm glad you're excited, but remember, we've got a job to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>She's right. We can't let our guards down, especially not with all the problems surrounding the Rainbow Cacao that have been occurring around here since Valentine's season started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We have to do our best to keep this contraband in check so everyone will be able to enjoy the holiday safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah, I know! Speaking of the Rainbow Cacao, though, where even is it? You were the ones who brought it last time, weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, right. This time, it's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Gangway! Comin' through!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All right, here you go! This should be all of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I can't believe you were able to get to Lustburg from the fields so quickly! And with all this cacao in tow, no less... You're amazing, Caris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you talking about? It took me forever to get here. I'm not supposed to floor it for delivery jobs, and I gotta tell you, I get really antsy when I can't speed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You were still going quite fast, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Right, so, anyway, this is the infamous Rainbow Cacao, huh? Interesting, interesting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>This really is some high-quality stuff. I wonder if there's a way I could get permission to sell some of it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh, my, is that really it? I bet I could use it to make medicine. Do you mind if I have a peek as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I had no idea you were interested in cacao, Lizzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hmm? Well, I am a little curious, but... It's just not something ordinary citizens can get their hands on, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ugh. Yeah, don't remind me. The distribution of Rainbow Cacao is strictly monitored and controlled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, but if it's for you, Lizzy, I can try to make sure some of it gets out there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It would be better if you didn't. The powers that be have exclusive purchasing rights over Rainbow Cacao. It's very much banned from public wholesale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Aw, c'mon! You know I was just joking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I should hope so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm actually rather surprised you came out here directly to get this stuff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>We tend to feel uneasy until all the Rainbow Cacao is securely in our hands. We've had incidences in the past where deliveries were stolen just before we could retrieve them, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>There are still many in town whose...curiosity, shall we say, about these infamous beans is strong enough that they would undoubtedly make such an attempt even now, given the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Curiosity, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And all this despite the inherent danger. We really must take steps to reinforce our regulations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I, for one, disagree. I think the current laws regarding Rainbow Cacao are far too strict, even as they stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We can't even distribute it to witches who intend to use it for research!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If we make the rules any stricter, the black market for it will only slip farther underground, making its distribution even harder to monitor than it already is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I grant that that's a possibility, but it's certainly no cause to tempt fate by giving people easy access to such dangerous materials. Surely you can see that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Whoa, now! This debate is getting a little heated. Let's all take a deep breath and calm down, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ah... Our apologies. That was most unbecoming of us indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Not at all! You're both just trying to look out for the best interests of your citizens. You only came to a head because of how much you care.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Indeed. Although you may disagree on matters of policy, you both argued your stances for the sake of the people. It speaks highly to your characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>For what it's worth, as a merchant myself, I can't say I'm particularly happy about all these regulations. These used to just be run-of-the-mill magical components, after all. Now they're practically taboo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When the government suddenly forbade all sales of them... Well, let's just say my bottom line had definitely seen better days.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It is easy to see why the laws were enacted, though. Rainbow Cacao is potent to the point of being potentially very dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Especially Purple Cacao. Just a tiny bit of it is strong enough to charm humans and monsters alike, and even the smell of it can get you feeling intoxicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Really? I didn't realize it was so potent. It's such a shame I can't use any for my medicines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Enough chit-chat. Our job is to guard all of this and make sure nothing bad happens to it, so let's get to guarding, shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Right. We have to make sure Valentine's Day doesn't get waylaid by anything or anyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Excuse me for the interruption, but it seems another individual has fallen ill!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Another one? And with the same symptoms? Have we confirmed if they've ingested the same thing as the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes. It appears they purchased it from the same vendor, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Everyone who's eating stuff from the same place is getting sick? That doesn't sound good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My, my! What could they have ingested? Perhaps it wasn't food, but medicine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Elizabeth. I...don't mean anything by this, but just to be absolutely certain, you wouldn't happen to have anything to do with this incident, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm? What do you mean? How could I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You know—that stuff you were making yesterday?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ohh, that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about that. I did make some medicine yesterday, but it wasn't enough to spread around. Rest assured, I had no hand in this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Good. I'm glad to hear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Of course Lizzy wouldn't be the one behind it! She would never make anything that would hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(It could certainly have some nasty side effects, though... But that's beside the point!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>She only makes medicine to help people. In fact, it was her medicine that brought me back from the brink of death ages ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Exactly. Yesterday's medicine was an energy booster; nothing more. It does have a tendency to make you sweat chocolate, but that's a small price to pay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I really don't know how to feel about that... But if Elizabeth's medicine isn't what's causing people to get sick, then what is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Rainbow Cacao, naturally. Everyone who has fallen ill did so after eating chocolate made from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What?! But what of the ban on distribution we were only just speaking of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>As my colleague insinuated, there exists a black market from which one can procure the cacao in secret. Based on our investigations, we believe its base of operations to be somewhere near the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt again, but I'm afraid things have gone from bad to worse! I've just received word that someone else has become sick as well, in just this short time. We must return immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I will have to call our conversation here, it seems, as I must see to these patients. I'm counting on you all to give your best effort in guarding the materials. Do take care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>So there's a literal black market, then? Something must be done about that, and soon! Things could easily spiral out of control very quickly if it's left unattended.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I'm happy to look into it. I can do some market research on how to deregulate sales, while I'm there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Are you really willing to go so far just for Elizabeth's sake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hehe! Of course! You'd be so happy if I could help do something to relax those distribution laws, wouldn't you, Lizzy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You really are something else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Besides that, though, I have some personal qualms over how tightly regulated Rainbow Cacao has become. It just...rubs me the wrong way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I understand that Purple Cacao is dangerous because it can attract monsters, but is it really fair for all the other varieties to be lumped into the same ban? There are so many uses for them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And so many people who want them. The demand is ever present. And it is, after all, a merchant's job to meet her customers' demands!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The court mages even confirmed this, stating curiosity from the general populace as a reason for the increased risk of robbery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I have. And that's why I think it would be best to confirm these illicit sales with my very own eyes! It's my duty as a merchant, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I could sure use some help, though! Perhaps you'd care to join me, Caris? I would so appreciate the assistance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What? Why me?! We've barely just begun the job we were hired for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Why don't you ask Elizabeth for help, since you love her so much?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What are you even saying? How could I possibly bother Lizzy with something like this? It's preposterous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>But I'm fair game?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Come on! Please? If I really find any Rainbow Cacao at the black market and have to confiscate it, I'll need a way to transport it, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Your motorbike would be the perfect thing for that. I bet with how fast you can go, we'd be in and out of there in no time at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Fine. You win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about things here. We'll guard the Rainbow Cacao and hold down the fort while you're gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Thanks so much! Lizzy, I'm going to head out for a bit, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Are you, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Well, why don't I go with you, after all? I'm quite curious about the Rainbow Cacao myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Really? You'll come with me?! Hooray! This is going to be so much fun! Let's not waste a moment, then; come on, team!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Hoo boy. This...isn't going to be so much fun, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
