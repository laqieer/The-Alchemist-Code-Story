</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh, there it is! Excuse me, would you have a seat for one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Welcome. It's a little crowded, but if you don't mind sharing a seat outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not at all. As long as I can eat the sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Well then, this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Heheh. I'm really looking forward to it. Seriously, if only I didn't have a headache.</td>

<td>Oh, they really are good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Who would've thought they we'd be sharing seats. Um, Reimei, wasn't it?</td>

<td>I'm honored to have my name remembered a master artist of the Pipa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...! You know about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. You're the Fayrene the Pipa player. Your name is famous in Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Last night, I went to verify who you were in person.</td>
</tr>

<td>Is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. No, I'm joking.</td>

<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh! Reimei...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>A-ahaha. Nothing. Just a little misunderstanding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Wait, hold on! Is Reimei that assassin who will take out anyone for the right amount...?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(Maybe he was the one who killed that man yesterday...and now he's trying to erase me too...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ahaha. The way you eat the sweets makes it look extra delicious.</td>

<td>Haha. No, it's kind of a cute look.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(No. The atmosphere about him. If he was truly here to finish me off...he wouldn't be speaking to me like this.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm sorry about last night. Wait, maybe it's the other way around...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>After we beat those men up, you collapsed from being drunk and I had to take you back to your lodging.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>H-huh?! Oh dear...then, you were the one who changed my outfit?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Calm down. You're spilling your food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I don't know which one is your true nature, but it's best you don't ruin your persona as a virtuoso of the Pipa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ahahaha... You say strange things, Reimei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh. Right back at you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Well then, now that we've finished eating our sweets, I'll be going now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, ow unfortunate. Just when the conversation was getting started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It might be fun for us to talk again over drinks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That being said, don't get too drunk at work and mess up your performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey...I don't drink while I work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Just because he's a little handsome, he's way too overconfident. Don't mess up from getting too drunk at work? Hah! The nerve of him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>For starters, I've never messed up during a performance. And I never ever drink during work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>My work...is my work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Work...I need to go now.</td>
