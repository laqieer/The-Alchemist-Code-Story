<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where are we? And why am I...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Celis. but our time is short. I know this is sudden, andâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! Are you...Logi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I knew it. Unbelievable! Look how much you've grown!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How could you tell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How could I not?! He's my precious son... But, my dear Logi, why are you here? How are you here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'll try to keep it brief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So...you entered the dagger's inner world in order to have me teach you Kagutsuchi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It boggles the mind. The ancient belief that all things possess a soul is actually true! And it's through the soul of this dagger that you were able to summon me, as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It is quite a development. And Logi is here to offer his aid in restoring peace to Wadatsumi once more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Thank you so much, Logi. Though I must also apologize for dragging you into this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>O-oh... It's quite all right. Really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But you're right; time really is short. We'd best get this started. Draw your weapon, son! Huzzaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wh-whoa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I truly do pale in comparison to you, Celis. You're on another level altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh? That just tells me you've been neglecting your training! You should easily be able to manage attacks like this by now, Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Training is, after all, one of the tenets of everyday life. And those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm? Did I say something strange?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Just thinking that's a good creed to live by. And that it's even better when you hear it firsthand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I'm glad you approve! But now is hardly the time to be struck with admiration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Rather, it's time to train you in the sacred art of Kagutsuchi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oho!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You're still too open in the moments before you strike. Consider your form to be the springboard for the following slash. You can't get caught up in it, or else you'll lose that initial spark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Celis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nothing like a real fight to polish up your skills, eh? You've got this, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have. Just like my father, the Captain of the Blue Flame Guard, and my mother, the Vice-Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Their blood runs through me...as does that of the Wadatsumi royal family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This blood of mine tells of countless wishes, and an astounding lineage that spans much of the known world. And thus far, I'd known all of that, but I had yet to truly feel it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Through this training, I will find my path. I will find the burden that I am supposed to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Because until I do, I cannot rightfully inherit those wishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What a lovely answer! You've grown into a truly dependable young man any mother would be proud of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Celis truly is amazing, and not just in terms of swordsmanship. She sized up Logi in an instant, and knew just how to guide him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I still have such a long way to go before I'm even worthy of being mentioned in the same breath.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Amane! What are you doing slacking off over there? Come! Join the fray!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>M-me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>All I see is my dear Amane trying to skip her training again, and that will never do! You need to grow stronger too, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm counting on you to defend Wadatsumi in my place, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yeah, come on over, Amane! Let's see what you've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>O-okay! Hyaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There we go! Now things are getting interesting! I'll take on both of you at once!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Are you watching, Lady Mitsuha? It hasn't quite become the Wadatsumi you and my parents hoped for, but it's well on its way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Your descendants are fighting desperately to return this land to its former glory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That alone is something to celebrate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And looking at them now, I know that Amane and Logi can do it. They have it within them to restore Wadatsumi back to the way it once was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
