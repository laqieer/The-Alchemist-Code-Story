<td>The moment I thought I was going to die, I remembered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The worst day ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The moment I gave up on living, it came to my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The greatest day ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>A life that makes me believe it wasn't all for naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A life that lets me believe it was worth having stood my ground here, that I don't have to go anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>A life that allows me to believe there are none whose existence has been undone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The one connection shared among the ten commandments...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That connection...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is that how one avoids losing sight of themselves in a world of darkness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes, it is. And it is you who tugs on that chain connecting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It really doesn't matter who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am pleased to make your acquaintance. I am a big fan of standing on the sidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Drei?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Like he said, I'm a good guy, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So, show me something good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ha! You bought me time enough to gift me the spotlight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're later than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, come on. We came here straight from the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Your fan's here watching.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hahahah! I was just thinking I hadn't seen enough action today! Come on, Sieba, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Jeez, you're always so loud. You're thick, sweltering, unsightly, and smell like alcohol all the time! Not a single ounce of you is dazzling! Don't come near me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh?! You smell funky all the time too, you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Excuse me?! This is called perfume! Take a good whiff, fool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Gah! My nose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Aaah! You're so annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Pretty energetic for having just returned from a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don't get me wrong, it's exhausting babysitting this animal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Animal? I'm human, just like you! Can't you see I'm standing on two legs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're anything but human.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hahahah! Well, I am really big! More than twice as big as you are, at least!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Right. Twice as big. Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yo, Sol! I just noticed, you're practically dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You really just noticed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sorry to greet you all bloody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You look like you've bled nine beer bottles worth of blood, eh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why are you looking so happy about that?! That's a lethal amount! You really need to stop measuring everything like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Still, you're probably right, Neun. I haven't enough blood, or strength, left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Will you help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Heh! Don't act so reserved! This is the prelude to our campaign for the sky, right?! Let's get it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>May I join you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We've repelled the false ruler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It was nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Caught up, as promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting, Vanir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So that is the one Sol said would be our first enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>He waited until all of you were assembled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What kind of boor would I be, had I not? This is more fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And I told you, didn't I? Show me the strength of your will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>These are all things you will share with your comrades. Remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Let me introduce you. The Dragon Slayers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Cool name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(I don't get it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I am only human, after all. There is just no way I can defeat you alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>To inherit the will left by those who came before us. That was my excuse for using words like commandment to bound our wills.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I've deserted comrades, offered them up as sacrifices, gave them power, and convinced them of world domination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I thought that I had become inhuman...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>(...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But the members of the Templars each live and carry on with their own sense of will. Taking those who are gone along with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>None of it is futile. If any one of us leave behind some sense of our will, then we will have left our mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Even in death, they are with us, and help us feel alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Sol leads with the chains of commandment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>We the Templars grip those chains to move on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It is our will to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>It is our right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>We loathe the righteous world, and we huddle together because we fear being alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That is who I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I don't need to be a pioneer like you. Just being a guidepost standing along the trail that you've blazed is enough for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I only need to be a reckless philosopher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(What is happening? Their Alchemia is collecting around Sol...?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>A rip-off can exceed the original.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>All it takes is enough blood and effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>A cursed prayer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It can forge a dream and the vessel who carries it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I am Sol.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Though I may be hollow, I do have my will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Even if it is childish, I will cleave to it and carry it with outlandish pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Wow, so bright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The sun of Lost Blue, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Vanir! Let me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You stand back and watch, Nero.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>But I wish to...know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I want to know this world my power has created. If it must be destroyed, or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Phantom Karmacoma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ah... They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Fantastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yeah, I copied your style and "promoted" myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Making practical use out of what you've seen, I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Vanir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Would you be sad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>If you were left alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I...I will be. A little...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I recognize that voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>It was in Veda's Fringe Dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The one who gave us power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You were a dragon after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>A dragon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You want to fight against the fools who challenge the status quo, don't you? You itch to do so as the ruler of the skies, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I cannot not speak for my old self, but... That could be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Is this what it means to know one's self?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Be honest. Isn't this fun? You want to see how the underdog makes it through this one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>I'm...excited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Perhaps introductions are in order. This is Nero, a dragon willing to destroy the world in order to find themself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Nero...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>She wants to destroy those she herself gave power to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Like a child playing a game.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Is there something wrong with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You better pay back what you owe with interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>That's usury.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What we owe?! I owe you nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>The greatness of our loss is our strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>If you all are not enough to destroy the world, then I will topple it myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I will then know what I am capable of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Regardless, we must cut you down to reach the Truth at the top of the tower, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>If you reject destruction by me, then show me. Show me the strength that you hope is enough to overthrow the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>And now for a word from our muscle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I was about to fall asleep with all that yappin' you all were doing, but it's all really simple, isn't it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Just bring it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>It's unanimous then, Nero?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>This is getting interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>It's how we do things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Try and stop us, Templars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>If you can hear our voices...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Phantom Karmacoma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Can you hear my footsteps approaching behind you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Have you made any progress?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Thanks to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I decided to rip-off your name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>—van...</td>
