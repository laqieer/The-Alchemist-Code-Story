<td>It's creepy no matter how many times I see it. Why do these insects that are supposed to be small become so big?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I heard they evolve because of Philosopher's Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Philosopher's Stones? Are those the ones we learned about in class?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you saying that the insects eat the bits of Alchemy scattered throughout the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They're too big for a small insect to consume. It's the sap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The sap?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I heard rumors that there's a tree on the outskirts of the forest that was raised using Philosopher's Stones as fertilizer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The insects consumed the sap from that tree and thus grew to be so big. On top of that, they apparently became resistant against the cold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I've been thinking this from before, but the information you have, Alma, um, you can't really call them...rumors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They're practically top secret information. Rumors are rumors because they're common knowledge. Where are you getting your information from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Never mind the details. So, apparently, they tear off the shells of those insects and use them as armor—that's why they're called Bugmail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Tear off...?! But those insects were once men, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Maybe they think that if they inflict pain on the hateful witches, it would bring peace to the men now being used as armor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How terrible! This is so...wrong! Why do men and women have to fight each other in the first place?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hey...calm down! If you make too much noise the Bugmail will find us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then we'll just stop the Bugmail! Everything is wrong with this situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You've gotta be kidding me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A portion of this country seems to be wary of the Holy Guard—of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Soon the Mage's will come from the Royal Palace in order to suppress the resistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Should I use that opportunity to slip into the Royal Palace? Or...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Ohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Captain Dias?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why did you come out? You understand that it's dangerous, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm going to stop...the Bugmail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This conflict...it's all wrong! Why do men and women from the same country have to fight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If only everyone would drink and talk, they'd be able to get along like my mom and the old men who came by frequently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>People aren't that simple. The same battle will continue over and over again...until the world changes drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're talking about on a continent-wide scale, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>True, I don't think that it's possible for people to get along on a continent-wide scale just by talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...But we're talking about men and women who were born and raised in the same country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They're the individuals who are supposed to love each other the most. I'm sure they can learn to understand each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Honestly... There's never a dull moment with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I've never seen a Paladin that could be reasoned with to this degree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Alma! Rebecca!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But there's truth to what Liz said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Well, when it comes to animals, it's normal for the males and females to get along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>This isn't a dream or an ideal! It's just a matter of someone acting on it! So...I will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Well then...what are we gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There are countless insects on both sides of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Let's find this Salomo guy! If we can stop him, then all of this should end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>In order to do that, we need to break through the swarm of insects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Complaining won't decrease their numbers. We've just gotta do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Let's go, everyone!</td>
</tr>
