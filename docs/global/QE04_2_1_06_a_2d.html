<td>001</td>
<td>Voda! What is this strange turn of events?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'd put it down to a gust of new wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tina...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting, Mocca. I brought her like I promised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well then...Fuu boy, tell me more about what you were just talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I had my own doubts about the whole situation. However, at the time, I did nothing to resolve them. Thus, we now find ourselves here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The gulf between our tribes continues to deepen. It has allowed this mass outbreak of the Jam. As a result, all of Saga is now in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Is this the Saga that we pledged that day to protect? It's still not too late. We must come to terms with the past and move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I have nothing to say to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. In that case, allow me to fulfill the purpose of my visit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...! Why are you kneeling? What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>As leader of Voda, I would like to make a formal request. Apparently, there is one who seeks to destroy both this forest and my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I invoke the Sprite's Oath. In accordance with the law, I call upon the unification of Saga. Now is the time to work together to restore peace to Saga!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Voda...! What are you doing?! How could you submit so easily?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>When a crisis arises that threatens the land of Saga, we must set aside tribe and faction and unite as one. That's the law of Saga. I am merely following it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I hardly believe one so dedicated to the law as yourself would dismiss this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>My hope is that you will tell me what happened that night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Why now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Because it matters now more than ever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm sure you have also felt that a gluttonous power has begun to suppress Asena.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It is probable that Asena gave this girl, Tina, the power of foresight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And, by coincidence, Tina has also manifested a wind Ouija.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This matter is of the utmost importance. I don't know what the Gluttony army is plotting, but let us work together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>There's no need for that. I'll take care of this situation myself. I'll give you the reinforcements you've requested. After all, you'll need them to eradicate the Gluttony army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Always such a stubborn boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>As for you, you should hurry back to the Water Temple. What if something were to happen to the Water Matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There' s no need to worry about that. It's fine, as you can see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You brought your Matter with you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You took the risk of rendering yourself defenseless in order to come here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's how serious I am about this. It's made me want to entrust my fate to this girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If would be quite problematic if the Gluttony soldiers were to seize it in my absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Although I can't carry it for long, it gives me enough time to hear your story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>After all, it's about time we engaged in some meaningful conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Excuse me! The Jam have emerged on the outskirts of the village! There's an astonishing number of them! Please, Fuu, help us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Leave this to us! Let's go, Tina!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of course! Voda, please wait here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wait! I'll go too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Watch them work together so naturally...it reminds me of the old Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That, right there, is the future of Saga. It's never too late for us, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Voda...</td>
</tr>
