<td>Bwaaa!!! I can't fight well like this, and I can't run away because there are too many trees!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's why you need to ride on it standing and fight. It's good practice, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This is way too Spartan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>There's a knack to doing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Just like when you stand on the ground, you need to believe in the Broom Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh? What are you two doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The same as you, Rebecca. We're practicing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's not practice if you're mounting it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No way... I can't believe you don't know how to ride a Broom Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>For starters, why are you using such an old Broom Ace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It doesn't match your body size. Is it a hand-me-down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A-and what if it is?! I was the one that said I wanted to use it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I wanted to use the same Broom Ace that my mother used!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I guess if you're gonna be at the mercy of this hand-me-down then I've got nothing to worry about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh no! Here comes another herd of monsters. Let's chase them off first!</td>
