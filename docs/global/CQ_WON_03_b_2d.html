<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>Thank you, sir! M'lady! I came out here to try and take care of these baddies myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>But then I got scared, and hid—but before I knew it, the two of you showed up, and took them all out like a couple of whirlwinds! Thanks so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>It's good to be brave, but you mustn't try and tackle problems like this yourself, all right?</td>

<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>I-I know... It's just like dad said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>He told me that if money can free the village from those creatures, then no price is too steep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>But then...what're we gonna do if it happens again? We don't have that much money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>That's why I tried to take care of it myself, but the moment I saw those things, I got so scared...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Well... I think it's great that you want to protect the people of your village. You should definitely hold on to that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>B-but... I did want to protect the village, but to tell you the truth, I also wanted to get away from it for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Why? If you're the son of the mayor, you don't have anything to worry about! You've got status and money...the whole shebang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Village Youth</td>
<td>But... I should be able to do so much more for the village than my father—if I just had more freedom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>Ahh... You're still a child. Did you really think that you would find your freedom just wandering around outside the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>So long as we live amongst others in this world, none of us will have complete freedom.</td>

<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>Tut-tut! I won't hear any more arguments. Think about your father! He gathered together an enormous amount of money just to protect your village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>If you can't see that the freedom you speak of is not worth betting on, then I'm afraid you're doomed to die an untimely death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>That's going a bit far, Strie... Kid, you tried to protect your village in your own way, and that's better than sitting on your hands and doing nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>

<tr>

<td>I'm not taking on any apprentices right now, but I can train you up a bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Whether you train on your own or have me help you is entirely up to you, kid. You just do whatever you think is right. Protect the village however you see fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Got it! Um... Thank you both so much for protecting our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Duh! Never know what's gonna make you money! Looks like everything's in order here, though. No more monsters. Shall we head back?</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Nothing! That stuff you said earlier... It really made me think about what freedom means to me. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>And have you found your answer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Nope! But...I did remember something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>And what would that be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>The reason I left home... It did have a lot to do with sticking it to my dad, but that wasn't all there was to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>I was determined to win my freedom with my own two fists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>That's how I felt, but then everything you said to that villager kid really resounded with me, so I got to thinking... Who would that freedom actually serve, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>Oops! Did I accidentally lecture you, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Nah... Well, it wouldn't have been such a bad thing, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>Ooohh, I don't like this at all! Courtesy doesn't suit you a bit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Your freedom lies in fulfilling your own desires; mine doesn't. Have I just been rebelling against the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>I'm starting to wonder if what I wanted was just...hollow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
<td>Hollow, hm? And so what if it was? You want to get rich, don't you? It's up to you to make that happen, little man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Heh! Tell you what. The next time we see each other, I'll make sure I have my answer ready!</td>

<td>I look forward to hearing it.</td>
</tr>

<td>And your pockets need to be filled?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>
<td>Pfft! Anyway, if nothing else, I trust in the strength of my fists, and in the Tiger-King Fist! At least that's a technique that's designed to live and let live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/won.png" alt="Won" height="128"><br>Won</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suto.png" alt="Strie" height="128"><br>Strie</td>
