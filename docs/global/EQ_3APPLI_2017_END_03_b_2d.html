<td>Uzushiomaru...lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What a relief. We got back the Sun Keys she took as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Impossible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My plan...my perfect plan to engulf every world in darkness...how can it fail here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Kayako...you've lost. I'll commend you on your determination...you even went so far as to revive yourself from the underworld, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Justice will always win...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And, as soon as Amaterasu wasn't on her own, you didn't stand a chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Arghh! Don't underestimate me! I'm still not finished yet! I still have my negative energy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We'll eliminate it with the power of these keys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A dazzling light emits from the Sun Keys brought here from the future. They engulf Kayako completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ahhhh?! It's so bright...my body is disappearing!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're a spirit of negative energy resurrected from the underworld... Of course, this is the effect it'll have on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Impossible! I'm...fading?! My will...everything! It's disappearing into the light...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whether it be in darkness or in light...I pray that you will no longer suffer anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Noooo...ahhhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's over, I think. Finally...everyone is still safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ohhhh...Amaterasu!!! You're alive! I'm so happy!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>U-uh...um...thank you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sure that pirate sent you all here to help me when my own strength wasn't enough to protect the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, this Golden Compass is what led us here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>With these words, the Compass is held up so that Amaterasu can see it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Amaterasu also removes her own Compass and grasps it tightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you. I guess that means that I have to continue working hard from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, I doubt that's the only reason why the pirate gave that Compass to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>After all, that Compass leads to the Twilight Zone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you were to always remain here, it wouldn't be necessary, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Do you mean that...he gave it to me for when I want to leave the Twilight Zone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If you're always alone, Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then it might be difficult to leave here, but what if you had friends that you could rely on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can...go on adventures?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The pirate must have given the Compass to you for when that time came. What a romantic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, let's talk all about that later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For now, I want to get some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yes...now that everything is okay, I suddenly feel really tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tr-true...I'm exhausted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sorry, Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't think the Twilight Zone is supposed to be used for this...but can we rest here a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmm. Well, I don't see why not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>In exchange, can you tell me all about yourselves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm not completely sure yet if you're friends that I can sincerely trust...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>In order to help facilitate that, I want to know more about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Yuri, wasn't it? You said that it starts from choosing to believe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes! I did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All right, how about we start with introductions then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Okay, I'll go first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let me introduce myself again. I'm Amaterasu. Thank you all for coming here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Amaterasu says this with a slightly shy smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Thus, the sun goddess became a pirate and set out to explore the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>They actually pulled it off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>According to my calculations, there was a much higher chance of failure...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Well, that's understandable. It just means they managed to work their way around it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We should celebrate their accomplishment. It really is quite impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A few days later...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Cheers!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The five of them clink their glasses together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Gulp, gulp, gulp...ahhh! The best! Summer is the best!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Seeing her like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It makes you realize that, even if the world is different, Amaterasu's nature remains the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Amaterasu...I'm surprised you like alcohol so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes, it's hard to imagine that you worked so hard at the cost of making friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Whoo! My wish has finally come true! I wanted to drink with my friends like this...underneath the blazing sun!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Just like she says, the sun is high in the clear sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All the black clouds covering each world disappear, and a warm and dazzling glow fills the land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The long eclipse is finally over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So all of you voyaged on a pirate ship together? So jealous! Is alcohol the most appropriate thing when it comes to pirates?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Hey, you're underage...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Speaking of pirates...you're not going to wear that hat anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td><p_name> turns to look at the pirate hat hanging from his waist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>This hat saved me time and time again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>When we were fighting against the darkness within our hearts, it was that hat that saved us as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Because we had that hat, we were able to sail across three worlds and save you, Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm not the one who gave you that hat, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'll take this opportunity to tell you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Amaterasu stands in front of <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The reason I am here like this now...is all thanks to you, <p_name>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Without you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>And Lisbeth, Laevateinn, Yuri, of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Without all of you, I would have been consumed by the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No matter how many times I say this, it's not enough. From the bottom of my heart...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>...Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hey, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh? Captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Put on that hat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>And take me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>No...take us on a big adventure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Heheh. Please do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Let's go, Cap!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Captain, hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Yuri, Laevateinn, Lisbeth, and Amaterasu gaze towards <p_name> with expectation in their eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>This hat...was where it all started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td><p_name>, who had been silently gazing at the hat, slowly puts it on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Yep. It looks perfect on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Yeah, Cap! Give us your order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Give us a heart-pounding adventure, captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>All right then, all of you! Let's head towards the sun on our next adventure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>We set sail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Aye aye, Captain!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>This time...let's enjoy our midsummer adventure together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Her smile is like the sunâ€”radiant and dazzling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Thus we close the curtain on our adventure of a summer.</td>
