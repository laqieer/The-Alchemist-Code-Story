<td>Don't you think it's so very convenient? What an elegant way to render normally powerful foes powerless.</td>

<td>And so too was Space-Time Manipulation once developed for a specific purpose.</td>

<td>Time Travel. The ability to travel into the past or future. The ability to alter past regrets and undo unforeseen threats at their root.</td>

<td>Aren't you a smart boy. 50 points for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Oops. Looks like that cranky child just woke up. Seriously, I wonder if Icona ever had to deal with such an unruly beast.</td>

<td>Well then, I bid you adieu. Try not to die out here. In fact, it's probably for the best if you just leave if you can manage it.</td>

<td>After all, the Ira Belt will perish shortly.</td>
