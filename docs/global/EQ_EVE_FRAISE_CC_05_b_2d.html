<td>001</td>
<td>Ah…my leg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Gotcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Eve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Are you alright, my pet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…Oh, Fraise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He's carrying her in his arms like she's a princess! I've never seen this in real life before… Oh, and now he put her down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Rest here, darling. I'll end this quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My, my…you think you can defeat all of us at once? You'd have guts to go up against just one of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes. I must protect the one I love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>A knight's strength knows no limit when it comes to protecting others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ack…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Sweetie...you were incredible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Whoa! That was totally different than when he was training… So cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Y-Yeah! He sure is cool! So, I guess you've fallen for him too, Rach?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Say what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well…the truth is I love--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hiyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oof…C-Curse you… Don't think you can do this and get away with it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'll file a formal complaint against Envylia. That'll teach you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…! Wait! You can't! He shouldn't be punished for rescuing me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's alright, my love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>N-No it's not! You killed a witch! This is a big deal…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Because of me, you're going to be in for a world of trouble…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It's alright. I didn't kill her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You didn't?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Uhhh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I struck them with the back of my sword. That much I know to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Actually, weren't they the ones who struck first?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Fraise didn't strike until after you attacked. Which means he was acting in self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…B-Be quiet! First and foremost, what is a knight of Envylia doing in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Outsiders will only create conflict in Lustburg. He's no different…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>On the contrary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Sorry I'm late. The application for entering the country as an ambassador for the king was a little confusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>An ambassador for the king?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That man is an official delegate of the nation of Envylia--Here are his papers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>…Thank goodness. They finally let him in…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? I don't get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see…a partnership between Envylia and Lustburg…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes. We'd like to enlist your knight's help in protecting Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aren't the witches able to defend Lustburg on their own?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…I asked myself the same question. After all, the witches are quite formidable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>However, they are vulnerable to enemies with an immunity to magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>As my associate mentioned, the knights may be able to help them in a variety of situations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Additionally, if we cooperate with Lustburg, we'll be able to learn about that country's magical technology and wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As a commander of the Royal Knighthood, I'm constantly searching for better ways to protect Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If we can pull off this alliance, we'll be able to defend our country with high level magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…Expanding our capabilities of self-defense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…I see. It's true that our magic pales in comparison to Lustburg's. Your proposal sounds audacious, but also intriguing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Closing our borders won't keep us safe. I believe we'll be safer if we remain open and more accepting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>We all want to protect our country, and we can do that without isolationist policies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's why I want the people of Lustburg to see the knights of Envylia firsthand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Hmm…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>...Do you think it's worth a shot?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Well, I confess your idea exudes a certain type of idealism characteristic of students…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>But I think it's worth a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…! Thank you so very much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>And that's what happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>R-Rach! You're incredible! You really took the initiative…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>If there was anything I could do, I was gonna do it! Well, there wasn't much of a choice, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…I didn't want to give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I wanted to believe that a person's strength comes from not giving up when things get difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>A person's strength…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…If he is an emissary for the King of Envylia, then we must treat him with respect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>…Please accept my apologies. We welcome you into our country. I will arrange an audience with the queen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>…Excuse me! Please wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm sorry Fraise, my sweet. I got you caught up in Lustburg's affairs and also got you into big trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I don't want you to get mixed up in this any further. So…I've been thinking we should break up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>But…but...I…don't want to give up on our relationship. Because…I love you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Maybe you don't love me anymore because you're with Rach, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>…Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I adore and cherish and love everything about you! So, I don't want to let you go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Um…Eve, my pet. I think you're overlooking one tiny detail…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Yeah…it's not like that between us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>It's not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>NO WAY!!! But…but Rach, you said how cool Fraise was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I meant…as a knight! And speaking of which, I think Chloe is the coolest of all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>B-But, didn't you lock arms earlier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That was all a performance! Come, on! Don't be ridiculous! Moa would kill me otherwise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…I-I see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So that explains it! Geez, I feel silly. Heh heh… I'm so relieved I'm crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>…Hahaha. I guess I couldn't give up on Fraise even if I tried. I better work even harder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I'll train longer and harder so that if witches ever have their eyes on Fraise again, I'll be there to protect him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>And I'll keep looking for a way to break the curse! And…and…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>…Eve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Eep…! Fraise…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>…Please. Don't try to do everything on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Let me help you find a way to break the curse--and help you with all sorts of other things. I want to protect you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>…Please don't cry alone anymore. If I imagine you crying, I can't sit still and my heart feels like it will tear through my chest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Sweet Fraise…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>And if one day we succeed in creating a world where you and I can be together--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Then I hope…you'll spend your life with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I hate to ask so much of you, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>…*Sniffle*...*Sob*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>!? E-Eve, my pet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>P-Please don't cry! Did I say something I shouldn't--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>*Sniffle* No, you didn't. I'm sorry, I can't help it. I'm just…so happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>In that case…I'm glad. Won't you tell me your response?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>…Yes! Yes, of course! I want to spend the rest of my life with you! *Sniffle*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I was starting to worry they weren't coming back, but…I come here to find this. I better shut my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Isn't it wonderful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It sure is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>…I don't get why girls love this kinda stuff. I can't take it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>…Well, at least he's back to his normal self.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I'm really…happy. People's emotions are really powerful, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>…Right, mom?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Afterwards, they both met with the queen as emissaries of the King of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>"It may be difficult for us to join forces immediately, so let us start by getting to know one another…"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>"I hope we can work together to build a brighter future." In response to Envylia's invitation--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The queen said, "If this alliance will increase our safety and prevent hostilities, I see no reason to refuse."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>And so, Lustburg's closed-border policy for national defense was quietly pared down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Now, the lovebirds can prove their love to one another! Hooray! Hooray!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>…I can't write that…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hey! Why are you so into my report?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Who wouldn't be--with all those shenanigans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>This is the price you pay for all those unexcused absences! Consider yourself lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>*Groan* At this rate, I might as well write down every little detail and do a special report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>If I document all of my latest extracurricular activities, I bet people would love it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Wooooow…I'm sooooo happy for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Moa…are you mad at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Why should I be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I mean, if you would've told me, I would've joined you--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>…Fiddlesticks! I wanted to help Eve, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I said I'm sorry! I just did what I felt I had to do. I didn't expect it to blow up like this…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Besides, if you had been there, things might not have gone as smoothly. International relations are complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Phooey…I guess you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>…By the way, Rachel, Eve has looked really happy ever since.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Seeing her smile makes me happy, too… So, I wanted to say, "Thank you!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>My only regret is having missed the scene where they confess their love to each other…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>…You know, I just realized it, but you and Eve have a similar smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Uh-huh. It's like you can tell you are cousins, or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>…I like your smile, Moa. It cheers me up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Yeah, right… *Giggle*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>That's why I'm SUPER relieved everything worked out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>…Yeah, you did a great job tricking me, but...it's alright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>…Okay! Time for me to get serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Whoa! What's gotten into you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Today is the first day of the rest of our lives! The world is our oyster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Just the thought of it gets me pumped! We could discover a way to break the curse…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Or begin an apprenticeship under a knight. Doesn't that make you feel excited?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>That's what you want to do when we finish school? Don't you want to be a witch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Just because we graduate the School of Magic doesn’t mean we have to become witches, right? Look at Eve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>And then there's Chloe--that female knight from Envylia. She's SO cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I want to be the type of person that forges their own path through life--like my role models!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Lustburg needs more women like that. Don't you think?</td>
</tr>
