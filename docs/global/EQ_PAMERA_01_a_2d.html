<td>Haaaahmm.... I'm sleepy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I worked so hard yesterday. I'm so going to fall asleep in first period. I'll have to get Noah to lend me her notes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Grand opening today! Be the first to try our crepes! These treats are the new specialty of Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Crepes...? Ooh, and it's a brand new shop! This would be a good thank you gift to Noah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sweet, delicious, and luxurious crepes! Have some with your loving family and friends! Tastes even better when you have one with someone special!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Mommy! I want a crepe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If we get crepes now, then you won't have room for cake later. Since it's your birthday, let's have crepes another time, all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Okay! I can't wait to eat your cake, Mommy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Mommy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Pamela? What are you doing? Hurry up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whoops! Coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That kid...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Isn't that Pamela?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is there anything you don't know, Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You really don't know anything, do you? Pamela's famous. How can you not know who she is? She's a genius who's skipped grade upon grade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Wow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't you think you're doing a little too much part time work lately? You dozed off during class today. Are you sleeping properly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I sleep just f-f-faaaaaaaaaaaiiin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>With a yawn like that, it's hard to believe you're sleeping at all. I'll lend you my notes later, so make sure you get an early night tonight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you! Hey, Noah... Have you ever talked to Pamela? What's she like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? I guess I've seen her in the library a few times but I've never talked to her before. I think she's probably a good kid, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>She always takes care to put her books away properly at the library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Pamela? Of course I know her. She's super cute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's not what I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, sorry... I do know a little more about her, of course. There's more to her than just being adorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>She's a scholarship student who lives in the dorms at the magic school... Her comprehensive ability and capacity for memorization are phenomenal... She's the very definition of a genius.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It's only natural that skills are highly valued. Sometimes, she even assists the Court Mages with their experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow. Isn't skipping grades over and over like that kinda crazy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It just goes to show what a genius she really is. Though...she seems to get targeted a lot because of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It's probably hard for her to make friends, considering her special circumstances. She seems to spend a lot of time by herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>She tries her best when it comes to things like Operation Present, but she always ends up missing the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Operation Present? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh! Hey! Over there, isn't that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Sorry, I have to get to my next class! See ya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Shucks... Rejected again. I really thought I had done well with the symbol of my friendship this time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No. That's not what matters at the heart of it. It isn't the gift that was the problem... The timing was all wrong. That must be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I must hand over the proof of my friendship at the optimal timing! If I do that, then my dream will come true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Next time, I will gain a friend without fail!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(Is this what Ms. Celine was talking about?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's probably hard for her to make friends, considering her special circumstances. She seems to spend a lot of time by herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She tries her best when it comes to things like Operation Present, but she always ends up missing the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The proof of her friendship, huh? I see. I guess she is a bit off the mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Friends aren't something you should have to work so hard to get... People just kind of become your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Emma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hm? Noah? What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Don't give me that! It's time for Practical Skills but you weren't in the classroom so I came to look for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Our teacher is super strict, so once the bell rings you can't enter the classroom anymore! We'd better hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh, wow! You're cutting it pretty close by coming to look for me! You're so sweet, Noah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Emma! What are you doing? Hurry up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I am, I am. I'm right behind you.</td>
</tr>
