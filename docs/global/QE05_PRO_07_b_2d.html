<td>Why?! Why won't you fight me properly?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Eh. I'm not really feeling it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Come on. Can you really say that you mean to kill me? I don't feel like you're really trying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm not joking! I'll make you leave if you don't do so yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I'm willing to take that bet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have no choice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why aren't you trying to avoid my attacks?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's my policy to never let a woman cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Even if those tears, uh, aren't yours or whatever, it's part of my motto to identify the reason behind them and stay until the tears are gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...are a strange man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why are you so determined to help me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You've forgotten already? I told you, I can't just sell out a friend that easily, even to save my own hide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>A friend?! You're saying that I'm your friend? That's ridiculous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm sorry to say it, but that's the way it is. I don't have that many friends, but we've been stuck together for long enough that I kinda feel like you're one of 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Anyway, I've got a question for you, friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wh-what kind of question?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I wanna know what you've been all torn up over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I-I... Nngh... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Seriously, what is making you cry like this? There's got to be some reason for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I-it doesn't matter! It's nothing you have to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, it is. I can't leave you here knowing that there's something you're worried about. That'd be the same as selling you out. I couldn't do that to a friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Do you get it yet? I'd rather die than not help you out of whatever dilemma you've gotten yourself wrapped up in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You must be joking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I get that a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why won't you just listen to me? If you stay with me, you could die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I kind of got that sense. Tsk, tsk. This all would have been easier if you'd just said that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Aren't you scared?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There's no person in this world who isn't afraid of death, but...given the choice of running from death or doing what I can to help a friend, I would choose the latter every time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Anyway, I think you've misjudged me a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I have intimate knowledge of how to make use of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Y-you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. At least trust me enough come with me instead of staying here and waiting for certain death. Can you do that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I... You're... You're strange.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Heh. Well, then, young lady... Where can I escort you to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>The man with red hair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I must find Logi Crowley. The only thing that can change this world...lies in his blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Okay...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Tamis and the others should return shortly. Let's stop here for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wait! One more time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Please, just one more time! I just have this feeling that if I do it one more time, I'll finally be able to lock it down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Interesting. Why not? I'm willing to believe that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Thank you! Okay, one more time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There's no way to save the people of Lustburg if I can't even defeat one person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I'll definitely learn Voda's technique and... Grr! Who's she calling flat-chested?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa... Envylia's Leviathan and Wratharis' Satna...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Slothstein's Belphegor and Gluttony Foss' Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then, finally, Lustburg's Asmodeus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Of the seven Sacred Stones, these five have begun to wreak havoc. Now, with the Mikaboshi making its appearance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>It's obvious that the balance of power in this world is beginning to fall apart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones will call upon each other when the balance of power in this world comes undone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The Sephira, who hold all the knowledge of the Alchemy Source, must know something about why this is all happening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Agatha, just watch... I will definitely find you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Nrgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Mocca! Are you all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Y-yes, I'm fine. I still have this, which Georgios left to me. I just need...some rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Of course. Don't push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>The curse affecting Mocca's body is getting stronger. We must find them before it's too late!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>The Sephira... I will find that legendary tribe, even if it is the last thing I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Hey, so... What is the boss doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You mean, like with the flowers and everything? Some kind of gesture to those who have fallen on the battlefield, I heard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Apparently, it's some old tradition that's been passed down from knights of the Envylia kingdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>In the end, these people have become victims of the tempestuous Sacred Stones, just as we did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>After all the time I've spent traveling, visiting these ruins of past lives, and meeting new people, I have learned something important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I have learned that the precarious balance of this world is at risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>In order to protect more people from being subject to more loss, more unhappiness...that balance must be protected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>For my father, for Dias...and for Agatha.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That is why I must find the Sephira. I must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I have this feeling that if I could just find them, I would take another step toward meeting Agatha again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Agatha, I promise I will find you. Wait just a little longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>The Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance is compromised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>In response, the hearts of the people shall be thrown into disarray and become agitated. Before long, the waves of emotion will swell and bring about a new era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>The result will be lasting peace...or a devastating tragedy unlike any that have come before, one which will inspire shudders of horror to any who think of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>After all, I have only one mission: To watch for myself how this all ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>This never-ending cycle of people craving the Sacred Stones, and the Sacred Stones wreaking merry havoc upon their lives...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>The wills of the seven Stones have begun to make their ripples in this world...and the world is growing more and more chaotic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I shall stand witness to the waves of history that break again and again upon the shores of this world.</td>
</tr>
