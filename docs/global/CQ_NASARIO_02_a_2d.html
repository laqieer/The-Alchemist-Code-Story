<td>It seems that the demons have fled—for the time being, at least..</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Are you hurt, Leon? Were any of your instruments damaged?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The only thing that will get in the way of my performance is you talking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I see that you can't even manage a thank you. I really ought not to mingle with your kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Moreover, your very presence disturbs the noble timbre of this forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Is that what my performances sound like to a high-elf?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You ought to determine whether my music ruins the peace of this forest with your own ears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Such sweet music! Look how all of the spirits of the forest come together, the better to lend their delicate ears to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is the beauty of the elf blood within you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That you can soothe the forest even after a sudden battle is...remarkable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Half of me was left unscathed during that battle—my physical half, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>However, I wonder about my other half... My heart, so to speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Pardon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Didn't think of that, did you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's wrong? Cat got your tongue? Or perhaps the lowly words of a mere human cannot reach you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>D-don't be absurd! That was... I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There are still demons close by, so I was simply distracted by their presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You need not stop playing. I will handle them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So that's a pure high-elf, huh? They truly are bound hand and foot by their pride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I pity that half-elf, and so my intention was to help him, as well as to praise his performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>However, I did not praise him, did I? No, I praised the elf blood inside of him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That makes me no better than foolish mankind, who persecute others for their appearance or the manner of their birth, and other such things that are not the fault of the individual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I wonder if he will ever come to this forest again?</td>
