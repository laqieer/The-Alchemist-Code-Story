<td>The time has come. We will finally resurrect the Demon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Reconsider this, Sabareta! Listen to what I'm telling you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Demon is our last hope. Do not attempt to meddle any further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! What do you mean by "hope"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Are you trying to tell me that the Demon's revenge is the hope of the people of Wratharis?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why not end the reign of Alchemy at the hands of the ultimate creature of Alchemy. Doesn't that sound satisfying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>The purification of this foul, rotten world... What other hope is there? This is the long-cherished wish of our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No... That's wrong! That will only give birth to further hatred!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The resurrected Demon will bring about the end of the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those who are killed and the families they leave behind will be in the same circumstances that all of you once were in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you telling me that's your hope?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If that were to occur, the descendants of those from Wratharis will eventually encounter the same revenge!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The cycle of grief will continue on forever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Alchemy, which you intend to eliminate, will cause this conflict to continue for hundreds of years to come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The die has already been cast. It cannot be helped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It can be helped! You can stop this cycle of grief!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Precisely because you are Sabareta, knight of Wratharis, who has experienced the pain caused by Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't be absurd. What other option is there? You're speaking in ideals. It's nothing more than a pipe dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No! There is just one other option! It's to restore the Kingdom of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You and your people are going to restore the Kingdom of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Envylia will support your effort! If our two conflicting kingdoms can work hand in hand, then I am certain there can be peace in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's absurdâ€”a humorless joke. What you are suggesting is impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We won't know until we try! I will personally negotiate with Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As a novice of the Holy Order of Babel, I will convince King Patrick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You cannot say there's zero chance of it working! So, please...promise me you won't resurrect the Demon until then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Lord Sabareta! The enemy is attacking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fine. I'll be there soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait! Please, Sabareta! This is something only you can do! Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You speak nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Enough... The wheels of fate have already been set in motion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>For the sake of the families that were murdered, casting aside our blades of revenge is something I cannot do!</td>
