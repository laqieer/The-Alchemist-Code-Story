<td>You're one of Aedith's assassins. It's good to look for an advantage, though you're lacking focus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You should've taken the shot before raising your voice just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, yes…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But for you to escape again would be more troublesome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Being basically a decoy… Not a bad idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I've seen a situation like that gone badly with my own eyes recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Instead of fooling around, why not come at me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Being weird and serious are not mutually exclusive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Rather, it's the people who seriously act stupid that you should be worried about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Not fond of people who look down on others…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's not at all how I meant it, but you're saying that I'm above you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>And this is how you take a shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No way… That was faster than a bullet…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I was just predicting your moves. You should learn about feints.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Though, there won't be a next time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ugh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Lord Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This is the first time I've seen you become a shield for someone else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So what if I did...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ae…dith…? Oh no, there's blood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Don't worry, my angel. It's just a scratch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I missed your vital points. But Aedith, you've weakened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm just not in the best of shape now… Dammit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You're willing to let that slide?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're seriously asking me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Let go, Aedith! I'm not just some pawn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't know what you were going on about, but I'll just say that this isn't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So, who's the next opponent?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What is this…? Just randomly shooting bullets?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Right. Shooting that way is just a disturbance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, that's what I wanted, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Matia…?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, stay where you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Yishai Ignacio…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ah, I've finally caught up with you. I got information from Shahel, who was "dispatched" to this layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Schmeier. One of the seven Draconic Pillars. Would you come along quietly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Matia…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>(She's still breathing, but she's unconscious.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>(And as for me, I can't even turn into a dragon because of my injuries.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ultimately, I'm in a desperate situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm glad you understand. Let's head back to the Pride Layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait a minute… Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Aedith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hm? Are you the ruler of this layer? I apologize that my Shahel made some unreasonable demands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Even if it's just to buy some time by killing a dragon in human form, there's a way to say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>What will happen to the layer's autonomy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The territory of the Seven Sins used to be the land of dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>No matter how many cities are built, no matter how much prosperity is gained...humans are still guilty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's not a bad idea to wipe all of them out, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Damn you…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hrgh! Ghaah…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>! There was no reason to shoot him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No reason was necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hrgh! Ugh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Hmm, interesting…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Aaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…You're going to forcibly take Magil from this burial ground to heal yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Esai…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You're too evil to even be human...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You can't transform...? No matter…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Everyone, the opponents who are preparing for battle are the seven dragons. Watch out or they'll take you down quickly!</td>
