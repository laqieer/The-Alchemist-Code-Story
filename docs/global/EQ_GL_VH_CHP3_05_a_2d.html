<td>Lady Shion!</td>

<td>Quickly, our lord is just ahead!</td>

<td>That blasted merchant, he's gone too far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Merchant? Ah—Li Wang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I should have known... I suppose the highwaymen are his to blame as well.</td>

<td>A cold shiver slithered down my spine as I neared my home...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There was not a single member of the public enforcement in sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It dawned on me, then, just how many strings Li Wang was capable of pulling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Ahaha! Is that all, Miss House Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Terribly low standards, if you ask me.</td>

<td>Shall I show your lord a whole new world of pleasure?</td>

<td>Such violence! Must you react with such savagery, Lord Zheng Yi?</td>

<td>And now you're under investigation for harboring dangerous articles related to Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Look how you've fallen, Lord Zheng Yi. There will be nothing left of your house at this rate.</td>

<td>My only regret...is not being able to expose Goetia for what it is.</td>

<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Your influence in Greed Dike is undeniable, that much is true...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Rather a shame if you were to slip up and lose your prize and position overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I don't know what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Really? If I were to—as you said—"have an accident" here...short of necromancy, you're not going to furnish a useful report for your masters.</td>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Where did you pick up such a filthy habit, my lord?</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Shion?! You're back! You're all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We were starting to worry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>As it stands, I'm more worried about the both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You've got nothing to worry about, now that we're all here.</td>

<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Mm. Welcome home.</td>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Master!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What recalcitrant sinners!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'll make you pay for that remark!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh, I'll do worse than that, Zheng Yi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'll see you RUINED.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
