<td>That being said, Lustburg is really cold, right? Isn't our clothing a problem?</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>On the way, we'll get some cold resistant clothing...hey! Hold on, Edgar!</td>

<td>Aren't those your friends over there?</td>

<td>004</td>
<td>What?</td>

<td>Little lady! Even you're here, Ronnie! You've been waiting for us all this time. You're making me get teary-eyed.</td>

<td>Now isn't the time for that! Don... They've abducted Don!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...? Hey, hold on, Ronnie. When people get abducted, they usually go for the women or children that are lightweight and easy to carry off.</td>

<td>The thing is...a bunch Alkaroids closed in on him and Don wasn't able to resist...and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Alkaroids? Didn't they stop moving after the Messiah was destroyed? And are you telling me that Taras just let them take him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's because he doesn't have any energy in his right arm! He used the energy to save this city. And, because of that, he's now been abducted!</td>

<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please...Edgar! Logi! Please save Taras!</td>

<td>Wh-what are you talking about? We shouldn't be wasting our time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I see. Very well then, I'll go on my own. I owe him a debt. Without his help, the Messiah would've finished me off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You too, Logi? Argh...fine! Not that I owe him anything!</td>

<td>Edgar!</td>

<td>Little lady, Ronnie, lead us in the direction that they took that idiot!</td>

<td>018</td>
<td>Is this some kind of factory? It's pretty old. Maybe it's an abandoned factory that the Beckram's destroyed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Thank you, Fiona, Ronnie. It's gonna get dangerous from here so the two of you best return to the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-what kind of nonsense is that?! We've come this far and you're gonna try to ditch us again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's not the case, Ronnie. Right now, the city is in a state of chaos with all the restoration that is going on. What I'm saying is that you should help them out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The volunteers that I brought along with me are the ones who are working on restoration. I'll show up later so do you think you can look after everything until then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uck...fine. But you better come later, Edgar! Just right now, you wandered off without saying anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fine, fine. Hurry up and go! From here it's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...time for the grown-ups to get to work.</td>
