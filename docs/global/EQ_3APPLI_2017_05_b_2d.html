<td>Ack... Wh-what happened...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey...why do you look like you're in so much pain? What is that monster...behind you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yuri and the other kunoichis defeated me...sent me to the bottom of the underworld...where I was supposed to sleep permanently...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>However, there was a voice that whispered in my ear... "Is this how you will end?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's when I realized...my true desire... At that time Uzushiomaru was already there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>The disappointment I was made to taste...the grief, the frustration...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I would share it with every single person in existence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why? Didn't Yuri and the others give you a peaceful end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hahahah! Why would I want a peaceful end...after having obtained power?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>With the power I obtained in the underworld, I can finally get revenge on everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Lisbeth...there's no convincing this person...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The underworld is an overwhelmingly dark world. The souls who fall there are basked in darkness, distorting them even further...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What a poor person... You sought too much power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I know someone like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They sought too much power...and lost the thing that was most important to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hahah! There is nothing that is important to me! I only have one wish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I want to cover all the worlds in darkness. I want to fill all humans...no, all living things with negative energy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>When I heard of the Sun Keys, I danced for joy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Just by stealing the keys from that wench, I could slam all the worlds into darkness just like I wanted to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Heheh. I got worried when some of the keys were removed...even if it was just a few.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But now, I'll take back the key from you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will remove the light from the all the worlds and plunge everything into darkness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're quite a strong-willed girl...but I'll soon send you to the underworld as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's a world where the dead mourn and not a shred of hope exists...a world that is pitch black!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll drop you in this world! By doing so, you will be able to experience what I felt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're fighting against me right now! Don't aim for them! Aim for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh? You seem to feel more pain when I attack your friends rather than you... In that case...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ack... I said don't do that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What an arrogant little girl. That gaze filled with light and hope...with trust for your friends and for the future! Nothing infuriates me more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heheh. I will send you to your ultimate despair...where not a shred of light exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>How convenient. I've now obtained your Sun Key.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>No way! I'll get it back right away! Along with the other keys...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ahahahah! Right away? You don't have such an opportunity anymore... Come at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What?! Sh-she broke the key...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>N-no!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Without the key, you can't control the sun anymore. The sun is now practically gone from that world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What? Then...there's no longer any sun in Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ahahaha! What a lovely face...sunken with despair, you little brat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Does that mean...this world is over?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ahahah! Yes! Bye bye, sun; hello, terrible misfortune! An era of death shrouded in darkness will begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Don't worry! It won't be just this world. I'll make sure all the other worlds follow suit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ahahahahah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>No...there's still a solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>With my remaining strength...I made a temporary barrier. Listen carefully, both of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Amaterasu...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>A solution...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I will become the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wait...what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>It's true that the Sun Key of Babel has been lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>However, if I become the new sun...then I can still save this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wh-what exactly does that mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>As the one responsible for the sun...I will use my final solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Your final solution?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I will unleash all the power of the sun within me...and engulf this place with light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It will purify the Fallen and return the Sun Keys she has to the sun again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You...you can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As for you two...you must take the two that are still not awake back in the pirate ship and leave here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But...if you become the sun...what will happen to you, Amaterasu?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You said it's the final solution. Does that mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No, you can't! We all came here to save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>If I could...of course I would like to go back with all of you! Especially now that we're all friends...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>But, that's why I want to become the sun...in order to save all of you...my friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This is something that only I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Thank you...for responding to my voice...for coming to save me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>For becoming my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I will continue to shine down on you from the sky of this world...always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>N-no...you can't! There must be another way...we can find it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I don't...have much time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>But I'm happy. After all, I can become the sun...and give strength to all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I love all of you...my friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>No...Amaterasu...how can you...? Sob...why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>The barrier will dissolve soon. This is goodbye...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No, Amaterasu! Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Aim the boat towards the sea! Save all of our friends!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>All right. I'll take responsibilityÂ and make sure we all get back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Thank you...Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>We're setting sail, Lisbeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>We cannot let our friend's ultimate sacrifice go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...! Sob...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>What is this barrier...? You're going to let them escape! I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Those...are my very words to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Huh?! You...!!! Ge-get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We'll go together...you fallen soul...or shall I call you by your true name, Kayako...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>?! Wh-what...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Hyaaaahh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Agggghhhhh!!! Le-let me go!!! My plan of eternal darkness...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I am the Sun God Amaterasu!!! I will not surrender to your dark desires!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Amaterasu!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The massive tidal wave generated by the explosion immediately sends all on the pirate ship back to their original world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Good bye...everyone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Amaterasu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Even if I have been defeated, another will come who will desire to plunge every world into darkness and fill them with despair...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>The intense sunlight engulfs the darkness and rises to the heavens...creating a new sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The pirate ship safely departs from the Twilight Zone. Yuri and Laevateinn, who had still been in battle with their nightmares, awaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>However, their lost friend would never return.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>...It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Oh! Look! The sun!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Looking up at the sky, they see the sun shining brighter than ever before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>So...Amaterasu brought light to this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>It's all over now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Thank you, everyone. Let's go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Huh? What about her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Her world has been saved. There's no reason to stay here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>But...I want to stay a little longer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Yuri, don't you have somewhere to return to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Yes, I do, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You have a world you need to return to as well, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So...this is goodbye. I don't feel ready for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>But the time that I spent with all of you...it wasn't bad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I feel the same! I'll never forget about everyone I met here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I guess this is the end of the adventure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Maybe someday in some world, we'll have another chance to go on an adventure together...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I'll look forward to that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>...Agreed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Me too, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td><p_name>...when that day comes...will you wear this hat again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>With all the confusion remaining from this incident...until the other worlds are saved, I don't think I can wear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Besides...after everything is finished, the person who this hat should be dedicated to...is her...Amaterasu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Yes...you're right...we should send this hat to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td><p_name> and the others look up at Amaterasu, now transformed into a radiant sun...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The pirate boat sails across the glistening sea towards the next world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>It travels the worlds...gathering all the Sun Keys...</td>
</tr>
