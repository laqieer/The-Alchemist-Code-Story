<td>What?! Was a snowman the culprit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm not a snowman! Well, I am a snowman...but not an ordinary one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Then...what are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm a spirit of the sacred snow! The name's Kyu. I'm from the Maruda tribe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Maruda tribe... I've never heard of it before. So...um, Kyu, did you do this terrible thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're the ones who are terrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Near the border of Slothstein</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>All right. Just a bit more and we'll have finished the deliveries for this year!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Was it just Slothstein that was left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yeah, that's right. But there aren't too many deliveries to be made in Sloth, so I think we'll finish quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's not like there are only a few children there. Is somebody else responsible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. Winter Holiday is deeply rooted in Sloth's culture, so, apparently, parents usually give their children presents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, we're going to be delivering the presents to children with no parents?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Well, it's a little different. We're going to be delivering the presents to all the districts besides one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sloth has a slum district called Real Heaven. Apparently, there's a real Santa there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A real Santa in a slum district? Isn't that pretty suspicious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well...if Santa's making all the children happy that can't be a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Everyone, look out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...?!</td>
