<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Noct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>More or less.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You've got moves as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...They're a persistent bunch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yeah. They've been chasing us relentlessly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(The situation seems more troublesome than I thought.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Does anything come to mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No, but it's unlikely we'll find anything here on the border.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I believe we should head to Slothstein and gather what information we can there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is that a city?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I've never been there myself, but it's a country with advanced mechanic technology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Apparently, they have the sort of vehicle you are riding on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A technologically advanced city... It seems worth checking out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The sun is setting. Let's hurry. We should be able to find lodging in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The sun is almost down, it would be dangerous to move about at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>True. It would be safer to wait the night here and wait for dawn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm hungry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let's camp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Come on! I wanted to stay at a hotel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A camp, huh? Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fortunately, our camping equipment is in the Regalia, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We lack sufficient food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm fine with eating a piece of toast or a plate of rice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>As it happens, I've been eyeing that patch of vegetables just over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are we seriously going to eat that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm not sure of how edible they are myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>When it comes to your cooking, Iggy, I wouldn't mind eating unfamiliar vegetables. That being said, looks like a Behemoth has just shown up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...Really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Hmm. I guess that would be the unfamiliar monster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Now we've got something to hunt.</td>
