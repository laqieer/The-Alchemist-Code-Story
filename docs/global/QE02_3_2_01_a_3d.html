<td>He-hey. Are you two all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course, we are. After all, he went easy on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Went easy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Every blow that he dealt us was restrained.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If he wanted it, we'd be grabbing drinks in the next life just about now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He means he could've killed us whenever he wanted to. Agh! And you're sure he was wearing the Blue Flame Guard's coat of arms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Of course, I'm sure. The way he fought and that red hair of his...tsk...why didn't I realize sooner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yeah. Now that I think about it, he's the spitting image of Zeke. Cripes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Zeke?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Once called the Hero of the Continent, he was Captain of the Blue Flame Guard from the now decimated Kingdom of Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Are you telling me that you've fought against the great sinner Zeke who plotted the rebellion that led to the fall of Envylia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yep. We were hired by the remnants of Wratharis...and were beat to a pulp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Tsk. Now there's a face I could've lived without recalling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I recall correctly, his oldest son was called Logi. I heard he died, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What is he plotting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no point in contemplating that now. Quick! Let's pursue him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wa-wait, Don! What about Tango and the others?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What about them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Are you serious? They're fighting against a horde of Alkaroids down there! Your right arm is at risk, Don!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Haha. Very funny. My right arm is right hereâ€”safe and sound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are you seriously gonna stand by and let them get massacred?! Tango is risking his life for you, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Ronnie, once all this is over, I want you to quit the underworld. You're not suited for this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm talking about their resolve. You don't understand the resolve of my men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Resolve...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They all resolved themselves when they stepped into this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The act of clumsy kindness that you suggested would only serve to stain their resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We of the mafia are connected through invisible trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tango!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Come on. I'm not so helpless that I need worrying over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Don, we destroyed them all. The others are pursuing the trail of the hoof prints we discovered earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmph. You took your time, didn't you? There's not a moment to lose. Let's hurry on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, Don. What are you standing around for? If you want to be favored by Don then you better be the first to move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh...? Ah! Go-got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Heh. Well then. You're not going anywhere, you red-headed scoundrel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The hooves seem to be stretching on much further. They're moving at a speed beyond imagination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's best to discard logic when trying to perceive that knight's movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hm? Hey...wait a second. Something's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wha...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Whoaaa?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well, that shook pretty hard. Was it an earthquake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huff...huff! Se-seriously, this is bad for my heart! Someone has it in for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Actually, it didn't shake that much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This guy's a wimp when it comes to things like earthquakes and thunder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>He looks scary, but deep inside he's a damsel. Aren't you, Tara baby?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Shut up! This could very well lead to a terrifying natural disaster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm sure this is Mayor Edward's wrath to you greedy idiots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh? The old man's wrath?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Ever since he died...there have been more and more earthquakes every day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Most likely, the air pollution is the cause. The greedy idiots are trying to change the physics of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You should bring that up with them directly. We've got more pressing matters to attend to. Here come the androids!</td>
