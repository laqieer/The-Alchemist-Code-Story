<td>You just don't have the basics down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>What good are the basics anyways?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>They're useful for everything that comes after them. Knowing letters leads to reading. Dexterity leads to wielding a weapon. Your choice of location can support a lifestyle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I haven't ever needed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Well, Lost Blue is where you can't get it even if you want it. There's no foundation for life. That's why nobody can even think to hope for a decent future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Consider your magic attacks. Without any basic training, you must have put significant effort into refining it as much as you have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Right?! Isn't Ex Atmosphere great? I referenced the Legend of Lost Blue for my magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Ah, imitation is one of the first steps of learning. That's not a bad example you found to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Yeah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>But the name is a bit too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I suppose it'll come in handy when you're trying to show off, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>You ought to think of a shorter name.</td>
</tr>

<td>Maybe I was naive, but...</td>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>By following him, I believed I could see light shine down into this sunless underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Dragons still exist. Even if we can't see them with our eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>The current ruling class of this world. The inequality we suffer thanks to the outer world that surrounds Lost Blue. Malice, deceit, and the so-called absolute justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>They are beasts that deem us to be evil so that they can bare their teeth and prey upon us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>So, let us fight back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Even if it seems impossible, we need to become strong enough to change the world before Greed Dike cheats us to death or else there is no tomorrow for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>It is an almost hopeless suicide mission. A fantastic squandering of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>He throws out such grandiose notions when he gets excited, I can hardly keep up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>But I never knew one could live life like that. The thought of it—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Gets your blood pumping, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Hm... We'll need at least seven members.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Seven...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>To overthrow the absolute justice of this world, we'll need to eliminate the seven Holy Guard regiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>There are seven captains of these regiments, all almost as strong as Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>To counter this, we need seven warriors of comparable strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>No, we'll be needing ten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Why's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>The more the merrier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Ha! Now you're getting it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I mean, we are trying to topple the world, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Aside from the Seven Kingdoms of Babel, there's Saga, the Desert Zone, and Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>So you've been studying. Seems like teaching you how to read was not a waste after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Seven nations and three regions. We'll crush them all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>What is greater than that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Let's name the team the Dragon Slayers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>That's...almost cool. In an ironic way, maybe, if you look at it in the right light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>What? Are you saying this all seems like hot air to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I think it sounds like we're talking about ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I want to bring daylight to Lost Blue, a land without sky nor sea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I want to create a world where wrong isn't corrected but is instead considered to be the new truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>To the world of villains, I want to bring...the sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Are you going to be that sun?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>No, I'm not worthy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Why not? You're—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I'm not that benevolent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>But...what about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>You've shown me benevolence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Well, you're special.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>The hell does that supposed to mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I can't be bothered to be the shining light for the masses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I prefer to simply be a pioneer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>A pioneer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>To find the path, to blaze the trail, all so that those behind me can follow in my steps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>It is the pioneers who pave the path ahead, but it is those who follow that expand the path even further.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Huh, I didn't take you for a poet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I'm just quoting some philosophy. It was from a book I found in the trash.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>"If one paves a path, others will follow and they shall broaden and expand it as they go."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>But are you sure that's what you want? To be the one who disregards your own security for the sake of hypothetical others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Well, I'll be able to rejoice when I see people following in my footsteps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I've got my pride, so I won't let them catch up to me. I'll keep blazing on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I sometimes can't tell if you just trust the people at your back that much or if you actually don't like them to be too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Guess I'm leaving that up to them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><img src="../img/backgrounds/bg10.png" alt="bg10"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>So, what do you say? Let's get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>One can attain immense power considered to be the origin of the Alchemy Source at the top of the Mystic Tower Veda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>There are things you can achieve along the way. For you, that's whatever you can learn from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>I'd hate to be in debt to you, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>You've got your policy to live by, right? Try and steal them from me before I'm too far ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Use your magic and martial skills: combine what you have gleaned from following legends of old and what you've studied from my moves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Be the best of both magic and might!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yuvan</td>
<td>Easier said than done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Ha! You've understood something important, then. Talk is easy. Making it happen... Now that's another story, rife with failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Isn't that what youth, or Yuvan is all about?</td>
