<td>So you're also...seeking the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I've heard rumors that it was at the Beckrams. I approached them in order to find its whereabouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But...you couldn't find it there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I couldn't. They're working up a frenzy in order to find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>This made me think that you must be aware of its location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you tell me where it is, I'll release you immediately. Where is the Sacred Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why are you looking for Belphegor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have no intention of telling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I cannot give you an answer no matter how much you ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't know anything about the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sorry but just take your answer at face value. There must be a reason why the Beckrams are chasing you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's the truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't you think that I wish I had answers as to why things have ended up this way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You don't seem to be lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>But...there's something that connects to the whereabouts of the Sacred Stone if you don't realize it yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Do you know about the Door of Truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The Door of Truth...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Aye, it's the place with something spinning around that gives you power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...How do you know about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I went with Edgar, aye! Fiona hasn't been there yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are you talking about the strange world that you saw when you fell off the cliff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Edgar, huh? Looks like I'll have to have another conversation with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I want to talk with you a little as well. Would that be all right, you chivalrous little knight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Aye?</td>
