<td>Aarrghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't worry, Zahar. I'm going with you. It's almost time. Uckkkaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Goodbye...Captain Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I am Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I am the King of Darkness, the messiah who will rise from the shadows to bring a new order to this corrupted world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I am Zahar. I am—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Shadow Messiah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>H-have they really come to attack us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Cleric, leave this area to me. You must run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That simply will not do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You dogs of the Holy Order! Purveyors of false justice, deceitful bringers of fraudulent light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You, who distort the laws of the world to your own benefit... We throw off the chains of your hollow authority!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>E-eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You dare to brandish your sword at Lord Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hyaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>O-ohh... H-Holy Guard knights, to me! Protect me! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hmph. Look at you. All alone with no one to save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Shh... The shadows are whispering for your death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Ah, shuddap, you. Listen to me, cleric. Those Paladin guards of yours? They're dead. They ain't comin' for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Y-you... What do you want? I c-can give you money! Lots of money? Just name your price! Please, just let me live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Money? Tch. What are we gonna do with sumthin' like that? It just makes assholes outta perfectly nice folk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The fleeting pleasures it affords are empty and cruel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>An illusion of something you've always wanted. Just a facsimile of the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Indeed... We shall not build the new world on something so false and hollow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What do we want? There is only one thing we want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Salvation by darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Salvation...by darkness...? Ha...hahahahaha! Y-you all must be joking! This world needs light! This world needs the Holy Order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your pathetic defense of your corrupted existence sounds no more intelligent than the braying of a frightened animal. One as depraved as yourself could never understand the glory of our cause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Be grateful that I shall now bestow upon you the honor of turning your wasted life into something a little more useful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No, Zahar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That voice... Hm. Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I came to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Stop me...? You? Hahahahahaha! Fool, what absurd jokes you tell!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Zahar, how could you have become this? You were once a man revered by many as the rising star of the Holy Guard, and then as the Hero of Wratharis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Justice. I do this for justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What here looks like justice to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Do you not see...? No. Of course you don't. Just like these dogs of the Holy Order of Babel, you subscribe to the idea that there is only one correct way to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Arrogant fools, all of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Ack! Zahar, stop this already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hahaha! Try and stop me...if you can!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I shall usher in a new age! A world that craves eternal darkness! As supreme ruler, I shall herald the truth of the world! I will not be stopped by the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You will never succeed! I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! I am here to provide backup—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No, Spica! He's mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>B-but...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Spica! Look, the Scarlet Flame Guard! Come on, I could use your help taking them down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Urk...! You're strong...but that's not enough to take me down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Th-this is my chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Chance for what? Escape? Not gonna happen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Umph?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Tsk tsk tsk... Gonna run off an' save your own hide? What kinda example are you settin'? Shameful. Time for you to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I won't let that happen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ugh, the Scarlet Flame Guard! Always gettin' in the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Shuddap before I shut it for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You still think you can get away?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Urk?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Surrender. Hell will welcome you with open arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Pl-please save me! I'm begging you! Look, I have gold—all this and more!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>J-just take it and leave me—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>How pitiful... Did you not understand? Your money holds no sway over us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Eeeeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>N-no! Do you know who I am?! I am a cleric of the Holy Order!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>My power should be enough to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Urgggh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We shall take the Philosopher's Stone off your hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Bah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We have accomplished what we came here for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Lord Zahar, let us withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Cleric! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>This is no time to be worried about anyone else, Vettel! Your overconfidence shall be the death of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Urgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Ah, I suppose you are not a terrible swordsman. You were able to stop my sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Zahar... I will stop you here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You're starting to sound like a broken record!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>It seems our esteemed leader has gotten distracted by that redheaded knight. He's not responding to my call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I see. Perhaps he will listen to me. Oh, Lord Zahar...? We have the Philosopher's Stone. It is time to leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Very well. We will finish this another time, Vettel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You dare flee, Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Be grateful, Vettel. I'm letting you live...until we meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Dangit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Vettel... We failed in protecting the cleric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Curses! This is what you call justice, Zahar?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>The mission went well, Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The appearance of the Scarlet Flame Guard was something of a surprise, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Whatever! They hardly put up any sorta fight against us! Right, Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Lord...Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Lord Zahar. You are too focused on your personal battle with that Vettel. Our ambitions are grander than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I am aware.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Anyway, come on. A girl's gotta eat! The squirt's waiting on us, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>How curious, Ila. I didn't know the two of you had gotten so close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Wh-what? That's got nuthin' to do with it, I just get sick of the squirt's whimpering if we're away for too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Heh heh... There's no point in hiding it! Everyone can tell that you're secretly worried!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I am not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Lord Zahar. It seems that we have some...uninvited guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Ah... It's you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The Corpse... You Holy Order trash! Dogs! Show yourselves! I know you're here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You have become a liability. Mark our words... You shall not have much longer to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>How lovely. It seems that the Holy Order of Babel has begun to take us seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Welcome back, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Didja hold down the fort properly while we were gone, squirt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Yeah! Oh?! Ila, your face... You've been wounded!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Huh? This? It's nuthin' to worry about. Forget about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Leave it, a'ight? I told you, it's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>S-Sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Aw, Mia! Wanna hear something good? Ila was all in a rush to get back here because she was worried about you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Wait, what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>R-really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I never said that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Heh heh... Come on, Mia! I bet Ila is just too shy to admit that she would loooove for you to help her take care of her wound.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Shuddap, Silma! Could you keep your trap shut for once?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>What is it, Lord Zahar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>It's nothing. I shall rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>What is on your mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I...need more power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I do not have the strength to defeat Vettel, the Scarlet Flame Guard, and the Holy Order... Perhaps I do not have the power to establish an order of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>You are the conqueror who shall become the king of darkness. You must have the strength to bear that burden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Listen to me, Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>You and I were destined to meet. It is my fate to become your strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Thank you...sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Just promise me that my death will be quick and painless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Letitia, you were the only one in that prison who would smile at me. You are everything to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Sister and mother all in one... My only family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>(Ah, yes... That guileless promise from long ago.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Zahar. Wake up. The morning has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Good morning, Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Good morning, Letitia!</td>
