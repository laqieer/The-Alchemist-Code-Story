<td>He doesn't look like he's lying...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Indeed...</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Still, it's strange. His true loyalties should be with those knights we are facing, and yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If he speaks the truth, it means he deserted his army, or even—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He must have his own reasons, fellow countrymen or not. We all have our own goals.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I mean... Maybe... But...</td>

<td>(I feel like there's sorrow in those eyes... Am I just imagining it?)</td>

<td>Andechs? The honorable knight that reports directly to King Arius?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Why would you point your sword at us?! You joined the pacifist faction or something? Running from war is a coward's move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What do you think you're doing?! Protecting the scum of the Invidia Belt? Swinging your blade at your compatriots?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Do you bear no loyalty to your own kingdom?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haaah... I had far too much time to think about those things on my journey over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Are my actions truly just? Aren't I just dragging my pride and convictions through the mud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That said...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Seeing you all fighting here somehow cleared my head. Finally, I thought, I don't have to keep hesitating! I know what's the right thing to do, if you catch my drift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You can't be serious—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Though you are knights as I am, to me you may as well be strangers! Don't involve civilians in your war!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Agh—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Trampling another's peace for your own glory and victory... When did the Ira Belt Knights start walking down the wrong path?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wait, you're an Ira Belt Knight?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey now, no need to put your guard up. Didn't I just fight at your side?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Let's leave the questions and incredulities for later, shall we? Keep your eye on what's happening right in front of you. We're trying to prevent a tragedy over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah... You're right. Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wow, that was easier than I thought. Well, that's fine, as long as you don't give in that easily to everyone, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's because humans show their most genuine side when surprised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Happy I gave a hand to a bunch of good folk then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Gnh! We've already achieved the most important thing! Let's fall back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...They just left? What a safe and uninteresting move. Who is leading these knights?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Looks like the situation has settled down a little... So you better start telling us what your deal is. You look just like these Ira Belt fellows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ah... Well, it's a bit of a long story, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Emmel! Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's clear up all the loose ends first. Then we can gather everyone and I'll tell you my story.</td>
