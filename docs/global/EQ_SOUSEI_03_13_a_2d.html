<td>A black knight... Could he be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm sure of it. He's the corruption wielder who killed the last Vessel of Purification!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We of the Infinite Serpent intend to save this world. Our goal is not to extend the duration of this filth-ridden land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What harm could there be in leaving just one place steeped in sin like so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Can you not forgive such a small and insignificant blemish?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If this little experiment succeeds, the Cursed Beasts will no longer be a threat to humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Then, we will have no reason to fear that little thing called "sin".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>By owning up to their own sins and using them as a resource, every region could achieve new heights of development.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What brighter future could there be for the world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>With minimal sacrifice, we could open the future to so many more...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is the mission I delegated to myself as a researcher.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's the very reason I live; the reason why I feel I deserve to exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you see? This is my salvation, Zafeiris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It seems that we cannot see eye to eye. As such, we can no longer remain allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It is time for you to be swallowed up by Belphegor's corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Such is a fitting end for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I may not have had an advantage in the tunnels, but this clocktower is also my research facility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Don't think that you can take me out so easily on my turf!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>This is the same substance as the belt of magil that restrains the Cursed Beast...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, but not only that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's...absorbing magil?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This magil belt is an Anti-Curse device I created to quell the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Unless I'm quite mistaken, it should have a profound effect on the Fallen and those like yourself who use the power of corruption to your own ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You underestimate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"O Belphegor! Devour the Sloth that glints in thine eye!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Groooogghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The Cursed Beast... It's moving?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Warning! Belphegor has partially overcome the restraints of the magil belt and is presently drawing on a vast quantity of magil from its outer shell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No! Our bid for control...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Down with you, Pursuer of Sloth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You will not escape. Your obsession with the future you dream of ends here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"I am the key that opens the gate!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I didn't expect to run into you here and now, but I have a whole lot of questions for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Well, well, a survivor of the Sephira... The inhabitants of the Gula Belt Region who wield strange powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nimul?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Adaleigh! Get out of here and join up with the others!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, but—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This man... He's the one who killed Emmel's predecessor...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Do you understand what that means?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I... I do! Leave Emmel to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Come on, Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If... If you're fighting, I'll stay and fight, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There's no need. Have faith in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nimul... Okay. I will. Just...be safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You may not believe me, but I will say it anyway...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I have no interest in that woman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Either way, I cannot just let you walk out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're the one who threw our village—our home—into chaos! I can't just forget that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Revenge, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Maybe so, but it doesn't end there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>You've said it before... That you mean to save the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So why do you align yourself with the Cursed Beasts? Do you mean to steep the world in corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>There is no point in answering you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I just... I can't see you as someone who wants to hurt others and stamp out their hopes! That kind of villainy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I am willing to soak myself in sin in order to save this world. Such is the depth of my conviction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No matter how much blood must be spilled... If it saves the world, then it is worth it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>There really is no meeting halfway for you and I, then... Our ways of thinking, and the futures we strive toward are just too different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What will it be, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I will defeat you here and now, and then join my companions to take on Belphegor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I see... Then you believe the world can be saved that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You have been found guilty of this crime. By the power invested in me, I sentence you!</td>
</tr>
