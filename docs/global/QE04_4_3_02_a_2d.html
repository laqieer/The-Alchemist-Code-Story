<td>The dragon's ceased its fire and water attacks, and it's slower as well. They must have prevailed...right?</td>

<td>The fool! He's the one that brought on this whole dang situation! Now he's gone and left us the mess to clean up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We do not have time to wallow in grief. Tehre has shown us how to destroy the cores.</td>

<td>Blast it... Destroying one of its cores has only made it stronger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It's just getting started. Look, the back's glowing red...which means it's about to use fire again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Aye, but even so, we can't just give up.</td>
