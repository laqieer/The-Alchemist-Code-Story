</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/othi.png" alt="Othima" height="128"><br>Othima</td>
<td>It's a safe bet. And as you know, I have valuable clients there. So do me a favor and go check in on them for me, will you?</td>

<td>Oh, these are just incantation gears.</td>

<td>Why're you bringing so many?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>

<td>That...seems excessive. Can you carry all those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Sure can! They're heavy, but I can manage. Remember: nothing is impossible if you put in the effort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>You keep saying that, but do you know why people don't always put in all the effort they possibly could?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Huh?! No, really! I'm fine. I can carry them on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Can and should are two different things. Besides, it'll be more effort for me to have to walk slower to keep pace with you because you're weighed down with all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Now, enough dilly-dallying. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/wilh.png" alt="Wilhelm" height="128"><br>Wilhelm</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>W-wait up, Magnus!</td>
