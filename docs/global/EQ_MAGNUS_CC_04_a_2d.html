<td>001</td>
<td>Magnus! Will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's up, Ryui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's up? "What's up?" I'll tell you what's up, Magnus! You haven't submitted a single report this week!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Rep...ort? What's a report?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're impossible! Quit joking around, this isn't funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein himself told me to pass on the message, and he was furious, let me tell you! I could practically see the smoke coming out of his ears! It was terrifying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh. That probably has less to do with the report, and more to do with the fact that we absolutely trounced him at cards last night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What?! Ugh... Why am I always the one paying for your mistakes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I really thought you might have learned something after that incident with the gambling tournament...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But I see you're still just as content to waste people's hard-earned taxes as before. Well, regardless, those reports need doing, and you're going to get them done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Here. I expect you to complete every last one of these, from oldest to new, and be thorough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Look, I'll even help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Good. You get started on those, and I'll join in later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No! We're both going to start, right now. We're doing this together. It's more fun that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You're the ones who showed me that, you know. There's a lot I can learn from you two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You see, "fun" was an alien concept to me in Real Heaven, but now I see that enjoyment and effort can go hand in hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is working with us really what you want to do with your life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm? Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Just making conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Haha. You want to procrastinate that badly, huh? Well, no can do! We have to finish this pile by the end of today. Understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is that any way to speak to someone who's helping you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>How's this? Yes, ma'am. Right away, ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Sounds like you three are having fun in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hello, Mister Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't tell me you're here to ask me to run another errand for you? My hands are really full at the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I keep telling you, it's Captain Othima now. And it's not exactly an errand, but I do have a favor to ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I don't see how that's any different, but...okay. What can I do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I want you to sell this new incantation gear for me. I think you'd have an easier time navigating the buyer's location than I would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All right. Where do I need to go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is that a problem?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>No... Of course not. Sure thing. I'll go get ready to head out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Every time... She'd never go back on her own initiative, and refuses to visit unless I'm paying her for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>All things considered...you two should go with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Huh? Why us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>To tell you the truth, there are signs that something shady is brewing in Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Does this have anything to do with that Purification Plan you mentioned the other day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's a safe bet. And as you know, I have valuable clients there. So do me a favor and go check in on them for me, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Fine. I'll get it done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm back! Sorry for the wait. It took me a while to get everything together. Are you two ready to head out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Do you really need that much stuff?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you planning on doing a lap around Babel on the way back, or something? What do you even need to bring that fills a rucksack and two trunks?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Oh, these are just incantation gears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Why're you bringing so many?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hee hee... It's sort of a force of habit. I just thought these things might come in handy. Oh! But, don't worryâ€”I didn't forget my first aid kit and whatnot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I mean, you never know what you might need, right? So it's best to bring something for every scenario, just in case!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That...seems excessive. Can you carry all those?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Sure can! They're heavy, but I can manage. Remember: nothing is impossible if you put in the effort!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You keep saying that, but do you know why people don't always put in all the effort they possibly could?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Because it's hard. Now, c'mon, give me one of those bags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?! No, really! I'm fine. I can carry them on my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Can and should are two different things. Besides, it'll be more effort for me to have to walk slower to keep pace with you because you're weighed down with all that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now, enough dilly-dallying. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Heheh. He just can't handle the thought of someone thinking he's a nice guy, can he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>W-wait up, Magnus!</td>
</tr>
