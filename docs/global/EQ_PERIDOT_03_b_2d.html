<td>Ah. They're leaving in quite an extravagant fashion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>They're from Gluttony Foss. Most likely, they were attempting to capture me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Well, as a compromise you could live in the village near the forestâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>More importantly, are your injuries okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, ouch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Honestly. You're such a troublesome... Come on. We're going home. I need to look after your injuries.</td>

<td>What's the matter?</td>

<td>My voice reached the animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Did you figure out why the beasts didn't respond to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. I'm sure what the animals wanted to say was this:</td>

<td>That even if it's not there anymore, as long as I remember the forest, it will not disappear.</td>

<td>017</td>
<td>Do you need me to guide you outside of the forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No. I'm okay. Thanks to you, I'm all right now.</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I see.</td>

<td>Come to Lustburg some day. It's really a lovely city. Next time, I'll show you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No, I'd rather not.</td>

<td>A stubborn person like me is much better suited for the forest than amongst flocks of people.</td>
</tr>

<td>023</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Of course, there's also the option of you staying in the forest and living here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I can't do that. If I stay here, I'm sure I'll continue to rely on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I can't call myself your friend if I'm relying on and clinging to you.</td>

<td>The two of us will never meet again. He will die in his city in the way he so desires.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I will also live in the place that I desire...and live in the way that I desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I will wait, wait, and continue to wait. And if I get tired of waiting, well...going on a journey might not be a bad idea.</td>
