<td>I won't let you get away with any of this! Suzuka, get going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>G-got it! Mistress... Good luck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmph... Such a determined little face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It will come to nothing against me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Urgh! Watch yourself, girl... Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ack! Why you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>She not only met my sword, but...even managed to turn the strike against me! No... Was she just lucky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Kanon... Just now, that was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>U-um, this is hard to say, but that was pure luck. He just happened to be where my instincts wanted to swing my sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Your instincts...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>My body just did what felt right, but...it's really incredible that even at such close range, I can't follow his movements at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I remember Captain Othima saying something about how the Templars seemed to just pop in and out of thin air. I'd better be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Apparently that man's movements cannot be seen with the eye alone. Something about...navigating between different spaces...? Am I correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nngh... Yeah... Something like that... They're using a space that's similar to the world beyond the Door of Truth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A different space...? That cannot be seen with the eyes alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Kanon, focus on what is before you. This isn't a puzzle you have time to think through right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But...perhaps if I can understand the root of his ability to move like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Leave that to me, Kanon. You need only spend your energy fighting with all that you've got.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Good. Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What could you be planning? How amusing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>He's gone?! Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Stay calm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No... I don't believe this is the correct time for calm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>D-don't worry about me...! Besides... I think I'm starting to catch on to what he's doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Nngh... K-Kanon...prepare yourself! The next time he appears...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>What?! B-but I still don't understand his movements.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're bluffing. None of you can sense my presence while I'm in the other dimension, which means you cannot guess where I will appear next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I wonder...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So you're committed to your bluff? Well... All I need do is prove that you have no idea what you're talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>He disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain Cadanova!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Unfortunately, he is right... I cannot sense his presence while he's in the other dimension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you serious?! Th-then what the heck are you planning?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Calm down. Last time, I noticed that while I couldn't sense him while he was in the other dimension, I could pinpoint where he would appear. You need only aim for that spot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Where he will appear...? How?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Kanon, earlier you said it was just pure luck that you managed to land a hit on him. I think it was more than just chance. Do you understand me? Just listen to the voice of your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Voice of the sword...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>This is something only you can do, Kanon. You have one chance to make this work. This is the time to take advantage of the leverage you have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What?! W-wait, I'm telling you, I need more of an explanation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Once he learns the trick, you'll lose the element of surprise! There's no way for me to explain more without giving it away completely!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>B-but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The voice of the sword...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You'll be fine. I believe that you'll be able to catch him this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wishful thinking will get you nowhere. How quaint that the man known as the Flame Dragon King would fall to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>?! Hm?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Impressive! You were able to defend against my strike...but I certainly wouldn't say you have been able to effectively read my moves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I knew it... This sword... It was created by Yogi Ku, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Heh... The one who can read your moves, who will be your downfall...is not me. It is someone who I have entrusted my legacy to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>As you say... Leave this to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I heard it this time... Excalibur's voice! Huzzzaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Grk...!!!</td>
