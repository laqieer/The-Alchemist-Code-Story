<td>001</td>
<td>Agh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Where...am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Looks like you're yourself again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're Seida of the Alize people! What am I doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It seems like you were under some kind of curse. You don't remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>A curse?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh... It seems like you're right. I'm ashamed of myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did you remember something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's the opposite. I don't remember anything after I ran into that man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That man. You can't be talking about...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know his name, but he was a strange one. He was dressed completely in black.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I knew it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>His name is Waginau and he's a really bad guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>As the Holy Guard, we are on a mission to defeat Waginau and those who pull the strings behind him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hm. I see. I can sort of agree with you. He obviously didn't seem like a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then why did you let him cast a spell on you?! You should've run away immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Of course, I had no intention to indulge him. However, he told me that knew the location of the Godwolf Asena's nest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The Godwolf Asena?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's a legendary wolf that originates here in Saga. It is said to be the beast that is closest to the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It's the prey that I've dedicated my life to. That man showed me the Godwolf's fur that glistened with the colors of the rain. He told me that he knew where its nest was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And he asks you to defeat us in exchange for the location of the nest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It appears so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I had no intention of listening to him, but he took advantage of my wavering heart. I am quite ashamed of myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If that's the case, we're done here. I told you earlier, but we're in a hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, I can't let you go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It doesn't sit well with me to let you continue on after my discourteous actions against you. If there's something I can do, I'd like to assist you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What an inefficient offer. We take no offense by your earlier actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's a matter of my own conscience. Perhaps all I can do is offer my services as a bodyguard, but please let me make up for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A bodyguard? Ohh, Seida! The people of Alize...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Is there something I can do? Please, do not hesitate to ask. This will also stand as proof of the friendship between my people and yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You're right. Well then, would you go to the clinic that is further up ahead from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There you should find those from my people of Alize sheltered there. I want you to take them somewhere far away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm. So your people are at the clinic. Understood. Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She's gone. All things said she was a good person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. Although somewhat simple-minded. Let's hurry on as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There's nowhere left for you to hide. Show us your identity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Welcome, knights of the Holy Guard, Captain of the 4th...and Demonic Spearman Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So...it wasn't a trick of the eye after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What are you doing here?! Emperor of Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Lion Monarch Orion!</td>
</tr>
