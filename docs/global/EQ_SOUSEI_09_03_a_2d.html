<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>So their weapon was useless. Utterly devoid of meaning, too. No weapon could possibly have made a dent, ultimately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>Its power was irrelevant. Ouroboros simply diverted their attacks, impervious to their paltry attempts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>Eventually, they reconsidered their strategy: If attacking from the outside wouldn't work, they'd attack from the inside.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>They created something modeled after Ouroboros herself to fool her defenses, like a Trojan horse.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/bian.png" alt="Bianca" height="128"><br>Bianca</td>
<td>Made from a piece of the Shell of the World, engraved with the anguish of the dragons... It is a second vessel for Ouroboros.</td>

<td>I am but a spirit created from the crumbling ashes of this world, born from the regrets of a girl who no longer has a name.</td>
