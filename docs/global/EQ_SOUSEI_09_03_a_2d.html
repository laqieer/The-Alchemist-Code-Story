<td>Therefore, I must insist that you return what we are owed.</td>

<td>Wh-what?!</td>

<tr>

<td>You must have realized by now. That power is not meant to be controlled by any one person.</td>

<td>Once upon a time, there was a group of people who decided to create a weapon for the purpose of destroying Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>They did not know it at the time, but they were approaching their goal from the wrong perspective. Nonetheless, they did finish making their weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What they didn't understand is that Ouroboros is much like a breakwater, securely encircling the world and keeping it safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So their weapon was useless. Utterly devoid of meaning, too. No weapon could possibly have made a dent, ultimately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Its power was irrelevant. Ouroboros simply diverted their attacks, impervious to their paltry attempts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Eventually, they reconsidered their strategy: If attacking from the outside wouldn't work, they'd attack from the inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>They created something modeled after Ouroboros herself to fool her defenses, like a Trojan horse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>And that was...you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It was that stone you carry within yourself now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Made from a piece of the Shell of the World, engraved with the anguish of the dragons... It is a second vessel for Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I am but a spirit created from the crumbling ashes of this world, born from the regrets of a girl who no longer has a name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I contain memories...or perhaps the memories are what contain me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They are the final memories of our failure, our fallacy, and our lingering folly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I am their last promise for absolution. That is my reason for existing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And for that...you used us...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That dragon sleeping within your chest, fighting to awaken... That is what I desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>This time, I will make certain that Ouroboros dies by my hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Gnrgh... As if...I would make it so easy for you!</td>
