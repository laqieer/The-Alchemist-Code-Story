<td>…*Sigh* It's a little early to break for recess, but it's not like we're getting much talking done…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I thought Greed Dike and Wadatsumi could settle their differences by jointly managing the Mikaboshi…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Greed Dike should have control of the Mikaboshi! We can take care of it properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nothing good will come from giving power to a group of heretics!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(I used to regard the people of Wadatsumi as heretics…until I met Yomi. Thanks to her, I've gained a valuable new perspective.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(As Greed Dike's general…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(I must end the fighting. I must do so for my friend, whose wounds have yet to heal.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>General! I've been looking all over for you. So this is where you've been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…Yes, forgive me. I needed a moment to cool my head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The meeting is about to recommence. Better head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>…What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…Actually, the meeting has been suspended to accommodate a visit by the Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>…The Lord Commander?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>(The handling of the Mikaboshi is an important topic indeed, but I wouldn't have thought the Lord Commander himself would…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(…He must think there's a threat to peace percolating in Greed Dike.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…I see. Thank you. I'll make my way there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…Um, General Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Um...It's not your fault the meeting isn't going well…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>So...please try not to overexert yourself. We're here for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Overexert myself? Don't be silly! I don't know the meaning of the word. I'm a general, aren't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let's go. The Lord Commander should have arrived by now. We can't keep him waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh… M-my apologies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…Making my subordinates worry--what a rookie mistake…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Pleased to meet you. I am Lord Commander Basheeny. Allow me to be brief…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'd like to request your immediate help with the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>My help? I could've sworn you came here because you doubted us…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Why would you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>B-Because…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There's no reason for me to doubt anybody in Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kagura told me all about you--a Greed Dike general and an ally to Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>She said you risked your life defending Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>…S-She's too kind. I just did what I thought had to be done--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I had to fulfill my duties as general, and to help Wadatsumi and my friend…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Whatever the motivations, your actions speak volumes. Yomi also spoke highly of your character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yomi did--did she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Because of the importance of this meeting and your position as a general, she was worried that you might overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yomi said that… I'm sure she's even worse off than I am, but she still worries about me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How dependable can I be if I make Yomi worry about me, especially when her health isn't great?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Give me the full report.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Greed Dike extremists are attending the meeting about the management of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Until recently they were a relatively small group, barely on our radar…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But I've heard rumors they're after the Mikaboshi in order to bolster their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So that's why you came to meet in person…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>If that's true, then Yomi has a lot on her plate. I'll have my most trusted men assist in guarding the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'd appreciate that greatly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I had planned to keep a sharp eye on instigators at the meeting, but I never thought they'd try to steal the Mikaboshi…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I'll take it upon myself to monitor their movements and connections. I'm sure we can learn things from the inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>If this blows up, all our efforts to establish a peaceful relationship will have been for naught. That would be inexcusable to the people of Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I won't allow them to be this reckless!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm grateful for that offer, but... You could also try to conclude the meeting yourself. What do you intend to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Of course, that's my responsibility as well. I'll do both to the best of my ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Perhaps you should focus all your attention on the meeting. I heard it wasn't going very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>… Why don't you let your subordinates gather intel from the inside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I couldn't possibly--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…Who knows what lengths the extremists are willing to go. If there are any mishaps, my men could be in danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It'll be…just like that time the ogre blood illness….</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...So, I will protect the Mikaboshi and find and detain all the radicals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That way everyone will be safe--the Mikaboshi, my troops and even Yomi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…The radicals are sure to view you as an obstacle. Please keep your wits about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Yes, I will…I don’t want to be taken hostage and have my men put in a difficult position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt, General Leafah! Fights have broken out at the meeting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The Greed Dike faction and the Wadatsumi faction are clashing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What!? I've got to stop this immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Um, General…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>…I should probably go, too. The extremists may be whipping up the crowds. Can you take me there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>...Yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(Discussions only lead to disputes about the Mikaboshi's power… Building a world of peace isn't easy.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(I bet Kanon would know how to handle this… Well…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>(I promised I would protect the world she entrusted to me and lead it to the future. I can't lose hope now…)</td>
</tr>
