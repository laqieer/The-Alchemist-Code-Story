<td>Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That was the last one. Why don't you show yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're as strong as the rumors say. Definitely worth the trouble of finding you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I expect there's no need for me to introduce myself. I assume you already have a dossier on me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So this was a test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We should talk. Come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I never expected to receive an invitation from the famed Desert Wings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Uh, yeah, flattery won't get you anywhere. All I want to know is whether you'll take this job or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The tyranny of the nobles is crumbling and a new era of a true republic is upon us... We're pretty much willing to use any tool we can get our hands on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>In particular, you Sephira would be a pretty effective game piece in resisting the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Personally, I'm of the opinion that I can make the best use of you and your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Are you saying you want to use us as a constraining force against other factions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well, yeah. The way I see it, this continent is in peril.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Gluttony continues to interfere with everybody's affairs, and Greed Dike is doing that inconvenient military expansion thing they seem to be stuck on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Without any blessings from Sacred Stones... With all this aggression surrounding us... The Desert Zone is in a precarious position. Wouldn't you agree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, and recently, some Sand Hawks and I ran into the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I can't believe the Holy Guard claims to represent justice with such a dangerous pet at their heels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We share a common enemy. All I'm saying is... If we were to join forces, the sooner the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Very well, but what do you intend to have us do? If we become too active in public, we will be become easy targets for our enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm thinking of spreading word of you lot around certain back channelsâ€”make something of a name for you in the underground. Publicly, I was thinking...couriers for my guild?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Will we be permitted to prioritize our own needs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Come on, old man. Don't be such a stick in the mud. Your objective is to coexist with us, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Otherwise, you would've tried to solicit Carla, a marked one, into your ranks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You're waiting, aren't you? You're waiting until the people of the desert can accept the burden of living with the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You think too highly of me, but...I am glad to know that you are trying to understand my people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>All right. We will lend you our strength, but in exchange, you will help us as well. So that we can each accomplish our goals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, I guess this concludes negotiations. Kinda hoping you'll make life easier for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>The people were struggling. Every time war enveloped their land, I was frustrated by my own helplessness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>My time had already passed and the future was now in the hands of another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All I had left was the ability to do what I believed to be right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I worked to protect my remaining comrades and reduce bloodshed as much as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I believed this to be my mission, and the reason I was allowed to live as long as I had done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...</td>
