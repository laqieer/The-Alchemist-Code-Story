<td>Ohh, that was so scary!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We were able to fight as usual in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Piece of cake, as always!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That happened so suddenly, I was surprised!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You're such a scaredy-cat. And it's not like you lack the ability in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh, don't say that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hey, this fighting has gotten me hungry! To get to know more about this world, why don't we visit a city and get ourselves something to eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, gathering information is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Time to eat! Time to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As I thought, Yggdrasil is nowhere to be seen. And instead, there's this huge tower. This is not Arcania indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hey, look there! It's a city! I wonder if they have anything delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey, that's our guild! This city does feel kind of different from Iorys! Ehehe, let's find a place to eat first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If we need to gather information, we've got to find ourselves a bar. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?! Hmm... I suppose they should have some food at a bar too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yeah, they probably should.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Alright then!<br>Time to eat! Time to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hi Mister! I would like three fried-egg breads!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Hm? Where are you from, young lady? We don't have any such thing on the menu here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What?! Are you serious...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Judging by your appearance, you don't seem to be from around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right, we're from Iorys on the continent of Arcania.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Never heard of that. We don't have this thing you call fried-egg bread, but what do you think about our specialty here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa! It looks delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It smells nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait a moment. These aren't yen, but I got my hands on this money earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Mister, can I pay you with this money?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, food for three people would be 1600 Zeni. The sparkling water is on the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Thanks a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>By the way, has anything unusual happened around here these days?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hmm, let's see. I've heard several stories of some unusual monsters appearing in the nearby forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Some unusual monsters?<br>Could that be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Were they able to eliminate those monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No... The knight faction has been on the job, but the monsters are just causing more and more destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>They're apparently quite fierce. Some of the knights who got wounded made it back to the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Hey, we have to hurry to go and defeat them! That girl earlier said they need us for that, didn't she?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Did you finish eating already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh, n-not yet...gulp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>There's no sense in hurrying though. We need to properly prepare ourselves first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Thanks for the food, Mister! It was very delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Glad to hear that! Oh, could it be that you're about to go and hunt down those monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yes, that's our plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>There's one thing that caught my attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>After the reports of the appearance of those monsters, another strange rumor started spreading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Another strange rumor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They say there's a female knight called "Black Dame" who has been fighting the monsters, and that she has been attacking the knight faction as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Black Dame?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Uhhh, that sounds scary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I don't know the exact details, but please be careful, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Alright, thank you, Mister!</td>
