<td>I never thought we'd be tasked with slaying monsters after all this.</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>That was quite a sight. Your leadership, your maneuversâ€”all of it was no less impressive than that of an official military force.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>And you are?</td>

<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Me? I suppose you could say that I'm a sort of guide sent by the guild.</td>

<td>Don't worry about it. We were in need of some extra hands anyway.</td>

<td>I'm Logi. Logi Crowley. And you are...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Me? I'm...Isidore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's nice to meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Same here. Who knows, this may end up being a long-lasting partnership, for all we know.</td>
