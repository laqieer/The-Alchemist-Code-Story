<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Why are you fighting me? Look inside yourself. You should know better than anyone that this is the only way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I know nothing of the sort, and I dispute the very claim!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I will never approve of a single sacrifice, from anyone! And that includes you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Especially you... Everything I've done has been for you—to save you from the Truth of this wretched world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Poor, sweet Nimul... You dream so big.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But this world is not so kind. There's always a price to be paid. In order to save one thing, you must inevitably hurt another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Everything we've seen, all this time, has proven that to be the case. There's just no getting around it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You think of the lives that have been lost along the way as people you couldn't save. But that's not the case at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>They're people who thought long and hard about the choices they were given, and made their own decisions. Some of them just chose death! And that's not your responsibility to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You are not the arbiter of other people's wishes and dreams. You do not get to determine if they are acceptable or not. To think otherwise is nothing more than sheer arrogance on your part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But...I—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What?! What is this light...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It may be arrogant of me. I'll grant you that. But I still intend to take responsibility for every single person I wasn't able to save!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If only I had been stronger or smarter, maybe I could've found a way. If only I'd known more, maybe I could've come up with an alternate solution to their problems!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Those people died not because they wanted to, but because they felt they had to. And if it's arrogant of me to say that I don't want anyone to ever have to feel that way again, then so be it; I am as arrogant as they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That is my sin of Pride, and I bear it with further Pride; I will never stop wishing for a better future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll save everyone next time. And if not then, then the time after that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Let my prideful arrogance be a beacon of light upon this darkened world! And may that light lead people away from ignorance and hopelessness, and toward a better tomorrow...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That light called Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Override access to Superbia Belt confirmed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The domain established between Lucifer and I...has been overridden?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Let's work together, Emmel. If I become too idealistic, then you can scold me for it. If you go a little too far, then I can snap you back to your senses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We can forge on ahead, little by little. Together. It's how it was meant to be; I mean, we are brother and sister, after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness. Are you two all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We're just fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Eulalia, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm glad you two made up. That was the biggest fight I think you've ever had!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Fight as in, quarrel. As siblings. You two are always having trouble figuring out what's best for each other, and then you end up fighting about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But until now, those fights have always blown over in the end, with you two making up and winding up on even better terms than ever with each other. This time was just a bit more...intense than usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I suppose you're right. I hadn't thought about it before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>My goal hasn't changed, Emmel. I'm still going to save everyone and everything in this world. And that includes you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But nothing! Your plan was far too extreme. So let's try to think of something better...together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We have to figure out how to teach Alchemy to everyone, throughout the Belt Regions. And until they've mastered it, we need to figure out how to keep them safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's a lot to manage, and I could sure use a hand with it. Think you can help me out, Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Please? If you want, you can just think of it as donating your time to keep your hopelessly incompetent brother out of harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...I can do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Well... I don't think you can! Because I won't let you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Nimul!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hrk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I'll heal her with my magic! Nimul, step aside!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why...? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What did you do, Ignacio?! Why would you do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ignacio, you shot her?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That, I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What will you do now—you, who have been chosen to bear the fate of this world? What will you do, Nimul, Child of God?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Will you still cry out for a salvation that will never come, and ignore the ideal sacrifice that lies before you?</td>
</tr>
