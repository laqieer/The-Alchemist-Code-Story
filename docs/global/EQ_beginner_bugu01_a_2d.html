<td>Hm? Who are you? This is my workshop, but...your face is unfamiliar...do you want something from me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What?! You want me to teach you how to use gear?! Where did you show up from? I'm busy! Go away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...Fine, fine. With you hanging around there I won't be able to get any work done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmm. Now that I look carefully, you seem to have a good soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You seem to have potential. I guess I'll teach you how to use gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So? What do you want to learn? Huh?! How to make it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hey, hold on. Gear isn't something that anyone with a half-baked idea can make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Seriously. Oh well. Fine. My expertise lies more with weapons, but I guess this is some kind of fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was just thinking of making some armor. How about I make some that's perfect for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Before that, listen carefully. Gear is something that chooses its user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>If the user can't handle it properly, it isn't worth much. Try to master it properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That being said...even someone who's been creating gear for years like me...can't just make it from scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Do you see that mountain over there? There's some good stuff on the surface right there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How about you bring a few Shards?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah, don't worry. About 80 should be enough for the first step! Let's go!</td>
