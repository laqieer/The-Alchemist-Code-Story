<td>Maybe the Jam have some kind of eggs or something, and those were being hatched?</td>

<td>Considering how many of the Jam there are, they would need a lot of eggs. I doubt that the Gluttony soldiers are walking around with bundles of eggs.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Also, there donâ€™t seem to be any traces of eggs on the trees.</td>

<td>Look at this. This is one of the trees that the Jam emerged from.</td>
</tr>

<td>Hmm. Maybe they're invisible eggs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>That would mean the Gluttony soldiers are able to see them somehow.</td>

<td>It didn't seem like they were wearing any special equipment for that.</td>

<td>Right. Well, if not eggs then what?</td>

<td>Voda wasn't certain, but she did mention that she might have an idea...something about breeding...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>When you say breeding, the first image I think of is eggs, but...oh...maybe they split apart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Split apart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>You know, they're kind of soft and flabby like jelly. Wouldn't it make sense if they split apart in order to multiply?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>That's an interesting theory, but they would need an original form from which they can split apart from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Also, when they split apart...they would normally become smaller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Right. In that case, I really wonder what it could be. Are they born from nothing?</td>

<td>...Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>They emerge in various places...and suddenly increase...no, I can't think of anything.</td>

<td>...Achoo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>You scared me... What's the matter? Have you caught a cold?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>No, I just have a bit of a runny nose. I'm fine! There's no time to be catching colds right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Exactly! What if it's contagious and you give it to me...oh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What's the matter, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Breeding...emerging in various places...the sudden increase...could it be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Did you figure something out?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>Well, I'm not certain yet...but, this could explain what's going on. I'll ask Voda about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/tina.png" alt="Tina" height="128"><br>Tina</td>
<td>But...if my prediction is correct, it'll be quite troublesome to handle.</td>
