<td>It doesn't matter what tribe it is, but, unless you're accepted as the guest of a tribe, you won't be able to stay in Saga.</td>

<td>But isn't there only one chief for every tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? Paza is a neutral trading village. There are people from various tribes here. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than one chief.</td>

<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>In that case, you should decide by the overall vibe of each faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>If you prefer to be around reformists then you should consider Tehre...if you're interested in warfare then Fuu...and if you think nature-worshiping is your thing then most likely Voda is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Well...that's a pretty rough categorization, but you get the picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Hmm. Between those options, I guess I'd say Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/lies.png" alt="Lisbeth" height="128"><br>Lisbeth</td>
<td>Besides, if they know a lot about nature, then they might know how to remove the curse of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trading Merchant</td>
<td>Well then, try and find yourself a chief from the Voda faction. Sorry, but I'll be leaving now. I'm keeping my other customers waiting.</td>
</tr>
