<td>001</td>
<td>The crowd is starting to grow. Why are you looking so serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm thinking about what I ought to do as a chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How should I respond if those from the Tehre faction and the Fuu faction decide to challenge me, knowing that I'm the chief of Voda?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Surely they would never challenge you out of the blue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You can never be too careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>As the representative of my tribe, I cannot back down. That being said, as I am away from my village...if someone were to take advantage of this fact and attack them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I didn't know you were thinking about such things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Such things...? As a chief, that's what's expected of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. No one would suspect that you're a chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's hard to imagine that a young girl like you would be the head of a tribe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...! Are you insulting me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you wish to imply that a young girl like me...couldn't be a chief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>N-no, not at all...that's not what I meant!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even if I'm young, I'm the chief of the Toxotes tribe! As their chief, I must consider all possibilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>He-hey...wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...I was careless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Although she may have taken on the role of chief, Tina is still a young girl. I'm sure the burden is heavy for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What the...? There's some kind of commotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Anyway...once you get to the village, try to find someone who bears the title of Chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It doesn't matter what tribe it is, but, unless you're accepted as the guest of a tribe, you won't be able to stay in Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>But isn't there only one chief for every tribe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? Paza is a neutral trading village. There are people from various tribes here. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more than one chief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Oh, right...but I can't just go along with anybody, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>In that case, you should decide by the overall vibe of each faction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If you prefer to be around reformists then you should consider Tehre...if you're interested in warfare then Fuu...and if you think nature-worshiping is your thing then most likely Voda is for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well...that's a pretty rough categorization, but you get the picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm. Between those options, I guess I'd say Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, if they know a lot about nature, then they might know how to remove the curse of Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Well then, try and find yourself a chief from the Voda faction. Sorry, but I'll be leaving now. I'm keeping my other customers waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seriously?! You're already leaving?! ...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...? It's been a while since I've been here, but there seems to be some kind of commotion. Be careful, young lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Go-got it! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Um... First, I need to meet a chief, right? I wonder where I can find one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...Oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Um...excuse me! Where can I find...a chief?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>U-um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I am Tina, the 45th chief of Toxotes. Sorry if my small, feminine stature doesn't meet your expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Whaaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ack! What's with that reaction?! Chiefs aren't determined by their age...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Tina! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What...? Did you come to apologize for your rudeness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Now isn't the time for that! The Jam are here! Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What...?! Ack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hey! Ch-chief...hold on a second!</td>
</tr>
