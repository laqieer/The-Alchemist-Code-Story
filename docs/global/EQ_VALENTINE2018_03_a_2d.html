<td>Phew... That's the last of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah... Hey, those monsters were unusually determined, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hm? There's something on the ground here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ah. That's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Wow, look how cute the wrapping is! Did you make this yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Y-yes! I dropped it when that monster attacked me. I hope it hasn't been broken or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>After all, I've already used up all of the Rainbow Cacao I bought...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let me check... It's a little beat up, but nothing too bad! It's still a presentable enough gift.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wow, that looks delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But isn't it a little...plain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>R-really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's not reaching its full potential the way it is now! Try adding a little decoration, like here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>E-Emma, is this really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you doing over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Uh oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's chocolate, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Y-yes, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Snacks and chocolates are not allowed on school property. I have no choice but to confiscate this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tsk... Valentine's Day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>N-no, please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That's pretty harsh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Strict enforcement is the only way to make sure that discipline is learned in the Academy. There's nothing we can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I was supposed to exchange chocolates with my friend. I can't do that if I don't have chocolate to exchange!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>It wasn't easy making it using the cacao, and I was so excited when it turned out so well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Aw... I mean, I know it's against the rules, but it's sad that her handmade chocolate was just taken away like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yeah... Hm... What can we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is there really anything that can be done? I mean, rules are rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hey. Why don't you take this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Isnâ€™t that Rainbow Cacao?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Emma!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I got some as a sample. Go on, take it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You can make more chocolate with this! Be careful not to get caught this time, and remember to amp up the presentation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Emma! Stop encouraging her to break the rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It'll be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>F-fine?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm glad it all worked out! Or...well, I guess it hasn't worked out yet, but I hope it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Noah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Emma is always like this... She just does whatever she wants and doesn't listen to me at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That's not true. I just think that life would be much more boring if we all just followed the rules all the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Boring, you say...? There's nothing wrong with following the rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I didn't say there was!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Really? That's what it sounded like to me. If you think following rules is so boring, then you must think that I'm boring too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What? What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-hey, you two. Let's take a step back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yeesh... Something better happen and save us all from this awkward silence...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Grrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Be careful what you wish for. Seems like the Cacao brought more monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, no. This is perfect! Anything was better than that unbearable quiet!</td>
