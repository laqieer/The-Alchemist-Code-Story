<td>Haaa... That took a little longer than I thought it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wow... So while everyone's asleep, you're out here, walking around and protecting the city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hmm? Oh. Well, that is part of the reason why I am patrolling, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Haa... You're amazing, Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It was just a little detour on the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Now, why are you...? Well, I suppose you did have quite a long sleep in the afternoon. It's only natural that you would have trouble sleeping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why am I like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lustburg may be a snowy country, but the days are surprisingly hot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's better to go into safe mode and sleep than to let yourself overheat, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Overheat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>When you first came here, you had a lot of trouble controlling your magic, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Y-yeah, that's right! I forgot, but whenever I'd try to use my magic, I'd start feeling really warm, and then—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's called overheating. The heat from your magic steadily raises your body temperature, until you start losing control of your magic and eventually pass out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You experienced this many times as a child. Hence why you are sensitive to the heat and use up much more energy than most when attempting to control your magic in the middle of the day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Using up so much energy makes you tired. It's only logical.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I... I don't really remember overheating. My memories of that time are all...fuzzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of course they are. The human mind cannot function correctly in that state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>But...I do know that you and Michael were always there for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ah, I miss those days. You know, I think I recall a time when Michael got distracted and ended up taking a direct hit! His moustache turned black as soot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>N-no! I burned Michael's moustache?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Only the very tips. Oh, but it was so funny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>P-please don't tell me I ever hurt you, Lofia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well... A few burns here and there, and the occasional bout of frostbite...but nothing for you to be concerned about. I've long-since healed up now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>F-frostbite?! N-no! I...! I did that to you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I... I can't believe I hurt you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't be silly! Like I said, I'm all better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>All I've ever done is cause you and Michael trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You're always so kind to me, giving me cookies and waiting at my bedside for me to wake up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Michael carries me to my room when I fall asleep. I... I love the both of you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But...I did terrible things to you—to both of you! Not only that, but I somehow forgot all about these things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Ravina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I guess you'd be better off if I wasn't around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, Ravina? I'd like to take you somewhere nice. Will you come with me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I usually don't tell people about this place, but you can be the exception. Come on, let's get going! Actually, wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I suppose I had better deal with the rest of this lot first!</td>
