</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rofi.png" alt="Lofia" height="128"><br>Lofia</td>
<td>That's called overheating. The heat from your magic steadily raises your body temperature, until you start losing control of your magic and eventually pass out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rofi.png" alt="Lofia" height="128"><br>Lofia</td>
