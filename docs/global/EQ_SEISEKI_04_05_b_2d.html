<td>Commander, have you managed to finish that training of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, it was successful. Now we can continue our strategy as planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I see. That's good to hear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Soon, the other captains should arrive soon. After everyone has gathered, let's start with specific instructions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lord Commander, is that you there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Most Reverend Bishop...and all distinguished members of the council.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Things seem to be moving along well. Although I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Indeed...things are going well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I heard that you plan on implementing a large-scale strategy. Is this true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. Although I will not reveal the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Very well, very well. I am deeply impressed with your dedication to your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>However, do be careful not to take such dedication too far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Regardless of the fact that your duty is to enforce justice...by being too dedicated to this cause, you may lower the reputation of the Holy Order itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>After all, at the end of the day, the enforcement of justice is nothing more than the enforcement of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. Of course. I understand this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Indeed. Well said. Do continue to dedicate yourself to your duties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Commander, what was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Those are members of the council that were dispatched from the Holy Order and their leader, His Most Reverend Bishop. In reality, their rank corresponds to one higher than ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. So that's the rumored...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Beneath their clean-cut clergy robes, they are lots who hide an eery attachment to the Sacred Stones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I rarely say this. After all, they're a conniving lot who are already aware of our top secret plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This may just be wishful thinking...but they don't appear to know the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Still, it never hurts to be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If they discover that this mission is for the Mikaboshi, they may attempt something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Very true. We must be extremely careful with the leaking of information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Also, I hope we can implement the plan without having a single casualty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Kazahaya, give instructions to each regiment captain. We will implement the strategy as planned. I'll begin the final adjustments with Kagura.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes, Sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I can't believe it... Those two...</td>
</tr>
