<td>002</td>
<td>Hyaaaaah!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>This is no good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hm? Where is that voice coming from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This voice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's why our standing within Envylia is changing every year.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Really? I guess it has changed a little bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's never going to be great, though, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Don't look so hopeless! It's okay, just relax.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Go ahead and groom yourselves while you hear me out, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The shedding gets really bad around this time of year, doesn't it? There we go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Brushing my fur! Grooming is important, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>If I don't brush it properly, there'll be fur everywhere. It's especially bad during shedding season.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, no. That's not what I meant. Why are you gathering up all the loose fur like that? Are you gonna use it for something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ehehehe... Well, I collect all the fur I shed and make stuffed animals with it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>S-stuffed...animals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It's super soft and feels really nice to the touch! See? Look at it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you want to touch it? Eheheheh... Isn't it cute?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh, uh... No thanks. I'll pass. Besides...you can't really call this cute, can you? Er, never mind. Back to the point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, that's right. Eheh... Ahem!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>There is no prejudice in the Scarlet Flame Guard. We all follow this rule and fight together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>My... Um, the person who I admire made that rule, you see. So I'm determined to protect it with my iron will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You don't say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why I'm sure the day will come when the people of Envylia and we therians can walk hand in hand together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No, I'm more than sure. I know that this country will be a place like that someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I will make it a reality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>R-really? So... Is it okay for us to get our hopes up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You betcha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh? Chloe...? What're you doing all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, well, I... I just happened to hear your voice. What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Well, I want the therians and animals to like Envylia just a bit more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So I come here to talk to them about all sorts of things; to show them the good side of Envylia, a little bit at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if the situation improves, it's pointless if the hearts of the people don't change along with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>A little at a time? Does that mean that you do this often, then? In addition to all your training and your duties in the Scarlet Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's important to keep moving forward, even if it's just one step at a time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I will do everything I can. I have to do something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Nina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We'll handle this! Don't panic, and take cover!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Let's go, Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Right!</td>
