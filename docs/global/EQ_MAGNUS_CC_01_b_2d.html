<td>You sure are lucky, Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/magn.png" alt="Magnus" height="128"><br>Magnus</td>
<td>Ahh, but that's where you're wrong. It's not Lady Luck, but the Goddess of Gambling who smiles on me. She's as fickle as they come, and tends to favor people like her, such as myself, rather than serious types like you.</td>

<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>True... I must admit, I didn't expect things to drag on this long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>You said yourself, this isn't a game of chance. And I don't get lucky. I've always had bad luck, and had to work doubly hard to counteract it. So I make my own luck, through hard work.</td>
</tr>

<td>How does that apply here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
