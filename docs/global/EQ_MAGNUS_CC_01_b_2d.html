<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>She's certainly getting into it. Quite impressively, too. She swiftly and comprehensively analyzes her opponents' attack patterns before retaliating. At once passionate, and level-headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Still, I have to wonder what she meant about improving her quality of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh, that. It's kind of her motto.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You see...she's from Real Heaven.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>She's had a hard life. She's always been alone, and she still fully intends to operate that way here. I'm a little worried about her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I see. I daresay that worry numbers among your reasons for scouting her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What's all the noise about? Sounds like someone's having a fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, it's that time of year again, isn't it? New blood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>New recruits, huh? Time flies...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Come to think of it, weren't we meant to be there? The captain said something to that effect, but I forgot about it. Guess it's too late now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It's fine. We just got back from a mission! We deserve a day's rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We cracked down on some illegal Alchemy users, exposed some nasty human experiments, and kept a bunch of bad guys from fleeing into the countryside—all in a day's work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I even put my research on hold for that! So we can afford to slack off for a bit. No one's gonna blame us for taking a day off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I guess it can't hurt... It's just one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Besides, who cares about some new recruits? Hah! This is a good hand. I'll stand. You?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hit me. Heh... The ace of spades. Looks like I win this round.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Guess this means your win ratio isn't one hundred percent anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's a difference between play and a real contest. I have to let you win sometimes, or you won't want to play with me anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Heh. Whatever you say. It was a fair match, and it doesn't bode well for you that you can't even beat me for fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch. You hardly ever beat me, but when you do, you just have to rub it in, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heh. Anyway, I wonder what's keeping Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He's out there with the new recruits, obviously. He's a captain. He can't afford to slack off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Right. I suppose that's where our captain is, too, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I would assume so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Naturally. The only people brazen enough not to show up were the two of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>C-Captain Kaya! What brings you all the way down here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't you remember me telling you to report to the guardroom to meet the new recruits today? Well, that was hours ago now. The meeting's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Since you failed to show up, I brought along someone I want you to meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hello! My name is Ryui, and I will be serving alongside you in the 2nd Regiment as of today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whatever you need, I'm there. I'm as capable with the pen as with the sword, so whether it's paperwork or guard duty, you can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, uh... Hi. Why'd you bring her here, captain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Because you're going to be her mentor. I expect you to show her the ropes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What?! Why me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Because I think it will do you both some good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Besides...it's about time you took on some extra responsibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>How do you figure? This won't be a good thing for her, or me! I'm not ready to look after someone else!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>And when will you be ready? I've seen you in action, Magnus, and I think she can learn a lot from you. This is my decision as your captain, and it's final.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heh. I'm lookin' forward to watching you play the part of mentor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Oh, really? Since we work together, you'd be just as much her mentor as I would, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Getting along, I hope?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hello, Mister Othima!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It's Captain Othima, now that you're a paladin, Ryui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Anyway, I'm so glad you're joining us! I, for one, will definitely be counting on your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm happy to be of assistance, but I hope you haven't forgotten that you still need to pay me back for those magic mecha repair fees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You two seem pretty friendly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>We've got a rapport going; I'm the one who scouted her. Anyway, from what I hear, you're going to be mentoring her, Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>That's right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No, it's not! I haven't agreed to anything yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You're so stubborn... Fine. Let's do it like this. The two of you are going to face off in a game of cards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If Ryui wins, you will take responsibility for her as her mentor. Do you accept, Magnus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You sure you want to play it that way? I won't go easy on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I wouldn't expect you to. I'm sure Ryui wouldn't, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Whatever the conditions may be, I accept! And I'll do my best to win, if that is what you ask of me, captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Then let's get to it. We'll play blackjack. You start with a hand of two cards, and whoever's total is closer to twenty one wins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Here's the deck. You can draw an extra card if you think your number is too low...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But if your new total goes over twenty one, you automatically lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So, those are the rules? Understood. I'll give it my best shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Gotta admit, I feel bad doing this to a rookie, but...them's the breaks, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'll deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Aw...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Wow. Another bust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It's almost impressive how she fell for every last one of your bluffs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You sure are lucky, Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Ahh, but that's where you're wrong. It's not Lady Luck, but the Goddess of Gambling who smiles on me. She's as fickle as they come, and tends to favor people like her, such as myself, rather than serious types like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What was the point of this, captain? Were you trying to teach her that life is hard, or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I mean, you should've known there was no way a rookie would be able to see through Magnus's tricks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>True... I must admit, I didn't expect things to drag on this long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>But we never set a limit on how many rounds we would play, so I still have a chance! Let's play again. I'll definitely win this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Fine—but this is your last shot. We're almost at the bottom of the deck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Fine by me. I meant it when I said I'm definitely going to win this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You don't give up easy, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>It's not a game of chance, you know. Just praying for luck isn't going to get you anywhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You don't have to worry about that. I didn't get where I am now by leaving things to chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oh, really? How do you plan to win, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>The same way I always do. Through hard work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Haha... Interesting. Well, I stand. How about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Hit me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>All right. Let's see if your hard work paid off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Well, well, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>See? Told you I'd win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>How'd you know to draw that extra card? I guess you just got lucky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You said yourself, this isn't a game of chance. And I don't get lucky. I've always had bad luck, and had to work doubly hard to counteract it. So I make my own luck, through hard work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>How does that apply here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I memorized every card we drew, round after round. Then, when you said this would be our last game, all I had to do was calculate the remaining cards in the deck. The possibilities were limited, so it was pretty easy to figure out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wow. You really went above and beyond, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Why wouldn't I? It was my job to win, so I did. But you know, you actually tipped the scale in my favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I wasn't sure whether I should draw or not...until you taunted me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>It could've been a trick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>But it wasn't. You thought I was going to go bust, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You created a situation where you didn't have to pick up, but I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>And I knew that I could pick up without going bust, so I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Dang. You got me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I did, didn't I? A little hard work can go a long way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>It certainly can. I'm impressed by what I've seen today. Your persistence and willingness to work hard will serve you well as a paladin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>However...the conduct you displayed during the mock battle was less desirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Huh? What'd she do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>She watched her comrades fight each other, only joining the fray after she had a handle on their attack patterns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>This did allow her to defeat them all singlehandedly, however.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Not much of a team player, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I suppose not...though it's not intentional. I've always been alone, and had to do everything myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I did wonder why nobody else was doing what I was, but...it just didn't click that we were meant to be working together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Teamwork isn't always easy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Kaya's a bit of a lone wolf, too, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>So's Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>You're one to talk, Will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Moving right along... It's not a terrible strategy, but it isn't going to win you any friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>And to an extent, camaraderie is important here. For so long as you are a member of the Holy Guard, you are expected to work alongside your fellow paladins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Understood. It won't happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Good. Now, since the matter of your mentor has been taken care of...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You may spend the remainder of today resting in your quarters. I will contact you about your first assignment in due time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Thank you for humoring me, Magnus! I look forward to working with you. Until next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Guess she wasn't as much of a boring goody two-shoes as I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>As if I could have you mentor anyone so pure. I expect you to take this seriously, Magnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Heheh. This is gonna be fun.</td>
</tr>
