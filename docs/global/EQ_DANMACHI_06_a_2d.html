<td>The walls seem even more damaged the farther in we go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That rumbling sound we keep hearing is probably these marks being made. At least the place isn't falling apart or anything, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Seems like some sort of special power is at work here. It should hold the ruins together for now...hopefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What is it, Ila?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thank you. For earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Earlier? Oh, haha, that! I was just moving on impulse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I don't care why you did it. It just made me...happy?...that you did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I don't mean you coming to my rescue! Don't misunderstand me. Just...the fact that you gave those creeps a well-deserved thrashing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's all. Got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Uhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That's just Ila's way of showing appreciation—for being as outraged as she was about what those guys were doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>She doesn't need to thank me, I just did what came naturally to me when I see something awful like that happening.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Still, your behavior clearly moved something in Ila's heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>And rightfully so! You were really heroic back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah, Bell and Ais make quite the duo. Their skill is considerable, and they coordinate their attacks together on the battlefield very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>There's no enemy we can't beat with Bell on our side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Amazing! Ila's even come around on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Someone who gains comrades as naturally as you do, Bell, is bound to be remembered as a hero in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Me? A hero? You could say that about Ais, maybe, but certainly not me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I wouldn't call myself a hero either. I just fight monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>But put any monster in front of any of us, and we'll take care of it, every time. We're a formidable team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I can't believe I'm actually agreeing with Wallen-whatever about something...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I also believe in you. All of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Especially you, Ila. You and Bell seem to have a natural affinity with one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What? You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't misunderstand—I'm only talking about the battlefield, here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And Kevin, you were giving them support the whole time without breaking a sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I...don't know how to react, being told that by a goddess. I feel like it'd be rude of me to say it's nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Heheh. I'm glad you were assigned to Bell as a guide, Kevin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's an honor to hear you say that, Goddess Hestia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This group could even stand shoulder to shoulder with the adventuring parties who attempt the lower dungeon floors back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>In fact, I'm sure of it! This party could conquer the whole dungeon, given the chance! So get out there, and show me how heroic you all can be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes, Goddess!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can count on us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We will prevail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah! We got this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Raaaaaaaaarrrgggh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's the minotaur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And it's close. Stay on guard, everyone.</td>
