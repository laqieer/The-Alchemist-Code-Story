<td>We don't need another woman of your...talents, in the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Why? Because they've already got you?</td>

<td>The glinting dagger Agares floats under the ashen moon, its tip glowing red-hot from latent energies.</td>

<td>I won't leave you and Zheng Yi here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>So long as I am still here, our house yet lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>At the very least, they will keep Lord Zheng Yi alive. They have to...or the secrets of Atropos die with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Please, Shion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You are our last line of communication with Soren and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>If Goetia catches them off guard, all will be lost.</td>

<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Do what you must, my dear brother. Whatever they're after...they must not have it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Running? Foolish.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'll have your bodies fuel your masters' pyres!</td>

<td>I heard the shrill cries of our loyal retainers on the wind as I ran.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Their voices, along with my sister's and her beloved, would come to haunt me for a long time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>But I swore, then, that no matter what happened, I would be back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And I would have Li Wang answer for his crimes.</td>
