<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>So, you were sealed as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>And quite the nuisance it was. Are your memories beginning to come back to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, they remain shrouded. But that's not a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I will destroy the humans. They are the ones who took from me what I sought to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That is, assuming what you say is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I have spoken no lie. Everything I've said to you makes sense, no? You needn't doubt me. I would never deign to put you in harm's way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Unlike the humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>With the obstacle that was the Blade Fox now undone, no one remains to stand in our way. We have the luxury of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>So you needn't push yourself to remember everything now. Once the humans have been completely annihilated, Wadatsumi will be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heh...haha...hahahaha! How absolutely wonderful! My dream draws ever closer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But I must examine that body of Tamba's a bit more closely. It may hold the power I seek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If so, I shall take it for my own. Now that there is no one left who can use that bothersome Kagutsuchi technique, the road ahead is clear of all opposition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even the whims of Judius and Greed Dike need no longer be tolerated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The last laugh...will be mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ah...nnh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ngh... Ow!<br>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, right... We were...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Could I be the...only survivor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, thank goodness! I'm so happy to see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wh-wh-whoa, stop! That hurts! Mind the wounds, please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>S-sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm quite relieved to see you too, Azami. I'd begun to suspect the worst. What...of the others?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Only a handful of soldiers survived the onslaught. And Captain Ugachi still hasn't regained consciousness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We failed. We lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Which is why I entrust this resolve of mine, woven throughout time immemorial, to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>No. It's not over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I've been entrusted with something important, and I'm not about to let that trust be dashed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If we say we've lost, then we've given up. We've given up on Wadatsumi, on the Blade Fox, and on the bonds we've built together all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If we give up now, we'll never be able to enjoy a meal together like before. We'll never be able to laugh and poke fun like before. Are you really prepared to accept that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Because I'm not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Didn't we take an oath? We said that with our blades, we'd clear the way for Wadatsumi's future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So I won't give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What do you intend to do, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm going to track them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?! That'll just get you killed! Why would you even consider something so foolish?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I see nothing foolish about this. It is a reasonable course of action, given the circumstances. Let us consider each matter in turn:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>One, I don't believe Captain Tanosuke's consciousness has been completely overtaken. We must somehow bring him back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Two, Celis' death remains unconfirmed, so it is in our best interests—on multiple levels—to locate her whereabouts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>And three, I believe it is imperative we re-establish the Blade Fox Corps. These are the points we need to address, and the first two are why I must follow the Discarnate Power's trail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Will you try to stop me? I'll do it by myself, if need be. But I'm going to do it, either way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...You promised me. You promised me you wouldn't do anything stupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And I'm not! If we just stand around, we're going to lose literally everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So I, for one, won't just stand around. I'm going, and that's that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>And that's exactly what I mean! You're not going anywhere by yourself! That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'm going too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What self-respecting big sister would just sit back and watch her little sister go off to fight a hopeless battle on her own?! Honestly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yeah. I suppose you do have a point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If either one of us were to give up now, we'd be putting the people of Wadatsumi in imminent, catastrophic danger. And on top of that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We'd never be able to laugh, poke fun, and eat dinner together again. Like you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>There we go! That's the spirit! And on that note, I think the first order of business...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...is to get some food in us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>At least. And get cleaned up, while we're at it. You are looking a bit worse for wear, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Look who's talking.</td>
</tr>
