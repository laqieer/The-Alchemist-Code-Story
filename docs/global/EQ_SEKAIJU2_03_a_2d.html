<td>Haaaaa... It looks like that was the last of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shenmei, I understand that you wanted to hasten to their aid, but it's dangerous to rush into battle alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Heheh, sorry! If I see someone in trouble, I just can't help myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Pishposh! The monsters have been vanquished, and that is good enough. Now, let us commence our intelligence gathering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hold! You must not enter the village! You did help us out back there, so I really don't want to have to turn you away, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This village is currently in quarantine. None may enter or leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I did hear one of the soldiers shout something about taking the infected to the church. Perhaps that has something to do with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They did? I didn't catch that. Your hearing must be pretty sharp, Gunner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>As an adventurer, it is only natural to hone one's senses, in order to prepare oneself for the many dangers one might face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Y-yes, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So...there are injured here. If they are infected, that would mean that those who enter the village risk contracting whatever malady is afflicting them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Exactly. That's why we have quarantined the village, to prevent the infection from spreading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So that's why... What's wrong with them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well... It begins with greenish bruises on the skin, and then they get a high fever that just won't go down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Greenish bruises...? I feel like I have heard of such a phenomenon somewhere before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>S-sir! P-please let me go and collect some medicinal herbs! At this rate, my father will—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I told you, you must not leave the village! We have already sent some soldiers out to search for medicinal herbs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>You will just need to wait a little longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It will be too late! I can't stand around waiting! I cannot let my father—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I know, it's taking some time, but they will bring back those herbs! Have faith, and patience!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Nngh... A-all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't know about you guys, but I want to help these people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmm... I am concerned for the people of this village, but we must not forget about the person who called out for help earlier, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I know, but I can't abandon someone in need!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Besides, I know that keeping the infection from spreading is important and all, but not being able to leave the village must be horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I agree with Shenmei.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're right. We cannot simply let this go unresolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Indeed! It is decided. We will assist in gathering the medicinal herbs. We cannot call ourselves adventurers if we abandon these people to search for that voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Th-thanks, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Have you been listening, soldier? We will take on this herb gathering as a quest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What are you saying? You saved us from the monsters, even though we're complete strangers, and now—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, hush! To help one in need is the role of any adventurer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I... I thank you! Please, help us save this village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's the spirit! Leave it to us! Come what may, we will complete this quest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you, all of you! On behalf of the people of Babel, I thank you! You're all so kind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When it comes to helping people, one's homeland—or home world—is irrelevant! We are doing what is right, nothing more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Exactly! Besides, if anyone's kind, it's you, Shenmei! You're a really good person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I-I guess? I'm just being myself. Ahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I always ended up giving away all the treasure I found to people who needed it, and then my crew would laugh at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see. You may have been a pirate, but you used your spoils for the benefit of the people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Ah, and if she was a pirate, that makes Shenmei an adventurer as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'd love to have an adventure out at sea... Ah! Would you tell us a story of your adventures as a pirate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I would like to hear, as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>R-really? Okay, let me see... It was a dark and foggy night, and we were headed toward Sleeping Basilisk Island, when—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I want to hear this story as much as the rest of you, but we've nearly reached the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...lp...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Th-that voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>H-he...lp...me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Why now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm not sure... However, it seems that it is coming from within the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Indeed. Excellent! We can find the medicinal herbs and the owner of that voice at the same time, completing our quests in one fell swoop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm not sure that it will be that easy... However, we will break through!</td>
</tr>
