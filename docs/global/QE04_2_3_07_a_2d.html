<td>Fuu, we've returned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shh! It seems like he has visitors. Let's wait here for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That's just not true. I've explained it to you over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But, if Voda hadn't come here then there wouldn't have been any conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Exactly! Thanks to all this uncertainty, my child is afraid to leave the house.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I heard there were others as well. With all the damage that the Jam are causing us, we can't afford to deal with any other problems!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>But you've misunderstood what happened. Because those others were here, you were able to avoid further damage. Why can't you understand this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It doesn't change the fact that we were scared to death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>We just want to live a life of peace. Please, don't let them near our village again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Please, Fuu!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We've returned, Fuu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah. Well done. I thank you. Did you hear what the villagers said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. My apologies. I was the one who requested you to patrol the village and exterminate the Jam for the sake of the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even if you and Voda work together...perhaps the villagers won't be able to adapt so suddenly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, I did anticipate that the gulf which existed yesterday wouldn't disappear overnight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Still, it surprised me to see how much our presence made the villagers anxious.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For a time, you may have to suffer such responses... I truly apologize for this. Will you be able to endure it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course. I'll endure anything for the sake of protecting Saga.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Um... Is there anything I can do to assist?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Tamis...you asked the same thing before, but you mustnâ€™t worry yourself about such things. You should be preparing yourself for the days ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I know, but...with everything that Mocca and the others are doing...I wish there was something I could do to help as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Besides...if only I was able to restore the Wind Matter, the people of Saga would be able to live in safety, but...because of my lack of power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's not true. Tamis, you're fulfilling your role as the vessel for the Wind Matter brilliantly. It's my lack of power that's the problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Not at all! Sorry...I didn't mean it that way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Mocca and I will find a way to succeed...I promise you. So, Tamis, please don't worry about it too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tamis, you just need to prepare yourself and wait for when the moment comes! Right, Tina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. I promise that we will revive the Wind Matter...and protect Saga's future. Please, just wait until that moment comes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...Okay.</td>
