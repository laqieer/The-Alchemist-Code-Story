<td>Heheh. How was it? This is what I'm capable of! Impressive, isn't it? Well, I am older than you two dunces anyway.</td>

<td>Anyway, what were you thinking, going into the sealed shrine without permission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What was sealed in here were the remnants of an ancient corruption that my ancestors risked their lives to subdue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And to wake it up without any preparation... One wrong move and it could have been a disaster, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's... I have no response. But how did you know we were here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was guided by the voice of Sephiron, of course. She told me that you guys were in danger.</td>

<td>Sephiron?</td>

<td>The great Mother is always watching over us. Be grateful for her love.</td>

<td>Always watching...</td>

<td>At the time, we thought we'd purged the corruption, yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It was only a small part of the original source of corruption, Cryphone. As long as that the true foundation of the corruption remained...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We should've seen that it was only part of an old, greater corruption that Sephiron had been containing all along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Therefore, now that Sephiron's blessing has been lost...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Allow me to break free from my past regrets and finish what I started long ago!</td>
