<td>Hello. It's been a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Hey sis... I did it. Just like you said in your letter... I exorcised the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Sis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I mean...the writing was all shaky, so I couldn't really read most of what you wrote—like, at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You have nothing to apologize for. It's just...one of those things. You know. Codes of conduct. Laws of nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>So, I wasn't really taking it super seriously in the beginning, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My bad. When I got there, the corruption in Wadatsumi was worse than ever before, so I figured I'd better get on with it like a proper, dutiful sibling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Exorcising demons is the duty of the Black Star Clan, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I didn't get it, though. It was easy enough, so I did what you asked of me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But now I think I can understand it a little bit. That's thanks to you, sis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I've always liked bubbles. I liked watching them dance in the air and fly high into the sky. Who knew where they might end up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'd watch them, transfixed, while my sister would watch me with a smile on her face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's all. She didn't need to say anything. That was how we spent our days then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Black Star, the Demon Hunting Clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>A clan with an ancient mission. They wield the sacred blade Sumeragi in times of crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The fate of our clan was to be the blade that slays the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's how my sister and I were raised. The code of our family was absolute. There was no going against it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It didn't matter how we felt. We had to follow the code that we were indoctrinated into from the moment we were born.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>At least, that's how it was supposed to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There's no reason for you to take on something you don't understand. I will uphold the legacy and code of our family. Be free, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My sister smiled when I asked her that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>A gentle and ephemeral smile, as soft and fleeting as bubbles floating away on the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Then the day came when I started to hate the bubbles I once loved so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>One hot summer day, I was playing with bubbles like usual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When I turned to look at her, expecting her usual smile, I saw a frown instead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Three years at most. That's how long they said I had left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>This...can't be true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know it is hard to accept, but that's just how it goes sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Life, I mean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The bubbles my sister blew popped as she spoke.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What? I don't get it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That's what the doctor told me, and I doubt they're wrong. The only thing I can do now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...is continue to uphold our family's code with the time I have left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Come on, it's not like I'm going to die tomorrow. I've decided to think of it as...a gift of time to help me prepare.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Prepare...to uphold the code?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>But I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I couldn't say anything. I didn't know how to express what I was feeling. I still didn't know anything back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I felt like I shouldn't say what I was thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>You don't have to worry though, Ren. I'll take care of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's better to burn out than fade away. I'm going to give everything for the code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Is the code really that important? Enough to devote the rest of your life to it? Don't you want to live longer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Nope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>How are you so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>How? It's thanks to the code that I can be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The popping bubbles began to seem just like my sister's life. Fragile and impermanent. Short-lived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's when I began to hate them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Seeing them float high on the breeze, I was almost jealous that they could escape this unfathomable situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Even after I stopped blowing bubbles completely, I thought about that moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Anything to distract me from the idea that my sister was going to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's what I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>――――!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>This is no joke... At this rate, I'll be killed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Done already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>What happened to three years left?! You're in perfect health! This doesn't make any sense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, do you have a problem with that? You'd rather me die like the doctor said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>No one could kill you even if they tried.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh? If you truly think I can't be killed... Maybe you need some more training to give yourself a fighting chance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Are you prepared, Ren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'll forgive you if I make it past three years.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And so my sister trained like hell every day and dragged me to hell with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Burning with a desire to protect the code with the time she had left, she became monstrously strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Even after the three years she'd been given, she was doing well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Haaa... Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Let's call it a day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Call it a day?! You almost killed me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're not dead. No harm, no foul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I thought you said you'd go easy on me if you lived past three years?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Hmph. Poor little brother. I'll think about it. Maybe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>How cruel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It is cruel. This was a good day of training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You're still training... Why do you need to get so strong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>To protect the code. Though I'm also trying to make you stronger too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>But you're already the strongest person I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wadatsumi still isn't at peace. It's true that not many have seen demons since we've been taking care of them in secret, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>There are humans who would take advantage of the peace they see and try to profit off of it themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But...that doesn't have anything to do with the code, does it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The teachings of the Black Stars are concerned not only with demons, but with evil too. You know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Well, sure, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Haven't you ever thought about living as you like, without worrying about the code? Don't you have a dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Of course I have dreams. Just last night I had quite the exciting one. Though it would take a while to describe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>That's not what I meant...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Thank you, Ren. Your jokes always cheer me up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I was being serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>If you weren't joking, then... You were lying to me? No, that's not it. Hmm, how interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Natsume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>There's no dream more important than my cute little Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>...Did you eat something weird or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Nothing that you haven't eaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Haaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>A demon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>More of them have been showing up than before. They must be gathering somewhere, scheming to bring corruption to our land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Which means we were right in training somewhere away from people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>We should slay it now, before it reveals itself. We can't let any corruption spread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It also makes the perfect cooldown exercise after training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Natsume, wait!</td>
</tr>
