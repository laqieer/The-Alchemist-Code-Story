<td>Lost Blue being no more would rob our friend Greed Dike of its assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse A</td>
<td>Seeing as it holds several secret experimental facilities there, not to mention it provides access to assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corpse B</td>
<td>Lost Blue is simply too convenient a place to hide what you don't want seen. If such a place is brought into the light of day, then its connection to Greed Dike will also be revealed.</td>

<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>If denizens of Lost Blue are suddenly brought to live in the world above, they will only know how to make a living by stealing and killing. They will soon find themselves in another slum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Especially if their fate is left up to the Holy Guard, who depend on military might to champion their absolute justice. The Holy Guard cannot save Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>
<td>You dare insult the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>It's just impossible to reform those who are drenched in the ways of the underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>They monopolize authority, crush their enemies, and hide their secrets. Only fools blindly believe in justice, while being intolerant of any tinge of evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>
<td>Fools? For some, justice is nothing more than the truth.</td>

<tr>

<td>Certainly. Just as there are some whose truth is that justice doesn't exist.</td>

<td>The only way for Lost Blue to be saved is for it to gain power strong enough to defeat the whole world.</td>

<td>Those of us who are twisted cannot bask in the light until the world has become twisted as well. That's the only way for us move forward.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>
<td>But the reform you dream of cannot occur abruptly. It must be realized gradually over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>
<td>A hasty revolution will bring ruin to the world. History has seen much devastation because of this.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>The plot can't move along if good and evil compromise so easily, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>

<td>You've given me time. Ask anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>I can't return to my client without having assassinated you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>When you report to the Holy Guard, please tell them that you eliminated the assassins to the very last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>That will erase me from existence, and it should halt attempts on your life for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cada.png" alt="Cadanova" height="128"><br>Cadanova</td>
<td>I suppose I will owe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>Just until we see whether you cleanse the corruption from this world, or if evil catches up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vanir</td>
<td>There will be consequences if you don't keep up with what you owe.</td>
