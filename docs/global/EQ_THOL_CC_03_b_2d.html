<td>Do not misunderstand what justice truly is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Honestly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That one seemed to have detected the existence of Lost Blue on his own, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How self-righteous of him to demand a total revision of its society after such a pointless investigation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lost Blue being no more would rob our friend Greed Dike of its assets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Seeing as it holds several secret experimental facilities there, not to mention it provides access to assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Lost Blue is simply too convenient a place to hide what you don't want seen. If such a place is brought into the light of day, then its connection to Greed Dike will also be revealed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Why do you target me so?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You really don't know why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Cadanova... An individual that is rather sensitive to the corruption of organizations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He tirelessly develops his strength for the purpose of some day purifying that corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>My path is a righteous one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Phantom Karmacoma... Alchemy that does not require the use of the souls of the dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The eternal duty of the Holy Guard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That is to be unyielding in their faith in justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We cannot allow him to become any stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That is our honor! That is the responsibility of those with power! That is the duty we have been charged with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>How admirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What will happen if we botch this assassination?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If Cadanova falls, great. If he survives, well, it should be fine as long as he understands meddling with Lost Blue will have consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That should keep him from reporting his findings to others. He wouldn't want to bring danger to his comrades, now would he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's just how people like him are, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heh, hahaha...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>A dragon soaring through the air and a unicorn galloping in the sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>This is awesome...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>What I saw was like a scene from a legend playing out before my eyes. It was enough to reignite my passion for the sky. Once again, the sun shone in my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Have you honor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I have my creed as a villain. Does that count?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'd like to hear more about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You wouldn't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For the sake of reaching the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I want to bring the bright blue sky, unobstructed by the veil, and without fear of being devoured by dragons, to the people of Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The bright blue sky...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is it not possible for us to walk the same path of justice?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Why would we be crossing blades at all if we weren't on different paths?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I myself have never seen this Lost Blue, but I acknowledge its existence. I would like to save it if I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>While investigating the past of many assassins, I've caught a glimpse of this so-called Lost Blue. A place forgotten by history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I would like to extend a helping hand from now on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Not possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Whose side are you supposed to be on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's just a difference of perspective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Lost Blue is a lost cause. Like you said, it has been forgotten by history and the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Even if its existence is revealed to the world, there are those who will immediately be culled and ousted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No matter how hard the Holy Guard tries, there will be those who cannot be saved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We will never know unless we at least make an attempt toâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You should learn from history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Those raised in the slums only know how to survive in the slums.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>If denizens of Lost Blue are suddenly brought to live in the world above, they will only know how to make a living by stealing and killing. They will soon find themselves in another slum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Especially if their fate is left up to the Holy Guard, who depend on military might to champion their absolute justice. The Holy Guard cannot save Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You dare insult the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It's just impossible to reform those who are drenched in the ways of the underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>They monopolize authority, crush their enemies, and hide their secrets. Only fools blindly believe in justice, while being intolerant of any tinge of evil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Fools? For some, justice is nothing more than the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Certainly. Just as there are some whose truth is that justice doesn't exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>The only way for Lost Blue to be saved is for it to gain power strong enough to defeat the whole world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Those of us who are twisted cannot bask in the light until the world has become twisted as well. That's the only way for us move forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>And the first step towards that is this fight right here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>So can we finish this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Would you mind giving me some time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You're going to let me go again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The corrupt must be purged with fire. I know this to be true. It is the righteous way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But the reform you dream of cannot occur abruptly. It must be realized gradually over time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>A hasty revolution will bring ruin to the world. History has seen much devastation because of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Justice isn't that easy, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm glad you understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>We may not understand each other, but I can at least give you time to prepare yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There's no way for us to come to an understanding, is there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>The plot can't move along if good and evil compromise so easily, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I wish to ask you one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You've given me time. Ask anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I can't return to my client without having assassinated you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>When you report to the Holy Guard, please tell them that you eliminated the assassins to the very last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>That will erase me from existence, and it should halt attempts on your life for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I suppose I will owe you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Just until we see whether you cleanse the corruption from this world, or if evil catches up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>There will be consequences if you don't keep up with what you owe.</td>
</tr>
