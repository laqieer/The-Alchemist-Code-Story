<td>Agh...huff...huff...! That scum. He really went all in, didn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Why? Why are you doing all of this...?! I just want to die...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I deal with life in my job. I'm also just betting on life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But you're trying to die before you can stop dancing...that I don't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Like I said...it's impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What is impossible? You're willing to risk your life on it, right? If you really want to do it, then you should be able to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>... ...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tsk. He's here already. You get down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yep. This battlefield is for me and the comb head guy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Young lady, I can't afford to even let you, the client, get involved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Or should I just carry out all the job requests at the same time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry. It's my fault. I've involved you as well, Edgar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You've got it wrong. With that one bullet, the version of you that will get married and stop dancing...has died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But, at this rate, the dancer version of you will die as well. Hey, do you really want to die? Or do you want to bet on the future?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...?! What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If you want to die, then you can just remain complacent like this. That bazooka will promptly finish you off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But, if even a part of you, doesn't want to die, then place your finger on the trigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'll hold the gun. With your will to live, pull the trigger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>W-wait...I've never shot...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm sorry, but you're out of time. I've got my next appointment coming up as well. It's over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Close off you future and shoot down your ghost!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>O-ohhh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh...oh...I'm...alive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Hmph. Was that a cancellation request for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, I guess so. The client who felt despair because she thought she wouldn’t be able to dance...is now dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Honestly, that's some free work I did there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh? Dead? Cancellation...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Heh. Like I said, the person before me now is nobody. She's a lady who just likes to dance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>And wherever she may go, she will not blame anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That single shot was filled with emotions. You really are an amazing lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Edgar...am I...allowed to live as I please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Only someone who is determined to create their own future can truly grasp hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'm sure you can do it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Thank you...Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I completed the job, my dear client.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Just so you know, I really hated having to hire you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, that's rich coming from you. Especially after you got me involved. Anyway, I can understand why you would get desperate. She's a good dancer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hmph. That was quite the performance, to be honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tell me that after you pay up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I completed my job. Now hurry up and give me my reward money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This should be enough for the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What're you playing at?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I told you to escort her. Not only did you do that, but you made her fall in love with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Huh?! What kind of nonsense are you spewing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You always go too far! Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Edgar? What are you doing reading the newspaper? You look really happy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah, it's nothing. It's just nice to see someone I know from the old days doing well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Is that so? By the way, were you always like this with women even back then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey, hey, back then I was even more of a "cool and quiet" type. Ah, don't give me that suspicious look...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh, could you tell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I can read that much of a woman's heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ahaha! I wouldn't call that a woman's heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hahah. You've got a point. Shall we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Where are we going to next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I feel like going somewhere where I can enjoy a drink...while watching a beautiful woman dance.</td>
</tr>
