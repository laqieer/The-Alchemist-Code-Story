<td>Well, well. We're certainly a long way from the desert now. This is shaping up to be a last showdown of some sort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You think? I don't know... I feel like I've broken more of a sweat dealing with petty thieves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What kind of thieves have you been dealing with?! Never mind... I'm not gonna let you show me up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Time to bring all these monsters down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right! I'm not here just to play around, after all. The man who taught me how to use Spiritbonding needs my help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Come on, Sand Hawks! Get ready for the fight of your lives! For our future, and the future of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ugh... Energetic, as always. She even managed to drag me into this mess... This isn't even our country. We're not in the Desert Zone anymore... Always making me do things I don't want to do...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Your words are intriguingly at odds with how well-prepared you look for battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Hmph. Well, the Fruit Peddlers have done a lot of good toward increasing our profits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't like to owe anyone anything. I prefer to pay off all my debts in one go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I see. That is good enough reason, indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That he possesses such strength as to summon and transmute a body like this... That Kamui has exceeded all my expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>If my eyes do not deceive me, you must be the Chief of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>No, no. That title belongs to someone who died a long time ago. Hyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm little more than a nameless Sephiran soldier on an anonymous battlefield now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>In that case, consider me the same. Heh! I can't remember the last time I was able to fully concentrate on swinging my sword in battle without worrying about tactics or morale! It makes me feel young again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ha! Such reckless brutishness! I would have expected more gentility from an esteemed general of Gluttony!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nonsense! I was a soldier and mercenary who survived countless battles before I became anything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Being here like this reminds me of who I used to be. I must ask you not to underestimate me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Then I must beg your forgiveness. I had not meant to offend. Perhaps it is a poor apology, but all I can give you is the chance to see our village's most secret of arts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>That is more than I could have ever asked for! Too much, in fact! I would never presume to have the right to see what your people guarded so dearly from the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The rules that once governed the Sephira are little more than dust now. Even if they did still exist, they would be nothing more than extra shackles for our people to carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What reason have the Sephira to burden themselves further? It is up to old fools like myself to show the future generations of my people that it is time to forge a new path forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hah! Fantastic! That was well said for a nameless soldier of the Sephira. I would be honored to bear witness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thank you, friend. "I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Really, there's no reason to be so dramatic. Personally, I prefer a less flashy type of change that builds naturally over time, with conscious effort. Some might call it boring, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Let them have their fun! A chance like this doesn't come around all that often!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm not quite sure how we're connected, stranger, but it feels like a solid match! Care to join me in the fray?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm? What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>No, it's nothing. I am simply...unused to meeting new people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>However, from your appearance, I can see that you must be a gladiator from Eos. It has been a long time since I've seen one of your ilk.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That's right! I'm Teona. I was once champion of the Colosseum!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I see. I would be most obliged to have you at my side in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Is there something wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>No, it's just... Aren't you...? You are! You're Hisham! Look at you! You're all grown up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I-I have no idea what you're talking about. You must have the wrong person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No way! I recognize that twinkle in your eye! You're Hisham! Wow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Come on! Let's charge into battle together! We may never have a chance like this again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That may not be the best plan. I'm really more suited to a supporting role on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Don't be shy! I'm trying to fulfill a kid's dream!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten. You wanted to be a gladiator once, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>All right. On three! Make sure you keep up, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Honestly... You have far too much energy for me, the lot of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Amazing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>They're pushing the Jam back, despite the overwhelming odds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nngh...grk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Kamui?! Are you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>It's nothing. Don't worry about me. We'd best start moving. I can't hold this forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Hurry! We should be able to push through to the arboreal altar now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Understood. Agatha, wait here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? Oh! O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Let's go, Blue Tongues!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What...? Oh, my head... Ever since I saw the light of the Sacred Stone, I've been hearing...someone's voice...</td>
