<td>Then I must beg your forgiveness. I had not meant to offend. Perhaps it is a poor apology, but all I can give you is the chance to see our village's most secret of arts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leordas.png" alt="Leordas" height="128"><br>Leordas</td>
<td>That is more than I could have ever asked for! Too much, in fact! I would never presume to have the right to see what your people guarded so dearly from the rest of the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iakov</td>
<td>The rules that once governed the Sephira are little more than dust now. Even if they did still exist, they would be nothing more than extra shackles for our people to carry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iakov</td>
<td>What reason have the Sephira to burden themselves further? It is up to old fools like myself to show the future generations of my people that it is time to forge a new path forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/leordas.png" alt="Leordas" height="128"><br>Leordas</td>

<td>Really, there's no reason to be so dramatic. Personally, I prefer a less flashy type of change that builds naturally over time, with conscious effort. Some might call it boring, but...</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/hish.png" alt="Hisham" height="128"><br>Hisham</td>
<td>However, from your appearance, I can see that you must be a gladiator from Eos. It has been a long time since I've seen one of your ilk.</td>
