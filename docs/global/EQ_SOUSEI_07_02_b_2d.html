<td>Wait! Please, wait! I know I wronged you! I will pay for the damages! So, please stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>If you eat that, you'll definitely die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Have you reflected on what you did wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I have! I really have!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ambrosia, what is he doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I think he's prostrating himself for forgiveness. I believe this posture is the greatest expression of atonement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is my first time seeing it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Please accept my deepest apologies for what I have done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Honestly, young people these days...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ambrosia, that makes you sound really old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am old! Show your elder more respect!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait, are you alsoâ€”?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I see. So you're from the same hometown as Adaleigh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The Acedia Belt Region, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You lot must seriously enjoy falling from the sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Once again, I apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We were trying to test, through trial and error, whether we could cross the Belt wall based off the findings Adaleigh left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>And, during the test, there was an accident...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, if it was an accident that occurred during testing, I suppose it couldn't be helped. I often have accidents myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'll let the garden thing go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, where exactly were you trying to get to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Gula Belt, I assume?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Yes, that's right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I wanted to tell Nimul and the others about the abnormality that occurred in the Acedia Belt Region.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The rift running through the sky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. That happened here as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A little while ago, our Belt's sky...cracked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It crumbled as if the dome ceiling was peeled away, and what laid beyond was exposed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Do you know something about it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The balance of the Belts is crumbling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Th-that voice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's been a while, Minario. Ah, and Ambrosia is here as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hey, why are you...? What about the Corruption?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Apologies, but there's not enough time to get into the deeper details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Lend me a hand. Your powers are needed to save Nimul and the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Both technique to cross the barrier of corruption that those from the Acedia Belt Region can use and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Abstinent Witch, the magic you have to freely control time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Heh... You've gotten more determined since the last time I saw you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right. What are you planning on using my Space-Time Manipulation for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To save Nimul and the others, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Thank you very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This place is just like the Avaritia Belt from ten years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Quence's technique led me here? For what purpose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I don't have enough information to know for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>What I need to do right now is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I have find that girl I got separated from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Also, if I am to believe that girl's words, Emmel and the others are in this Belt, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Nothing gets solved by my just standing around. I must take action, learn more, and unravel the mystery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That is all that I can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I'm sorry, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's all right. I wasn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Is everything all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It's nothing. Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh! I, um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This is embarrassing...but as you can see, I'm a Fallen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Did you perhaps come from somewhere outside this Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That's correct. Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I knew it! This is quite a rare occurrence. You're a castaway, are you not? Or are you in the Infinite Serpent, like the shrine maiden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>The Infinite Serpent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(Their reach extended here, even this early? Never mind that. More importantly...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>My apologies for staring so rudely. It's rare for a Fallen to have intelligence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>So they say, but the Fallen of our Belt can speak just as I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Those that fall to the Corruption, those with weak wills, and those too weak to become soldiers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>In this Belt, being a Fallen is the mark of a weak person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>The Fallen are weak?</td>
