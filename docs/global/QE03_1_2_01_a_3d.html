<td>Hey. Is the queen still not here yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ah. Her Majesty is currently extremely busy and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I heard that already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What I want to know is what official duty is so important as to keep a Paladin waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I-indeed, Captain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Um... Captain Dias, it appears Her Majesty is not feeling well. If possible, could you come again another day...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>She's not feeling well? Are you talking about the queen who was keeping me waiting just a moment ago for official duties?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Is there something that you don't want me and the Holy Guard to know about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>N-not at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, that's right, Captain Dias! From today, one of the country's prominent events will begin at the Venus School of Magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>While we're keeping you waiting, please at least allow me to show you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What? Who cares about—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come now! Do take advantage of this opportunity! It would be a shame if you missed it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>He's overly persistent for this just to be a patrol. Could he be after the Sacred Stone after all? The blasted Corpse...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Rebecca said we'll settle things at Sabbath...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I was always helping out at the shop so I've never seen Sabbath properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's why I don't really understand the rules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Anyway, I know it's some kind of mock battle where you ride on a Broom Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yep, yep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't think too much. Just get on a Broom Ace, fly, and try to remove your opponent's mask in order to win! It's simple, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's not simple at all! I mean—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Look! I can't use both of my hands! How am I supposed to remove the mask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're riding it wrong! You're supposed to ride on it standing with both of your feet. Like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ohh, right! I've seen other witches ride on it like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you can do this, you're an Ace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Wait...can Rebecca do this as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I-I'm gonna learn too! Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oops... Looks like you'll need a lot of practice. Perfect. Here comes your practice partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Here it comes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Inside the school we can't ride on Broom Aces without permission, so...get ready for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm not ready yet!</td>
