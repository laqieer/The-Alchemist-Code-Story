<td>(I cannot stop myself from treading down this path. Even if I lose all of my comrades and am forced to walk it alone, I must continue to bear the hopes of the many.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I must forge on... Isn't that right, Letitia?</td>

<td>Vettel!</td>

<td>Ren...?</td>

<td>What happened?! Why the hell weren't you there?! Why were they there instead?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>"They"...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>They were clad in what looked like Paladin armor. I think they called themselves the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You say...they were Paladins?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Why would they send Paladins? Could they have a plan in motion? No...that can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What are you babbling about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We've...been outmaneuvered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Outmaneuvered...? By who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It must have been the Blue Flame Guard... No. The minister. We were originally ordered by the Minister to disregard Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What happened to Zah...to Shadow Messiah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Most of them were killed...when the Philosopher's Stone mine exploded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Zahar...Zehn, Ila...and those who remained behind at the stronghold are all that's left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What about the one named Corvus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Dead. He was killed by the Paladins who call themselves the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So? What's our move, boss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If I were able to make any moves, I would. However, we have been consigned to a joint drill with the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We depart for Northern Pride immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait...what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Regardless, I cannot allow you continue on such a perilous mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's not—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Shadow Messiah are waning in power. They won't try anything for the time being. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Besides, what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I know for certain that I will once again face Zahar on the battlefield. I feel it in my bones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>How...did this...happen? Why...? Why are you so bruised and battered?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ugh... Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Tell me. What has transpired here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>It was...a surprise attack...by the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Holy Guard! Again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>They have shattered my Sacred Darkstone! You...will rue this day, you holy curs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We simply cannot have you doing whatever you please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Who might you be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Zahar, this would be our first meeting in person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I see. I have heard of you before. You are the mastermind behind the Holy...no. Behind the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You go by the name Waginau, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Indeed, I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What is your purpose in all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Equilibrium in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Ha. Lies. Your organization is bent on wide-scale conquest, and you are the one who pulls the strings from the shadows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You have it wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>How so? You sow the seeds of war and ensure that chaos runs rampant throughout the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You boast of building an orderly society, yet you commit the kinds of heinous acts that can only promote anarchy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Within chaos, lies truth. Conflict is the stabilizer of this world. Order, under the guise of chaos, is essential to generate conflict...which in turn affords us equilibrium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Such hypocrisy will not lead to truth, nor could it ever result in true order. I will be the one to bestow upon this world its new order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The truths we both seek, Zahar, are in fact one and the same. Zahar... Won't you join me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I have had my eye on you ever since you rose through the ranks as a knight in the Holy Guard. Will you not take my offer?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I will not serve you like some mongrel dog, nor do I have any interest in becoming one of your animated dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Such is not my intention. Under my guidance, you would be molded into a true King of Darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>This is a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So be it. I was aware from the beginning that this would be your answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I am the savior of the shadows, and I will claim the title of King of Darkness without your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>How disappointing to hear. However, Zahar, I concede that you are truly a hero of the darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I shall see that your name is carved unto the hearts of our people, and allow your memory to endure the test of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Even so... you may not be the one to control the darkness of this world, for the darkness within you is too intense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Once I have finished with you, my pure darkness will shine upon the world, make no mistake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Fare thee well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>This world will be remade in my image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! Lord... Lord Zahar!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ila...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I can’t find Mia nowhere. They musta taken her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>The Holy Order has truly rotted right down to the core if they have the audacity to kidnap a little girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Please! I'm beggin' ya... Save Mia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We will pursue immediately. Mia will not be lost on my watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Lord Zahar... Why can’t I join the Shadow Messiah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Mia, let me ask you: Why do you want to join us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Why? Because...I want to be useful to you, just like Ila.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>In that case, I want you to remember: One's worth is not limited to the field of battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>It's...not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That it is not. At this moment, we have no choice but to fight, in order to change the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We, Shadow Messiah, will form the cornerstone of the new world...but your role must be different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>But...why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>You will stand atop the foundations we lay. You will live in the world we strive to build.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>When that time comes, you must obey the laws we establish and contribute to society in an orderly manner. That is how you can be of use to me. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Sorry... I don't...think I get it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hm. That's fine. You don't have to understand right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Lord Zahar...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Are you awake?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>No need to be frightened, little one. We don't want to hurt you. Nor will we have to, if you behave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Wh-why did you kidnap me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You must already know, precious bait. To lure Zahar out, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>B-bait...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh, look...he's biting. Hehehe. Just like we planned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Lord Zahar! Ila!!! Stay away!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Mia, we're comin' ta save you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It never ceases to amaze me how low you lot are willing to stoop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Hehehe. We must eliminate interlopers like you, for the sake of peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>So you'll do whatever you decide to be correct? It is my understanding that Waginau would prefer to have me under his command...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>No matter. However strong you might be, or how powerful your alchemy, it won't be enough to polish my boots! Bow before me, for mine is the way of truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I shall reign supreme over the darkness, and become a god of blight to eradicate the old world!</td>
</tr>
