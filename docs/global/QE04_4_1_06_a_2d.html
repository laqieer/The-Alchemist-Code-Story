<td>You're suggesting we split our forces into two? Don't you think it unwise for us to cut our strength in half before attempting to slay a dragon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Not if we are to protect Saga. Several measures need to be taken in order to ensure its survival. Destroying the core is the first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This, I leave to you, Tina, Rega, Lisbeth, and Georgios. Mocca, you will go with them and take command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Such few numbers? What will we be doing in the meantime?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We will be activating the Matter in Tamis' body. Restoring the Wind Matter should be our utmost priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I see. It has long been said that the four Matter exist to seal away the dragon. This is your backup plan...in case we're unable to defeat the beast, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wow... Is that what the Matter were designed to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>The dragon is mentioned in an ancient legend within Saga. It is said to be a living incarnation of nature's fury. As long as we coexist in harmony with nature, it will not reveal itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>However, should we humans dare decide to betray the will of nature, even for a moment...the dragon shall emerge to annihilate us all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Moreover, as proof of its desire to coexist with humanity, nature created the entity we call Matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Then they're not just stones imbued with the power of purification... They're not just there for the sole purpose of suppressing Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, the people of Sephira, too, had the same power...but ever since they were exterminated...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>The four Matter have been the only entities capable of purifying and containing Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Sephiran people, and Matter too, flourished beneath the great tree of life, Sephiron. Building roots among Mother Nature has granted them access to the power of purification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>But now...the Wind Matter lies dormant. Don't tell me...you intend to awaken it by force!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We will rejuvenate the Wind Matter by infusing Tamis with the various powers in all of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>The wind within is yet a small breeze...but we will nourish it with water, warm it with fire, and shape it with earth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>If we funnel each of the elements using a circulation of wind, we can create a perpetual cycle that will restore the Wind Matter to its original state. This is the only method remaining to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wagering all we have on awakening the dormant Wind Matter is the best option available to us right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're going to infuse all of your Matter into her?! Do you have any idea how taxing that'll be on her body?! It's far too risky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Then tell me, do you have a better plan? Even if we manage to destroy the dragon, there still remains the problem of sealing Beelzebub.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Our objective remains the same. We shall restore the Wind Matter to its original state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I have been prepared from the very beginning to give my body up to revive the Wind Matter. Let me do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Mocca, I'll be fine. If I can be of help to you, then all the more reason why I should do this. I mean, it's not like I can fight by your side or anything...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I've always envied the fact that Tina can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>For once...I'm the only one who can do this. So, please Mocca, allow me to help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tamis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Then it's decided. We'll retrieve the Matter from each of the temples, then infuse their power into Tamis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Meanwhile, you will go and defeat the ancient dragon. If all goes accordingly, we'll reclaim Beelzebub and seal the dragon once and for all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Furthermore, when Tamis receives all of our Matter, the Ouija will be released, enabling her to use it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>If you can't take the dragon down, then leave it to us. We'll show you the true power of the Sprite Trio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Whether you agree or not, this is our best course of action. Now then, prepare to move out—hm... Looks like we have company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Glurp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We'll rendezvous after we've visited each of the temples. Time is of the essence! Let's make swift work of them and be on our way!</td>
</tr>
