<td>This is the third battle in the Mech War Games Tournament! With mech gear in hand, our competitors will clash in a fierce battle to the bitter end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tournament Host</td>
<td>Daisy has a strong offensive, but she's only barely hitting those weak points, and has yet to earn a single point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tournament Host</td>
<td>However, if she keeps up these all-out attacks, it will only be a matter of time before she knocks her opponent to the ground and claims victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contestant</td>
<td>Nrgh! She's fast—and her attacks are critical! I can't make out a single pattern in her attacks! She's unpredictable!</td>
</tr>

<td>Heh, this is nothing! I'll show you my best attack! Huzzzzaaahhh!</td>

<td>It's no good! I...s-surrend—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Ngh! You're not bad, you know. I can't believe you were able to find my weak spots, and keep those attacks coming one after the other! Urgh... I'm beat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contestant</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about? I didn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tournament Host</td>
<td>What a match! A mysterious, invisible attack from her opponent brought Daisy to the ground! As if she simply fell over! It's game over!</td>
</tr>

<td>Wh-what?! This is rigged! Hey! I bet so much money on this chick!</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>

<td>You've gotten stronger since then, haven't you?</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Oh, just h-hurry up and wind up the music box already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Just twist it like this, and then... All right, here it goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Heheh. It's so cute! But...that's strange... Why hasn't it wilted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>I treated it with a special trick of the trade. That aside, how was the tournament? It was today, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Oh! Yep, that's right. I lost, just like they wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>That was clever of you. Where money is involved, things never end prettily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Yeah, Leema told me something similar. She said that entering a big tournament would be dangerous, and I could end up getting hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>But I just grinned at her and told her that I was counting on her for the cleanup. So then Leema told me to lose, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>You better lose spectacularly, 'cause I'll be the one dealing with the mess you make, after all. That's what she said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Spectacularly, hm? Well, playing Mech War Games costs money. I can't say I blame you for trying to make some extra coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Anyway, what I really want to know is...what do you keep smirking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Well, Leema is going to teach me how to make Mecha Lances—and she even said that she would do the maintenance for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>It's all thanks to this flower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>There are many ways in which flowers may be used for decoration, but in order to bring out their beauty to its greatest extent—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>The flowers themselves need to be bred for beauty, right? The other parts of the decoration are just there to make it pop. I guess I'm the same. My weapons can't bring out strength that isn't there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Yes. It is vital that the flower itself is aware of its own beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Yeah... It helped me remember some stuff. Things I'm good at, things I'm bad at, things that are important to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Hey, do you think this flower realizes how cute it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Why don't you buy it yourself and tell it how cute it is every day, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>All right, but I want a discount! No one can afford this price! A hundred thousand Zeni is way too much for a student!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Hahaha... All right...but only if you can beat me in a game of shogi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>I was hoping you would say that! If I win, I get a discount!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Come to think of it, how is this music box a toy, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Now, now. A toy is something that brings joy and smiles to people, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>I guess this thing did make me smile... Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/rich.png" alt="Richie" height="128"><br>Richie</td>
<td>Any more questions, or shall we begin? A customer might come along and buy that music box if you take too long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/dais.png" alt="Daisy" height="128"><br>Daisy</td>
<td>Oh, no! Quick, hurry up and start already!</td>
