<td>This is the third battle in the Mech War Games Tournament! With mech gear in hand, our competitors will clash in a fierce battle to the bitter end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Daisy has a strong offensive, but she's only barely hitting those weak points, and has yet to earn a single point!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, if she keeps up these all-out attacks, it will only be a matter of time before she knocks her opponent to the ground and claims victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Nrgh! She's fast—and her attacks are critical! I can't make out a single pattern in her attacks! She's unpredictable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Heh, this is nothing! I'll show you my best attack! Huzzzzaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's no good! I...s-surrend—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ngh! You're not bad, you know. I can't believe you were able to find my weak spots, and keep those attacks coming one after the other! Urgh... I'm beat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what are you talking about? I didn't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What a match! A mysterious, invisible attack from her opponent brought Daisy to the ground! As if she simply fell over! It's game over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what?! This is rigged! Hey! I bet so much money on this chick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That's my cue! Leema, let's get outta here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>L-ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated! P-please remain calm! Th-there is no need to resort to violence! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Richie! Hey, Richie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Hey. Don't run around in my shop, you little savage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Please tell me you haven't sold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Really, now. Is it necessary to ask me that every single day? No one has so much as asked about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I made it, so you're not allowed to sell it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, please... I was the one who paid for the light globe and the music box gears to make something of this simple daisy in a jar!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>All you did was help me put the toy together. If a customer wants it, I will sell it to them without a moment's hesitation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's so greedy! You... You silly-hat weirdo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You've gotten stronger since then, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Oh, just h-hurry up and wind up the music box already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Just twist it like this, and then... All right, here it goes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Heheh. It's so cute! But...that's strange... Why hasn't it wilted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I treated it with a special trick of the trade. That aside, how was the tournament? It was today, wasn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Oh! Yep, that's right. I lost, just like they wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That was clever of you. Where money is involved, things never end prettily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yeah, Leema told me something similar. She said that entering a big tournament would be dangerous, and I could end up getting hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I just grinned at her and told her that I was counting on her for the cleanup. So then Leema told me to lose, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You better lose spectacularly, 'cause I'll be the one dealing with the mess you make, after all. That's what she said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Spectacularly, hm? Well, playing Mech War Games costs money. I can't say I blame you for trying to make some extra coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Anyway, what I really want to know is...what do you keep smirking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, Leema is going to teach me how to make Mecha Lances—and she even said that she would do the maintenance for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's all thanks to this flower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There are many ways in which flowers may be used for decoration, but in order to bring out their beauty to its greatest extent—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The flowers themselves need to be bred for beauty, right? The other parts of the decoration are just there to make it pop. I guess I'm the same. My weapons can't bring out strength that isn't there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes. It is vital that the flower itself is aware of its own beauty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Yeah... It helped me remember some stuff. Things I'm good at, things I'm bad at, things that are important to me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hey, do you think this flower realizes how cute it is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Why don't you buy it yourself and tell it how cute it is every day, hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All right, but I want a discount! No one can afford this price! A hundred thousand Zeni is way too much for a student!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Hahaha... All right...but only if you can beat me in a game of shogi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I was hoping you would say that! If I win, I get a discount!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Come to think of it, how is this music box a toy, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Now, now. A toy is something that brings joy and smiles to people, is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I guess this thing did make me smile... Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Any more questions, or shall we begin? A customer might come along and buy that music box if you take too long!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, no! Quick, hurry up and start already!</td>
</tr>
