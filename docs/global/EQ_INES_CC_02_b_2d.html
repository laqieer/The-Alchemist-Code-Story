<td>002</td>
<td>Rrg...</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Ines? Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Y-yeah. I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Excuse me, driver? Could you stop here for a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Claris?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Come out, please, Ines, won't you? The flowers around these parts are stunningly beautiful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Whoa! I had no idea there were meadows like this around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Well, we are now quite a distance from your forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The scent from these flowers is known to calm one's nerves. Take a deep breath here, and you should quickly feel at ease.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Really? All right, then.<br>Huff... Haaaa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well? How do you feel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...do feel a little better now. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Glad to hear it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Nasario? Is something bothering you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm troubled by the state of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was closely observing our surroundings as we left it earlier, and noted it wasn't just the Rattys that are exasperated...but all the creatures. Every last one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that...because of me? Because a human had entered into your sacred space?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No. You've been accepted by the spirits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The ancient blessing placed upon your lineage was recognized and acknowledged. The creatures of the woods should not have seen you as any sort of threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>So, what then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There must be another who disturbs the noble timbre of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wait, so someone other than Claris was there too? For what reason, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Could someone have the high elves in their sights, like...before...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Ines...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The only thing I can say for certain is that they have not yet approached us, small comfort though that may be. But do rest assured, I am remaining on guard in case they do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Um... I'm sorry to interrupt, but we are falling behind schedule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Right. We should go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ines, take a look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Is it...a lantern?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes. I noticed the carriage is a bit dark inside, so I thought perhaps we could use it to make the remainder of our trip a bit more comfortable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But I wasn't certain if you'd want to. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I-I think it's a good idea. Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>......</td>
