<td>Ugh... this is insane! Just you wait... the Holy Guard will hear of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No! We can't let him escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Leave him be. We've busted his operation through and through. He probably won't be setting foot in Slothstein's underworld ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What about the Holy Guard? If word gets out that Soren was using Alchemy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>As if that guy could go to the police in his state! You worry too much, Sieg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Now that that's all settled, how about a nice warm bath and dinner at the tavern? It'll be my treat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You were staying here all along, huh? So that’s how you ran into Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>T'was a lucky coincidence. I'm just glad it all worked out for the children, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You mentioned you were here for leads, right? That kidnapping ring has been on my radar for a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We've busted them thanks to you and Soren, but as for their employer, I'm afraid we haven't been able to find out anything. Elusive bunch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm thinking, though... since Soren can wield Alchemy, maybe it would be best if we asked for her help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're not thinking of Teach, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Oh, fancy meeting you here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Shion! Good to see you again. What're you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>On a business trip, as usual. I see you've brought the boy along.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yeah. I thought I'd try to find out who hired the raiders back in Sakris Village. Turns out there's a similar kidnapping ring here, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>And who might this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah, yes. Shion is a retainer to a noble house in Wadatsumi. I met her in the village. She really helped me out back there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shion, this is Roxanne. She's a childhood friend of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Pleased to make your acquaintance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...The pleasure is all mine. So you're a retainer, huh. Do they send retainers all over the place to conduct business these days?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>My lord is interested in all manners of commerce. I merely carry out his will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Does that include "helping" men out?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Roxanne, what are you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...I do not claim to know what you're getting at, but if my information is reliable, do you not engage men in your line of work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's different. Nobody shows up and helps a random man in a village in the middle of nowhere without ulterior motives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ah, then are you implying you only help others for selfish reasons, like personal interest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now see here—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Have I spoken out of turn? I must apologize. I have other matters to attend to, so... please do excuse me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Until next time, Siegfried. To you as well, Soren... and of course, Miss Roxanne.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Honestly, Roxanne, I don't know why you're so worked up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All I'm saying is you should watch your back around women like her! Who knows what she's up to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah... what are you, my wife? Keeping me on a short leash and all that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>NO!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Okay, sheesh. You didn't have to shout...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Stupid Sieg... How dense can he get?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ugh... I barely escaped with my life. That brat... How did he obtain Alchemy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ah! So you came after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There was an unexpected complication. Brass Rose Roxanne managed to mess up my operation with some Alchemy-wielding kid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Please, you have to help me stay under the radar. After all I've done to fulfill my end of the contract...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>(The figure gestures to the slight figure beside him.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We do not deny that you have been of great assistance. However, we cannot ignore your duplicity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Some of the children we received were found to have families.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>That is not what we requested from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>W-well... you just wanted children, right? There are only so many orphans in Slothstein—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hold your tongue and keep your excuses. I do not want to hear from a man who trivializes human lives for monetary gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Deliver the judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>As you wish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait! What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Your wicked ways end here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hrrkk...</td>
</tr>
