<td>Why are you just standing there, staring into space? What's going through that empty old demon head of yours?</td>

<td>Shut. Up.</td>

<td>Look, I get it! You can be a human or a demon and still share in the pain of losing Kaede. Your regrets from that day still haunt you, right?</td>

<td>Kaede was in the same boat, but she got over it. She achieved happiness by casting off those chains and just being who she wanted to be. And yeah, in the end, you weren't able to protect her.</td>

<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>Nah, I don't buy it. I mean, if you were that committed, then why would we still be here having this conversation with me? You're clearly hesitating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tanosuke</td>
<td>I know that humans have caused you harm before, just for being a demon. But there was a time in your life when you forgave them for that. Remember?</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Can there be any doubt he would've lied again, given the chance? Kaede's future with him would've only ended in tears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
