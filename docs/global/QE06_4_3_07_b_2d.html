<td>Why are you just standing there, staring into space? What's going through that empty old demon head of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Shut. Up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You actually look a little human when you're like this, wallowing in your own regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why won't you shut up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Look, I get it! You can be a human or a demon and still share in the pain of losing Kaede. Your regrets from that day still haunt you, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You have no idea what you're talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You don't have to be bound by what's expected of your species. You're free to follow your own path. All that matters is what you want to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'm not bound by anything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Then why are you working toward destroying humanity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Because I must.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But that's not what you want, is it? Ipso facto, you're bound by what's expected of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Kaede was in the same boat, but she got over it. She achieved happiness by casting off those chains and just being who she wanted to be. And yeah, in the end, you weren't able to protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You think that somehow means it's your duty now to kill all humans?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nah, I don't buy it. I mean, if you were that committed, then why would we still be here having this conversation with me? You're clearly hesitating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I know that humans have caused you harm before, just for being a demon. But there was a time in your life when you forgave them for that. Remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You accepted Koga into your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So seriously, just ask yourself: What is it you actually want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Demon or human... It doesn't matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Something to...protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Like I said, our time here is limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We'll have to return to these sacred vessels soon. But before we do, we wanted to make sure to deliver our message to you:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Don't forget, there are people here who sincerely wish for your happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I... I want to protect...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you forgetting what the humans did to your brethren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A-ah...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, I knew you wouldn't forget that so easily, now, would you? You know just how cruel, backhanded, destructive, and wretched those humans are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Th-that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Koga lied to you, don't forget. He hid that he was once a demon hunter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Can there be any doubt he would've lied again, given the chance? Kaede's future with him would've only ended in tears.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He blinded you with a facade of happiness while he slowly prepared to lower you into the pits of despair. You know it's true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I... I hate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Is that all the ferocity you have in you? After everything those humans have done? What of all the resentment that's pooled up over the years?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I hate...hate...hate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>There you go! More. Let your hatred flow. Allow your unfettered enmity to swallow you whole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>HateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHateHate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes, that's it! Good, Tamba! Good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Rraaaaaaghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Aaah! What the heck?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hate... Hate...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>HateHateHateHateHateHate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Gah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Rraaaaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>He's gone berserk! This isn't just Tamba anymore. There's something else influencing him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>And whatever it is, it's been gnawing at his mind for a long, long time now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So this is what's kept you bound for so long... And I couldn't do anything about it. I'm so sorry, Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I'm sure the Blade Fox has some way to counter this, though. I hope. Right... Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(The only thing I can do for now is...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Fingers crossed!</td>
