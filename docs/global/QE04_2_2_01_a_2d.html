<td>Do you mean that...the Wind Matter is inside her body?!</td>

<td>Wait...is that the same as Voda carrying the Water Matter inside of her?</td>

<td>Worthy individuals can carry Matter inside their body so as to prevent any evil from touching it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>However...even a Sprite has a limitation to how long they can sustain this task. My limit is twelve hours.</td>

<td>Was this girl blinded...so as to block her senses and prevent any evil from touching the Matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yes. From generation to generation, one member of my family has had their eyes crushed at birth.</td>

<td>After all, even after it has lost its power, it is difficult to sustain the Wind Matter within one's body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So that's why they call you a "vessel"...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes.</td>

<td>Until the day that the power of the wind is revived, I will protect the Matter. That is my duty as a descendant of the Alize people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Fuu boy, the truth has been made apparent to me. Why don't you explain the rest to me with your own words?</td>

<td>What the...? What is that?!</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Glurrrrrp!!!</td>

<td>The village is under attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>We must save them...ugh...aghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ack! I underestimated the power of Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Alia, I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise to you. I'm truly...sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I should've saved you that night, even if it meant breaking the law. The future cycle...for the good of Saga!</td>

<td>Are you okay? I'll get you some water...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...Thank you.</td>

<td>Did you have another vision, Tina?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Another vision... Hey, Tina, hang in there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Fuu, I received another revelation of destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What is the future cycle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>In my vision, right before you lost your life...you said, "Alia, I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise to you."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What...?! How do you know about that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your promise with Alia? I see...so that's what you've been so stubborn about protecting. I should've expected something like that from you, Fuu boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Glurrrp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Fuu, please, tell us about it later. Right now...we must protect this village!</td>
