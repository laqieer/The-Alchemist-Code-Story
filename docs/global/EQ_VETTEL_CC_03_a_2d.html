<td>Ah, excuse me! Please carry that over there! Yeah, and turn it this way. Yup like that, next, uhm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Please set up a rest area over here. Do we have enough blankets? Well, in that case please—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Agh, this is the worst! Why did they have to find a ruin now of all times?! Right when we're spread so thin?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now we gotta prepare for the Holy Order and the Paladins to arrive too, argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's about time I go to meet them. I'll have to guide them to the ruins, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hold on! You're going by yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Everybody is already busy enough with rebuilding and keeping the peace. If I take anyone along, it will only increase the burden on everyone else. I'll figure it out one way or another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...One way or another isn't exactly great either, though. Don't you see the issue here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Here's the ruin entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I'm sorry for making you come out here on such short notice. I know the Order and the Holy Guard have their own reconstruction efforts to deal with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't worry about it. This is our job. Besides, your men are just as overworked as the rest of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>We will head inside to investigate. Please wait outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haha, don't mind him. It's really an honor knowing that you are guarding the entrance!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...So basically, they don't want me to follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>This place looks pretty ancient, though. Wonder what's inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oops, you caught me. Should have expected nothing less from the Captain of the Scarlet Flame Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My, my. Did I catch you trespassing? That isn't like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ah well. I guess this makes things a little more interesting for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ngh—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Nn... Or maybe not...? Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, well. You still have the energy to be distracted mid-fight? Did I make it too easy for you, Ren?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hyaaaaaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
