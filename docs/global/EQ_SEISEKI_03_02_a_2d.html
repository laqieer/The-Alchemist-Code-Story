<td>Hyah!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Fyuuuuah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ack! More of them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What's going on? I thought you said this road was tough, but there wouldn't be many monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>If you have time to complain, then use your sword! You're being inefficient!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Seida's right! It doesn't matter how many of them come at us if we defeat them all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Here they come again! Over here! If we move along this side path, we may be able to trick the monsters to some degree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't talk nonsense! We won't result to trickery! We must advance head on and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Are you going to repeat our earlier discussion? How inefficient can you stand to be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Stop! Don't fight between the two of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? Now that I think about it, isn't there something strange about the movements of the monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They keep coming head on towards us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's almost as if they knew we would take this route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, I know! There must be a spy amongst us who is aiding the monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I see. In that case, it's obvious that you're the most suspicious out of all of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh?! N-no! It's not me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Be quiet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I can feel a sinister presence in the wind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't know the details, but I think the herd of monsters is moving towards the source of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In other words, there is someone controlling the monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It can't be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Did you have someone in mind?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No, but what about the group who is causing conflict that Captain Kudan and the 4th Regiment are looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Right! They could be the source of this sinister presence that Seida is talking about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>True. There's a possibility of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ohh, look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What is it this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>There's a suspension bridge over there! If we cross that, we can reach the summit...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yikes, more monsters!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's defeat them and advance forward! Everyone, attack!</td>
