<td>Seriously. If you're gonna take time off, how about you do it somewhere more peaceful next time? Why would you choose such a troublesome place like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's to avoid meddling folk like you of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>If it's somewhere that has easy access, my subordinates would come right away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you even have any regard for your subordinates and your guild?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's got nothing to do with you. I don't want to hear your tiresome lectures.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Heheh. I finally found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? Who are you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with you! Our business is with that scrawny fellow over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Did you forget about us? We blame you for what happened to our organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>A band of thieves, huh? I didn't know the Guild handled folk like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's simple... At some point, we determined they were hindering our work. It was nothing personal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Heheh. Keep saying that. This is where your luck runs out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We've become well-known to the point that if we take you and the Guild out, we'll be able to resurrect our organization!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Correct me if I'm wrong, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Did you set off on your own because you wanted to divert the attention of these bandits away from the Guild?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hmph. The Guild isn't like your tiny little organization. These guys don't hold a candle in comparison to the Guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Keep talking! All your bold talk sounds weak when you're hiding out here in the middle of nowhere.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Far from forgetting about us, you've been running scared from us, haven't you?! Gawhaw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You want to protect the pathetic members of your Guild, even if it means having to sacrifice yourself, huh? Gyahahah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right. So, these are the scum that dabble in killing and human trafficking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hearing all this vulgar talk is serving as a reminder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I thought they disappeared because of internal division, but, I see... You were taking them out on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>With this to take care of, I understand what's been keeping you busy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>It's not like you to take the hard road like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Shut up already! You wanna die?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>How amusing. Go on and give it a try. I was just getting bored of having to play babysitter for this fellow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This has nothing to do with you either. Stay out of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Hah! Finally, you show your true intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Sorry, but I'll be participating in this. There something about their rotten attitude that I just can't stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Have it your way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Fine! Let's take them both out then!</td>
