<td>Agatha! There you are!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh? What's the matter you two?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Leaving the main army is dangerous! What're you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What do you mean? I'm stocking up on medicinal herbs, of course.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Medicinal herbs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This is the healing prairie, Siguroardottir. Various types of medicinal herbs grow in clusters here.</td>

<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There are a lot of injured within the Guard, aren't there? I thought I would collect these and make plenty of healing salve.</td>

<td>Agatha...</td>

<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>In any case, don't go running off on your own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Running off? I may not be able to wield a sword, but I have my way of fighting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Even so! Don't suddenly disappear like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh...sorry! Did I worry you?</td>

<td>N-no...</td>

<td>Just as Dias's voice fades off, Logi suddenly detects someone's presence and calls out to the two of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Get down, both of you! It's Wratharis soldiers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>!</td>

<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It looks like they haven't noticed us. I wonder where they're headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It could be Naraba Village. You can see it over there. They're famous for their herbs, so it's certainly—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Are they gonna attack the village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>No, hold on! Can you see, Dias?! Monsters are attacking Naraba Village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Are the Lizard Brigade gonna try to save the village?! How hypocritical of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Perfect. We'll be able to see how the famous Wratharis soldiers fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What are you talking about, Dias! You're not going to help?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What? We're at war with these guys. There's no need to help. Right, Logi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Seriously! You're an idiot, Dias! I won't ask again. I'll go myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Wa-wait! Agatha, calm down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you going to let them get massacred too, Logi? When did you become such a cold human being?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>No! What I'm trying to say is that it's dangerous if you go alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We can't abandon them, just because they're Wratharis soldiers. We're going to Naraba Village, Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Huh?! Why do I have to—Hey! Wait!</td>
