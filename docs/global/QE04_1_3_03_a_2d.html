<td>I was surprised to see Tina get so emotional. Somehow, it was comforting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah. I guess you have to hand it to the chief of Voda who can control nature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There was so much truth in your words that it made the problems of human society seem so fleeting. You touched me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Right back at you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What you said about Saga being on the verge of extinction and how we don't have time to bicker amongst ourselves...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I don't know...something about that moved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tina! Yes, I agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No...forget about that. I got a little too worked up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Right...I wanted to ask you about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Why did you get so worked up? Is it something to do with Fuu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You called Fuu "that man." It sounded to me like you have a close relationship with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Huh? Is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't intend to keep secrets from the two of you, but give me a little more time. When the time is right, I'll tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No way?! Does that mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Are you fine with that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>He's telling us he'll tell us when the time is right. As our friend, shouldn't we trust his word?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Friend...! Ah...is that the way you see him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>You can be pretty curt sometimes, so it's hard to know what you're thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, do you think of me as your friend as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What are you prattling on about? Anyway, I'm tired of using my brain so much. I lack sugar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Did you want chocolate? Sorry...I gave it all to that old merchant just now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Well...he pointed us in the right direction, so I thought it would be rude not to thank him somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>He seemed happy and told me that Lustburg candy was rare around these parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What?! Ack...! That man...! I'm going to get it all back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey...! What are you talking about?! You can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Friends, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I just realized that it's been a while since I was walking alongside someone I truly trusted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Mocca...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What is this...nonsense...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heh...I can sense the child in the wind...let's go.</td>
