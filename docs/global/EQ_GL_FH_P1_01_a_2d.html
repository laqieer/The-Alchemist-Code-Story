<td>Several months since that fateful encounter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>In the dim light of an abandoned safehouse, the final Sister revealed her identity at long last.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Clotho and the Director were one and the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Disdainful of mankind's innumerable sins, she vowed to purify this world in Soren's name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>If I must force you to see the truth of this world, then so be it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Give it some thought, Master...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I will be waiting. As I always have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>While Goetia ramps up their operations, many of its members still remain oblivious to the Director's will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But not all are content to remain unwitting pawns in the grand chessboard of Clotho's vision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>- Goetia, Slothstein Branch -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's her status?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There is...ah...promising progress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Her signal is quite pure, quite pure indeed... Far better than expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>However there remain a few...obstacles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Get to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You will know soon enough. Her training session has been approved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Let's not dawdle then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There is no need to worry. Your vitals are in excellent condition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You've just been...asleep for a long time, after your little accident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But look how far you've come from that frail maiden lying under rubble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's...right, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Thank you, Doktor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Ah, a final request before you leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Your thoughts, whatever they may be. Write them down. Do not forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I would hear them. So that...that you can be whole again, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...Yes. I'll do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If there's nothing else...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She has not protested her ministrations?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not at all, Doktor. She takes her doses without complaint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Good, good...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>All that remains is her combat performance, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Let us hope Grimm won't work her to the bone just yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I expect you have gone through your lab simulations, but this is the real deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You will patrol this stretch of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>As this is a restricted area, intruders must be dispatched immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I needn't tell you to clean up your messes after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>When will this exercise end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>When I say so. Dismissed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>With a curt nod, Roxanne slings her rifle over her shoulder and makes for one of the many winding alleys.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(It's almost too quiet here.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Was this place supposed to be...livelier? I don't remember.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Tracing the faded edge of a stone wall, the sniper looks skyward at the setting sun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>At some point before her reawakening, she must have beheld such a scene. Perhaps even countless times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Yet all Roxanne felt in her chest was a seizing wistfulness for something she couldn't quite recall.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What was that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(There!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Wait... You're...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>How long has it been, Rox?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>An entire mansion gone, just like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You were there. Weren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>All of us were. And so were you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You were one of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The one with the Alchemia...he was too dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We should never have taken him in. Goetia was right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We damn near raised the boy! How could you be so heartless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You're the one who threw your lot in with those criminals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(He seems familiar too...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>(But why can't I remember?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Haaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Roxanne... I'm disappointed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>You've forsaken everything that you stood for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'll hear no more of this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You've got a lot of nerve showing up here in the first place!</td>
</tr>
