<td>001</td>
<td>...I'm finally back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It looks peaceful at a glance. Though from what you've described, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's not the case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Admittedly, I don't know the present situation. Things may have changed in Wadatsumi since I've been away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It's best to keep expectations low, however. Although...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I didn't think you'd really stick with me all this way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I'd rather die than not help you out of whatever dilemma you've gotten yourself wrapped up in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So you're playing the fool, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you saying I've been a nuisance?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>At first, yes. But now I'm glad to have you with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Nice to hear you've come to believe in me a little!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Well, we have been through a lot together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So, ol' Logi... You think he's really gonna show up here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Yes. If that knight we met was truly headed for Gluttony Foss, then Logi has surely received our message by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nonetheless...or rather, because of that, there isn't a moment to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must fully secure the stone's return, before the traitor notices its absence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So we're just puttin' ourselves right in the line of fire, huh? This seems like it's gonna turn into a pretty big headache.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You may take your leave if you'd prefer. This has been our fight from the very start, not yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No thank you, ma'am! Did you already forget what I said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've never sold out a friend to survive, and I never will. We're in this together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Tch! Looks like we have company.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait. Something's not right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The heck?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Edgar! Get back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That did somethin'! Let's try it again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What the...? It deflected my bullet! But I just got a clean shot off a second ago!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is a Dismortant. It's a twisted, weaponized creation of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>They learn from past pain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I see. Guess I called the whole headache thing! How do we beat 'em?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We don't. For now, all we can do is withdraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, just do whatever I can to hold the thing off! Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Gonna be easier said than done to shake it, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Even still, we won't fall here! Think of all we've been through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, for sure. I won't allow anyone's tears to fall this day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let's go!</td>
