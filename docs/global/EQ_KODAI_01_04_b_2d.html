<td>D-did you...? With one hit?! Wh-wh-who are you?!</td>

<td>Me? I'm Lil! What's your name?</td>

<td>That's too long! Can I just call you Sia? Is that okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh? Uh... Sure, I guess. You seem a little...slow.</td>

<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Um, yeah, I was born only a little while ago.</td>

<td>Schmeier told me dragon bodies develop slowly, so I've gotta grow up before I can move any faster.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No, I didn't mean you move slowly, I meant... You know what? Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So, what are you, anyway? That was an incredible amount of magil you brandished there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Magil? You know magil?! You know about the dragons' blood?!</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>S-so you're actually...a dragon, then?</td>

<td>Yep! I am! I'm Schmeier's masterpiece!</td>

<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I feel like we're having two very different conversations right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Anyway, if you're one of the dragons, you must know Claybelle, right? I presume that's why you've come here.</td>
</tr>

<td>Crei...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>N-never mind. I'll just take you to her. Come with me, please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Thanks, Sia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I sense Lil's presence. She must have used her power here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Against Ophioneus' pursuers, I suppose. Or perhaps...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There seems to be a town ahead. Hopefully that's where I'll find her. I'll feel a lot better once we've been reunited.</td>
