<td>Well, I listened to the beachgoers' stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Apparently until just a few days ago, the humanoid machines weren't attacking people. They just picked up trees and rocks from all over the beach.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>I wonder why. Were they ordered to pick up trash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>Then when they ran out of things to pick up, they suddenly became more interested in the people on the beach, stealing the things they dropped.</td>

<td>...</td>

<td>Also, there's something about how the Alkaroids moved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>So they really are Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>I heard that Beckram Alkaroids aren't currently being produced, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>It's unclear why they are here, not only in operation but also stealing people's things for some reason... This isn't just random behavior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>There's probably someone giving them commands. And if that's the case, it'd probably be faster to ask that person directly what they...</td>

<td>What? An octopus?</td>

<td>Huh. They aren't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/noah.png" alt="Noah" height="128"><br>Noah</td>
<td>Oh! There might be someone deep in that cave that's causing them to come outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/suzu.png" alt="Suzuka" height="128"><br>Suzuka</td>
<td>That's a possibility. Let's go check it out.</td>

<td>Whoa! Is that a boat? It's pretty beat up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/albe.png" alt="Albea" height="128"><br>Albea</td>
<td>It's been anchored here...which means there's probably someone inside.</td>

</tr>
