<td>Hyah!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Oh! You can still move...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Albea, watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh no! My comb!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Grrahck!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>S-stop! Don't! Give it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>W-wait! Albea! It's pointless to chase after them! We can't even see them anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Let go of me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I have to follow them! I need to get it back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That comb is... It's—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Albea, calm down! How are you going to follow them when you can't even see them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Rather than blindly chasing after them, let's take a moment to assess the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Any way you slice it, doing something about those machines is our job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I agree. There's something about the way those machines moved that concerns me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Albea...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm sorry for losing my composure. I wasn't even the only one that had something stolen from them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Th-that's totally fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(For the always coolheaded Albea to lose her composure... It must've been something really important to her.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>By the way, Suzuka, what was the thing you were concerned about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, I listened to the beachgoers' stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Apparently until just a few days ago, the humanoid machines weren't attacking people. They just picked up trees and rocks from all over the beach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Now that you mention it, I only saw them digging through the trash, like they were looking for something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I wonder why. Were they ordered to pick up trash?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Then when they ran out of things to pick up, they suddenly became more interested in the people on the beach, stealing the things they dropped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Also, there's something about how the Alkaroids moved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So they really are Alkaroids.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I heard that Beckram Alkaroids aren't currently being produced, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It's unclear why they are here, not only in operation but also stealing people's things for some reason... This isn't just random behavior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There's probably someone giving them commands. And if that's the case, it'd probably be faster to ask that person directly what they...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What? An octopus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Agh! They're swarming...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>And attacking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh. They aren't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>They're more docile than we heard. It looks like they're focused on something else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh! There might be someone deep in that cave that's causing them to come outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That's a possibility. Let's go check it out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Whoa! Is that a boat? It's pretty beat up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's been anchored here...which means there's probably someone inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>L-look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's...an octopus! It's been nothing but octopuses lately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Bertha said that ever since that giant octopus was wiped out, they've taken to living deep in caves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Deep in the caves? But these are in the mouth of the cave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hm? What are they doing? It looks like they're bringing something out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Wait, Mira. If you stick out that far—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah! They noticed us! And they're coming this way!</td>
</tr>
