<td>This is where it ends for you, Venus Dota Lustburg.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>All your soldiers have scattered. Choose once and for all now. Surrender or die here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Di-Dias, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you saying? I still have a solider right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? Right now, I am a single witch. I am a single warrior who is fighting for my country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You gotta be kidding, right?! We're already exhausted over here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And now we're supposed to take on the strongest witch in this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hmm. So, you're still going to put up a fight. In that case, goodbye, queen of ice. If you're not going to melt, then I'll shatter you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wait! Please! You can't kill her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What are you saying? Haven't you realized through all this fighting?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ideals don't matter once you're engaged in battle with your enemy. The time for seeking a dialogue is not on the battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's true that each time I was nearly killed. I didn't want to die so I fought desperately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Because I was fighting, there was not time to talk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Still, Salomo spoke while fighting. He told us about his sad past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>He told me that the Bugmail people use anger as their motivation to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>They told me that the court mages use fear to motivate themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I think their rage and anger comes bumbling to the surface to mask their sadness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>They don't want to become sad by dying, becoming an insect, or separating from the one they love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Because they want to run away from that sadness, the men and women fight to be separate from each other. They've forgotten that Asmodeus is the true cause of their sorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>When you fight, you cannot talk. When you die, you cannot talk. That's why I don't want to kill or be killed. If I hurt someone, I would at least like to heal them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I want to get rid of the curse that is born from sadness. That is what I want Your Majesty to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My words alone will be drowned out immediately. That's why, Your Highness, I would like the person who stands above the other witches to understand first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You have only lived for 10 or so years. I have protected this country for over 200 years. Isn't it clear who is in the right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Please, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If you believe that you are right, then show me after 200 years!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If I exceed you now, will you listen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What...?</td>
