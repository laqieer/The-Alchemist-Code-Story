<td>Nngh! They just keep coming!</td>

<td>I suppose Nimul and Waginau have already gone on ahead.</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't just stand there with your sword out! My Engineer Soldiers will catch up to them in no time, so hurry up andâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You go on ahead.</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh? What are you saying?!</td>

<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>They're going to need these soldiers if they are to reach the depths of this corrupted creature. You must go. Now, quickly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What about you?!</td>

<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There are more enemies than I expected. If they were to damage the ship before we reached the dragon's core... Well, we would be in trouble, to say the least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>So I will remain here, and deal with these beasts.</td>

<td>You know, since coming to this region, I have forged a great many weapons, but have had little opportunity to test them.</td>

<td>Go. You are needed elsewhere.</td>

<td>As I wander, the scenery might change, but my deeds will not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I forge steel, sharpen blades, and aim for the zenith of my art. There is simply nothing else I desire.</td>

<td>Fool. You are as sinful as they come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Child of greed... You are unworthy of consideration. This spot will mark your grave!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your blade is a trial I must overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Slave to the Almighty... I accept your challenge!</td>
