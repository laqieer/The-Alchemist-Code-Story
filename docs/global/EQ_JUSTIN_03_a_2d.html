<td>We managed to stop it somehow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Still, The Guard Droid shows no evidence of having been illegally tampered with...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Perhaps it hadn't gone rogue, but had been ordered to cause destruction?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wh-what is it now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oh...the sound is coming from the toy shop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Agh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Are you okay, Richie?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's just a scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>More importantly...I'm sorry, but the toy you entrusted to me was taken away by some strange-looking men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>That toy?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Such lawless acts cannot be tolerated! Still...do you know where they fled to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I didn't see them myself...but I threw some florescent paint at their faces. It really stands out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Understood! Leave the rest to me! Justin over and out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I will not let crime be tolerated in this city! That is my justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>The paint leads up to this roof.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That being said, I'll need warrants to search inside houses. But if I take too much time, there's the danger of evidence being destroyed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, in that case, there's only one thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Strie?! Were you following me? Hey, what're you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, if you go like this and this...there. It's unlocked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait, hold on. Wait! You're entering illegally!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Oh? Do you plan to sit there sucking on your thumb while the criminals escape?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is an emergency. Let's make a few exceptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, you're right. It's certainly an emergency, but...wait...I still haven't made up my mind yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I actually did it...as a detective...I broke the law...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Now isn't the time to be mopping about it! Hold on...I can hear voices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>...Hm!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>This is the object that the thief Chat Noir protected vehemently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's just a toy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What a fool's errand! After hearing that it belonged to Chat Noir, I expected some kind of rare gem that's embroiled in history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, that's unfortunate, but a request is a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know! Argh! I even had to obtain a Guard Droid from Alvarez...and this is the result!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see. So that Guard Droid was part of the plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Who's there?! Show yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>It appears we've been found.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I had no intention of hiding from the start. In order to protect the peace in this city...now is the time that my justice will be put to the test!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What?! A Peacekeeper?! What is one of the mayor's dogs doing in my mansion?! Get rid of him! I'll pay you for it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>As you can see, that's the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hilarious! Do you think that I, Justin, will quake in the face of evil?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now you'd better come quietly, villain!</td>
