<td>Oh! Tina! How was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Argh! So annoying!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I guess I don't need an answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>As soon as they find out I'm from the Voda faction, they won't even speak to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is that really the same Fuu tribe as the one Mocca belongs to?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I also didn't have much luck. People would listen a bit more when I told them I'm from Lustburg, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No one mentioned any sighting of Gluttony soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I couldn't get anything either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mocca...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I was able to get information from a lot of people, but none mentioned any sightings of Gluttony troops... I've got nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>But...that merchant didn't seem to be lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes. I wonder if it was just a coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It's still too early to make that assumption. Let's talk to some more people...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Please! Someone! Help me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That person is crying! I wonder what's wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Please! Help my son! He left the village a while ago and still hasn't returned!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Outside the village? Aren't the Jam out there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's what I heard! I tried to ask my fellow merchants to help, but they were also frightened of the Jam!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>On the road, I asked someone from the Fuu faction, but they wouldn't listen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's unbelievable! A child's life is in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Please! Help him! My son should be in the forest behind the village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Abominations...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The Jam...Where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm talking about the people who gathered in this marketplace. I can feel the evil corruption that comes from their hearts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Faction?! Tribe?! There is nothing more important than protecting the life of a child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ti-Tina...! Everyone is watching?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Not just animals, but trees and flowers...and small organisms as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Those who live in this world devote everything to leaving descendants behind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Protecting our children and their future is an instinct given to all born into this world...even if the child isn't our own!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...! Tina...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You who have forgotten the principals of being alive...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You are inferior beings whose very existence is vile! I despise even having to address you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You idiots!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Tina...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We're wasting time here...let's go, Tina.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Ack...aah!</td>
