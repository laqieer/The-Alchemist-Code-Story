<td>Land ho! This should be where the cave with the treasure is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>We're finally here... I can feel my heart pounding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, before we head into the cave, we should alert Albea and the others as to our arrival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Um... How exactly do we do that again? Liu Shen!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Never fear. Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This seems like it might take some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>How about we go ahead, survey the surrounding area and assess the situation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>B-By yourself? That could be dangerous...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Thank you for your concern, but I'll be fine. I'm more than capable of defending myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You should do as Shenmei has instructed. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I wonder if this is okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Hmm... As I expected, the lay of the land here isn't that different from the desert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But the humidity inside the cave is much higher than outside. There's likely some water pooled, making it muggy and sticky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Is that...? A demon?! No, it's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>An octopus? It's my first time seeing one, but there is something unsettling about how it moves about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What the...? Is it coming this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It doesn't seem like a dangerous foe. But if it gets its tentacles on me... Hah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Pfew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nefertiti!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sorry you had to investigate on your own! Everything okay? Any octopuses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>No problem at all. I was just curious, so I went ahead to take a look around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The cave seems precariously unstable. We should be safe to search, but I think we should conclude our business as quickly as we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't see any new footprints or signs of a struggle, so I don't think the other pirates have come yet. Still, there are some unusual traces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh? What did you find?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's only a small amount, but there's soil from a different location mixed in here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's different from the earth and sand outside the cave. It may've been stuck to something and fallen off inside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That's all I know. I was planning to investigate a little more and eliminate potential dangers next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>A-Astounding! You were able to discern so much in such a short time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>It's nothing. I just like to do what I can to be ready. I like to be prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I suppose, I grew up in an environment where that was very important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I see. Impressive... It's certainly not something I could do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Looking ahead and plotting the first move... You like to play it by ear too much for that, Xiao-Xiao.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Gah! I know it's true, but it hurts to hear it. I feel like some fool, leaving everyone else to take care of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(But what if I were able to be more like Nefertiti?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(I wonder if things would go better that way.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Shenmei? What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh? Oh! No, it's nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Let's get this show on the road! Time to solve the mystery of the map!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>W-Wait up, Shenmei!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She certainly has some pep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary in the cave so far... But there's a fork in the road?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Which way do we go? Okay, time to rely on my gut!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't do that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmm... How about we go to the left?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?! How did you decide so fast?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I feel a breeze coming from up ahead. If we go that way, the cave should open up. That seems like the best path to search first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That makes sense... That being the case, I think we should go left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hmm... I'd thought that I was the one with all the treasure-hunting experience...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Isn't relying on your intuition how you've become lost in caves before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh, is that true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I recall the cave seeming shaky, as well. And then the exit was blocked by a cave in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We knew the rocks could be unstable, so we tried to move quickly. However, our captain cheerfully sauntered into the unknown...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Oh... Is that what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>B-But! We found another way safely out! It was fine! I suppose I should try to take in my surroundings, though...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, Nefertiti! As we go further in, could I ask you to survey the geology of the cave?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'd like you to find potential alternate ways out, and see what we can do to avoid a cave in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I don't mind at all. I was already thinking about that myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Thank you! You said things seemed precarious, so we should be prepared for any eventuality!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hmm... The ground is a little weak here, and the humidity is much higher than at the entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>And this wall is really dangerous... A little knock could have a massive effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Oh my!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Hey! Your fight is with us! Don't worry Nefertiti, we'll take care of the octopuses! Let's have at it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Well... That's fine teamwork. I'll take you at your word and focus on my survey of the cave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>This is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Ah! There are octopuses here, too?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Did they get separated from their group? I wish I could simply do my investigating, but... I suppose I must deal with this first.</td>
</tr>
