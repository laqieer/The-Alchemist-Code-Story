<td>I told you. I am a Captain of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This sword bears the weight of peace on this continent. Such a sword could never lose against one who only thinks of their own personal gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Personal gain...? Who do you think you are?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I carry the lamentations of an entire country of people who lost their home and future to this cruel world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There will never be anything that anyone can do to justify what happened to my people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I could never lose to someone like you who wields authority in such a corrupted reality! Beast Art Evocations! Book Two, Leo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The ink came to life?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Go forth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nrk! Huzzah!!!</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>No...</td>

<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing? Why haven't you killed me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My sword's purpose is to defeat evil, not to slay the defenseless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>E-evil...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I sense no evil in your heart. You will not die by my blade today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Logi... I heard that he is leading some kind of militia now, but...I couldn't even guess where he might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>However, I do have some information about the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What...? Wh-what is your purpose in telling me this? Pity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>No... I just think that it is in my own interest to tell you this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Your...own interest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I am currently chasing after Wratharis' Sacred Stone, Satna. I just thought...perhaps your quest could help both of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>It is said that the Sacred Stones of this world will call out to one another when the balance of power has been disrupted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Balance of power...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>It doesn't matter. Forget it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Then...where is the Mikaboshi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>The Corpse only managed to grasp what can be taken as mere rumor... We don't have any proof to verify what we've heard yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Just tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Most people think it has just disappeared, but...the truth is, the Lord Commander of the time neutralized its power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Neutralized...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The Holy Guard has committed all of its resources to searching for it, but they haven't been able to find it yet. In other words...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>To find it, then... I have to go to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes... You'll have to go to the country that has swallowed Wadatsumi whole: Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The sacred stone of my country is...in Greed Dike? The origin of all of this horror?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Why...? Why must this life be so full of cruel discoveries?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Aghhhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Aghhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What theâ€”?! Are you okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Nngh... Wah... Wahhhhhhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Y-you need to calm down! Pull yourself together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Have you calmed down? What...happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It's... It doesn't matter. These are not...my tears! What are you...? Wh-whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Ahem, it's better if you don't move too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Wh-what are you doing?! Why...are you...holding me in your arms?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Y-you're not going to kiss me or anything, right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You just...seemed like you needed comfort. It can't be easy to deal with whatever it is you're struggling with, if you're being pushed to break down and cry like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>C-comfort...? Y-your face is...really close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This is normal when you hug someone, like it or not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Really...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Look, I didn't expect to be thanked or anything, but this criticism is a little much. Get your mind out of the gutter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>My mind is not in the gutter!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Just...calm down for a moment, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So, listen. This information of mine is all I have for you. If you mean to go to Greed Dike, you should hurry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Didn't I tell you? I got this information from the Corpse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>You mean...the Corpse is already looking for it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Could be. Now, I have other places to be. I have answered your questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>W-wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Are you really going to let me go after telling me all that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I told you. I don't sense any evil in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm sure that fate will bring us together again. Goodbye for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>A sword for defeating evil, not slaying the defenseless... Just like a samurai. So that was Dias Crowley...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Have you calmed down? What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wh-what is this? What is this trembling?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>I'm not even Lisbeth! I can't believe I'm getting so worked up over this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You, too, have a past that cannot be forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>What?! What was with that response?! I totally got pulled in by his...by him!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>No way. No way, that's not me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I need to focus. I have much more important things to concern myself with. I don't have time for this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>So why is my heart pounding like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Logi Crowley... I have to find you. I'll definitely find you. To do that, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I must push aside all of my emotions. I must not let these ancient sorrows overwhelm me yet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Could the Mikaboshi have fallen into the hands of the Sun King?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>It's time to face destiny... I must head to Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
