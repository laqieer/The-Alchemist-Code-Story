<td>We finally made it through the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>We're almost at the rendezvous point, but we don't know what might happen. Don't let your guard down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We're going to meet up with the other Paladins outside of the 4th Regiment, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Yes. There we'll meet up once with some of the Regiments and, after that, we'll attempt to catch up with Captain Zain who is ahead with all the Regiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>To be honest, it'll be all the Paladins excluding the 4th and 6th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The 6th Regiment? Is that Captain Othima's Regiment? Why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>When the call was made, only he wasn't around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I wonder what he's doing during an emergency like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The newly appointed Captain Seida of the 3rd Regiment went looking for them, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? I saw Captain Othima before we left, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh, where?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>He said there was something he was looking for. I told him about the gathering, but he said whatever he had to do was more important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That idiot! Fine, let's forget about Othima and the others for now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What we need to focus on right now is rendezvousing with Lord Zain as soon as possible...understood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ye-yes! Kagura is okay, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>But she's with Lord Zain. I doubt anything will happen to her, but you never know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Captain Yauras...I know it may not be possible, but I have a request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I know that you can't discuss these things due to your position, but, in order to not have any regrets, I would like to understand the place we are headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What exactly is happening in Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Do you promise not to tell anyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Of course, Don.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Fine. Actually, the other day, a gigantic Spirit Stone was found in the Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A Ghost Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. It's called the Mikaboshi. That Stone hides a tremendous power that could destroy this entire world.</td>
