<td>Did you get to eat your fill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes, th-thank you so much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Oh no, thank you for being alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, if it wasn't for Amane here, I may not have been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, but if I hadn't met you, Azami, I wouldn't even be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We wouldn't have been able to do it alone, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We weren't alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I thought I lost everything. Duty, Mother and Father...but I was wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I had Amane still.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Your duty? Are you perhaps one of the Kagomurasaki?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I am. Everyone else was...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Thank you for saving me! And Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Wait, where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm going to hunt demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will avenge my parents and my clan. That's my responsibility as the sole survivor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Do you have a minute? Here, let me hold you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Wha—?! What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm proud of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You've done so well, but for this one moment, just a little while, you don't have to do anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's okay. You can cry if you want to. It's the human thing to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Cry, cry, then cry some more. It's not too late to hold your head up high after exhausting your tears. You don't have to worry about a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>But I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Where are you planning on going without me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You said we'd be sisters, at least until we die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Neither of us are dead yet, Azami.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Waaah! Waaaaaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>That's right, Azami. You can let it out. You're not alone anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! Waaaaaahh! Aaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you not coming with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I have no reason to. I mean, I want to, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You're going through a hard time. Isn't that good enough of a reason to stick together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're her little sister, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're not planning on making me feel lonely again, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I know I'm not your mother, but I can still embrace you. See?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>You're freezing. You did so well to endure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...Uggh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>This calls for some hot soup! Let's go get ourselves warmed up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Mm... Uuuhhhghhh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Hey, don't start crying now. I just stopped and you're gonna get me to...to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Uwaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Meal's ready! Now, put your hands together and say: thank you for the meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Thank you for the meal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's so good! I love your cooking, Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That makes me happy to hear. Amane, don't rush or you'll end up choking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'll be fine! I wanna get big and strong as soon as possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Oh? Why is that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I wanna get big and vanquish demons! So I gotta eat a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Eating too much isn't gonna help, especially if you swallow your food whole. Can't you eat properly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It won't be long before you can't boss me around anymore! I'm gonna eat a lot, get big and strong, and surpass you in every way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I'd like to see you try!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Oh, just you wait! Celis! I want seconds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm sorry. It's just that you two seem to be doing so much better now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Neither of you are the same kids I met on that rainy day back then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's all thanks to you, Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Hehe, I'm glad you think so. I just wish days like these could last forever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Oh, how I wish...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Haven't thought of that day in a while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>And that selfish little request still holds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Well, we are alive. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>But?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Well, there's something I've been wondering about since that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Am I not more of a big sister than you, Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You can't be serious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>I'm just saying, the way I was that day was a bit more big-sister-ish!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I'm clearly older than you, which makes me the older sister!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I'm not talking about age here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I'm stronger than you, and besides—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>H-hey! What are you staring at me like that for?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You haven't grown an inch! I told you eating too much wouldn't help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hey, my body is not the only measure of my development! I'll soon be—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Well, as of now, I'm more mature than you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Why, you—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What, do you wanna—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Pffft!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nckk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahahahaha!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Wow, I can't believe how long it's been. Long enough for us to gain a new every day for ourselves, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>And now it's finally time for us to make good on the oath we made back then. We will eradicate the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I will fight to avenge my clan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>What about you, Amane?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>"Demons must be eradicated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I will take out demons as I see fit. That's it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>That's a very ambiguous response. You know, I've been wondering... How was it that you were able to stand against the Discarnate Power that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>What's the matter, Azami?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Somebody's watching us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Who's there?! Show yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Uh oh, you found me out. I thought I was being sneaky enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Celis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I didn't see Azami at the banquet, so I figured she'd be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Isn't this the sweetest display of sisterly love! You're gonna make me cry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Wh-whatever! I'm going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Oh, don't be like that. It's been a while since we three got together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The banquet's over, so we should get back to thinking about the mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I'm not made of free time, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Aww, are you feeling sensitive? Is it hard being a baby?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Celis! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The look in her eyes just never changes... But there are other things that have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Like what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>The eyes house your soul, and your soul resides in the humdrum of the everyday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Those who can't appreciate the value of their everyday life can't protect their everyday life. Still, if the surrounding environment were to change...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Your soul and daily life would change along with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Now that all three of us are members of the Blade Fox, we can't expect things to be exactly like before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>I understand that, but...I still want to spend my every day with you two, no matter what it looks like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>It is for that reason I wield a blade. I want peace for Wadatsumi. I want people to be able to live happily and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>I want them to feel safe, to be able to surround a table for dinner with their whole family. Though I'm not exactly sure how I can accomplish this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I want the same thing as you do, Amane. I hope we can find the means to accomplish them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>All right then, guess I should focus on the mission like Azami said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Tanosuke will give you the details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Yo, how's it going? Try to listen to what I have to say this time, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>This is going to be your first mission as a member of the Blade Fox, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>A mission... My first mission!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Hey, hey... You trembling already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>It's just adrenaline, that's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>You're not going to be alone on this mission, so you can loosen up a bit. Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I didn't expect to see demons here. I've got a bad feeling about this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Anyway, let's take care of them first. Now, stay calm and collected when dealing with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Leave them to me!</td>
</tr>
