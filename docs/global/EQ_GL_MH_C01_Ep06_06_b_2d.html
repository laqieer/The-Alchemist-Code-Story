<td>Huff... Huff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Congratulations, this battle is yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But I've done what is required of me... You're too late to stop Zheng Yi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>And may I ask what makes you so certain of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Teach!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hehe, I knew you would be fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Aww, you're a sweet boy Soren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I was starting to worry about you Teach! That took you longer than I thought it would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Those young boys weren't the problem. The monsters suddenly went mad and started attacking them as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I simply couldn't stand idle and watch them get devoured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh no, not at all! They remind me so much of the both of you when you were both still children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Yes Teach... You can reminisce about the past AFTER we get out of here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Let's get to the point. I'm guessing you've figured out what Zheng Yi has kept hidden in here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Not quite... But if all the information I've gathered thus far is correct, the True Core of Atropos...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...is in the deepest part of these ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aha! Well done!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hee hee...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Woah... What's gotten into you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You're all ever so optimistic about the future, it makes me wonder what is it that drives you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Faith. It is faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Faith?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That is right Shion. It is our faith in one another that drives us forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>In times of adversity, no matter the burdens we bear, we know that we are never alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Alone, we are weak. Together, we are so much more than the sum of our parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>A bond forged in the face of a common adversity is hard and unyielding; stubborn...but brittle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But when tempered through empathy, that bond becomes so much more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You would do anything for your sister. That is clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>But when push comes to shove, Shion, is there someone else who would do the same for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Come on children! We'd best be on our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I can only assume that this mini-me is just a sample of it's true potential...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...and a terrifying weapon indeed in the hands of one whose heart and mind is close to all but the very vision before him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(Minerva... If only we had someone like you...)</td>
