<td>If the Beckrams don't know where she is either, then there's only one person who knows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ethan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yep. Unfortunately, we're back to the beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Seems we've no other choice but to rescue him from the Beckrams' mansion and ask him directly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's...impossible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yo-you're still alive! Aye, you're a stubborn one, aren't you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Hold on, Alkemono. What do you mean that's impossible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...Heh...heheh... To-tomorrow...that man...is...going to be executed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ethan...?! Executed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...I-it's unfortunate... That I can't...see...the disappointment on your faces...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Jeez. What an unladylike parting speech.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>N-no! Why have things ended up like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...No need to mourn yet. In fact, you should be happy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Look at it the other way around. If he's going to be executed tomorrow, it means that he'll definitely be alive until then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If he's still alive, it means there's a chance we can rescue him...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We can perceive the situation as hopeless or hopeful. Tweaking our perspective can sometimes open new possibilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...I think we've still got plenty of opportunities here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes! We must do whatever we can to rescue him. Edgar, please lend me your strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's like seeing a wilted flower suddenly blossom afresh again. You can count on me, mademoiselle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Now that's decided, let's hurry. Alkemono, show us the route to where the execution will take place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't know, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For starters, here in Slothstein, we don't have something as ominous as an execution site.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I'm sure it's somewhere in one of the Beckrams' facilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Where are those facilities?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>There are as many as the stars, aye. There's no easy way of determining their location.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hey, you! Wake up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Its functions have been terminated. It's too late, aye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Tsk...! We don't have any time. This is not good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wow! I never knew the Beckrams had so many facilities!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I guess we can't afford to go knocking on all of them. We need to somehow obtain information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But...I doubt the Alkaloids created by the Beckrams will easily give up any.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I'm back. They only had a beef pastrami sandwich.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's great. Here you go, little lady.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...What's the matter? This looks pretty good too, doesn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. It's just that when I think about how, while we spend time here, Ethan's life is in danger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All the more reason. Even if we lament over our present situation, it won't change anything. When it becomes necessary...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We need to make sure we're in a state to move when it becomes necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Right. Food is part of what is required to pave a path ahead. Thank you, Ronnie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Heh. You're starting to catch on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Destiny is not something you wait for, but something you reach out and grasp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're the one who enabled me to think this way, Edgar. We need to do what we can for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Exactly. In any case, we've no other options now. Let's try and ask them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Guard Droid approaching! Guard Droid approaching!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Whoa! That was fast! Careful...here they come!</td>
