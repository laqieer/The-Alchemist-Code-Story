<td>We're done here. What's the situation over there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Groaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The nape's exposed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Eat this! Huzzzaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We got it! The core!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Judith, I leave it to you! Smash it to smithereens!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Got it! It's over for you!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes! I'm the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Stand back! The Giant Taurus is about to fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Whew... Ah! It's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ah... It looks like we were right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then...this means that you all can return to your world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Look! It's getting unstable! You have to hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Noble knights of another world... Thank you for all that you have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes. I owe you my thanks for saving Saga from the Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It should be the case that once you all have returned to your world, the rest of the Titans should follow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Is that because of the powers of purification you were talking about before? Then we'll lose all of our memories of our time here, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Yes, I believe you are right. Once things are set into motion, the purification will begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I...see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ugh. This whole little adventure has been such a waste of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Really? I thought it was pretty interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Um... Can you take Reiner back to your world with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Tch. Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We need to handle your world's problems while in your world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>As I said before, we'll deal with him ourselves after we get home, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Right...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Send us back, Judith. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Got it! It was...great meeting all of you. Take care!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So we're finally heading back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I hope those we left behind are all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Reiner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Don't cry. It's not like you at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>R-Reiner, you...! I'm not crying! Shut up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I-I'm definitely not...crying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Judith, the Mecha Weapon represents my hope for world peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(This voice is... Is it... Dad?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You'll have to carve your own path forward too; one that you believe in with all your heart. Whatever it is, wherever it goes, I'll always support you. You truly are—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You truly are going to find someone that you really want to protect, one day, and when that happens...you'll be able to use the Mecha Weapon's true power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>My wish is that the Mecha Weapon can be your ally, through thick and thin. I...had hoped that I would be able to protect this world in which you live...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't forget. The will to protect another...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It will never fade. As long as you remember that, I will always be with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Dad! Thank you! I... I miss you, dad!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Hey! Pull yourself together, Judith!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thanks, dad... Thank you for sticking with me all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh...? I'm...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Oh... Wait! Is everyone—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They're fine. They all made it back to their own worlds safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I didn't think you were such a worrywart! They're fine. I mean, their memories are all gone, but they're fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yes, indeed. Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Basheeny... I'd like to be the one who keeps custody of the Mecha Weapon and makes sure it is never used for evil. Would that...be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>This is the Anti-Giant Taurus Mecha Weapon. It should be used to protect those who are still being terrorized by other Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Also, my dad invented this for me. It's one of the last things I have from him... I just...can't let it go yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I...have seen for myself that you do not make use of Philosopher's Stones, that your goal is simply to use your power to try to protect the peace of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>In light of that, I can say that I do not believe it would be right to take the Mecha Weapon from you. It is rightfully yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>After all, you need it to protect the world, do you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Yes! Exactly! Me and the Mecha Weapon will protect this world, the same way my father did! Just you watch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Thank you, Judith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Just don't think that absolves you of what you did. I don't think I'm ready to forgive you lot yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>That said... Basheeny? I want to know... Why do you want to protect this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Mmm... Well... Someone important entrusted this world to me. I can't just let her down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>She's gone on a long journey, but...I expect that she'll be coming back one day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Protecting the peace of this world in her stead until that happens...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I think that's the very least that I could do for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I see. Then...I've decided. I promise you that, on the day that this world ever achieves true peace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That is the day I will forgive you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>All right. I look forward to that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>When that day comes, perhaps you would do me the honor of granting me this favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Could you work with us and continue to find new ways to use the Mecha Weapon to protect this world and all its people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>So that...if there ever comes a day when an enemy even greater than the Giant Taurus appears...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Of course! I wouldn't have it any other way! I'm sure my dad would have agreed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Thank you, Judith. It is a relief knowing that you'll be working with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>It's not over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>After that, our paths split, and I have been wandering this continent alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>The peaceful world that my father wanted...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>At the moment, there are still too many people who are under threat by the Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>On top of that, I am trying to figure out how to improve the Mecha Weapon in preparation for some possible greater threat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>What is the best way to improve or use it to support this world or protect its people?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Would it be more effective used in combination with another weapon? Or is there a better use for it that I haven't thought of yet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I still haven't found an answer to my questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>However, when I think I'm at the end of my rope, or something I've tried doesn't work out, I can take comfort in my memories of a certain group of people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I hope they're doing well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I'm sure I'll meet them again one day. I can't just give up before that happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>So...there's nothing for it but to invent something new and amazing to fit the bill! I'll do it with an electrifying swoosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>After all, I am the mechanic extraordinaire, Judith!</td>
