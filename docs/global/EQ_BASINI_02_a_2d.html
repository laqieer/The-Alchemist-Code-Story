<td>You can only be here for one reason. You've come to erase me, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Corpse's duty is twofold: to deliver a warning to those who threaten to stumble on the truth, and to eliminate those who do come too close.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why would you come here, knowing the price you would pay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In order to preserve the order of this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That is not your burden to bear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The order of this world is ours to protect. The Lord Commander must serve as a guiding light...but in your weakness, the light you cast is frail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Poor, pallid Lord Commander, wavering in the darkness... I will gauge the threat you pose by my own hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>How can you stay with Corpse, knowing Waginau's true goals?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>As long as he does not threaten the world's order, he is no concern of mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Well, if you think I'll go quietly despite that, you've got another thing coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nngh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Your doubts and your hastiness still dull your blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>You have failed to heed my lessons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why do you still follow Waginau, with this kind of strength at your command?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>When new and disruptive powers arise, those who would use them for evil ends soon follow. Corpse secures such powers and keeps them from the masses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Powers such as the Mecha Weapon that stood against the Giant Taurus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Then...it was you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You were the one who killed Judith's father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I did not wield the blade myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But you should understand better than anyone the nature of our work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Whenever a destabilizing power emerges, Corpse intervenes to secure or eliminate it before it can plunge the world into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thus is order preserved, and we will stop at nothing to maintain it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All the more so when some unwitting fool stumbles across the secret of the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I cannot deny that great power can bring catastrophe if it falls into the wrong hands...but not everyone is so callous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There are those who seek power for the good of all. To protect the world, not to plunge it into chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I have known such people myself. I once walked by their side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>My resolve is their legacy...and so I cannot allow anyone to stand in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Resolve serves no end but to undermine this world's order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Once upon a time, I was just another Corpse recruit under your command. But now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Now I am the Lord Commander, the living embodiment of absolute justice!</td>
