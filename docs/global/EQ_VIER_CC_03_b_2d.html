<td>There is no need to lament. I have no regrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I simply feel empty... From the dark cove, I will yearn over the echoes of a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>In the darkness from behind my closed eyelids, the dying sparks of days we clashed against each other are the only light I can see anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Thank you. It was fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(The war between high elves and dark elves... An eternal despair... A battlefield with no salvation.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(The only light for me was the wind that connected you and I.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Still, such surreal moments are gone now.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>(You will have your magic sealed by your kin, and be sold as a slave. A product.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>(The despair other races forced us to endure is now one we deliver to others.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"Throw off the chains."</td>

<td>"For whom does the King of Darkness rise? For whom does the King of Darkness fight?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Only then will you enjoy true sleep...</td>

<tr>

<td>My, my. I really must be wanting as a tutor if I'm falling asleep during my own class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>You... You must have been having a sad dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I...was not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You can't fool me, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You need not concern yourself with my dreams, Your Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I am always curious as to why you seem so sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>When you talk about dark elves or illusions... They ought to be encouraging accounts of how high elves developed clever ways to protect themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But I believe I understand now. I saw your dream, Ephylinde. And you saw mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>So then the nightmare from before... You and I were sharing dreams?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Your dream just now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>But why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I believe that as one of royal lineage, I was born with the proficiency in such powers... Foresight, divination...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>And these ears, acting like antennae, allowed our dreams and feelings to be shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is the first time this has ever happened. Could it be because I'm with you, who continued to improve upon your high elven powers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ephylinde? If you are sad, I want you to know that I am as well... Especially at night.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Would you...perhaps join me in bed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Wha—?! That is not permitted!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>For a commoner such as myself to lay in bed with Your Highness... I-I cannot! It is improper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Haven't you learned? You reacting like that only makes it more entertaining for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>N-no! That is not permitted! P-p-points will be deducted if you—! Aaah! Don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There is no one here but us, Ephylinde. No one to chastise, criticize, or condemn us for being...naughty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Wh-wha—?! N-no, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I-I'm a little sweaty right now, and so... Your Highness, you'd better stay back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh, I do not mind a little sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>C-could you possibly...not come so close, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hehehe, you're so cute right now, Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I-I-I... There will be no fooling around in class!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Speaking of improper, I had a dream where you were dressed quite...provocatively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>P-prova... Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You were offering bread to some people in this dream. While dressed provocatively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I-I saw that dream as well...but... Wh-why was I...?! Could that have been me in...the future?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Princess Ainanna...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Although it may be difficult for me to hear... I would like for you to tell me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>About the dream you just had... About the dreams you will be having...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Please do not apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>The hatred I mentioned in my dream... The one against our people... That hatred would include Your Highness as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I will not judge Your Highness or the high elves of this village for their prejudice against the dark elves and other races.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>It was not peace that came after war. It is more difficult to alter one's beliefs than it is to defeat warriors in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>But I was simply...too tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>In the time I have left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>The village I saw in the dream was a frozen place, where not even a single breath could be drawn. It was perhaps a glimpse of what this village will become in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>We can no longer simply coast along the flow of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>The things you've learned outside... The things I will come to learn... The things once believed to be wrong...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Please teach me everything. I do not care how long it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>If I manage to make this village somewhere people of all races can flourish in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Will you be able to find comfort here then, Ephylinde? Will that help you sleep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Will that not contradict your dream, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Seeing your dream changed my mind. Eliminating everyone and calling it clean... That is simply wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I would much prefer a country where all people can come together and feel safe sleeping at night. That would be ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That would be paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Do you not want that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>I can't say that I don't.</td>
</tr>
