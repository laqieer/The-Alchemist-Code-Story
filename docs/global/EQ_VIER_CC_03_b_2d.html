</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>And these ears, acting like antennae, allowed our dreams and feelings to be shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>This is the first time this has ever happened. Could it be because I'm with you, who continued to improve upon your high elven powers?</td>

<td>...!</td>

<tr>

<td>Ephylinde? If you are sad, I want you to know that I am as well... Especially at night.</td>

<td>Why not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>For a commoner such as myself to lay in bed with Your Highness... I-I cannot! It is improper!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Haven't you learned? You reacting like that only makes it more entertaining for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>N-no! That is not permitted! P-p-points will be deducted if you—! Aaah! Don't!</td>

<td>Wh-wha—?! N-no, I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>I-I'm a little sweaty right now, and so... Your Highness, you'd better stay back...</td>

<td>Speaking of improper, I had a dream where you were dressed quite...provocatively.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>P-prova... Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You were offering bread to some people in this dream. While dressed provocatively.</td>

<tr>

<td>Please do not apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>The hatred I mentioned in my dream... The one against our people... That hatred would include Your Highness as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>I will not judge Your Highness or the high elves of this village for their prejudice against the dark elves and other races.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>It was not peace that came after war. It is more difficult to alter one's beliefs than it is to defeat warriors in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>But I was simply...too tired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>In the time I have left...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>The village I saw in the dream was a frozen place, where not even a single breath could be drawn. It was perhaps a glimpse of what this village will become in the near future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>We can no longer simply coast along the flow of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>The things you've learned outside... The things I will come to learn... The things once believed to be wrong...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Please teach me everything. I do not care how long it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Your Highness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>If I manage to make this village somewhere people of all races can flourish in...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Will you be able to find comfort here then, Ephylinde? Will that help you sleep?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>Will that not contradict your dream, Your Highness?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Seeing your dream changed my mind. Eliminating everyone and calling it clean... That is simply wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>I would much prefer a country where all people can come together and feel safe sleeping at night. That would be ideal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ephylinde</td>
<td>That would be paradise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ainanna</td>
<td>Do you not want that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I can't say that I don't.</td>
