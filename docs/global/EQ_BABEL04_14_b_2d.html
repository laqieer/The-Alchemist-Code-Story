<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I hated them...</td>

<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I loathed them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Belladonna... The Resurrection lily... The casket flower... The Hurricane lily...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Red spider lilies are bad omens that remind you of death...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Beautiful as they may be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>At some point, I realized that we resemble those flowers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ironic, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>We take in corruption, purify it, and restore it to the world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Just as those flowers, by virtue of their poison, have radiant red petals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I loathed them, and yet I was irresistibly drawn to them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Because they are so like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You're right. They are like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>In the language of flowers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Red spider lilies symbolize sad memories and kindred spirits; resurrection and solitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>J-Jin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I didn't know you knew so much about flowers! Heheh... So you do have a soft heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I... I do not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But...kindred spirits sounds kinda... Hmmm... How should I put this...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Wh-what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well...maybe a little over the top?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>H-huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Heheh. I'm just kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>It's because...you were always looking at them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I was? You mean, at the flowers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So I just...did a little research into them. That's all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Hehe...heh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Both you and Wadatsumi will be reborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>You can stand on your own, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Even if you push yourself too hard...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You have friends you can rely on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>A new day has dawned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Hmph... Now I'm talking like a poet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Yes, Yomi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It's because of you, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wh-what do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>You always pushed yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>W-well, I suppose that's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I always wanted to tell you that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>All I ever did was depend on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>So I just...couldn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Listen to me. I came back. You're finally reunited with your weak-willed brother—soft heart and all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>We are together; right here, right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>So, will you let me hear it one more time? You know what I'm talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Good night, Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Sweet dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>J...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>J-Jin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi's power allowed him to come back...but only very briefly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I won't cry. I won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Y-Yomi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I was given a second chance—a fresh start. I even got to say goodbye to my brother. Now, I have to stand on my own two legs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I just have to get through it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>What you said just now... It felt strong... It felt...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Jin...was very dear to you. He will always be in your heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Losing him is hard, I know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>But keeping his memory alive within you is right. Living on despite your grief is what it means to be strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Let us move toward the future together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>I'll make sure you get your fresh start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>As for right now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You can let go, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>I'm right here, beside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Mm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Nngghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Uwaaaaaaaahhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Unnghh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Nnnnngggggghhhhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Uwaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>You did so well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>J-Jin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>I l-loved spinning tops with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I-I'm so glad we kept our p-promise! I-I'm so glad you c-came back! I'm so glad we could t-talk one l-last t-time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>I w-wanted...to see you...so badly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>I missed you so much! Jin!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Thus, the war between the Shiba Senko and the Kagomurasaki came to an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power was sealed in the village statue, and the cloud of corruption enveloping Wadatsumi began to clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Kagura nullified the Mikaboshi's powers...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>And it was decided that both Greed Dike and Wadatsumi would share the duty of its protection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Sumeragi lay broken, and so the only item that could counter the Mikaboshi was lost. As a precaution against future calamities, a bilateral agreement was forged...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>An agreement that never would have been possible if the two nations had been unable to put the tangled past that they had shared behind them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>The reparation of relations between Wadatsumi and Greed Dike also served to greatly inspire the next generation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>My sincerest apologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>I told you to stay put!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>I sincerely apologize!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>Well, I suppose you did help out a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Y-yeah! I guess I did, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Don't get cocky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>You know, it was incredibly dangerous for someone who isn't a descendant of the Kagomurasaki to even touch Sumeragi in its awakened state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I'm glad I gave it everything I had, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>When you touched it, I saw...a glimmer of...something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>It felt like the Sacred Stone Leviathan you saved gave you its blessing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>But there's no way someone like you would receive a blessing from a Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>I just can't believe... Sumeragi broke, so we couldn't destroy the Discarnate Power and sealed it instead...and now the Mikaboshi is in a joint custody arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>I'm kinda worried that I did something really terrible that can never be undone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Yes! You did do something really terrible that can never be undone, you idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Nooooooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>If the Mikaboshi is going to be protected for generations to come, that means I need to make sure that Kagutsuchi is passed on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Who am I supposed to pass it on to?! I don't want to do any more life-or-death training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I only mastered the technique in the first place by fighting one-on-one with Zain until we were both a heartbeat from death!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>Passing Kagutsuchi on means that I would need to put someone else through that! I never, ever want to go through that again! Ever!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>But you did promise Kanon that you would take care of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I know that! I haven't forgotten!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Well, then you gotta pull through! You can't break a promise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>This is all your fault! If you hadn't dragged yourself all the way out to a cursed island, none of this would ever have happened!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Nooooooooooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>You idiot! You stupid, stupid idiot!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Nooooo! I'm such an idiot! I really overdid it this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power may have been sealed, but should the stone overflow with corruption again, it isn't impossible that it might break free.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Even the Mikaboshi might be lost to us again if another war or something broke out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>That's why—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>That's why we must uphold the peace in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>Hmph. You stole my line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>It's something an ally of justice would say, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>Nah, it was kinda childish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>I am not a child!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>It's just my face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>Just because I have a baby face doesn't mean I can't be an adult!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Yes, yes. You are very dependable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Heheheh...heheheheheh... I guess I am kinda dependable...heheheh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>Ngh, it's that laugh again! Stop that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Oh, please don't cringe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>I... I... But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>What is it now? Are you still hung up on the sword thing? That's not like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Don't worry about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>Seeing you charge at the Discarnate Power like that... It was a little cool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Oh...boy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Really? Oh boy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>Ooh la-la.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>Ooh la...?! Gods save me from these idiots!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I'm gonna work on getting stronger, so that I can protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>If another demon shows up, I won't let it so much as breathe on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Well... Give it your best shot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>I will!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>Keep it down, twerp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>But, you know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I'm not gonna beat you up for it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Yeah, but...I think Sumeragi is okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Okay?! You broke it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>It was made from a demon's horn, right? The demon had two horns, so there has to be another Sumeragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>Anoth...?! I told you! One horn was made into Sumeragi, and the other into the Mikaboshi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>That's it! There were only two horns!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>But...the Mikaboshi is tiny, right? I'm sure there must have been at least a little horn left over. We can just use that to make another one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Don't talk about this nation's treasures as if they're ingredients in some recipe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>You two get along really well, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Wh-what?! With this imbecile?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>You don't hate him though, do you? Just because he's an abysmal moron...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>210</td>
<td>W-well, th-that's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>211</td>
<td>What are we talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>212</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>213</td>
<td>G-go away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>214</td>
<td>Hey sis... I did it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>215</td>
<td>Just like you said in your letter...I exorcised the demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>216</td>
<td>I mean...the writing was all shaky, so I couldn't really read most of what you wrote—like, at all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>217</td>
<td>So, I wasn't really taking it super seriously in the beginning, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>218</td>
<td>My bad. When I got there, the corruption in Wadatsumi was worse than ever before, so I figured I'd better get on with it like a proper, dutiful sibling...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>219</td>
<td>Exorcising demons is the duty of the Black Star Clan, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>220</td>
<td>I didn't get it, though. It was easy enough, so I did what you asked of me, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>221</td>
<td>You push yourself too hard, you know? That's why...you keep getting all...beaten up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>222</td>
<td>Just like...Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>223</td>
<td>You got so hung up on following rules and traditions, but did that really make you happy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>224</td>
<td>Didn't you ever want to try following your heart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>225</td>
<td>Because I do—and I'm going to. From here on out, I'm going to choose my own path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>226</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>227</td>
<td>You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>228</td>
<td>It was kinda frustrating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>229</td>
<td>Seeing Jin and Yomi together... Watching that Baby General accomplish her goals...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>230</td>
<td>While I... I couldn't help them in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>231</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>232</td>
<td>I wonder if I can...be there for someone, like they all were for each other?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>233</td>
<td>Jin kept his promise to his baby sister...but you didn't get to see me keep mine. It's not fair.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>234</td>
<td>Unlike Yomi...I wasn't able to meet you...one last time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>235</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>236</td>
<td>What's the big idea, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>237</td>
<td>Couldn't you just hang in there a little longer? Just...until I got home?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>238</td>
<td>Nobody...wants to be left behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>239</td>
<td>Hey. Come on. Say something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>240</td>
<td>Cause I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>241</td>
<td>Yeah, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>242</td>
<td>My other family is waiting for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>243</td>
<td>At least I have a place to go back to, now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>244</td>
<td>Lucky me, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>245</td>
<td>I even start missing it when I'm away for too long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>246</td>
<td>I'll have to show you around some time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>247</td>
<td>I hope Vettel will welcome me back with open arms...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>248</td>
<td>That'd be...nice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>249</td>
<td>It's twilight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>250</td>
<td>The moon is peeping out from among the stars.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>251</td>
<td>Beneath that starry sky, I wait.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>252</td>
<td>I am waiting for the day to come; the day when we can meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>253</td>
<td>I walk with the dawn, but come nightfall, I will always be waiting here for you. Listen to me... I'm starting to sound like a poet, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>254</td>
<td>I will become stronger—strong enough that I will never have to lose anyone ever again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>255</td>
<td>I'm going to work really hard, Jin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>256</td>
<td>At times, I will tire...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>257</td>
<td>And when I do, I will think of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>258</td>
<td>Jin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>259</td>
<td>Don't be a stranger, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>260</td>
<td>Come home to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>261</td>
<td>If you can't, then I'll visit you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>262</td>
<td>On the day of the Equinox...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>263</td>
<td>When twilight descends upon our village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>264</td>
<td>And the red spider lilies are in full bloom, tinged purple in the pale light of the moon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>265</td>
<td>There, atop the hill, bathed in that gentle glow... I will wait with bated breath for your shooting star.</td>
</tr>
