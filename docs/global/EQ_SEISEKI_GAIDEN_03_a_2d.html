<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Did you know that there's a blank in the history of the Holy Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You don't need to worry about that. You just keep progressing forward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'll look backward in your stead, and seek out the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(A blank in the history of the Holy Guard... I always believed that the Holy Order existed to administer justice to Babel.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(Did we once have a different role? Did someone try to conceal that truth?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>(As Lord Commander, I must find out!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah, Zain, I was just looking for you. Would you accompany me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm surprised you asked. It wouldn't be strange for you to head out on your own, without saying anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really are a blockhead. If I went off on my own, who knows how many complaints I'd have to suffer through later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>True enough. Where are we going this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>What exactly are the Cursed Beasts?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>There were no records of them in Envylia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>There were only a few descriptions of an immense beast... What could you possibly hope to learn from that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't be so impatient, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>First of all, we must verify whether or not the Cursed Beasts actually exist. By comparing these descriptions, however few...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We can confirm whether or not what was depicted in that mural had any basis in reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It sounds like a lot of work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's why I had to step down as Captain. I want to devote myself entirely to this research. It might all be for nothing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But I believe that bringing this truth to light will mean protecting Babel, in the truest sense. I really do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Was there a Cursed Beast in Slothstein as well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>That's what we're going to find out. Thorough investigation yields valuable results, you see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Speaking of Slothstein, I heard that they dispatched some rather interesting knights there on a mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That's right. Othima was sent to keep an eye on a guild of weapons smugglers in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How do you know about that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Heheh. Don't underestimate my sources. This Othima, he has abilities that rival the Captains of the Holy Guard, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Right. He's a little moody and mysterious...but above all, he's a very proficient magic user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>A lot happened to him before he came here. He even spent some time in Lost Blue. He doesn't talk much about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, yes. I'm looking forward to meeting him someday. It would be most interesting. Well, we should go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hm...? What's that sound?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>A voice... Where's it coming from? Wait... Up there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That decrepit Monzein... Sponging money off of me every chance he gets...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thankfully, I was able to sell off all that incantation gear to make some extra coin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>But my pockets are still too dang light! This month is going to be tough. I can't believe how much money that old codger throws around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Speak of the devil...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Othima, what are you doing in that tree?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Huh?! L-Lord Zain?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hello.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lady Kaya, too?! Well...it doesn't really matter. I know you're not slacking off or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What about your mission, Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm working on it. We're right on their trail. We'll have them soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Then why are you wasting time here? By the way, Othima... I heard you say something about making some extra coin... What was that about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ah! You heard that?! It's...all a part of my mission, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Then I'd like to have you tell me more about it. I've never heard of a member of the glorious Holy Guard making extra coin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Don't look at me like that! I just sold off some incantation gear that I made...for a little extra coin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Hmmm, what exactly is incantation gear? You've piqued my interest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I knew you'd understand, Lady Kaya! So, it increases your power by releasing Alchemia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Othima! Enough! You weren't entrusted with this mission so that you could play around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The objective of the Holy Guard is to uphold peace and justice in Babel! You should be ashamed of yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Zain... You should listen to what he has to say first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What Othima is doing isn't necessarily unrelated to the mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, that's...true...but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Silencing the Lord Commander in one sentence. Good job, Lady Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Besides, if you're going to get angry about it, couldn't you do something about Monzein, instead? He's always borrowing money from me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Monzein treats the knights at every occasion, right? Where do you think the Vice-Captain gets all that money from?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Don't tell me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>So I need to do some side jobs...but, you know...I think he'd actually leave the Holy Guard if he couldn't treat the knights anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I nearly started working part time as a woodcutter at one point. Wouldn't that be unfortunate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It just wouldn't feel right without old Monzein around, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>So, that's why my side jobs are more or less vital to keeping the peace in both the Holy Guard and Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Heh, heheheh... How...interesting. He's got you there, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Lately, though, that girl Seida has been keeping the Vice-Captain in line for us, which I'm very thankful for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>But...for a member of the glorious Holy Guard to take on extra work on the side...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I think it's important for the Lord Commander to be flexible in his quest for peace in Babel. Being too strict about the rules leads to a narrow mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Mm... When you put it like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>She really can silence Lord Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Lady Kaya, Seida, Captain Yauras... The women of the Holy Guard are really scary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Did you say something, Othima?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>N-no! No, no, no! Nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Well, Lord Zain, it seems that you have nothing to worry about. The knights of the Holy Guard will even take on extra work to uphold the justice of the continent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>So I'm really not slacking off, you know. I know you're in the middle of a mission, but since you're here, why don't you stay and watch?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Othima, how do you know about...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You would never come to a place like this if it wasn't for a mission, right, Lord Zain? Lady Kaya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>It seems pretty serious, so I have to wonder if you yourselves have the time to stand around talking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Hey...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Shhhhh. Please, conceal yourselves. He'll appear any moment now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>So you're the one who's selling that suspicious-looking incantation gear in our territory, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Hey, it's not like you guys have official permission, either! We're no different from each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Anyone who gets in the way of our business needs to disappear. Sorry, but you're going to have to die here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You'll regret using such a clich√© line! Evil never goes unpunished, you know... That's the way the world goes 'round!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You shouldn't be acting so confident, you know. You're completely surrounded! Get him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Like moths to a flame. Did you really think I was defenseless?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Nngh, you...! Don't underestimate us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Ahhh... You know...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You're the ones who need to be careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Do you know how many people have cried themselves to sleep because they've gotten injured by your sub-standard incantation gear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'm going to make sure you pay for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Arghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I guess I should wrap up this mission.</td>
</tr>
