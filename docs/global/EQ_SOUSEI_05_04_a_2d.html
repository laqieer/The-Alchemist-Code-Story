<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>Captain! I finally found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>You're on guard duty today, right? What happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>It's terrible, sir! The harbor's gone up in flames!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>It appears that Ira Belt soldiers have infiltrated the city! We're under attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>How?! The watchmen should've seen them coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>We would've received a warning if any of them approached by sea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>The details are still unclear, sir! But the situation is dire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Reinforcements are needed, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>Y-yes! We've been able to hold them at the docks, but we can't keep them much longer!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Then we don't have the time! You! Not out of breath yet, I hope. Do you still have the energy to run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Then send a message to the knight's headquarters! We need a unit to defend the capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Go, now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple Flame Knight</td>
<td>Yessir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>My apologies, but it looks like we'll need to borrow your strength a lot sooner than anticipated.</td>

<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>It's fine. This was the plan from the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>I must first inform His Highness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>That won't be necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Your Highness! Did you hear? The capital is underâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Damn, she got the jump on me? That girl is bolder than I thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>Hold on! You are wearing the equipment of an Ira Belt Knight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Whoa there, friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>Halt, Imnus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>My liege! That man is one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patricius</td>
<td>He's not our enemy. Isn't that right, Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Indeed, the men attacking you right now only represent one half of the Ira Belt. I'm not with them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>The true king of the Ira Belt has sent me to stop this treason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>You think I'd just believe whatever you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I understand why you might have some misgivings. I'd hardly believe myself if I was in your shoes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>So let me prove that I am someone worth believing. I'm happy to cut down the men invading this town with these very hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>You are?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Yes. Perhaps you don't believe me now, but all I ask is that you judge me by my actions, then, not my words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Imnus</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Excellent! Now let's dish out some justice!</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>Don't you think protecting the citizens is a little more important right now?</td>
</tr>

<td>So you're an ally...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Yup, sure am! Come on, don't hurt your head thinking about these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>I'm a knight that your king sent to help you, so feel free to trust me a little, 'kay?</td>
