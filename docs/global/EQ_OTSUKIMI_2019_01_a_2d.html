<td>The sky above us was always obscured by thick clouds, but the heavens have become so clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm a Phantom Soldier now, but knowing that and believing it are two different things. It didn't feel real until I saw that sky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The clouds parted, and I was able to meet someone I never thought I'd see again. I was so happy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Wow... Feels like a completely different city without all those clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>While I'm here, I want to see how far the field of magical engineering has progressed. Wait, could that car's engine be...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's perfect weather for moon-gazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Whoa! Wh-who are you?! Huh? Hazel, is she a friend of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My name is Tamamo, and this is Kon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Nice to meet you. My name is Evelika. I'm a mercenary from Slothstein, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait a minute! Where did you come from, anyway? Jumping out of nowhere and shouting about the moon... Who does something like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry! I'm just so excited about moon-gazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is moon-gazing, anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's a custom of Wadatsumi. I had it explained to me earlier, but if you want the details...Tamamo?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Heheh! Then allow me to explain! You see, moon-gazing is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Haaaahmm... The people at the shrines seem kinda busy today, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ahh. That is because they are preparing for the moon-gazing event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Moon-gazing? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Curious, are we? Very good. Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Moon-gazing is a festival in which we express our gratitude to the gods for the year's harvest. We begin by decorating the altar with offerings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Such offerings should be dumplings made to look like the moon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>In addition to a nice meal made using seasonal foods, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>After the festival, you enjoy these offerings. By doing so, you express your thanks for the bountiful harvest with which you were blessed, thereby strengthening your connection to the gods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That is what the gods tell me, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Sounds delicious! Well, I'm convinced!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I would like to take part in the festivities myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>However, leaving the shrine amidst such sizeable crowds was deemed too dangerous for me. As such, I have been forbidden from participating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I am sure that everyone will enjoy this day in harmony, united under the majesty of the full moon. I cannot deny that I am a little envious. I would very much like to enjoy it alongside them, but alas...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Okay! Then I promise you that we'll go moon-gazing together someday!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>And that's what we're doing today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see... So that's why you're both dressed like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aren't these garments lovely?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>They are, but they look difficult to move around in. I wouldn't have expected you to be so into this, Hazel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It sounds like it'll be fun! The moon should be so beautiful with skies as clear as this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If the sky ever clears, I would like to see the moon with you, Hazel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That would be nice. Someday...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Unless... You don't want to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No, I would love to! I swear it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>All right, then! If that is what we are doing, then I, Evelika, will do everything in my power to make tonight go well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>So, we'll be needing dumplings as round as the moon and a feast full of seasonal deliciousness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I've asked Carol to take care of the dumplings, but... Ah, right. We'll need to make some other things as well. I wonder if she'd be okay with me making another request?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Oh, I almost forgot! We need silver grass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Silver grass? What does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But... Hmm... I think I saw some growing somewhere near this area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We'll need to watch our step. Wild animals live here and we're invading their territory. Let's try not to disturb them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Isn't that right, Hazel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What the...? Where did she go?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Over here! Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Hey! Don't go on without me! Wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Look! A whole field of silver grass!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>So this is silver grass... They look so fuzzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hrm... These are a bit wimpy looking. Are there more down this way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A-are you two sure we should be going in any deeper? I heard wolves nest in this area. Maybe we shouldn't...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Whoa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hehehe, sorry. I think I just woke them up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What did I just tell you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Grrrroooooooghh!</td>
</tr>
