<td>Your past?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…After my parents died, I became a small-time thief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…When you were just a child?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>It couldn't be helped. Even though I was a child, nobody was there to take care of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Everyone was fixated on their own lives--the whole country was. You had to do whatever you could to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I even killed in order to feed myself. It's an awful story, I know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I was jailed multiple times. I was miserable. I thought, "Why does this have to happen to me?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…That's--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I hated demons. Well, not just them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The adults who neglected me, my country who ignored me…I hated everyone around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm not going to make excuses. But...I could only get rid of that hatred by committing more and more sins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It was one of those days when I was thrown into prison that a man spoke to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The man made an intriguing offer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"Capture demons, get paid. The more you capture, the more money you make."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It seemed he made the same proposal to others, but we could operate individually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I told him, "I'm just a kid. I can't catch demons." But the man said:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>"You have more chakra than most. Use it to catch demons and I'll show you how make a living."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>"Wouldn't it be better than to waste away here, wallowing in hatred?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…Who was that man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I’m not sure. He didn't seem to be from Wadatsumi, although I didn't think much of it at the time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Anyway, the reward money was out of this world. I jumped at the opportunity. And I could also enact vengeance on the demons who robbed me of everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I said "Can I really cleanse myself of hatred?" He nodded with satisfaction and said:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>"But you've got to catch them alive--otherwise it doesn't count. There's no reward if you kill them." He said that again and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I only had one question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>"Why are you doing this?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>To which he answered, matter-of-factly---</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>…Then what happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>When I got out of prison, I was taught how to wield chakra. There were others like me, all with a lot of chakra…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>And it seemed like they all had family members killed by demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I got to work soon after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I captured demons like I was told and made tons of money. I didn't have to worry about what I would eat the next day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Capture. Sleep. Repeat. Capture. Sleep. Repeat. Over and over and over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Sometimes I worked alone. Sometimes I worked in groups. I caught scores of demons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Every time I caught one, I felt myself cleansed of a little more hatred, but every time I caught one…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Indescribable emotions began to swell up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Indescribable emotions…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>How can I put it... I think I was consumed by a sense of duty to catch more and more demons...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I felt that the "work" I was doing was no longer about capturing demons, but rather cleansing myself of hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Around that time, a name was coined for people like me who captured demons for a living:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That name was "Demon Hunter."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…Demon Hunter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Rumors began to spread quickly about a group that secretly captured demons and brought them to a certain man…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Captured…demons…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>…Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…What happened after that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…One day</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I was hunting demons as usual. They appeared to be eating as there were human corpses all around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>At the time, I was working with other Demon Hunters to collect all the demons in the area.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I'm guessing their guard was down because they were eating. We captured them without much of a fight. As I was leading them away…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>…I felt a demon child staring at me. I could sense…hatred in its eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>At first, I thought it was angry about being captured, but the next moment…it started to cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Cry…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>It was the cry of an infant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>…………</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Right then, I came to my senses. demons have to eat to live, too. Otherwise they'll die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That baby was hungry and crying... That's how it felt. And I suddenly thought:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>"What the hell am I doing?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Once I had that epiphany, I immediately realized the little one in front of me was just like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We both ate because we were hungry. We experienced deprivation, and hate...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The hunger…and contempt for senseless cruelty… What's so different between humans and demons anyway?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>All those thoughts started to make me… They made me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hungry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…HUNGRY? Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Well, it's true... But then I started thinking seriously.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Everyone gets hungry, so if we can live in a world without starvation maybe we won't have to fight anymore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Isn't that a little oversimplifying things…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>The reason I became a Demon Hunter was to feed myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You hated demons, too, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>That may be true…but if I had food to eat, I'd eventually be able to let that go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Besides, even if I settle an old score, a new conflict is bound to spring up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'm much rather be full and avoid conflict altogether.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>So, you don't hate demons?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I hated them, but living in hatred...isn't it "normal."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>For me...I just want to eat to my heart's content. If I can live without hunger, I can live without hating anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>And not just me. All the humans, demons, and animals that live in Wadatsumi, too. I want all living things to be that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...How can you say such flowery words?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Because I know what it's like to have nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>That's why I want provide demons an alternative to eating humans. That way we won't need to fight each other.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>What do you think? Am I crazy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>…That's what you consider "normal?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I do--much more so than hating one another. That's how I feel about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>…What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...I should despise you. You may have caused our suffering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>My brother wants to kill you. Demon Hunters are our most hated enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>He thinks killing them will protect me… But I don't want to always be protected. That's why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I want to kill you with my own hands. I have to ... I know I do...and yet…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>And yet... Why...! Why…………!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>…!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Shall we eat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Oh, um…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>It's okay. Eat 'til you're full... You can think better afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Even if that means devouring you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>You'll be full, so I won't fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>…Idiot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Maybe…but I'm okay with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>After all, I got a demon to come back and try my cooking, didn't I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>…Good point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Well...then…time to eat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Hang on while I go get more seasoning!</td>
