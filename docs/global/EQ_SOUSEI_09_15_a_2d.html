<td>I thought I would try to stick around for a while, but...ugh. This town's just too noisy for my liking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I like it here, myself. It's warm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Stands to reason it would be, given that it's a town of mining and engineering and such...that's floating in the air for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Honestly, it's such a waste of magil to keep this rock in the sky! Has everyone here lost their marbles?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We did what we had to do to keep ourselves safe from the Cursed Beast's influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Never mind that! You have everything ready, motorcycle man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yep! After sending Nimul and the others off to the Superbia Belt, it certainly has taken some time for us to get back on our feet...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But we did it, so now we can finally provide them some backup! Assuming we're able to get to them in time, anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yes, time is of the essence, if this constant magil rumbling is anything to go by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>The barrier of corruption separating the Belt Regions is starting to wear itself down. Or maybe it's just...accumulating sin more quickly than before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I've been confined to Luxuria Belt for so long, I'm not even sure what's going on anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I do know that we're fast approaching the future my mentors wished for so long ago. The time of creation is near.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You mean Nimul and his gang have finally done it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>They've done something, at least. Possibly fail! It's hard to say. In any case, we should to make sure there are as many people to help as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then what are we waiting here for? Follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Ugh, young people. Come along, Winnick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right behind you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Is everyone here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Yes, the allied forces of Invidia and Ire Belts have all boarded. But can this ship really cross over the world's barrier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Sure can. Not only does this baby make use of some of Adaleigh's own designs, it was put together by some of Acedia Belt's best engineers, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It might not be as maneuverable as Adaleigh's ship, but we can move lots of people and resources all the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Could use a bit of sprucing up, though, admittedly. The interior is a bit drab.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Stay on topic, motorcycle man!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Right! Ahem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>We were planning to recruit more people from other regions, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But there's no time for that now. I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you headed to meet with Andechs and the others? If so, I'll gladly join you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>He helped to save Ire Belt, so I've got a debt to repay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Great! Welcome aboard, then! Next stop: Superbia Belt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So, the end is near...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Within my flesh and blood, the Shell of the World... The people of the territories of the seven sins have changed far too drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Has all of this change and progress finally altered things beyond the scope of the Dragon Realm that my Truth so fervently acted to preserve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It is a but a relic now, so much has been lost. Its degradation consumes my very being.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Heh... Haha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This must truly be the end—both of any hope for restoring the world that the dragons once envisioned, and for the absurd dream I once held.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yet in spite of it all...or rather, because of it all, the time has come for a new beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You, human Alchemist Nimul, who've come bearing a wish to create the world anew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>So long as I exist as the cornerstone of this world, your invasion will fail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>But there is still time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>The world is, as it shall always be, mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Should you deny this for even a moment, I will not hesitate to show you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You shall see the revolution you so desire! Witness what truly awaits the future of this world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Shall we see how well you're able to weather another trial?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Know what becomes of foolish humans who act in defiance of the Truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Is everyone prepared?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>This will be a race against time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>While Eulalia and the others keep Ouroboros' phantoms busy outside, we'll recapture the tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Let's move out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>...! What in the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Is this the Temple of Beelzebub, the Cursed Beast of Gluttony? Why is it inside the tower?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>No, this must be...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The Dragon Realm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The Dragon what, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>The dragons that once ruled over this domain had the ability to change the world's properties as they saw fit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As spiritual beings with flesh and blood, they had the power to determine the laws of the world—to determine what was true, basically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>They called this Dragon Realm their sanctuary. It is the very manifestation of their power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>So that's the official name for this place? Anyhow, that still doesn't answer why a whole shrine's been stuffed inside here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>This tower's made from magil and the cores of the Cursed Beasts. Did Ouroboros activate it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>The air in here is decidedly abnormal. Everything here lay in the palm of my lady's hand... Or, perhaps it's more fitting to say it is like an embryo in the womb. The embryo of a new world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>That...doesn't fill me with a lot of confidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>But we can still move forward. Sensing the way the magil's flowing through the air, I believe something must be above us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then we'd better get going. There's no telling what might happen if we stay he—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Who goes there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>"Who goes there"? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>As well-known as I was, that's the second time I've been asked that question today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I suppose that's just the way it is when you're in a different time period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>This magil—and you, with it—are phantoms born of Ouroboros, I take it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Correct. I am Ignacio. Esai Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Did you just say "Ignacio"?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Mm, yes, you're called the same, aren't you? Quite the coincidence, isn't it? Or, rather...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It may be more sensible to assume your name is inherited. I swear, my peers never knew what to do without me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Perhaps the name was passed down among the generations because I still had an unfinished role to play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Lord Nimul—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Please don't address me like that. You calling me "Lord" is somehow...unsettling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Nimul...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Nimul, then. I'll handle this...vagabond. You go on ahead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Are you out of your mind?! It's not like these are normal enemies fighting with spears and shields. Going in solo is suicide!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Maybe so, but we can't afford to waste any more time dealing with this right now, can we?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>(He's right. If Ouroboros has noticed we're here, our best course of action is to strike where it hurts the most...and fast.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(Still...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Besides, you left those other four to keep the enemy's minions occupied. Now it's my turn to do the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>If their lives can be thrown away to buy some time, there's no reason you should make any special exceptions for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're wrong, Ignacio.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Eulalia and the others will survive. I have every faith in their abilities, and in their will to live. I'm not so sure I can say the same for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Oho, do I smell some discord in your little group? That will certainly make my job quite a bit easier!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Geh! Fallen?! Where did they come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Fallen, eh? That's a good name for them. Simple and to the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>When one is consumed by sin, they lose all sense of self and fall into a violent, impulsive stupor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Fooo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>And that's precisely why they cannot oppose their own sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>So...hungry... Always...so hungry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>This is just like back in the Gula Belt, when we fought Beelzebub!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Innumerable Fallen just keep on spawning from the corruption in the air around us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Quite right. The very atmosphere itself keeps them coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Ouroboros really knows how to think on her feet, I must say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>And she wasn't blessed with a parent who could teach her that kind of thing, which makes it all the more impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ouroboros has become quite fond of strong-arming her way through things, but originally her strategy was to attack people with images of the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>You love to hear yourself talk, don't you? Are you planning on telling us what's really going on here, or not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I'm just here to do my job. I believe that Ouroboros called it a "trial."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>And you lot are obliged to pass it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>A trial? To fight her?! What, is she going to assign us handicaps based on our performance to even the playing field?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>She won't have to, since she is already nearly expired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>She'll die if nothing's done. But of course, you already knew that, didn't you...Ignacio?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>If you're really the successor to my name, you should be well aware of the situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Ignacio, what's he talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>The Shell of the World has its limits. At least, that's what my father told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Ouroboros documented everything, and in doing so, she affixed her Truth to the seven Belt Regions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>The problem is, humans have since produced too much of that sinful magil...more than the Cosmic Egg can handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>So by limits, you mean that the vessel containing this world is in danger of rupturing and...falling apart, I guess?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Was that what those cracks running through the sky were?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Naturally. And equally natural is the impending demise of the existence you know as Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>If victory is your goal, you need only wait. This battle will fight itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>What? Can it possibly be that simple?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Of course not! Think about it! What he's saying is basically that the world's about to end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Wait. Doesn't that mean we've already lost? What have we even been fighting for, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Is that the only thing you care about? If it's a question of who wins and who loses, I would consider you to be the victors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>The sins of humanity have exceeded God's ability to pass judgment. There is no more definitive sign of victory for you than that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>What you're saying, then, is that Ouroboros—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Is essentially this very world itself, yes. As I'm certain even you've concluded by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>How could she...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Nimul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>What kind of sick individual are you? What is this talk of trials, and the death of the world? How is that supposed to be a victory for humans? And why do you seem to take such delight in it all?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>And...if it's all true...then how did it get to this point? We were supposed to be working together to save the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Why did none of you ever warn us? Why did no one tell us this could happen? How could you keep that from us?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>We did tell you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>I told you. Mesarthim told you. Matia told you. The surviving dragons, who believed so strongly in humanity's future, told you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>The future can only be won through battle—through bloodshed. I taught her that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>I ensured that she understood there could be no new creation without combat...without destruction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>We ally ourselves with Ouroboros to atone for the sin that made her what she is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Yes... This is all because of our original sin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>But why does it have to be this way?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>This is just the Truth of the future we've built.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>The only thing humans can truly understand is bringing harm to one another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Ouroboros reached that conclusion after many years of observing humanity's history unfold.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>If you find this possibility unacceptable, then the only thing you can do is change it, through your own power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>What on earth was she thinking? There's got to be a way to change the future for the better...right? Isn't there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>That line of thinking is a privilege afforded only to the living. For the dead, our only concern is the lingering attachments we leave behind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Andechs?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I don't have the foggiest idea what in blazes you're trying to say...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>But if you're looking for someone to take on the big-mouthed newcomer, I'm your man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>Except, there's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>No time left, I know. So let's try this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Ignacio, we'll take on this joker together. How's that? You wanted to deal with him in the first place, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>That sounds good to me. Bring it on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>No matter what the future may hold, there will still be sacrifices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I do believe that. And yet, for some reason I can't quite explain, I don't buy anything else this other Ignacio is saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Oh, dear! Have I made an archrival of my own kin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>To put it lightly, yes. I've hated every single word that's come out of your mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>All right, as long as you're with him, Andechs, I can approve of this arrangement. I'm counting on you two!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>Just don't go dying while we're gone, you hear?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>I've recalibrated the Hamal using Nimul's power. It should be effective now against even products of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>Got it. Just leave this to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>You ready, Ignacio? I'll take the right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Then I'm on the left! You're really okay with this, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>With what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>With dying here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>Anyone who goes into any battle risks dying, right? It's just a hazard of the job. And one I plan on avoiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>I see. Two have stepped up against me. Though your numbers are few, I'll humor this little display of bravado.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>You're awfully confident, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>This body is already dead. There's nothing left for me to lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>If what you said is accurate, though, then I'd say you have some regrets. "Lingering attachments" were your exact words, I believe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I do, of course. But those have nothing to do with the task at hand. So, are we doing this, then? Let's get to work. I've never been fond of slacking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>You two have now met your unmaker. You will fall here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Hyaahh! We'll see about that!</td>
</tr>
