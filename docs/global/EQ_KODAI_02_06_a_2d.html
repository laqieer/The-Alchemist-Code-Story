<td>Is this…a tunnel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. Part of the recent development of a red light district in Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Before that, the city was just a standard mining town.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Mining?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What? What's this light…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>It's…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This light is what powers Redington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Massive Magil crystals that exist in the underground areas of the Sloth Layer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Amazing, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>The people were surrounded by Magil. The crystals are used for dragon technology..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>From Aedith's point of view, your proposal must have been something she really wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Schmeier?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Abandoned by the dragons… Seems to be so… And here lie the remains…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>This is a burial ground for dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Dragons? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>For us dragons, we need Magil to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>The destruction of the body for us is basically a notion that the time of change has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Even dragons will one day die, whether after living a long time or giving their life in battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>A long time ago, this planet had land where we would forever sleep after death. The final resting place was the burial ground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This is the place? So all these Magil crystals are…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Fossils of dead dragons. With all this power…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>So Redington's power is derived from burning the fossils of the dead dragons.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There must have been some who resented that. And there was feeling of abandonment. I see… What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Me? It's not my concern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The world revolves in cycles. Death is a resource for life, and that's how the world turns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Right now, it's the dragon's turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm sure Aedith will shed some tears by hearing that story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Really? Well, I'd still like to work together with him someday…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>With all these resources, there are many things that can be realized…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait… What's with this Magil…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Grrroooaaarrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>A beast like before? I get it now. The beasts have gone berserk because of the Magil…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>A bit of a long story…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Grrrroooaaaarrrr…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's basically like a ghost... Seeing a ghost in a graveyard is quite fitting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Don't let them attack you! Maybe the beasts will…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What a troublesome situation... Fine, let's do this!</td>
