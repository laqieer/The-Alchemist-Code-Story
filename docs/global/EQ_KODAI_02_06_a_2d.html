<td>A long time ago, this planet had land where we would forever sleep after death. The final resting place was the burial ground.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/math.png" alt="Matia" height="128"><br>Matia</td>
<td>There must have been some who resented that. And there was feeling of abandonment. I see… What about you?</td>

<td>Me? It's not my concern.</td>

<tr>
<td>Schmeier</td>
<td>The world revolves in cycles. Death is a resource for life, and that's how the world turns.</td>
