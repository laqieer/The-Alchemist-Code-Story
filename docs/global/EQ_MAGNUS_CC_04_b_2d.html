<td>Ryui! Is that you, dearie? I've been meaning to tell you—that cooking incantation gear you gave me the other day is simply marvelous!</td>

<td>Your inventions make my life so much easier! I've been getting a steady supply of water and electricity since you installed those pipes, too. I can't thank you enough!</td>

<td>Well, there've been some shady types hanging around here of late, and you never can be too careful.</td>

<td>They're not the mafia, either. There's something not quite right about them. They give me the willies.</td>

<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>Then, if someone attacks you, just jab them with it—like this. Easy enough, right?</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>No, not really. Besides, I'm sure you've already heard all about my past from Mister Othima. It's not like I'm hiding it or anything.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ryui.png" alt="Ryui" height="128"><br>Ryui</td>
<td>It's no miracle, silly. It's growing because you've been watering it every day, and taking good care of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right—but I didn't do it alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>See, I put this little sign here to warn people not to walk on it, and no one has! And people've been reminding me to water it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Child</td>
<td>So it's thanks to everyone that this little guy is growing so well! I can't wait to see what kinda flower it'll turn out to be!</td>
