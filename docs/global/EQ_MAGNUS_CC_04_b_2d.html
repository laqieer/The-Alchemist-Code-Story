<td>Don't you think you're overchargin' a bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>My good sir, this is a high-quality incantation gear! If you were to buy it legitimately, you'd expect to pay at least double.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Just between you and me, this was crafted by an extremely prolific Alchemist of some renown. If you're not interested in it, I'm sure someone else will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ooh! Hold on, lass! All right... I'll take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Excellent. Then we have a deal! Thank you very much for your business.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Heh. Y'know, you'd make a pretty good saleswoman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I might as well be one, after all the errands I've run for Mister Othima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ryui! Is that you, dearie? I've been meaning to tell you—that cooking incantation gear you gave me the other day is simply marvelous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your inventions make my life so much easier! I've been getting a steady supply of water and electricity since you installed those pipes, too. I can't thank you enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>There's no need for that. I'm just glad I can help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, but...goodness, how time flies! I still remember when you were yea tall—now look at you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Everyone's always talking about how much you've improved our little town, Ryui. And for good reason! Where would we be without you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Do stop by again soon, won't you? I'm sure I'm not the only one who misses you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Oh! By the way, Ryui, you wouldn't happen to have any incantation gear for security or self-defense, would you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh? Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, there've been some shady types hanging around here of late, and you never can be too careful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>They're not the mafia, either. There's something not quite right about them. They give me the willies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmm... I see. Well, how about this? Just press this button here to fill this part with high-voltage electricity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then, if someone attacks you, just jab them with it—like this. Easy enough, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ooh! This is just what I need. Thanks, dearie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh. Y'know, you're almost a different person down here. It's like you're in your element or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I am. This is my hometown, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right... You never talk about it, though. Is it a touchy subject?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, not really. Besides, I'm sure you've already heard all about my past from Mister Othima. It's not like I'm hiding it or anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's just...it was only through hard work that I was able to make it out of this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>And while I don't hate the slums, they're not exactly full of good memories for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But when I think about the fact that I was the only one who made it out...even though leaving was my dream, I can't help but feel a bit hollow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I can see that, but...remember this, Ryui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You are not alone, and from what I've seen...you never really were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>That's funny... Will told me something similar when we were training for the mock battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Hey, Ryui! Ryui! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That seed you gave me is starting to grow! You've gotta come see! I've been watering it every day, just like you told me to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ooh! Really? Show me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wow! It has sprouted, hasn't it? Great work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I was worried it'd never grow down here... It's like a miracle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's no miracle, silly. It's growing because you've been watering it every day, and taking good care of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yeah, you're right—but I didn't do it alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>See, I put this little sign here to warn people not to walk on it, and no one has! And people've been reminding me to water it, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>So it's thanks to everyone that this little guy is growing so well! I can't wait to see what kinda flower it'll turn out to be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You keep saying that, but do you know why people don't always put in all the effort they possibly could?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Why?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Because it's hard. Now, c'mon, give me one of those bags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Everyone is working hard down here... How did I not see that? What one person can't do alone, they make possible by working together.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'm sure it will be a beautiful one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hey! Where's Ryui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>She's talking with a friend. I'm just giving them some space. Anyway, how are things going on your end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I got us what we need, but it looks like we're in for a rough time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Apparently, some mafiosos are going to have it out here in a few days. Although...I'm not convinced it's really going to play out that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>See, those suspicious characters who've been sniffing around Real Heaven of late are actually hired mercenaries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>So, what are we gonna do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well...I don't see the harm in helping out—which makes me think that maybe she's been a better role model for us than we have been for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Sounds about right. But since we're supposed to be her mentors and all, it's probably still our job to steer her in the right direction.</td>
</tr>
