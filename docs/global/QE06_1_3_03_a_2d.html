<td>I take it they were tougher than you thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I figured I'd take them out before they could try to hinder our plans, but they were...tenacious. They won't be a problem, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Even if I am killed, there is still another to succeed me, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I'm pleased you think so. Is there anything else I can do for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No, not really.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Where are you going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm going to do as demons do. Weren't you the one who said that would be fine?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...Yes. Off to go searching again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I've decided to hunt some pesky foxes first. It will do double duty of accumulating more corruption and hastening the return of our king. Ah, and I should capture that girl with the special powers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh, so you found one of what you'd lost?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmph, you are a cheeky one. Anyway, are preparations ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Then I shall hunt those foxes, and then take my time capturing the girl and the castle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>So then this is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Is that not also what you planned? How annoying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Anything I can help you with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I don't remember ever teaming up with you. We're just doing what is best for ourselves, am I wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...I suppose that would be best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Tch! Nothing new or useful! Well, I suppose it can't be helped. I've read almost everything here at least once before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But I do remember there being something interesting. Now, where was that written...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>There you are, Captain Ugachi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Azami. What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please spar with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I couldn't do anything. I even...fainted before the Discarnate Power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You struck it once with your sword.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Just once! And only with your help, Captain Ugachi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's all I could do against the bane of my parents...of my clan! I can't stand how weak I am!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Azami...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I feel the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I will kill it next time. This I swear to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Going through all of these records is diverting in itself, but sure. I can teach you a thing or two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I see. The lord of pure-blood demons, the Discarnate Power</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes. We drove it away once, but we are currently having trouble finding a more permanent solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Hmm. Why has it showed itself now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That is unknown. However, it did seem very interested in one of our recruits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Really? And what is the name of this recruit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Her name is Amane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmm. I believe there were some records regarding the Discarnate Power in Greed Dike's archives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We shall investigate the Discarnate Power's intentions on our side as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>That would be greatly appreciated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>We stand at a very critical moment in history. I expect you to give all you have to restore Wadatsumi to what it should be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All is for Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>For Wadatsumi's peace...and justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>My everyday life... Something worth protecting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why am I troubled over this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>"This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>"I still believe."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>"I still believe Wadatsumi will regain such peaceful days once more!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>This voice and vision. This warm voice was saying, "This is what Wadatsumi is meant to be."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>And believing in its "peaceful days."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What am I supposed to do...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaah! It's not like me to be so low-spirited! I hate this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I should get my body moving in some way. That should help clear my thoughts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I'll beat these wandering thoughts into submission!</td>
</tr>
