<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Forgive me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You have nothing to apologize for. We just need to find somewhere to hide...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kamui! Over here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hisham?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>None of those Gluttony jerks are over this way! Hurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Got it! Malta, can you stand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Y-yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm glad the two of you are okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What about everyone else? Has Isidore returned?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know about Isidore, but the warriors that came back are at the Chief's house, buying us all some time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There's an escape route hidden behind the trunk of Sephiron. They won't catch us if we flee that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What are you doing, Kamui? We have to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Hisham... I need you to do something for me.</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Take Malta and go on without me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Wh-what? No way! I can't just leave you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>The Chief told me specifically to tell you to run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>As Protector...and as one who was raised by this village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>These people are my family. I must do whatever I can to save whoever I can.</td>

<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Kamui...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Please...promise me one thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Promise me that you will live...and we will meet again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Of course. I promise that I will live and come to find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Thank you. I'll be waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Are you ready, Kamui?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Take care of Malta.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... Haa...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You won't get away, kid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Urk! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Ugh, this business of killing kids already makes me sick, and now I have to work for it...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>"Aurora formed in glory, fell my foes with flames of mercilessness!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Urgh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>P-Protector?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Follow the aqueducts out of the village! Others will be waiting for you there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>O-okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>And you... I will not let you take another step!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That day, I could do nothing but channel my overwhelming yet helpless anger outwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I had seen the true face of Gluttony Foss, an insatiable, gaping maw that personified the sin of its Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A country in which many flourish by stealing from their neighbors, in which life is stolen by engineering the deaths of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>In which culture and government are built upon the cruel reality of a dog-eat-dog society.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>In which the weak have no means of protecting themselves from being swallowed up by the greedy and powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>And yet...I believed that there should exist a means for them to protect themselves. That there should exist a way to protect everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I lived my life believing this with all of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That is why, for me, that time and place was like a dream. One that was too good to be true.</td>
