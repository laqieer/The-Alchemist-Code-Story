<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I can't leave Ikasa behind!</td>

<td>H-hey!</td>

<td>005</td>
<td>We made a promise!</td>

<td>Swift decapitation means only a split second of suffering. So don't come back and haunt me, okay?</td>

<td>You probably would've put up a better fight if you hadn't been trying to protect that shrine maiden.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But you did get me to lose sight of her. 'Course, she'll stand out in that getup. I'll just have to be patient.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wh-what the hell?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Clearly, I did the right thing.</td>

<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'm a Paladin; a knight of the Holy Guard. A knight who lives to protect her princess, who is now her king.</td>

<td>Y'know what? I know I asked, but I don't care. It doesn't really matter who you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Heh. Well, I forgot how to die a long time ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You've got nowhere left to run!</td>

<td>Don't you see that Wadatsumi's true nature is in question here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wadatsumi took advantage of its distance from the continent and its cultural independence to give heretical power free reign!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>H-heretical power? Leafah, I don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>And yet you talk of another way—of a different sort of peace. What are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lady Leafah! Where are you?! We have received the order to return! We must leave, Lady Leafah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>R-run!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! I-I don't understand, Leafah! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Our journey will continue! We will travel around the continent, connecting with those we meet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I want to learn more about this world! I want to spread the teachings of my homeland, and bring that peace back home with me to Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>If I can do that, this world will be connected by true peace! Wadatsumi will become a part of the world at large!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Isn't this just a quest for revenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>R-revenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You keep talking about Wadatsumi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But Wadatsumi is gone.</td>
