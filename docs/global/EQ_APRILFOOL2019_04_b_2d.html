<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>S-stop! Please, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'll never forgive you, Sabareta!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Sabareta, don't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Don't worry. Whatever happens, we'll make it to Valderik! That is our resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Don't involve Agatha in your selfish, twisted resolve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Stop, Dias! Please! Don't hurt him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tsk! Get out of the way, Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Their revolt gave birth to countless tragedies! Are you going to divert your eyes from this truth?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I haven't diverted my eyes! I've turned them towards the future, and this is the conclusion I've reached!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>This is the answer I came up with that will lead the world to peace. If we can work together with them, we can stop the cycle of sorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Agatha, you... You don't have a crush on this guy, do you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What is he talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sabareta, you dare approach my sister?! Come on, Agatha. We're going home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>D-Dias...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I've been away from you for too long. I'm about to run out of my Agatha-reserves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Dias, what are you saying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm your big brother! It's about time you started treating me like one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>This is getting weird.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's wrong with this kid?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>None of your concern!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I will not allow you to be Agatha's boyfriend! You are not worthy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>B-boyfriend? Where did that come from?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Shut up! You are not worthy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>When she was little, Agatha once said that she'd only want a boyfriend as strong as me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I never said that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You and your skewed bandanna will never be good enough for her! I bet your mother made that armor for you, you useless meat sack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Are you trying to insult me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What are you doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Lord Gabirond, don't tell me you're after Agatha as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>What? Of course not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Oh, really? Don't think I can't see the deceit lurking in your eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(What is wrong with him? He believed everything I said earlier, but now that his sister's involved, he's suddenly paranoid.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>This is all Agatha's doing. She is far too charming for her own good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Dias, you're freaking me out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I bet none of you knew that Agatha loves cats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You know what else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You might expect the color of the wallpaper in her room to be pink, but it's actually pale blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Her charm doesn't end there. She is the best cook I know, she can fold clothes like no other, and her shampoo is the best-smelling stuff around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This is...bordering on crazy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How can you endanger your daughter to achieve your own ends? Whatever your reasons may be...I will not allow Agatha to be caught up in the ravages of war!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You've got it wrong! Becoming the representative of the Wratharis Dominion was my ownâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Shut up, Agatha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You don't know what father is really like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I saw it for myself! Father was feverishly deleting his browser history!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>There is also footage of him wiping his booger on a restaurant tablecloth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-you saw me doing that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>But that's not all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>There's more?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Father is not just some idol groupie...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He's seriously trying to get romantically involved with one of the group's members!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>This... This is too much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>You were my hero, a knight who I looked up to! I was proud to call you my father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I cannot stand by and watch anymore as you deceive others and pursue the path of treason!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Father...please, open your eyes! Or else, I will have to cut you down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Do it, Dias!</td>
</tr>
