<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>A story I had long forgotten. A tale from our youth about a sin that required atonement, of the mistake made by a powerless girl and a girl who knew not of power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It had been a day like any other. The war continued to rage on the island, and the two of us were sooty from its fires, fleeing for our lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I don't want to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Young Ikasa was much more afraid of pain than she would be in her later years. Her wounds were very deep, and I didn't know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It hurts, Button! It hurts so bad! Make it stop! I'm so scared! I don't want to die!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>H-hold my hand! Just squeeze my hand, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Deep in the forest, where the spirits of Wadatsumi were enshrined, amidst curls of smoke and raging fires, I sat by her side and fervently prayed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Hang in there! You can't die—you can't!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've just gotta say the magic words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Everything is fine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Those are the magic words! Just say them! It doesn't hurt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I...remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It was all my fault, Ikasa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My little spell became your curse!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's why you didn't leave me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why only I could kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Would you be so kind as to tell my fortune?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Certainly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Ahh, how exciting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yes, I see it. The message I have for you is as clear as day. "I will never in this lifetime read your fortune."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Well, that's rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Thank you for coming to my little shop. I hope you enjoyed your stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This won't do. How can one enjoy the occult without mood? Without atmosphere?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Thank you for coming. I was happy to serve you. The door is right over there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I am concerned about the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So you believe fortune-telling is all about finding out what is to come?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Is it not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I trace the threads of fate from your past. I sift through forgotten elements of what came before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Now, are you really willing to show me all of that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You never talk about your past, Drei. Nor have you ever been willing to discuss your outlook on the present or future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>You do not speak lies, but we both know that you are always lying by omission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now, I don't mind a mysterious man who won't share his past, but I won't let him into my bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How titillating.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I'm good at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>However, to be clear, I am not here to ask about myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh? A lover, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>For the past several years since its collapse at the hands of Greed Dike, Wadatsumi has been in a temporary state of peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now a shrine maiden who escaped that chaos has wandered into Lost Blue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've heard about her. Nothing good, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>A demonic occultist who curses and murders all those who approach her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How awful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>She is planning to climb the Mystic Tower Veda alone. Did you know that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Sol would know about her by now, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yes, yes, yes! That's exactly the point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>So it is her future that you are concerned for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Not hers, but the Templars'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Really? How sweet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This girl will likely be invited to join our ranks in the near future. However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What sustenance can a faded flower provide?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You're talking about the time when she was...blossoming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Don't make me remember! Let me forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>You have done well to climb to this point.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>My head is going to burst! I can't take it! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I will give you power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Just let me forget! Take it away! I just want to forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Once you have offered up your voice to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Won't you let me forget?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>All the dead, all those who I killed. All those who died, and all those who came to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All of my foolish dreams, my illusions of peace. My naive ideals, my escapist fancies of forgiveness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>All of those beautiful landscapes—the seas, the skies, the flowers—and the smiles I saw along the way. All of you, and all of me as I was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Just let me forget! I want to forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Why do you suffer so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Surely such a price is a small thing to pay for power. Besides, it is already done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Your oblivion is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The fifth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I was robbed of my ability to forget.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But Wadatsumi is gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I was unable to forget a single moment of my past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Sh-she put a spell on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>She made me feel all icky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Yeah! It was gross!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>All of the memories I had wanted so desperately to forget resurfaced. They played out in my mind in perfect detail—and would continue to do so for all eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>K-kill her! Kill her before she kills us! Kill the traitorous heretic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Kill her! Slit her throat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>All of the hatred I had experienced, all of my sins, my pain, my stupidity...all of the tragedies I had witnessed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>The knight with her cannot be killed! The shrine maiden has enslaved a departed soul! It is blasphemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Get her! Hunt her down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>It was as if it was all occurring again, in a single moment, right before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Everyone has it within themselves to forgive! I'm sure we can all make peace! You're good people! I believe in you! Nothing is beyond your understanding—not Wadatsumi, or magic!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>And we... Wadatsumi truly didn't know that Alchemy was forbidden!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>So you see? No one has done anything wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Like the illusions I could perform with my magic rites, these visions mingled seamlessly with my reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Our journey's over, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>My family's rotting corpses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>They had been strung up cruelly, left to die horrible, painful deaths. All in the name of retribution for their use of forbidden arts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>They were unrecognizable piles of skin and bone. Black birds circled overhead, eyeing their remains, while flies swarmed them, and maggots writhed on their rancid flesh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Father! Mother! Granny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I took them in my arms, and my ears were filled with a horrible wriggling and buzzing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>No... This can't... Aaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Rejection. Contempt. Prejudice. Betrayal. Panic. Neglect. Ignorance. Abandonment. Blame. Vilification. Anger. Assassins. Lies. Disapproval. Madness. Flies. Corpses. Maggots. Blood. Writhing. Buzzing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I'm sorry for scaring you. I'm sorry for making you suffer. I'm sorry for making you cry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I'm sorry for killing you. I'm sorry for hurting you. I'll kill you properly. I'll do my best to help you die. Please die in peace. Please don't scream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Please, just...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Just...end it. Please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Ikasa! Ikasa! Ikasa! Where have you gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>It's...all my fault. I cursed you. I couldn't save you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Where are you? Where are you, Ikasa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I have too many memories! I'm buried beneath them and I can't find you! I can't see you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Where are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Wh-what's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>The top.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>I will never forget that sight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>World's end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Where I can look down on everything...on the whole wide world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You're supreme ruler of the castle up here, Button.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>"They call me the Obliviated. No matter how many times I die, I always come right back. You get where I'm going with this, right?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>I can search for you here. My memories of you are here, Ikasa.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>I can remember you from here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>When I'm afraid and in pain and I feel like I'm going to die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>When I need you, I can...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Unforgivable savagery!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>She was trying to call a disaster down upon us from the top of that mountain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Down with Wadatsumi, the filthy traitors!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Kill her! Get her! Slit her throat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Umm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Such outrageous folly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Get her! Hunt her down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Wadatsumi's shrine maidens are the root of all evil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Do you think you could...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Justice was—and remains—ours!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>We will bring down the evil shrine maiden. For justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>...shut up for a second?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Bow your heads! Keep your eyes in front!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Aargh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Oh, Ikasa... My memories are so loud.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>The more I kill, the stronger my rites become. Isn't that what you told me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>"When you lose your way, heed the voices of the people."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>Listen to the people. Listen to them scream in the throes of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>"I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Let's all join hands. We'll link all the corpses together and perform a curse of rebirth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>"I train so that I can lead this world into a peaceful future—so that I can create a world in which people can join hands and overcome their differences."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Let's create a world from the corpses of the people who spout justice. Pile them high and flat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Urk!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>That is how we will achieve true peace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>For are we not all one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Ikasa. This time I will be the one who sets out into the rain to find you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>And this time...I will be sure to ask you that question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>"What about me?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Hm? What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>"Don't you have something to say to me?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>When I'm afraid and in pain and I feel like I'm going to die...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Will you please shake my hand?</td>
