<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nngh! Two down...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are you all right, Waginau? You're looking rather ragged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The corruption is...too strong here. I can still fight, thanks to this sword...but I'm...nearly at my limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's not like you to complain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hmph... And what about you? You're drenched in sweat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Heh. You caught me. My vision's been going blurry for a while now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>This is the first time I've wielded my new technique in succession like this. It's far more taxing than I had imagined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'll need to...devise some equipment...to support it...when I...have the chance...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hey! Get up! You can't fall on your sword here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Waginau. I need to...save...my strength. There are still...two...cores...left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>All right. You can count on me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Come to think of it... Adaleigh and Yna have yet to catch up to us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What the hell are they playing at? Wanderers... You can't trust them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Nnrgh! I'm not sure I can hold out much... Arrghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>But that's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Alright! Here I am! All Engineer Soldiers, open fire! Pump these chumps full of lead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Adaleigh... You're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What's wrong with you two, lazing around on the ground there?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'd say that's pretty damn careless of you, but then again, what would I know? I'm just a child, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmph. Don't get cocky.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What have you been doing all this time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You weren't waiting for me to catch up, were you?! This place is swarming with magil, and the controls were going haywire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>They're fine now, though. So you can leave the small fry to me and the Soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's good to hear. Do you have one to spare? I'm...not sure I can walk. I ended up expending far more power than I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah. All right. I've got you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You know, you sure are a strange one. I never know if I can count on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hahah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(I trained harder than any warrior of the Sephira... Or so I thought. I never imagined I would find myself so thoroughly drained.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(If I am to truly make this new technique accessible to anyone and everyone, I'm going to need to find some sort of medium. A mainstay, like Sephiron has been to us...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We should keep going. There are still two cores remaining, but we're halfway there!</td>
