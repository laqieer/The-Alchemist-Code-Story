<td>We'll be in trouble if the witches catch us, so let's sneak over to Eve's house. This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>U-Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Um, Fraise…your armor. Could you try to keep it down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Oh! S-Sorry. There's not much I can do about that--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>…You there! Halt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Uh-oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>*Sigh* May I help you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What do you mean "May I help you?" Why are you bringing outsiders into Lustburg…especially a man?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You, you're a knight of Envylia, aren't you? What business do you have in Lustburg? Hmm...I've seen that face before…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Geez! What difference does it make? It's not like he's breaking the law. He just came here to meet someone!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>He may not have done any harm…yet. However, we put little faith in outsiders--especially men.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>However, if he's a relative of yours... Well, that's a different story.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Uh, yeah! He is! He's my...boyfriend…and, uh…we're going to be family soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>So, we came to say hello! Didn't we, honey? *Wink*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>R-Rachel?! What are you talking about? You know my heart belongs to Eve--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Shh! Just play along!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>!?!?!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…A witch and a knight? Not a bad combination, if you ask me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I agree! He'll be great for experimenting on once he becomes an insect…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(…Keep it together! Don't let them get to you. Not now…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Phew, another full day of training…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>…Huh? Isn't that…Rach? And…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>…WHAT!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>M-My darling Fraise is with Rach!? W-What's going on? Why are they together!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Did little Rach really take my Fraise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>…But wasn't this guy seeing Eve? I guess they broke up, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I guess… I bet he has exquisite genes. I'm sure a student from the School of Magic would be a better fit than Eve anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>…Or he can choose me. I'll show you a great time, sweetcakes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Uh…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Now, just hold on a minute!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Tch…What are you doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That's my line! Don't touch him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(…Rach…cares that much for my Fraise-muffin…?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>What's all the commotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Uh-oh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…You're a student at the School of Magic, aren't you? And an honor student, no less...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Engaging in this kind of activity is a no-no. We'd better inform the headmistress… You'll probably have to be…expelled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Eek…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Hold it right there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Eve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Eve, my sweet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I overheard what just happened…and YOU were the one who tried to solicit Fraise first!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Expulsion DENIED!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Pft…You're more worried about covering for this girl than you are about your man being stolen from you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Er…Rach hasn't done anything wrong! She was just protecting my darling Fraise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…Even if we were romantic rivals…I know that Rach is a really kind person and she's Moa's friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>She loves her mom and…cares a lot about other people. I know she has a good heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's why I gotta take care of her! Rach and Fraise and everybody! I'll defend all of them!</td>
