<td>Embrace the light that guides the world... Rising Sun!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Nnngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The sun rises... Dawn breaks... You've come a long way, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I am only able to embark on this path because of you...and those under my command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So in doing what I wanted, I showed you the way...? Interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Well, sometimes observation leads to unexpected results.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's not like me to be so helpful, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>It is, however, good to do things that go against one's character sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Your duty isn't to face the justice and peace of this world alone...but to walk with the light that envelops you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Our paths may be different, but Cadanova and I are a part of that light. We'll be right there beside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Now, with that, I'll stop lecturing. It's really not my style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Can I return my coat of arms from the 2nd Regiment to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Yes. I'll do everything I can to give you peace of mind, Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I humbly return my coat of arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Captain of the 2nd Regiment, Crimson Dragon, Kaya... You have done well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I swear that what light I glean from my path will shine upon that of the Lord Commander and the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Good luck, Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I'll be waiting for the report on that mural...and on the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I need to learn that truth, as Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>If necessary, the Holy Guard will provide official support. Please, do everything in your power to reach the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I will. I'll use my observations to contribute to the justice of Babel. That is my new duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I'm counting on you, Kaya.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Heheh... He's become so reliable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm not needed here anymore. Wouldn't you agree, Cadanova?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Cursed Beasts...and the humans who stood against them. Could this be why the founders of alchemy...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If this is true... It threatens the entire continent. I must report this to Zain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No. My observations aren't complete yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I've finished researching the Cursed Beasts from every kingdom. I think I'll look into the founders of alchemy next.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I have plenty of time now, after all. I can fumble around in the dark for as long as it takes to uncover the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Previous Captain of the 2nd Regiment... Kaya, the Crimson Dragon... You know too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All manner of incidents are occurring every day across Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That is why it is time that we in the Holy Guard make our presence known. Order and justice will follow us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It is for this purpose that we are reorganizing the ranks. Perhaps one of you will be promoted to Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Never forget that those who gather here embody the justice of Babel. Don't shirk your training. Persist in your beliefs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>We are comrades who fight together to uphold justice. Every battle we fight is for the Holy Guard, and for Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This is the untold record of the days of the Lord Commander's youth, inscribed into a Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The various incidents that were to befall Lord Commander Zain, that lead to him protecting the justice of the continent...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...were to happen a little later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>As for the rumored Door to the Truth... What became of that was known only to a select few.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lady Kaya!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Huh...? Kanon? What's the matter? Surely there is no reason for you to be here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lord Zain told me to give this to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>But this is...a lantern.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So that Kaya, who has chosen to walk alone, doesn't have to fumble blindly in the dark. Also...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>That she may light her path as she goes. That's what he said!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I think I said something like that once...but that wasn't what I meant by it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Giving a lantern to a woman who has started her life anew... Heheh. Zain really doesn't understand women at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Oh, I have one more message!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Oh? Perhaps Zain has changed after all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>He said... "I have no intention of failing to assist you. Should you have need of me, I swear upon my blade that I will hasten to your side."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Hahahah! Same old Zain... He gains full marks for being a knight, even though I'm nothing like Cadanova.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Ah, Zain. You really are a chivalrous fool...and a blockhead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, be that as it may, I have to do my best to support Zain whether he understands us women or not.</td>
</tr>
