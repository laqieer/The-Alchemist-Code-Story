<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Yes! Finished! I win!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Wonderful! Good job, everyone! You have all displayed your powers magnificently!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Tch... What the hell are you on about, lady?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Now I will explain the rules of the race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Oi! Don't ignore me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Everyone will break up into pairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Teamwork is key! You must work together and head straight for the goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Oh, but you're allowed to use whatever you had with you when you were summoned. For example, your motorcycle, Caris.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That means my mech gear is fair game too, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course! You may even customize it however you wish in preparation for the race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What?! That's so unfair! I'm at one hell of a disadvantage!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's perfectly fair! The summoned and their personal effects are as inseparable as their limbs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will deduct Teona Points from you if you continue to complain, Vivi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What, really? How am I supposed to compete against a motorcycle?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Is that weapon in your hand just for show, Vivi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>N-no way! You don't mean...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Fight fair and aim for the goal! These are the only rules!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So what you're saying is that it's fine to destroy anyone who gets in your way! All right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I wonder why the rules are so lax?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>In short, all you need to do is get to the goal first. Are we clear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Plain and simple, just how I like it! I'm going to do my best and become number one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Good answer! You've earned yourself one Teona Point! Now, all that's left is for you to break up into teams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I have already decided those teams based on that little warm-up exercise just now...and my personal preferences!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh, I'd already forgotten about that! It's going to be weird teaming up with someone who isn't Leema. I wonder who it will be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>First up, we've got Caris and Megistos! You coordinated really well with each other!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's because we're both from Slothstein, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Someone with honor would be preferable, but I'll deal, I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Next! Vivi and Ravina! The Magia Gunslinger Pair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>So we're gonna be partners, huh? The name's Vivi. Let's do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh... Y-yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Next up are Dorothea and Reida, the love-struck sweetheart pair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Lovestruck? Such a simple word does not even begin to adequately describe my feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Same! Also, why couldn't I be teamed up with my special someone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, my! Such passion! Use the power of your combined love to propel you forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Moving on... Now this one is a sure thing! Two great men of the sea, Dilga and Gormalas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain Gormalas! This must be fate! Let's fight fair and square together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Don't screw with me! Why do I have to team up with you?! This is ridicul—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Let me see... Who's next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Are you ignoring me again?! You've got some nerve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oh! Daisy, I'm pairing you with Reagan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Really?! With Reagan?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(I can't believe I get to team up with the amazing Reagan! I wonder if I can ask him about mechanical engineering and stuff?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>U-um... Mister...Reagan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hm? Oh, excuse me. I was lost in thought. I was wondering why we're competing in pairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Phantom Soldiers don't fight alone. If you want to get stronger, you're going to need to improve your teamwork.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>And when it comes to training that particular skill, friendship, hard work, challenges, and failure are all part and parcel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Improving your friendship and overcoming hardship is the true beauty of training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This all seems very unscientific.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The race will be held tomorrow morning, so be sure to make use of the time you have in order to deepen your bonds with your partners!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>There will be a prize for the winner, so do your best! Ahem. Allow me to ask one more time...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Do you seek power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll see you all tomorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>She's gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Power. Of course I want power! Oh, the things I could do... Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Looks like we'll get along fabulously! I also want power. Oh, the things I could do... Heheheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Those two are giving me the creeps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Captain Gormalas! How about we deepen our bonds over a drink?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I thought you were a knight. Don't you feel nothin'? You're incredibly thick-skulled, aren't ya?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I have no idea what you mean. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I don't really get what's going on, but it's been a while since I've had fun like this. It's kinda exciting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>We should go get some food to get ourselves pumped up for tomorrow! Got any cravings, Ravina?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Cravings... Maybe brioche? The ones with fruit on them? Lofia said they're really good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Brush... Biosh... What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>They're all so...adaptable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well, it can't be helped. We're all in this now. Besides, I can't stand to lose a race. If I'm in, I'm in it to win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>See you tomorrow, Daisy! I expect a nice, clean race!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Caris seems like a really tough person to beat. The other teams seem to get along well, too... Can I really win this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No! I can't let myself get disheartened! I have to become number one, no matter what, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>U-um... Mister Reagan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Um, I read your book on mechanical engineering and it was really interesting! It taught me a lot, and I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>What operational principle are your actions based on right now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>O-operational...principle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If your intention was simply to begin a conversation with me, then I'm afraid that you have taken far too many unnecessary actions. It was very unpleasant to watch, as a matter of fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Though you seemed to intentionally increase in intensity for the purpose of beginning a conversation. Quite interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>U-um... Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>(I don't understand what he's saying! We'll never get to know each other at this rate!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wh-what should I do? At this rate, I'll never be number one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I thought doing this training would be what I needed to get Leema to accept me again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Leema... She's your Mech War Games partner or something, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's right! Leema is an excellent mechanic! Do you know her?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Only her name. Anyway, what exactly are these Mech War Games?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You know Leema but not the Mech War Games?! That doesn't make any sense! Aren't you from Slothstein?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>The Mech War Games weren't really established as a competition yet when I was alive, and I didn't really pay attention to that kind of thing anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I heard your names for the first time after becoming a phantom. From what I hear, you two are an amazing team.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Eheheh... We do make a pretty good... Wait, no. You're getting me off track! I'm going to explain the Mech War Games to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>The Mech War Games are a tournament in which you attach weapons to mechas and fight with them. These are called mech gear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>People bring their own custom mech gear in order to fight and compete!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>It's a strategy-based sport that tests your intellect and skill! That's how Leema explained it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You see, you can earn points by hitting certain areas of the enemy with both feet raised off the ground for over a minute... Uh... Well, you see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Ugh! Here, just let me show you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>What do you think? My mech gear is pretty cool, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Hm... Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply mechanize your own body?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>However, I admit that I can appreciate how dynamic and appealing the movements of the human body would be when wielding this mech gear. Yes... I think I can understand why the competition grew to be so popular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Yay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>(Am I really bonding with Reagan right now?! I knew we'd get to know each other eventually! Thank you so much, Teona!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Hmm... If we consider your habits when in motion, then perhaps a slight adjustment here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Wh-what the—?! Whoa! Cool! It's so light!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I figured out how it was put together, so I took the liberty of having myself a little tinker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>You figured it out already?! You're amazing, Mister Reagan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Oh, but... If you don't mind, I'd really prefer not to alter this mech gear Leema made too much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>All I did was tweak it to compliment your motions. It's very well made, so there was little more for me to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Heheh! Leema's mecha gear is the best in the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>For now, though, you should at least practice with it, to get yourself used to how it handles after the adjustment. Besides, I'd like to see how a Mech War Games combatant fights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Well, then, why don't we clear out that area over there, and then get ready for tomorrow?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>I'd like to know what it is that you may be lacking. I'd hate for a fine piece of engineering to go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Do you think I...might not be good enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Not necessarily. A mechanic skilled enough to make mech gear like this chose you as her partner, after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Yeah! Yeah, you're right! Okay, here I go!</td>
</tr>
