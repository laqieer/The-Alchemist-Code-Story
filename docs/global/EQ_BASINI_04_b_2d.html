<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Believe me, this hurts, but a little pain isn't going to stop me.</td>

<td>Your 'resolve' brings only chaos. What good do you think it can do?</td>

<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It can save this world.</td>

<td>...You are deluded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The power of resolve has saved the world before. I've seen it with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I have no more doubts. My friends trusted me to carry on their work, so I can't let anyone stand in my wayâ€”not even you.</td>

<td>Why would Excalibur answer someone who wields the power of darkness?</td>

<td>Now that I seek to realize the resolve my friends left behind, my own resolve is pure.</td>

<td>Once upon a time, someone told me that my past didn't matter; that they had faith in the man I could become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I will endure any disgrace to honor that trust. That is the truth of my resolve.</td>

<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Come after me if you want, but I won't go down quietly. I'll run to the ends of the earth if I have to.</td>

<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You truly have changed, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I have. And all it took was for someone to have faith in me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>What makes you think I can change so easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>

<td>Until next time, then.</td>

<td>Basheeny... What has changed you so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Resolve, you said. Perhaps I too...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I strove to eliminate resolve because I thought it brought only chaos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But you chose your own path and Excalibur answered. Does that mean it approves of your resolve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I failed my mission... It feels almost like fate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I want to defend order. That's all I have ever wanted. All I will ever want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I know, Carlotta. You aren't ready to give up either, are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I have to speak with Basheeny one last time.</td>
