<td>What is it? Is there something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I'm surprised you followed me this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You were the one who told me to. As the Successor of the Sun, I am willing to endure hardship to obtain that which I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Right. Got it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Have no fear! I will fight off any danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Rest assured, as your client, I have every intention of riding along with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>(...Seriously. I didn't actually think he'd tag along.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Amazing! You've truly lived up to my expectations! I am shocked that you managed to procure this amount of fine art during this time period!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I went way over and beyond. This as far as it goes. If you're satisfied, then hurry on back home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! This is just a portion of the items I've listed up! Here's the next list!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>...!</td>

<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>About the money, I'm willing to pay double from now! Thanks to you lot, my collection is growing increasingly complete. I am grateful, Ryle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You seem to have misunderstood something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You rich folk are always like that. You think that you can procure anything with money. I hate people that are like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What are you talking about?! I am paying a price that is more than generous. You have no right to say that about me! I'm your customer! Your client!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Money isn't always the solution to everything.</td>

<tr>

<td>The fact of the matter is, in order to fulfill your unreasonable requests, my men are placing themselves in considerable danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Would you be willing to risk your own life in order to get these items that you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My point exactly. Our business with each other ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hmph. Is that what this is all about? Of course I'd be willing to risk my own life in order to obtain what I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>My name is Ramses. I am the Successor of the Sun. No living soul will stand in my way!</td>

<tr>

<td>(I'm sure he'll go running at the first sign of trouble.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>The guard I sent out as a scout should be returning soon. If there are any goblins, we may consider turning back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Why?! We've come this far!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Do you really plan to put your life on the line? You know as well as I do that nothing is worth that price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Lord Ryle, there is a goblin's nest up ahead. It would be wise to turn back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I see. Soldiers, let's head back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Wait! We cannot retreat now. We continue onward.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You heard what he just said, didn't you? There's a goblin's nest up ahead. That's a clear and present danger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I am well aware of the danger. All of you, stand back. I will wipe out the goblins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We just need to fall back. There's no need to push yourself like that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Of course there is. There is no better reason than my desire to obtain what I want!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(This guy...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No matter what threat may lie ahead, I will eliminate it! After all, all that is worth obtaining must come at a price!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Prepare yourselves, goblins! My life is not so cheap as to be wasted on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...!</td>
