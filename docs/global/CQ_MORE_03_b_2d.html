<td>Phew... I'm glad we took care of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>…Moa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My dad must have become as hideous as those creatures…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That's why mom couldn't be with him anymore, even though she loved him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Moa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's why my mom hated me. I was the reason the person she loved became an insect…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>That's why mom said she wished I had never been born…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If I made her feel that way, then I'd rather never have been born either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No. Don't say that. EVER!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know exactly how your home life was…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But your parents loved each other enough to have you. You were WANTED.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>When you meet the person you love, you go through stages of romance, fighting, making up and deepening your bond.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Even if their love was doomed, they wanted to create a legacy…and that's why you're here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Loving one another, they managed to survive long enough to have you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Your parents chose that path…as do many people in this country-- Even my parents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…You know, there was a time I didn't know how to cope with it either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Uh-huh. When I learned that lovers were doomed to become insects, I felt so depressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I even cried alone…thinking happiness will never find a way to our land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You looked like I did back then, so I thought I had to do something to help you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>For me, training helps drive away all those negative thoughts... I wanted you to experience that, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eve…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm sure even you don't want the person you love turning into an insect, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Moa…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If that ever happened… Even you would probably start to hate your children, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You'll probably end up miserable…and yet… Why do you still--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>…Of course, there are people who can't cope with the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>…But the moment you fall in love--it's the happiest time in your life. Anybody would agree!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>At least, that's what my mom always says.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even my mom had a difficult time coming to terms with my dad's curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>But it didn't matter. They wanted to have me no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>The reason I'm here is because of my parents' love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That always cheers me up. That's why you should think that way too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>…But you're right. I'd hate it if Fraise were to become an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>So, I've got to keep training!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I thought I already told you! I've got to train to be a happy bride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm looking for a way to break the curse.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Is that why you don't want to commit to any organization…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Exactly. If I'm a free agent, I can find a way to break the curse on my own terms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'll overcome all obstacles in my way to break that curse. But in order to do that, I need more strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There's nothing I won't do in order to marry Fraise and build a happy family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So, I train. Day in and day out! That's why I call it bridal training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…Isn't it a tad too sports-oriented?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I mean, can you really break a curse with strength alone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You don't think it'll work?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's not that…it's just the thought never occurred to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But if anybody can use their muscles to break the curse, I'm sure it's you, Eve!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I guess that's what you mean by taking care of it on your terms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's not just me, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Everyone in this country who has someone they care about is fighting the curse in their own way... To build a brighter future for our children--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>…I wonder if my mom fought against the curse, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>She must have had me knowing that dad would turn into an insect…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I wonder if she had hoped to build a happy family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>…I'm sure she did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We're all fighting this thing…That's how Lustburg is still here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>…Yeah. You're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>(…Then I want to prove it.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>(I want to prove that we can beat this curse and build happy families across the land!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Eve, starting tomorrow, I want to do the same training course that you do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No way!? What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Are you a bridal trainee now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>No…not a bridal trainee, a Cupid trainee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I want to bring lots of people together and fill Lustburg with happy families!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I'll take down the curse with brute force and restore happiness to our people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>(If I succeed, then maybe I'll find the reason I was born…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>There's nothing I can't do in order to achieve my goal!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I'll overcome even the harshest training! Just wait and see!</td>
</tr>
