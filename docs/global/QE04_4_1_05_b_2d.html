<td>No way...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It is as we feared. Saga has suffered widespread damage. Come, lowering your heads will change nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yes, Voda.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>We need to do something about the dragon soon if we want to prevent any more needless deaths! Tehre, you say you have a plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I do, but it will take everyone here, as well as Rega who is on lookout, for us to succeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then, tell us this plan of yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, what a surprise. I thought you were about to admonish me for collaborating with Asena's murderer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm restraining myself right now...ã€€But, just so you know, had Alia been here, he wouldn't have hesitated to lend you a hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If Alia were here, we wouldn't be in this situation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Would you boys stop already? Discussing Alia gives rise to unnecessary emotions, and we don't have time for that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, all we have to do is destroy the core, which can't be achieved unless the dragon's moving, yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Another plan will need to be set in motion first. Besides, we will never be able to cut our way into the dragon's body with its scales hardened like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Another plan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes. Can you guess what I'm about to say, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Who? Me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Indeed. Tell me your thoughts. My next course of action may change depending on what you say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well... I think we need to come up with a plan B in case we can't destroy the core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What do you mean by that, Mocca?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There's no guarantee that we'll reach the core or that the dragon will fall, even if we destroy it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We also have no assurances that the green glow corresponds to the core, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's why, having considered all of this, you decided to retreat here to formulate a backup plan. Only one of the Great Sprites could have come to this conclusion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Am I correct, Tehre?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Well, well, well... Impressive. You've come to the same conclusion as I. It seems I can trust you with the other half of my plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>And what does that entail exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We separate into two groups, and work toward accomplishing two different objectives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You want us to split up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Yes. Allow me to brief you on the specifics.</td>
</tr>
