<td>They're too much for us. We need to fall back!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Curses! They're getting away!</td>

<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>These ruins are in a terrible state, but there is a well-worn path here leading deeper in. I think that's where they were headed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I don't sense any minotaurs. Nor is there any sign of the ne'er-do-wells from earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But there are some beasts down here, along with something very similar to a golem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Forget about them. We have bigger fish to fry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And we need to be ready. Those guys'll be particularly dangerous when cornered, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Mwahaha! You've done well to survive this long. You'll make great material for our Philosopher's Stones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Rrrg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Don't you dare lay a hand on them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Not so fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Curse you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Raaaaagh!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Bell, you—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Sorry, sorry! But the children should be okay now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Th-that's not what I was going to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>This is just the kind of person Bell is. He always dives in head-first when there's somebody to rescue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That side of him definitely makes me worry sometimes, but Bell wouldn't be Bell any other way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>These seem to be the only children down here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ais? You already went and searched the whole area?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Wow! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Also, I believe the minotaur went through here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Deeper in the ruins, huh? Where they had their base set up earlier, I guess. It's probably crawling with demons, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>So this is where we make our stand, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Seems like it. Let's go get this mess cleaned up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'll help get these kids somewhere safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Good idea. While you're doing that, then, we'll—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No. I'll do this first, then we go. We fight together, Bell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Ila...! All right. We'll wait for you.</td>
