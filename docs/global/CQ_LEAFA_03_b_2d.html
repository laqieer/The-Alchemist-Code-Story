<td>What the heck are you all doing--wasting this important opportunity!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This meeting is necessary for the future of both countries…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Humph… It was a fantasy to ever think we could share responsibility over the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wha--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's better we take what we can get and be on our way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What he said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…Regardless of what you say, both countries have already decided on joint custody of the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If you're saying you want to nuke that joint resolution…then your actions are a serious crime against both countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Ha...Big talk from the likes of a puppet general.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You've ensnared Greed Dike all while buttering up to Wadatsumi…You're nothing but a traitor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Me? A traitor?...I adore Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's why I look squarely at our past mistakes and try my best to achieve a bright future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It is you who are the traitors--trying to trip up those who wish for a better future for their homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Cry all you want. Who's going to follow a puppet child general?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Child general? I just have a baby face!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Humph. Whatever. The Mikaboshi will be ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>…As luck would have it, I hear Yomi's not doing so well as the Mikaboshi's guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>…Even if she's not at full health, she isn't so frail to lose to the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>My men are dealing with your splinter cell as we speak. It's only a matter a time before they're captured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Leafah is right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Basheeny!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I was about to arrest them but they disappeared. Where could they have run off to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Listen, I got some intel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Intel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>From Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What? Y-Yomi! What did she say? Is she alright? Please tell me she's alright!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just calm down. She's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>A short time ago we encountered a group thought to be the extremists. Working in tandem with our mole in the splinter cell, we were able suppress and arrest them. They are currently in transit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi has already been transferred to a new location and under heavy protections. Too bad, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oof…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I'd like for you to explain your little coup d'état attempt on the Mikaboshi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The Mikaboshi is safe! Looks like my men did a great job!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What a relief… And Yomi's is also safe… Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Spies? Reinforcements? Already arrested? What's the meaning of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I thought my orders were only to follow the extremists…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Why don't you hear directly from your subordinates?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Allow me to explain, General.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>After we heard about the plot to steal the Mikaboshi, we immediately joined forces with Lady Yomi to suppress and capture the enemy unit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Congratulations on your accomplishment! You deserve a great deal of credit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>How did you hear about the thieves?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>…We sent in a mole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Wha--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The other side was willing to do anything to gain power, so they simply exploited that weakness. Incidentally, I was the one who suggested the idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You acted on your own authority, without reporting to your superiors…normally that would be grounds for punishment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We're very sorry, ma'am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…Nevertheless, you did a fine job… Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>General…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Honestly, my soldiers wouldn't have been able to achieve the same results without your help. I offer my sincerest thanks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…You guys are really something! The Lord Commander directly praised you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You don't have to call me that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Well, even though we arrested them, it doesn't mean it's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>That's right. Will you continue to extract information from them for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes, ma'am! We'll get right on that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Now at least one issue has been resolved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Still…I'm surprised and heartened to think that they went to such lengths for Wadatsumi…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I'm not surprised at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>…I guess this is the part you tell me I need to look around more?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nah… But you should probably appreciate the influence you have on those around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I-I understand! I understand my lack of power as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>That's not what I mean…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It's the opposite, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You should be aware that the people around you can change because of your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>My…actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Actions are an expression of will. Sometimes they have the power to change people--even in unintended ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>If you act in accordance with your will, those around you are bound to be affected to some degree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>And that if that results in them helping you down the line…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Then you'll be able to handle things you were able to handle on your own. And the future will become that much brighter…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It would do you good to have more faith in other people's potential.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>My will can change…others? I never thought--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Pardon me, but…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Oh! I remember you from earlier…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I heard you and your men arrested the Greed Dike extremists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I came to propose we resume our meeting, provided the obstructionists have been removed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>R-Really!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Our wounds are still fresh and it won't be easy to trust the people who devastated our country. But you are very honorable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>If someone like you is around, I feel like we can be more open to compromise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>…! Thank you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>…Who would've thought a greenhorn like me would be able to sway the minds of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>As long as your actions merit such a change--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Right! I'll do my best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That's the spirit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>(…Greed Dike will be fine from now on. I'm sure.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>(…Kanon…it seems there's someone as straightforward as you in this world)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Now, about the meeting…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>If I do my best and if I can influence those around me…then I'm sure we can change for the better!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You said it! I feel the same! Let's both do our best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I know Greed Dike is in good hands, Leafah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>That's right! Leave it to me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>As a citizen of Greed Dike and as its general, it is my duty and pride to strive for this nation!</td>
</tr>
