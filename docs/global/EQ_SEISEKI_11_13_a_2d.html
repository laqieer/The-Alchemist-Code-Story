<td>Reimei!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Those who are dear to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>

<td>M-me?!</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Remember, Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! Oh no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What an aura...! Everybody, be careful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You have interfered with my plans for the last time! I'll wipe you all out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Wha—aaaaaahh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>H-huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Kanon! Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Impossible! Just the two of them stopped my attack?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>C-Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Don't linger on this. We will resume our own fight after we get rid of this fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Tch! I take it you still haven't changed your ways.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>A temporary alliance? Starting to get desperate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Still, are the two of you really prepared to face me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It's unbelievable how much strength he has left. I'll engage him directly. Cover me and don't run away, got it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>As if! I'll be the one to take him out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A former captain of the Holy Guard and its current Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I wouldn't say you two are weak, but I do find you wanting for a little...something more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Everybody, get down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You're too late. Plasma Burst!!!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Agh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-whoa! What is going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>K-keep your head down!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Tch! Its impact was reduced. It was wise of you to attack rather than dodge. This skill could have wiped out this entire country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Urgh! His...power... So overwhelming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>So this is the power that transcends dimensions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Come on, I'm still holding back. Is this really all you've got? I was hoping you'd be able to entertain me a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>One's true worth is measured at the twilight of their life. The next three minutes will reveal to me all that you have managed to gain in your lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Three minutes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>I'm saying you'll all be dead in three minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>That is, if you even last that long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Feel free to attack me anytime. I will vanquish the symbol of this world's justice to usher in the new era!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>You have a lot of bark, but do you have the bite to back it up? I'll make you regret those words!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Prepare yourself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Magic Spear Flash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>That is a flashy move, indeed. I do commend your spirit, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>He's...gone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I've seen that move already. Can't you do anything else? You should fight more intelligently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Kudan! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You're too slow. Even three minutes was impossible for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Spear Shockwave!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>What the—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>You lured me here on purpose?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Due to your overwhelming strength, you have turned away from using tactics. You are the one who should remember how to fight intelligently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Trinity Slash!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>A trap?! Bang!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Tch! I never expected coordinated attacks like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I warned you to fight intelligently. I thought it was obvious which of us would play decoy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>You wanted to be entertained? Then so be it! Bloody Strike!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Gah—aaaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Whoa! They did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Haa... Haa... You've made a lot of bold statements, but I am the one who will usher in a new era.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Just kidding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Wh-what?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You will usher in a new era? Don't make me laugh! You have less than a minute left to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>No... How?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>...Bang.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Don't tell me you're finished already.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>I have been incredibly merciful. Just consider all the time I've given you to repent. You're reducing all of my kindness to naught.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Urgh! Y-you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>He's too strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Oh well, I already knew none of you would give me any sort of challenge. Maybe nobody in this world can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Or...perhaps Orion would be somewhat threatening if he gained the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Then why are you wasting your time fighting us instead of Orion?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>He could be resurrecting Nimul as we speak!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>That's exactly what I want him to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Why would I want to stop him? It's a chance to see a legend with my own two eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>It will be the most exciting thing I will ever witness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Exciting?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Wouldn't you all like to see for yourselves a power that can wreak havoc upon this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>I would lose an opportunity to see what that power is capable of if I interrupt. Why would I ruin this for myself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>You...plan on fighting against the Alchemy Source?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Fight against it? No. I intend to annihilate it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Yes... Yes! The thought alone gives me chills! A chance to completely annihilate that fully resurrected legendary power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>H-he's...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Crazy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>It's been three minutes. Pity, you lot really couldn't accomplish anything. What a waste of my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>What do you plan to do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Usher in a new era. What else?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Right after I crush the justice of this world. Bear witness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>He's coming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>He's going to destroy this country along with us! Huzzaaaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>You're too slow. Omega Pulse!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>Aghh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Gaaaaah!</td>
