<td>Well done, Captain Vettel. You were truly an unstoppable force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm relived that my worries were groundless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I am the one who is relieved to have such dependable allies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>My apologies, Captain Vettel, but you seem to have an insect on your shoulder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Excuse me. I seem to have squished it. What a useless death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>E-eek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh? Captain Vettel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Pl-please, take this clothes off of me! No, wait, not here. Someone might see!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That's why I didn't want to fight in a place like this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What is the matter...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I...I absolutely and truly hate bugs!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Have you calmed down now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>My apologies for showing such an embarrassing side of me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Yes, the things is I truly dislike insects. It's to the point that I don't even like to look at them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>That's why, when the large bee was flying around inside the castle village...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Or when the children gave me a bug-shaped charm...I ran away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ah, I understand now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I was okay when I was a child, but somehow...no, when I saw them in a nightmare...I found myself unable to stand them anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I think it's the numerous legs and unreadable eyes that I can't stand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Hmm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Laugh, Dilga. The so-called brave hero has such an embarrassing weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No, I won't laugh. Everyone has weaknesses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As for me, I can't stand sweets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Dilga...is that one of those things where you say something you like in order to have people tempt you with it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Gwahahaha! In any case, it's nothing for you to worry over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>More importantly, the job of a warrior is to polish oneself is that we are prepared to face any adversary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You said so yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Whether we are surrounded by insects or fed sweets, we must remain calm and exert our full power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You're right. It's dangerous to have my weakness so easily read like this. I still lack enough training.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Exactly! Would you like to join my dojo in order to train both your body and soul?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Sounds good! Thanks! Let's work on fixing this together!</td>
