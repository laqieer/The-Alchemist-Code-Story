<td>Tch. This is a lot to ask of just two measly humans, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You never struck me as a quitter, Edgar. Suck it up, and let's make that opening!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Haaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Was that enough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yep. Amane's up now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ready. Logi, on my mark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What is your plan here? I can't piece it together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>We're going to get Azami to help us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This sword was once Azami's. So her thoughts and feelings still reside within it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Which means I can reach out to her, and we'll have a Kagomurasaki at our disposal after all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You...can do that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Even if I couldn't, I'd find a way to make it happen anyway. We have to believe! Our thoughts and feelings need to reach her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Get ready, Logi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Understood. I'll do my best to get through.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>All my thoughts and feelings, unto this technique, with intent not to kill but to save...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Kagutsuchi Kiraboshi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Uggrraaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Azami, lend me your power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Whew, I'm full.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>We'll be fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>We won't go down. Not yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>At least not until we've fulfilled our oaths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>To vanquish all demons who bring pain and suffering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>To bring about blissful days of joy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Wadatsumi's future... Our future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>With our blades...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Wake up, Tamba! Haaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Tamba!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Amane! Hey!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Tamba? Are you all right? Your face tells me you might just be back to normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Why...aren't you killing me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Because there's no need to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Don't you realize I'm planning to destroy you all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I know that isn't what you really want. You want to make peace with humanity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No. You're wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Then did you lie when you swore to defend young Mikaboshi and Sumeragi? When you told them you'd protect them, even at the cost of your own life?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I spoke out of turn. My thoughts were muddled. I'd already committed a grave sin by that time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Is that enough reason to confine yourself to the horrors of the past? Are you just going to blame yourself forever and continue to deny yourself what you truly want as punishment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Agatha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>It must've been painful. So, so painful. But it doesn't need to continue like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You don't have to suffer anymore. All these people here are trying to reach you. They're offering you a hand to grant you salvation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>After what I've done, I don't have the right to take that hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The difference between our two species is so trivial. If a mistake is all you're worried about, you can take all the time you need to atone for it. You have that right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Every living thing does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Why are you saying all of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Because you looked so troubled when you were fighting. I think anyone who stared into your eyes would've been just as inclined to lend a helping hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I don't deserve your sympathy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>You could very well not. I don't know your circumstances. But I've had people tell me I should've been killed...and then later reach out to help me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>That's the whole reason I'm still alive today: because I was given a second chance. Which is why I'm reaching out to you now. And I don't intend to pull that hand away, no matter how many times you swat at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It all comes down to what you want to do. So, what is it you want to do, Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>There are people here who wish for your happiness. How will you respond to those wishes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If you're not going to answer, then how about I connect you to the person you want to see most of all, instead?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Amane...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Just for a moment, I know. I'm afraid I no longer have the energy to let you savor this reunion for very long.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>But the Spirit Stone Mikaboshi was forged from a demon's horn as well. Care to take a guess whose it was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>...It's okay. You'll find out soon enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Hey, Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Kaede!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What is it you actually want to do? I'm dying to know, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...You don't hate me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Of course not. I have a few regrets, and some unfinished business I wish I could've attended to before my passing. But ultimately, that's it. I managed to live every day to the fullest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The ideals that Koga and I dreamed of were passed down to Mikaboshi and Sumeragi, and somehow or another, they've managed to continue passing them down through the ages themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That's all the legacy I could ever ask for. There's no room in my heart for hatred.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But, I... I have to atone, somehow. I just... I don't know how...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Somewhere deep in your own heart, I think you do. You've always been a good person, when it comes right down to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Just do what your heart tells you. Don't be bound to anyone else's will. Don't get taken advantage of. That's all I've ever wished for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Huff...huff... Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I've lost. I accept my defeat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Heh. I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I will return this body to its original owner. Though that's about all I can do, I'm afraid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I wonder whether you'll be able to pursue Kaede's ideals to the very end. I'll be watching, to find out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Will you be okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>I should be. Though there is one last thing I'd like to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>...I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Looks like we managed to save him after all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>We sure did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Is it over, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>It is. Agatha, could you take care of healing everyone's wounds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>The foes we need to worry about now are the Discarnate Power and Judius. But we'll have to rebuild our forces before we can take them on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>And before even that...I should take a rest myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Just hang in there a little longer, Amane. I know you're tired after everything you've done, but we'll need to find you a safe spot for that rest first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I've been waiting for this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>This body will make a fine vessel for the Demon King. I shall gladly take it as my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>The Discarnate Power! No!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Gah! It's no good!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Now there are none left to oppose me! Everyone will bend to my will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Discarnate Power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>All of you! All of Greed Dike! All of you will bend the knee! And we'll start by making Wadatsumi into a land for demons, and demons alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Stop!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>You? Why?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...! You!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hey. Apologies for keeping you waiting. Waiting for much, much too long...</td>
