<td>You can always overcome the gap in immanent power between species through wisdom and cleverness. Humans have conquered beasts far superior to themselves time and again.</td>

<td>Never stop thinking! All beings, no matter how seemingly omnipotent they may be, have a weakness that can be exploited.</td>

<td>I guess now that you mention it, the dragon who took them did seem weirdly careful not to harm them any more than he had to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>(Curious. From what the others were saying, I'd assumed their intent was to kill Lil, at any cost.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zafeiris</td>
<td>(If so, then why would they abduct her rather than simply eliminating her?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Claybelle</td>
<td>They may be dragons, but they're of low standing. Traversing among the Stratums alone should be a pretty strenuous and time-consuming task for them.</td>
