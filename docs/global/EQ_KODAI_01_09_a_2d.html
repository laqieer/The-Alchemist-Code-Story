<td>002</td>
<td>Lil, no! They're busy right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Let's stay hidden in the mansion, okay? Come here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmmmmm? But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No buts! We'll only get in their way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>...! Lil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ah! Sia—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Target sighted. It's the child Ouroboros.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Sia? No... You're bleeding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Shall we eliminate her here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, this is still a part of the Primordial Serpent. A haphazard attack would only provoke the Shell to strike at us with that light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Sia?! Get up! Umm, ummmm... Th-the blood! I need to stop the bleeding! Aaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-stop it! Don't hurt Sia! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If you don't wish to see her injured or killed, Serpent of the End, then choose your next move wisely. Come with us, and—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>What in blazes do you think you're doing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Curses! If we don't...eliminate the...Shell of the World, then...there is no...future...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Well, they're clearly not about to back down. They're willing to die to stop you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>The Genesis Altar... A testament to our sinful misdeeds. If memory serves, it can be found in the Pride Layer. That would be Ophioneus' territory, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>If you're really determined to go there, you'd best be prepared to march over the bodies of countless former comrades along the way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Shh! Listen. Behind the mansion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No! Noooo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Quence! What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>They snuck in from behind! They took Lil and Ambrosia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Ambrosia, too?! Where did they take them?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Is this...blood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I... I couldn't do a thing. Nothing! Not even my most powerful magic could protect them! What good am I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I mean, I knew that humans and dragons were on a different level in terms of power, but I had no idea the difference was so...profound! What was I thinking?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Lift your head up, fool. Don't beat yourself up over a single failure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Claybelle...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can always overcome the gap in immanent power between species through wisdom and cleverness. Humans have conquered beasts far superior to themselves time and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Never stop thinking! All beings, no matter how seemingly omnipotent they may be, have a weakness that can be exploited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Analyze, understand, and adapt. The repetition of these steps is what makes magic so potent. I've taught you this before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...You're right. I'm sorry, Claybelle. It was a moment of weakness on my part.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's not like me to accept defeat so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Blood was spilled here, but not much. Have the two of them merely been abducted, then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I guess now that you mention it, the dragon who took them did seem weirdly careful not to harm them any more than he had to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>(Curious. From what the others were saying, I'd assumed their intent was to kill Lil, at any cost.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(If so, then why would they abduct her rather than simply eliminating her?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>They may be dragons, but they're of low standing. Traversing among the Stratums alone should be a pretty strenuous and time-consuming task for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The Genesis Altar... A testament to our sinful misdeeds. If memory serves, it can be found in the Pride Layer. That would be Ophioneus' territory, unfortunately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Claybelle? Such magil... Be careful not to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I know what I'm doing. There! I've detected traces of their magil!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Claybelle, let me come with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>With those wounds? Not a chance. You just stay here and rest. Don't make me any more worried than I already am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>O-okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Let's go, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Right.</td>
