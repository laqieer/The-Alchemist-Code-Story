<td>We definitely didn't have to worry about that with the Cursed Beasts, at least!</td>

<td>An unfortunate consequence of focusing too much energy on fighting opponents so much larger than yourself.</td>

<td>Taking a life doesn't require flashy techniques, nor even any great amount of strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>You simply need to change your tactics based on the strengths of your opponent. If you can't even grasp such simple strategy, can you truly call yourselves Sephira?</td>

<td>Nng... What...?</td>

<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>This is the end of the line, descendant of the Sephira.</td>

<td>Oh, for the love of... How many little surprise extras are going to show up here?!</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Hello, Child of God. I expect you're not particularly happy to see me after everything that's transpired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>But I urge you to think of all that as water under the bridge. Just consider me another one of your shields. I am at your disposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Understood. Thank you, Ignacio. Can you use your gun to cover me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I really can't stand these two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesarthim</td>
<td>Hmm? A gun that can throw magil into disorder? That's rather concerning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Any normal person would at least be comatose as soon as they were hit with one of my bullets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>The two of them were raised from the dead by Ouroboros and given physical forms created with magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>They don't die like normal people. They can only be stopped by overwhelming them with the most powerful attacks possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Or maybe if we cut off their limbs so they can't do anything anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>That's...another option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>(Gruesome, but...should we try it?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>(No. The time isn't right for that. It's possible that Ouroboros is still watching.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>(We're going to have to stick with surprise attacks.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I have a proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>We should retreat. The odds, as things stand, are not in your favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Your greatest strength is your mind. You learn about your enemy, test your hypotheses, and then rinse and repeat until you get the result you desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>That's how you defeated all the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>At least, that seems to be the case, as best as I'm able to judge. And it's worked out well for you so far. But I think you may have reached the limits of that particular stratagem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Retreating now would just expose our backs to a dangerous enemy, though, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>I told you. You can use me as your shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>You're saying... You'll stay behind and keep them busy for us? By yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Are you concerned for my well-being? On that front, let me assure you, I will not be alone. In fact, I've recently run into an old man who was simply dying to volunteer as tribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Hey! Who're you calling old?! And stealing my spotlight... I was gonna jump in and generously offer to give you the opening you need to get outta here, but nooo, this joker had to go and beat me to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_mela.png" alt="Mira" height="128"><br>Mira</td>
<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You all should know what we're capable of. Snakes like us won't die so easily. We'll buy you enough time to clear out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>But...with the magil as it is, Space-Time Manipulation is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Remember, unlike you two, I can also use magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/st_niku.png" alt="Nyx" height="128"><br>Nyx</td>
<td>...That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>While you're on your way out, you should pick up my boss. She's outside healing your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I'm guessing you'll want her with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Your boss? Shahel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Uh, no? Your sister, man! Just get the heck out of here, all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/nimuru.png" alt="Nimul" height="128"><br>Nimul</td>
<td>Oh! A-all right. I hope I'll see you again soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>How unwise. You think the two of you will be able to keep us occupied here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Two? Where'd you pull that number out of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Quence, what are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>You'd better get going, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ignacio</td>
<td>Quence, answer me! What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>As one last favor to my former boss, you know? Geez, I'm such a bleeding heart sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>Your chances of survival just went down drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Eh. Wasn't planning to make it out of here alive in the first place, so that's fine. Anyway, I've still got this jerk with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Yes, this "jerk" still has his responsibilities to the garden he's spent all these ages tending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>In any case, if we're at this stage of things, I am the most suitable person to stand on this battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesarthim</td>
<td>Shahel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Long time no see. The lid's been lifted from the hell pot, and the steam has wafted your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matia</td>
<td>The two of you are no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>But we can buy a little time. We might just be mere pests buzzing around you, but we shan't be so easily swatted down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mesarthim</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Nothing to say in response? It's almost like you don't like me or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Of course they don't. I'm betting when they were alive, you made sure to be as big a nuisance as you could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Hahaha! You are not mistaken in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>Hmph. Honestly, a dragon slayer and a shield maiden? I'm too old to be dealing with this crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quence</td>
<td>I think I'm actually jealous of you, ex-boss. Even if you die, you'll just come back again, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>Ha! Let me fill you in on a little secret, Quence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/shah.png" alt="Shahel" height="128"><br>Shahel</td>
<td>This body of mine...will be my last. I used all my remaining resources to make my children.</td>
