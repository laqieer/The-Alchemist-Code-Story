<td>We've dealt with the biggest fish! Now all that's left is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You shouldn't get too excited. It leaves you vulnerable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Not if I have anything to say about it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>No way! Did you just see that?! She cut through magic! Magic! That's so unfair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Not only that, but she's a bit too small to effectively target.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>We definitely didn't have to worry about that with the Cursed Beasts, at least!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>An unfortunate consequence of focusing too much energy on fighting opponents so much larger than yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You've become far too used to your opponents being giants!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I wonder how many of you have ever actually killed a person before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Taking a life doesn't require flashy techniques, nor even any great amount of strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You simply need to change your tactics based on the strengths of your opponent. If you can't even grasp such simple strategy, can you truly call yourselves Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't appreciate you implying that my people are savages!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>How's this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Well, well! You pick things up fast. But you don't have the guts to kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Then we'll just keep on fighting you until you stop fighting back! Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, dear. Have you all forgotten about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Urk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I didn't ask for your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Don't say that! This isn't about you, anyway. I just felt inclined to jump back into the fray.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Daphne!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This won't work either?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Don't get carried away. Your human body may lose its ability to sustain itself if you overdo it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Quite an inconvenient power this is, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You. Do you plan to use that technique again?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Not that it matters. Time for you to fall!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Gn..rk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Waginau!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're putting up a better fight now than you did when we were on top of that tower.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>However, it's still nowhere near enough to defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Nng... What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>This is the end of the line, descendant of the Sephira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I don't think so. In fact, I find that idea quite disagreeable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh, for the love of... How many little surprise extras are going to show up here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ignacio...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hello, Child of God. I expect you're not particularly happy to see me after everything that's transpired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But I urge you to think of all that as water under the bridge. Just consider me another one of your shields. I am at your disposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Understood. Thank you, Ignacio. Can you use your gun to cover me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I really can't stand these two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Hmm? A gun that can throw magil into disorder? That's rather concerning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Any normal person would at least be comatose as soon as they were hit with one of my bullets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The two of them were raised from the dead by Ouroboros and given physical forms created with magil.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>They don't die like normal people. They can only be stopped by overwhelming them with the most powerful attacks possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Or maybe if we cut off their limbs so they can't do anything anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>That's...another option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>(Gruesome, but...should we try it?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>(No. The time isn't right for that. It's possible that Ouroboros is still watching.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(We're going to have to stick with surprise attacks.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I have a proposal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>We should retreat. The odds, as things stand, are not in your favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Your greatest strength is your mind. You learn about your enemy, test your hypotheses, and then rinse and repeat until you get the result you desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>That's how you defeated all the Cursed Beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>At least, that seems to be the case, as best as I'm able to judge. And it's worked out well for you so far. But I think you may have reached the limits of that particular stratagem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Retreating now would just expose our backs to a dangerous enemy, though, wouldn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I told you. You can use me as your shield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You're saying... You'll stay behind and keep them busy for us? By yourself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Are you concerned for my well-being? On that front, let me assure you, I will not be alone. In fact, I've recently run into an old man who was simply dying to volunteer as tribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hey! Who're you calling old?! And stealing my spotlight... I was gonna jump in and generously offer to give you the opening you need to get outta here, but nooo, this joker had to go and beat me to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Quence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Tch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>You all should know what we're capable of. Snakes like us won't die so easily. We'll buy you enough time to clear out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>But...with the magil as it is, Space-Time Manipulation is—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Remember, unlike you two, I can also use magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...That's true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>While you're on your way out, you should pick up my boss. She's outside healing your friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm guessing you'll want her with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Your boss? Shahel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Uh, no? Your sister, man! Just get the heck out of here, all right?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Oh! A-all right. I hope I'll see you again soon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>How unwise. You think the two of you will be able to keep us occupied here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Two? Where'd you pull that number out of?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Quence, what are you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You'd better get going, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Quence, answer me! What—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>As one last favor to my former boss, you know? Geez, I'm such a bleeding heart sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Your chances of survival just went down drastically.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Eh. Wasn't planning to make it out of here alive in the first place, so that's fine. Anyway, I've still got this jerk with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Yes, this "jerk" still has his responsibilities to the garden he's spent all these ages tending.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>In any case, if we're at this stage of things, I am the most suitable person to stand on this battlefield.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Shahel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Long time no see. The lid's been lifted from the hell pot, and the steam has wafted your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>The two of you are no match for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But we can buy a little time. We might just be mere pests buzzing around you, but we shan't be so easily swatted down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Nothing to say in response? It's almost like you don't like me or something!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Of course they don't. I'm betting when they were alive, you made sure to be as big a nuisance as you could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Hahaha! You are not mistaken in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Hmph. Honestly, a dragon slayer and a shield maiden? I'm too old to be dealing with this crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I think I'm actually jealous of you, ex-boss. Even if you die, you'll just come back again, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Ha! Let me fill you in on a little secret, Quence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>This body of mine...will be my last. I used all my remaining resources to make my children.</td>
