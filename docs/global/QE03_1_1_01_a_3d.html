<td>Hey, there. What would you like to...hey, what's the matter? You look white as a sheet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Ka-Katya! It's Helga, from Street 4...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No way! Has she already gone into labor?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Liz! You look after this place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>We'll help out as well! It'll be our way of honoring our buddy who became an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Yep! We owe a lot to that guy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What kind of nonsense is this?! A bunch of drunken men like you lot, attend to the delivery of a baby?! Don't underestimate giving birth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Uck... We-well, at least take Liz with you. We'll look after this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Leave the joint in the customer's capable hands, huh? Liz, are ready for this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...Even if I'm not, I'm going anyway!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>All right. Follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Don't you dare give up! You're this child's only parent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Gyahhhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Waaaah! Waaaah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You did it! You're a mother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Liz! Hold the baby for a moment!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huff....huff...thank you...! Thank you...both of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't let your guard down yet...after allâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Mo...mother! The baby...! It suddenly looks like it's in pain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Ughh...efff...ehhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Just as I thought...this country's curse is too strong for a newly-born boy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...! A-a...boy...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>The rest is up to each child's strength to live. This alone cannot be fixed by magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>No...no! That baby's father became an insect, just to give him life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>And now this? Dying as soon as he enters this world?! It's not right! It's not fair!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Liz...we cannot change his destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No...I won't accept this! He just entered this world! It's pointless if he's dead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I can't...take it!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Huh...what? Where am I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>This is the Door of Truth. I am Ouroboros...the observer of destiny who bonds this world with truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Huh? Um...I don't understand what you're saying, but...anyway, the baby...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Do you want to change his destiny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>You are worthy of power. That is why you've been brought here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What do you mean by power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Whether to protect, to resist, or to change...power can be whatever its wielder wishes it to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Are you telling me...that you're gonna give me this power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You are worthy of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I just want to help that baby! So that it can live together with his family! If you can give me that power then I want it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The power to live together... Very well, the contract of truth has been sealed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Use your power to pave a path to the unwavering truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>N-nothing has changed! What should I do?! What should I do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Liz...this is the child's battle to fight. If his power to live can overcome the curse of this country...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The power to live? That's it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I can share with him some of my power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Waaaah! Waaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Oh...the baby...he's regaining his strength!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>...! Oh god!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Wh-what happened? Liz, what did you do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Um...I'm not sure, but I gave it some of my power...I think. That's what I wanted to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>You gave it some of your power? I don't really get it, but you're a daughter after my own heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Huh...? Oh, um. yeah. Anyway, I'm glad it worked out. Not sure what you mean by that last part...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Whoops. Look at the time. I'll take care of the rest, so you head off to bed. You have school tomorrow, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Oh no! It's almost time for the dormitory's curfew! All right, well, good night!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Even the darkest clouds have a silver lining,' huh? I never thought I'd find it so close to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Lisbeth. Lisbeth Finn Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...! Ye-yes?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Sigh... This isn't a place to sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! I didn't sleep much last night...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>That's not a valid excuse. As a punishment, you'll be receiving extra homework.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Sigh... Well then, we'll continue tomorrow. Next, we'll be training in the forest so don't be late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Sigh... I messed up. I need to be balancing helping out at home with my studies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Don't beat yourself over the head. I hardly remember anything we learned from that last class anyway.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Alma... Yeh, you're right. I'll make up for it next class!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>All right, let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Lisbeth...we weren't able to make much progress in class today because the teacher was busy dealing with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Have you anything to say regarding that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Oh...! Well, sorry...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If I recall correctly, you help out at a bar at night, correct? You should stop that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You're dragging down all of your classmates with your actions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Will you put your single mother over your 20 classmates?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Th-that's exactly why I'm helping her! Because she's on her own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>So you're incapable of doing even the simplest of calculations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>A no-good student like you is a real nuisance to my class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>If you won't change your ways then hurry up and leave this school.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Let's go. Don't let what she says get to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...Yeah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>People...aren't just number!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Well then, I'll have you once again fight the monsters of this forest today. I've weakened their strength using my magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>While fighting the monsters, recover the ribbons that I've placed on several of the trees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>I will give marks appropriate to the number of monsters you've defeated so apply yourself to the task at hand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Especially you, Lisbeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You've not shown much promise in this so far. At this rate, it's possible that you'll fail this class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Understood...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Well then. Begin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Liz, over here! Past those bushes, there's quite a lot of monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>But...I feel bad for them. Why do we have to take them out for the sake of our education?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I understand how you feel, but...either way, we have to get rid of them or they'll make their way down to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Besides, you don't want to fail the class, right? Here they come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>!!!</td>
