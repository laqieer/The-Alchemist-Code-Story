<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>L-leave us alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Mia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten what Zehn did for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The only reason we were able to spend all those happy days with these kids is because Zehn kept us safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I haven't forgotten our home with the Shadow Messiah, either...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Because Zehn fought to keep that memory intact for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>And if he can do all that for us...I can do this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?! This brat is going to be more of a nuisance than I thought!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry to interrupt, but I have a message for you from the Bishop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>What?! Now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes. It is urgent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>But the Lion Monarch's Charge is underway! What is the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's why it took me so long to get here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I was told to pass on these orders before the Charge began, but I was delayed by its progression. The message is this: the remnants of the Shadow Messiah are no longer your targets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm? What's going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I suppose we'll only incur further losses on our side if we continue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Very well, then. We will retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Not that I'm complaining, but...why? You were prepared to kill us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Yeah! What reason would you have to spare us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Papa... P-papa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Why are you here, samurai?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Not to fight. I have a proposal for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>And you just strut in here like a proud peacock and expect me to hear it? Such arrogance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I humbly beg your consideration.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(Hmm... It's not a bad bargain.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(If Zehn joins the Templars...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>(He can act as Greed Dike's agent, and have them operate in our favor.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>(In exchange, all we have to do is leave the remnants of the Shadow Messiah alone. We lose nothing, but gain much.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hmph. You overestimate your own worth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Whoever you were to me, I no longer recall. There is no reason for me to hunt you or your ilk any longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yet it would seem that there is someone in this room whose arrogance eclipses even yours, for he saw fit to dispatch assassins without consulting me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Wh-what? Surely you don't—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ngh... Aaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You dare trample on the pride of a warrior?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(Zahar, the King of Darkness, and the person most feared by the Holy Order has been sealed away.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(The Shadow Messiah now number so few, they might never have existed. It is somewhat wasteful to send assassins after them, at such a critical juncture as this—however...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I merely thought it possible that, if Zahar should one day return, he might try to rebuild the Shadow Messiah.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>That could have potential consequences for Greed Dike as well, so I took preemptive action. What say you, Zehn? How would you take responsibility for this outcome?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I would give my life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Do you swear it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Upon my wife's grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>My lord...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Get out of my sight. I never want to see your face again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Then I bid you farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It was awfully kind of you to let him go. Are you sure it wise to trust someone who once betrayed you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He could come back for revenge...but he won't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It may seem pointless, to sacrifice so much to carve out one, tiny slice of peace in this vast world...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But I know he would prefer to end this conflict without drawing his blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>For that is the spirit of Iai. "Victory is won in the sheath."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well fought, my daylily. Well fought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Checkmate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>No way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>You can do this, Sol! Oh, um... I'm afraid that move doesn't work. Pawns can't move laterally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>You really should have kept more of your pieces alive. The king can't very well protect himself, can he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Damn it! Do I really only have pawns left?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Like me, everyone here is an empty vessel, unable to move from their place on the shelf.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Perhaps once they were full, but they have been upturned and emptied by the world, by their enemies, by their allies...by everyone and anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So now they seek to turn the world on its head, that they might be put right again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I hate this world. Every last inch of it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Not just Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I despise every last member of the brainless masses. People are only too happy to go along with the movement of the crowd, regardless of the consequences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I will never forget what I have suffered.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>It's just like our leader always says!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>"Those who harm our friends will be killed by any means necessary." It's the Templars' code for the Unforgiveable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>We'll do whatever it takes to see it through, even use people we hate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>We're going to take on the entire world, starting with Greed Dike!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Then we're going to turn everything on its head, reversing everything that's wrong with the world in one fell swoop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Bold plan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>The situation is kinda like that game you were playing. The pieces can only move within a set range, right? And in set patterns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>And if you slow down, the enemy will quickly overtake you, and use your territory against you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>That's why you have to be fast, and take the enemy's best pieces before they come for yours! Are you following along with this okay, gramps?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Must you call me that? I'm not that old, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Would you prefer "papa", then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Wh-what? That's not at all what I—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Anyway, now that you're one of us, we're not letting you go! Don't forget: you're a Templar for life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I won't. After all, that is the commandment I was given: Forget not thine purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>I have sworn to uphold it, and will not break my word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Good! You're our samurai now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>You should know that, considering my birthplace and creed, many would say I cannot truly be called a samurai.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>So what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You earned that identity! Your sword, your mastery of Iai, your samurai soul...all of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So you are the real thing! Okay? Don't let anyone take that from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Oi, Zehn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You'd better not be thinking of joining the fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Of course I am. How else can I repay you for giving me shelter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>You only just got your power. Your wounds aren't even healed up yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Füry and Vier did everything they could, and even they weren't able to put you back together again properly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>So you're staying out of this one, unless worst comes to worst.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Don't worry. We'll protect you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>From one scarface to another... Hang in there, yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>R-right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>And don't go getting hurt again, okay? We can't afford to lose you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Huh? Are you crying?! Is it 'cause of what I said?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>There's no shame in it! Sometimes you've just gotta let it all out. Don't I know it! Come on, Zehn, let's have a beer together! Gahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Geez... Crying's pointless, you know. Especially at your age.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Hah...haha... Hahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>I thought I'd never cry again...but it seems I've been holding my tears back all this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Now I... I can't seem to stop.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I...will not...force another...to sully their blade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I can no longer hear the narration in my mind. I suppose that means my tale is at an end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Wait! No! Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Live by the blade, die by the blade... This is the path I choose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I have done everything and anything I could to protect my home. I have played the part of the villain, allowed myself to be smeared with dishonor, and lived only by the blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>This sword which has been at my side through it all... It now gives me a clear path forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Still, perhaps in the next life, at least, I'll have a chance to begin anew. What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>(This will be the last life I take.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Fare thee well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hmm... Do you think there is an afterlife awaiting me? Or, if I am to be reborn, do you think I will find love.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Guess we'd better start searching for a new home, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Hmm... Where should we go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Well, we can go anywhere now! The whole world is ours to explore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Yeah... I guess it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Pa...pa...back...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>Mimi? What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Papa! Papa back! Ahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Papa! You're back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Someone's coming.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>Crap! Don't tell me those Corpse freaks changed their mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Who the hell are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Ila... Please stop biting the head off every adult we meet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>State your name and business!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>My name is...Na Zhu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Na...Zhu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Forgotten by my homeland, I am like a weed without roots, carried aloft by the wandering breeze... I apologize for startling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>Wait... Na Zhu. That Na Zhu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>It has to be! How many Na Zhus can there be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Have we met before?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>Mister Zehn told us about you! In the story, you're the prodigy swordsman who taught the clumsy samurai hero how to be a better warrior!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Wh-what? I... That's not...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>But you're clumsy, too! Just like Mister Zehn, throughout the story you keep stumbling and getting lost while you try to make things right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Mister Zehn said you were like a son to him, or a younger brother! He said he'd never forget you, as long as he lived!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I-I... I'm sorry. There's been some mistake. I'm not the person you think I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Ahahahahahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Mimi! Don't laugh at Mister Na Zhu. That's very rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Mimi's never this cozy with strangers, so I'm pretty sure you're not one. There's only one Na Zhu, and you're him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Zehn said you showed Mimi mercy. You let her live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>I-I... But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>This is a bit exciting, isn't it? I must admit, I'm a little starstruck. It's like the picture book came to life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Y-you're wrong! I'm not... I don't deserve—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Papa! Hahaha! Papa! Papa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Urgh... Nngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry! If I could take it all back, I would!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Aha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>The blade is chipped, the vessel cracked. The pariah will always be rejected and attacked.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>It's all my fault! I ruined everything! I'm so sorry! I wish I could change it! I wish I could undo it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>Yet now they are full to bursting...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>M-Mister Na Zhu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>C-can I...stay with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Really?! You wanna stay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>That's...why I came here. I want to face what I have done.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>I'm going to remain faithful this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>(I'm going to carry this sin around with me forever.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>I want to protect his family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>You'll help us? You really mean it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I do. I will. Please allow me to stay... Let me be useful to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>My skill at last finds the purpose for which it has been yearning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Sure! If you're anything like you were in the story, you'll be an asset!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>The...story?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Ila and I have been putting together a picture book, to preserve our memories of Zehn. We often do reenactments of the stories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Yep! They're just retellings of the stories Zehn used to share with us, but we're gonna use them to instill the samurai spirit in a whole generation of orphans!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>As the truth of all I am finds its place within my soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Aha?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>What is it, Mimi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Ahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>Mitsu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>So...did you find out if there's a heaven, after all?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>It was the home I shared with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>The only reason I am yet able to laugh is because you held on to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>So don't be sorry anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>I'm so glad I met you. I'm so happy we were able to celebrate your birthday together. I'm so lucky that you were the one I fell in love with, and who loved me in turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>It was such a journey... The memories are so good, I still laugh to recall them now. I enjoyed our time together. Didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>I did. Thank you, Mitsu. For everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>194</td>
<td>I'm going to live on, for as long as I can. Wait for me. Watch over me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195</td>
<td>Mitsu...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>196</td>
<td>Yes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>197</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>198</td>
<td>Go on. Say it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>199</td>
<td>I'll always love you, Mitsu. In this life, and the next; even should I be reborn. My heart belongs only to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>Hmhm. You could have been a poet, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>201</td>
<td>Live long, my love. Live long, and fill the world with the music of your laughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>202</td>
<td>I will.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>203</td>
<td>No one can hurt you anymore, my darling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>And no one is going to forget you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>205</td>
<td>I... I'd like to hear some of these stories. May I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>206</td>
<td>Hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>207</td>
<td>After all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>208</td>
<td>Take a seat! The show's about to start!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>209</td>
<td>Your story is at an end.</td>
