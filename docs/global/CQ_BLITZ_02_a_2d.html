<td>Haa...haa... Phew! Those guys were really something, huh? And you! You're crazy strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>If dealing with lowlifes such as these wears on you, then you are definitely unsuited for the position of inquisitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>However, having seen your skills firsthand, I find myself not quite so incredulous that the Envylian Guard would be after your talents.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Why not accept? Why not put your talents to use for a greater position?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Whatever. In any case, I had best take my leave. You are free to wander the city, but do not disturb the peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I wasn't gonna! See you around!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He might look scary, but I guess he's not so bad after all... Oh, dang! I hope the greengrocer isn't still waiting for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>She said if I helped her out again tomorrow, she'd give me another apple. Can she really afford that? I hope her business is doing well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You, there! Halt!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Huh? What is it? Just so you know, I didn't steal this apple!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You took part in that little scuffle earlier, didn't you? The Inquisition has deemed you to be under suspicion of the misuse of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>By my right as inquisitor, I am taking you into custody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>H-hold on a second! Alchemy? I didn't use any Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>You'll have plenty of time to find a better excuse while you're stewing in your cell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>H-hey! Stop! I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>How much longer do I have to be here? I didn't even get to eat my apple...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My apologies. You are Blitz from Envylia, are you not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Huh? Gilfred?! What're you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I believe I addressed myself to you as 'Inquisitor Gilfred'? I have taken over this case. As such, it falls on me to tell you that you have been cleared of all suspicion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?! Wh-what the heck...? I mean, I'm glad to hear it, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>The misuse of Alchemy charge was never verified. In fact, the report itself was found to be a sham.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>A sham?! But... I haven't done anything to warrant a grudge like that, have I?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You were merely mixed up in a plot against me. The fault does not lie with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What?! Are you...all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Fear not. If there were a problem, I would not be here right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh... Well, so long as I'm all clear, and you're all right, then I suppose everything is fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>My apologies for changing the subject, but there is something I must ask you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You said that you seek to help people on your travels... Why is that? What do you expect in return?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What? I don't want anything! I just want to help people who need it. That's all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Is it, now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Yeah! I like helping people, you know? I've always done what I can for my family and friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>One day, I found myself with the power of thunder, and decided to try and use it to help people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Is that why you embarked on this journey of yours?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Yup! I told myself—Blitz, you're gonna make this world a better place!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I got this power totally by accident, so it took me a while to get used to it. It was pretty rough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Still, I can't help but think of it as a happy accident. It's thanks to my power that I've been able to help so many people!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>If you are so eager to help people, then why do you hesitate to join the ranks of the Envylian Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? Oh, well... I was happy to be scouted and all that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've always done this myself, you know? Helping people. I get to see them smile, and that makes me happy. That's all I need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Sure, if I became a knight, I'd be able to work towards protecting something bigger...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But if I did that, I wouldn't be able to just go around helping the people who needed it anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The bigger the scale, the less you actually get to see the effect of the good you do on the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>One person can only do so much on their own. Only the people with whom you come into direct contact are likely to benefit from your help.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>A certain measure of power is required to truly help others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I guess... Still, I can't help but worry that one day I'd be given the order to fight someone I want to protect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I realize that this is awfully presumptuous of me...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>But if you truly believe that you have the power to protect that which you care for by your own hands, then I would have you prove it to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I've got the power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You're on!</td>
</tr>
