<td>The restoration process must be reaching its climax!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Spica! I don't truly understand what you're trying to achieve here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But... whatever your intention may be, I cannot allow you near Kanon!</td>

<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I will stop you right here!</td>

<td>034</td>
<td>And also... I'll make it back safely to Lord Vettel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Your intent is very powerful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>You adored Zahar, didn't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We didn't have another choice in that situation. If we wouldn't have banished him to the other side of the Door of Truth, our regiment would have...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I don't need your excuses.<br>I have accepted reality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm really sorry... for taking away such a precious person from you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Are you... crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It couldn't be helped because we believed in different things... And I know that as long as there's war, this sorrow will keep on repeating itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>But if I put myself in your shoes... If Lord Vettel were to be taken from me... As much as I'd want to hate the one responsible, I probably wouldn't truly be able to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I cannot step aside now due to the circumstances... But I can understand your sorrow agonizingly well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And Kanon is just the same! Ever since she became the Lord Commander...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>she's been genuinely praying for the end of this spiral of sorrow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>And that's also why she's so desperate now to restore Excalibur!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>I also want to aim for Kanon's ideals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>So I'm sorry, but I cannot let you pass! ...Crystal Break!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?!<br>My full-out attack didn't even...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I suppose...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>that even if this Vettel were to fall into darkness, you would be able to stop him, if you had the willpower for it.</td>
