<td>002</td>
<td>I will protect the future of this world! Eternal Glow!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Give up already! Die!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No matter how hard you resist, this is how it ends for you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Urk...! Grnk... You think...this is the end?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>D-don't make us laugh... As if we would die here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What? The light and the darkness are coming together?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huzzzaaaah!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Argh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>W-we did it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What...was that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I must admit...the depths of your doggedness continue to surprise me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Watching the two of you struggle so mightily and stubbornly almost gives me hope for humankind as a whole. Almost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It didn't work?! He even seems stronger than before! How can this be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>No... It's not over yet. Look at that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh! Orion's Phantom is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Yes. We were able to at least destroy the top half of it. That's significant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It didn't affect Orion at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We don't know that yet. We just have to play it smart to win the battle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>We just have to take advantage of this technique which combines our opposing elemental natures of light and dark.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Play it smart? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The opposing energy of light and dark cancel each other out when they come into contact. If that phenomenon is used against Orion, perhaps we can cancel out his strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Cancel Orion's strength...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>This is just a theory, but...look at the wounds we left on the Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They look...like flesh had been gouged out by the waves of our energy colliding, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm almost sure that we hit Orion, but it doesn't seem to have done anything to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's possible that Nimul's manifestation has bulwarked his defenses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>If only we had a way to lower his defenses for just a moment...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>What can we do? With every passing second, Nimul's soul grows stronger within Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>And his defenses along with it. In order to gain the strength to oppose that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I feel it... It's here! It's almost fully manifested! Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tch... There's no time to think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Please, wait! We still don't have a proper plan of attack!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If we don't take this chance now, it may never come again! We cannot let it go to waste!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Heh... Have you resigned yourself to death already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heed me! Even if there's only a tiny chance this will work, I'll take it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I am the true successor of the title of supreme judge! Any incarnation of Nimul who dares to face me will die by my hand without achieving their goals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You...?! With only one hand?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Indeed. You have no chance of winning. All your hopes will die here and now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No... No! It can't be!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Get away from here! You'll just get sucked into this as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I know that, but I can't just let this stand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You should pride yourselves on being the ones who have made possible the resurrection of a legendary power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Tch... Is this...all we can do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>No! This can't be the fate of humankind! This cannot be our end! No destiny is impervious to the possibilities carved out by free will!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Please, Excalibur! Please, give me strength one last time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Just enough to save this world from catastrophe! Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What...is this light?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It...repelled me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Now, then. This battle is just beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>You...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Don't give up, Kanon. It isn't over yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Zain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Lord Zain?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Ha! I was wondering who else might show up...and now you, one of the lauded Lord Commanders himself, have fallen so far as to become a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Long time no see, Orion. You, who see other humans as less than yourself, have come this far in achieving your ambitions...but it all ends here.</td>
