<td>Looks like we're free today...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Looks like it... Come to think of it, it has been a while since we've had a day off. I guess it's good to relax sometimes though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah! We've been working non-stop ever since we became Phantoms. It's good to have days like this sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Since we don't have a mission, I may go out for a drink. Why don't you come along, Aswald?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sure, it doesn't seem like anything will come up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hey, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I heard what happened! Why? Just tell me why!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>How could you have your bridal rehearsal without me?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I love weddings more than anyone! You can't have a wedding without me! Please, let me be your Cupid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is this an acquaintance of yours, Vanekis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Sure, I know a lot of people, but I don't know anyone who would just barge up to you demanding to be your Cupid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What's a bridal rehearsal? Do you mean...when we guarded the wedding parlor that one time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Aha! There you are!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Moa! Don't go flying off all by yourself! Did you even introduce yourself to everyone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Oh, I almost forgot! Nice to meet you all. I'm Eve's cousin, Moa!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I heard everything from Eve, and a bridal rehearsal sounds like the best idea ever! Please, let me help out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What's she talking about, Eve?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I promise that her heart's in the right place. When weddings are involved, though, she becomes a whole different person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Please let me come! They don't call me the "Mad Cupid" for nothing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I don't think that nickname means what you think it does.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I already have the perfect dress picked out! Now come on in!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Oh my... You're beautiful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You look...gorgeous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Thank you. It's a dress that I wouldn't normally pick myself, so it's a breath of fresh air.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I feel like this dress is wasted on someone like me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>That's not true! It looks perfect on you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Let's have Scheherazade draw your picture later! I'll ask her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>R-really? Would that really be all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I don't see why not. It'll make a great memento. Is this the dress you picked out, Moa?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course it is! A bride's most beautiful day should be her wedding. I worked really hard to pick it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>As your wedding producer, I'll make sure the bridal rehearsal is great! Picking out a dress is just the first step.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Did any of you agree to this bridal rehearsal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>She just sort of came out of nowhere, and this is all so sudden. I don't really understand what's going on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>She came to help pick out a dress, but what does she mean by rehearsal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Eve, isn't your cousin being a little overbearing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ahaha...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Now then, now that our bride is ready, next is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey Moa, how about we look into how things are, romantically, in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You were just recently called in as a Phantom, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>If you're hosting a bridal rehearsal, I think you should have a grasp on all the recent trends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I see what you mean. That's a great idea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Lucretia, Uzuma, we need to strike while the iron's hot! Let's start our investigation right away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Okay!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Umm...all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Wh-where are you going? Wait for me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>This is starting to look interesting! Come on, Kon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Our peaceful day ended before it even began.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Looks like it...</td>
</tr>
