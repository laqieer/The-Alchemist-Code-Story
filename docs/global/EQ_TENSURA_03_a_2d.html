<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Yup, yup. Looks like most of my powers have come back to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's good to hear. Are you sure your friend is in this village, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Yeah, my Magic Sense is never wrong. Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...Something is happening down there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let's check it out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hgnh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Curses... Just one after another... When will this end?! If only I could use Hell Flare...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Yah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Haaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Phew! That's the last of 'em.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Who are you people? Identify yourselves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>We're friends, not foes. We're here to guide the little slime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The slime? Does that mean that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Benimaru!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Rimuru! What are you doing here? Weren't you headed for the Kingdom of Ingrassia?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hm...well... That was the plan, yeah... Someone else had a different plan for me, though. What about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>...I'm not sure. I was training at the forest edge, but before I knew it I was in this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(It's just like Ouroboros said. The others were summoned to different locations. How annoying...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But this is bad news. I can't feel my powers. It's like all the magicules in my body have left me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Do you know where we are? And who are the humans with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Calm down, Benimaru. Let's assess the situation first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Have you had anything to eat since coming here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>No, I haven't... I only just got here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>One of the villagers found me wandering the nearby grasslands and brought me here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>But then the village got attacked by all these monsters... There was no time for food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Thank you all so much for protecting our village!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I feared for your life when you told me that you'd repay us for helping you by protecting the village from all those monsters! Though I suppose my fears were unwarranted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I've prepared you all a meal as a sign of thanks. Please have as much as you'd like!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh? So that's why you were fighting those monsters all by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...In the end I wasn't that much help. I couldn't fight like I could back in our world. It would've been the end of me if Rimuru hadn't come looking for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Aw, it's no biggie. Besides, you just told me you hadn't eaten yet, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What does that have to do with anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, we just got a bunch of food.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ah. Right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>We can discuss things while eating. We can't let such a carefully prepared meal go to waste. Let's eat before it gets cold!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Orcs?! But that's impossible...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm afraid that's the only conclusion I can draw from Ouroboros' description. Orcs... No. An Orc Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>She called us to this world to do something about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But those orcs...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Hey, are orcs really that scary?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>An orc by itself is nothing to write home about, but things are different when an Orc Lord comes into play.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>The Orc Lord feeds off of the fear of its allies. It's got a tremendous and overpowering energy that makes the other orcs obey it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Even a small number of orcs can devour an entire human village if they are led by an Orc Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>...Or a village of trained warriors. Like our Ogre Village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Hmm, but here's the thing. We kinda already solved this whole orc problem back in our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Huh? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Rimuru already defeated the Orc Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>After that, all the surviving orcs regained their minds and decided to live under Rimuru's rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Maybe one of them betrayed you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The reason the orcs rampaged in our world is because they were starving due to a famine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>But there isn't a single starving orc under the Jura Forest Alliance. They wouldn't have a reason to betray us. Besides...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>I don't think the current leader of the orcs, Geld, would ever go back on his vow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Yeah. Pretty much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>I also think that something's up. Though I can't say what that might be yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>What we do know is that this village lies in their path.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>No matter what the reason, we can't just overlook their actions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Besides, the people of this village took care of my friend, so now I'll take care of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Sounds about right. I'm in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Are you feeling better?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Yeah. It's just like you said, I feel much better after eating something. I won't perform so poorly again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Good. I'm counting on you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>(But I can't help but wonder about those orcs...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I'll join you on lookout duty.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Those beasts are more active than usual. It'd be bad if they caught you off-guard with no back-up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>"He's still recovering, so he shouldn't overdo it." At least that's what Rimuru told me when he said I should come and join you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Rimuru saw right through me, huh? Seriously, I'm no match for that guy's perceptiveness...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>You really put your trust in that guy, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I wouldn't recognize him as my ruler if I didn't.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Following the strongest is the way of life for us demonic beings... But that's not the only reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Rimuru forgave me after I pointed my blade at him in misunderstanding. He even granted me a name and a place to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>A name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>There are many monsters without names in our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Granting a monster a name makes them grow much stronger, but it also expends a significant amount of the namer's magicules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Considering all of this, naming someone is a highly dangerous act.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Who would've thought that he'd perform such an act of benevolence towards those that had tried to kill him? That alone was plenty of reason for me to recognize him as my master.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I see. He forgave your past actions and instead welcomed you as a comrade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Rimuru appears to be a gentle man, someone who prefers to win without delivering any mortal wounds, much like what we practice in Sosenko, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>What about you, Benimaru?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I don't find it so easy to forgive those that robbed me of all the things that I held dear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Do you hold a grudge against the orcs that wiped out your village?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You look like you know your way around a sword. Aren't you planning to take revenge?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'd be lying if I said that I didn't resent them at the start.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>But then...one of the surviving orcs—Geld—confessed to his mistakes. He was prepared to offer me his life in order to repent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>"Please, I ask that you take my head as penance and have mercy on my people." That's what he said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...And what did you do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>I said, I will show no mercy to anyone who would harm us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>But I also said, if you join the alliance and accept Rimuru as your leader, then you and I are not enemies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Taking his life wouldn't bring back the people my village had lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Before I met Rimuru, I would've never forgiven them. I would've wanted to kill them. Give in to my weakness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>But the orcs said that they'd work for Rimuru's sake. Their strength and labor force is not inconsiderable, so they had a lot to contribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>That's when I realized I couldn't just get rid of talented people because of my own grudges.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'm the Samurai General of the Jura Tempest Federation. I've got to put the country's interests first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>I dunno what kind of answer you were expecting from me here, but that's it. That's what I did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>No, it's fine. It's a good answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Freeing yourselves from the shackles of the past and living for the future alone. That's...an incredibly strong way to live. It allows you to wield your sword without anything clouding your judgment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>(Hey, Great Sage. Do you know why we're dealing with another Orc Lord?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Answer: There is a possibility that the current orc army was brought to this world from a different point on the timeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>(So from the past then? How is that even possible?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>(But it would explain a few things. So I can't rule it out.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>(There's also a chance that the Orc Lord of this world isn't the same one I ate.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>(Great Sage, can you tell if it's a different one?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Answer: It should be possible to analyze this matter once we are close enough to the Orc Lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>(I see... I guess we'll find out whether or not it's the old Geld then.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Lost in thought?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Albea!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>I was surprised that you're a rather important personage, leading so many monsters by yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Heh, I guess. I do lead the Jura Tempest Federation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>The orcs are among my subjects, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>That's why I've got to take responsibility if there really are orcs rampaging around this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I can't afford to ignore this matter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>What is it? Something on my face?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>No, there isn't. Honestly, I'm not even sure where your face starts or ends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>You just reminded me of someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Huh? Of who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Someone who also had a strong sense of responsibility, who tried to shoulder all burdens by themselves. A very reckless person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>That person knew I was alone as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>Rimuru. We're under attack.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>Ah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>Wh-what's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>We're under attack! Let's move!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>Benimaru, Creto!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>Careful, Rimuru! These guys look riled up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>I can tell. What made them come all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Answer: The orc army chased them out of their forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>(I see... Maybe we can still negotiate with them then.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Grrraaaaaarrrrrgghhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>...Never mind.</td>
</tr>
