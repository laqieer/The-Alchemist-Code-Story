<td>Kuza, it was just as you said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Of course. I know him well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>All that is left to do is to bring him to our side. Heh. This is quite entertaining.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Having Kudanstein on our side would further ensure the success of my conquest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Even if he chooses to reject our offer, that simply leaves us with a good opportunity to crush the Holy Guard. You are a clever one, Kuza.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Keep up the good work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Kuza... I know that one of the terms of our alliance was that you could try for my life at any time, but honestly. Don't you think it's time you let it go?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Tch...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I...failed. Even with everything on the line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It was not a bad attempt. You are indeed very clever, and quite skilled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Just kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Your talents would be of great use to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I'd rather die than help you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Did you not say that you wanted to protect Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It's...the only home I've ever known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I may still allow you to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Wadatsumi has fallen. It is inevitable. There can no changing what is to come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>My path of conquest would have brought this fate upon Wadatsumi sooner or later. I accept your resentment without reserve.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>But know that Greed Dike acts only upon this unwavering code: strength is justice. The only thing you can trust in this world is the strength that you yourself have cultivated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I will build a world in which the complacent weak are removed and only the strong are tolerated. The true irrationality of this world is when the efforts of those who strive are neglected and left to go to waste.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I cannot sympathize with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You must have some memory that resonates with this. You must feel some of that anger shared by all ambitious people who have been dragged down by the weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It is natural for the strong to prey upon the weak. Is that not obvious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Had Wadatsumi been strong, it would not have fallen. Now you can ensure that it never will again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>What did you say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>You will give Wadatsumi strength! I will allow you to do this under Greed Dike's rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So then, if I can best you, that would make me righteous?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! Indeed, that would be true! I will grant you the opportunity to exact your revenge upon me as you desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Of course, it remains an impossible endeavor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>How can I know unless I try?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>That's the spirit. So, will you serve me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Place your trust in my strength, for it is the true justice! Then you shall have all that you desire within your grasp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>That sharp glare of yours... You do not change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>When all of this is over, I will grant you the position of Wadatsumi's governor. If you serve me well, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You don't have to remind me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Does he seem useful?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>If he's not, I'll crush him. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How responsible of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I will not let anything or anyone stand in my way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Why...? You swore to defend Wadatsumi! What are you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Kuza...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Please, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>There is nothing more to be said. Your mission ends here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I know that I am no longer bound to this world, but is it so unreasonable for me to want to know the truth?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's all for Wadatsumi. All of it. Always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>How is turning to Orion and endangering the lives of our people supposed to be good for Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Tell me. How can transmuting their lives into Philosopher's Stones be good for Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Kuza!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You've played your part. Put Kagura in the dungeon and go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Kuza...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>There's no turning back for me now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>We have received word from Orion. He said to meet him at the Wadatsumi ruins by sundown tomorrow. He said that he will execute Kagura if everybody is not there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>He also said that it is time Greed Dike and the Holy Guard made clear whose idea of justice is truly righteous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Why Kagura?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He's trying to set an example. To show everyone that this is the fate of those who stand against Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Tch! That despicable monster!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Seeing as how he wants all of us there, he probably intends to annihilate the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>We must be quite a thorn in Orion's side. I'd be flattered if I wasn't so offended that he thinks he can take us all out so easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>He may try to force me to reveal the location of the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Well, what are we waiting for? Let us go rescue Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What are you doing, Kudan?! We cannot leave Kagura to such a fate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I...couldn't protect her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Hold it, old man. Hey, Kudan. Listen. I understand how you feel, but we have to do what we can here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>The Demonic Spearman we all know and love isn't someone so easily disheartened. Or at least, I didn't think he was.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Well, call on us when you're ready, but...just keep in mind we're pressed for time. I trust you'll come through, Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Will you...give me some time alone, please?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>As long as you don't forget that you're never truly alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Was I...wrong? Have I not made any progress since that day?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>The strong devour the weak... Kuza, is the path you have chosen the right one?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Then... Then what was the meaning of the oath we swore?! Won't somebody tell me that? Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>I said I wanted to be alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, did you gain the power of darkness just to brood?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I mean, to me, it seemed like you took hold of that power in order to protect something. That's why I took an interest in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Even I can tell that it wasn't so you could sit here in the dark, being all gloomy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What would you know?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I...don't have anything. So I've always envied you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>What are you talking about?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Are we not going? We can't mobilize if you don't give the order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Why...are you saying all of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I just believe it's what she would have said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Who do you...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Let's go, Captain Kudan! There's nothing we can do for Kagura sitting around here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>I'm gonna show Orion what's what! It's time for our justice to shine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>His idea of justice is wrong! You always said you'd make a world where the weak are no longer exploited!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That is the justice I believe in. That is the justice Captain Cadanova entrusted to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>So I know you're not mistaken, Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>What do you know about anything?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>I know enough! She's my friend, too! You're not the only one who cares about her, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Would the righteous just sit here and let this happen?! Wouldn't that only be affirming Orion's justice?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>The Captain Kudan I know is much stronger than that! So let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Why are you doing this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>I just feel like I need to support you like Kagura always does. Besides, I don't like seeing either of you sad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I fight to make the world full of smiles. That's my justice!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Kanon...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>You're...a lot more than I ever expected. Impressive, in your own way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>And Basheeny! You're still too disrespectful to Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>But I appreciate what you came here to do. Good work!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>We await your orders, Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>My...justice...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Let's go and face Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The 4th Regiment will lead the operation to rescue Kagura. The rest of us will take the fight to Orion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Well?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Captain Kudan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Knights of the 4th Regiment! We're moving out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
