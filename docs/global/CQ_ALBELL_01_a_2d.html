<td>What am I doing all the way here in Lustburg?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>(What's wrong with me? Why am I relying on a fortune-teller?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>(I wonder if Deneb's fortunes are really that accurate.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>(She seems a little air-headed. I hope I'm doing the right thing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Sigh... That being said, she's late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(If she really is as amazing as the rumors say she is...I wonder what I should ask her?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This is starting to become troublesome. Maybe I'll go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Sorry to keep you waiting!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Here she is. What perfect timing.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I do apologize. You must be tired by now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I'm fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Please, sit over here. Would you like some tea? I have some delicious herbal tea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>No, I don't need the tea. More importantly, um, I want you to read my fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Do you see the night sky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What? The night sky?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>(What is she talking about?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>When I was a child I loved to look at the night sky!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>As I continued to observe the lovely stars, before I knew it, I had become an astrologer and a fortune-teller. Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I-I see. Um... I came here to have my fortune read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Please don't rush. First of all, how about we talk a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh? Talk...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes! What is it that you like?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Well, I like building machines...and repairing them...and stuff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Machines? Oh, that's amazing! If my telescope breaks, maybe I'll ask you to repair it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hey... Why do you like working with machines?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Well, my father was a mechanic and he ran his own machine shop and repair studio, so I dabbled in it a lot when I was a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What I really loved was the smell and atmosphere of the studio. That's what I came to love the most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Heheh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Hm? You asked me, so don't laugh about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oh, I'm sorry. You said "love" twice, so I can tell you really do like it a lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>So, you've also been continuing something that you liked as a child. You're the same as me. I'm happy to hear that. Hehe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>(She's such a hassle. I should've gone home.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>So, when you make machines, what do you enjoy about it the most?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well...I never really thought about that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I guess I like it when I assemble something and it turns out exactly the way it was designed to be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Right, right. And?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>... ... (Seriously. This is really getting to be a hassle.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Um, I think I'll...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>All right. So why don't you enjoy working with machines anymore?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>What? How did you...I didn't say anything about that. Is this one of your fortunes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>No. It's not a fortune.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Then...how?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Well, when you talk about these machines that you're supposed to "love" working with, you don't seem to be enjoying it at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>People rely on fortune-tellers when they want somebody to hear what they have to say, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You might be right. Yeah. Can you listen to what I have to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Of course. That's why you're here. And that's why I'm in front of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh! I'm sorry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What's the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>The stars are badly aligned. It seems like an uninvited guest has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>(Did an "uninvited guest" really come?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Yes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>(Who are they?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What do you want? I have turned down your request over and over again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Deneb, we'll have you come today!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I have a guest right now. Please leave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Why would you turn us down?! Wratharis needs your abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>We'll place you in a good position in Wratharis. We'll get lots of money. It works out well for all of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I don't think so. The stars also do not point in that direction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I disagree! You should be grateful that Wratharis is willing to pay the country's money for a mere fortune-teller like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Ouch! What are you doing?! I said I'm not going!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>What?! Hey, let's take her by force.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Wait. I need to hear what she has to tell me! Don't take her away!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Who are you? Stay out of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I see. Well, if you're going to act like that...it's a hassle, but I'll have to stop you!</td>
</tr>
