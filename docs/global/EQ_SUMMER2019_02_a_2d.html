<td>Phew! I think we got 'em all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What is going on? It's not normal for octopuses to attack like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>This island region has always been densely populated by octopuses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>However, it was not until very recently that a giant octopus came along and began banding all of its kin together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>They've always been a rowdy bunch, but now they're organized to boot. It's turning into a bit of a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I am afraid so... Yet, despite the danger, there is one who failed to heed my many warnings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>It's nothing new, of course. Xiao-Xiao has always had a terrible sense of direction. However, these creatures can be quite tricky to deal with alone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's the matter, Xiao-Xiao?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>U-um... Liu Shen, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>There's no need to look so worried. It'll be all right. I will find her. It is the duty of the first mate to take care of his captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>B-but, um...Shenmei is...probably...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am going to take care of it. You wait here, all right, Xiao-Xiao?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>O-okay...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Hmmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I am going to go and search for my captain. Would you mind looking after Xiao-Xiao for me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Uhh... Sure. Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Thank you. I apologize for the trouble. We will commence our patrol as soon as Xiao-Xiao is found safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What the—?! Where am I?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>How did I get in a cave? I was chasing after that suspicious shadow, but I don't remember coming in here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Waiting is so boring! I'd definitely rather be patrolling than just standing around like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The name's Bertha! I'm a gunner in the Envylia Royal Knighthood Artillery Regiment. And this is Sharon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Pleased to make your acquaintance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>N-nice to...m-meet you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hey, Su Yi? Is there something you want to say? Something you're holding back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You've been making this face for a while now—like something's troubling you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>If you have something to say, you ought to say it. You can't expect people to read your mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>U-um...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>O-octopus...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Huh? Octopus?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>U-um... I... I mean...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well? It's no good just saying octopus. You've got to explain yourself properly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I-I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I-I'm going to go and look for Shenmei, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-hey! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Su Yi! Come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Why'd she run off all of a sudden?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>There she is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Oh no!</td>
</tr>
