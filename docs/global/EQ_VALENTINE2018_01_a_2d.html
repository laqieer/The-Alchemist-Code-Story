<td>Wow, that's so much cacao! Is this all the Rainbow type?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yep! You can choose whichever color you like best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Rainbow Cacao is also recognized as a powerful magical ingredient in Lustburg!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The harvest this year was particularly abundant, so I was able to get my hands on a fairly large quantity of it, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Lovely ladies, gather round! Got eyes for a certain someone? Hoping for a little help? The best-selling Rainbow Cacao is back in stock!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Raised in the sweltering heat of the desert, this ingredient will bring a burning passion to your love life!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ohmygod! It's that Rainbow Cacao I've been hearing so much about! I'll take one!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Me too!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>O-oh, fantastic. Ah, but wait, don't push...! A-ahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Uh oh... This could be trouble...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It can't be helped around this time of the year. After all, Valentine's Day is a girl's ultimate battlefield!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>This is why we were called? I suppose it's our job to restore public order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I hope you will also consider the protection of Lustburg's dignity a priority as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's a rather delicate situation. Students of the School of Magic have a tendency to get into...mischief.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Geez, what's with that? Gives me indigestion... What's wrong with letting loose a little every once in a while?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Valentine's Day is a ridiculous event that encourages rule-breakers to run wild and forget their duties as representatives of the Academy. Besides, chocolates and such aren't even allowed on campus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ugh, whatever. What does it even matter? I ate chocolates and sweets all the time while I was in the School of Magic and nothing ever happened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Excuse me?! As former student president, I am appalled by your behavior! Though...I suppose we have more important things to focus on right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So, this is Rainbow Cacao. I'd only ever seen it in books. It's incredible to be able to see it with my own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...And these are the effects of the Rainbow Cacao according to color. Do you understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes, I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Remember the specific qualities each color brings forth. I expect this will appear on the test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That's all for today. Don't forget to review the material we covered today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Nng... Huh? Class is over already?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How could you fall asleep again, Emma? The teacher kept looking over here. If you don't focus in class...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I can't help it if the Magical Ingredients class is less exciting than watching water boil. We didn't even get to see the real Rainbow Cacao with our own eyes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Plus, it's grown near the desert. That's too far from Lustburg to matter to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Well, you never know, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>There might be a day when we get to see it for ourselves. Until then, our duty as students is to learn as much as we can about it and everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes, yes... Nn... I'm so sleepy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Were you working last night as well? Are you getting enough sleep, Emma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Eh, don't worry about me. I'll be okay. I've just been staying up later than usual recently. If I muffle my yawns, it's like I'm not even tired! Nn...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Oh, you... Don't sleep in the next class too, okay? I won't just let it go this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>If I remember correctly, it was red for passion, blue for peace, yellow for sincerity, violet for charm, and...wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Green cacao for courage, and orange for friendship, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Brown doesn't do much, but it's supposed to be exceptionally delicious!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Wow, Emma... So you were listening in class that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh? No, you lent me your notebook to study afterwards.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hm... Is that how it was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The two of you have always been thick as thieves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A-anyway, what's with all this security? Even if this is the real Rainbow Cacao, isn't this number of guards overkill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>To bring all of us out just for this... Do we all really need to be here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>True...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Ah... Right, I guess it would seem like overkill to someone who's never taken part in this event before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Oh yeah! The two of you still haven't yet seen for yourselves the true terror of the Rainbow Cacao...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Grrrrrr!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>A monster?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Exactly! Here it comes!</td>
