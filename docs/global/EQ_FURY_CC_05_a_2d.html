<td>"Have you ever wanted to die?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>"Have you ever tried to kill yourself?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Many times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>"Have you ever wished the opposite—to survive?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Only once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>"A miraculous survival, huh? Wow." "Everyone's dead—except her."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>"The people of Wadatsumi must have something pretty powerful protecting them." "Wish I did."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>"Not me. You couldn't pay me to be one of them." "I don't even like being on the same team as 'em."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>"So, the Holy Guard is an organization that uses force to deal with problems caused by Alchemy."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>"Meanwhile, the inquisitors of the Holy Order of Babel keep watch on the Holy Guard and all others who would misuse Alchemy. They keep them on a leash and everyone else in line."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>"But what happens if there's a Paladin they can't stop?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>"That'd throw 'em for a loop, huh?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>"Why won't she die?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>"To hear her tell it, she just forgot how."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Nothing is more frightening than a human who is unafraid of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>When such a person is also highly proficient at wielding Alchemy, and well-versed in the martial arts of Wadatsumi... That is fearsome indeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Aw, shucks. You're making me blush, Captain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My apologies. I simply find myself at a bit of a loss for words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There's no right answer. I don't know what it might be, myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From what I gather, you are incapable of death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet nobody knows why. It could be a disease of some sort; it could be magic. Even the Holy Order of Babel has been unable to determine the cause. You yourself claim to have simply forgotten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Some suspect that you have made a contract with the darkness. Some within the organization view you as a dangerous entity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>To make a contract with the darkness⁠—to receive immense power in exchange for your flesh or senses⁠—is an act so forbidden as to eclipse the taboo of Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Yeah, so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I don't care what was taken from me. I'm not going to die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Sure, I'm an unknown and my background isn't pretty. The Holy Guard doesn't want my existence going public, but it'd be a waste not to use me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've heard people whispering about sending me and my powers off on some impossible mission that I'd have no chance of coming back from alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>To be frank, there are those here who would attempt to use you in such a way. I, however—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I think that'd be the right thing to do. It'd make things more peaceful.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Ikasa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I accept my mission as a Secret Knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You might not be under my command anymore, but you will always be part of the 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You can come back and rejoin us, anytime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm really happy to hear that...even though I know I'll never see this place again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"You're up, Obliviated."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>"Finished putting on your makeup?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hey! You said you wouldn't peek.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait, Wadatsumi?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>"The prolonged internal conflict incited by the powerful clans of Wadatsumi is dying down."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>"Yet there are countries who would use this opportunity to threaten the weakened nation."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>You mean Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>"They're demanding that Wadatsumi relaxes its restrictions on foreign policy, while secretly laying the groundwork for political sanctions and economic interference."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>"It's only a matter of time before they declare war. Of course, the general public is being kept in the dark about it all."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>They're planning to invade!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>"Maybe, but Greed Dike has a pretty sound pretext for doing so."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>"When Wadatsumi started opening up to foreign relations, it became clear that they misuse Alchemy within their borders to a shocking degree."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>"So they plan to justify the invasion by playing it off as a righteous punishment."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>"That's where you come in. Your assignment is to get a certain shrine maiden as far away from Wadatsumi as possible."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>"In its current impoverished state, Wadatsumi doesn't stand a chance against Greed Dike's attack."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>"It's almost guaranteed that if Greed Dike begins its invasion, Wadatsumi will fall."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>"That's why our client, clan of the shrine maiden, decided to have its promising shrine maidens flee the country in secret."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The Holy Guard cannot act for the benefit of any nation, whether that be Wadatsumi or Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Wadatsumi's misuse of Alchemy has only taken place within the nation's own borders. Its sovereignty protects it from the Holy Guard's judgement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>"Exactly. It goes without saying that they can't give the shrine maidens safe harbor after they escape, either. Therefore the only thing the Holy Guard can do is—"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Use their Secret Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>"The Holy Order of Babel would prefer to prevent those shrine maidens, whose powers violate their precious code, from wandering around willy-nilly."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>"They also want to avoid having Alchemy run rampant in the war with Greed Dike."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>"That's why the shrine maiden you'll be taking care of is going to be sent overseas on a study trip, without being made aware of the real situation."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>"If Wadatsumi doesn't get invaded, wonderful. She'll enjoy herself and head back home. This plan is just a precaution, in case war does break out."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>"If it does, though... Well, you might not make it out alive."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Hmph.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>You know I can't die, right?</td>
</tr>
