</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/ikas.png" alt="Ikasa" height="128"><br>Ikasa</td>
<td>Use their Secret Knights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"The Holy Order of Babel would prefer to prevent those shrine maidens, whose powers violate their precious code, from wandering around willy-nilly."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>"They also want to avoid having Alchemy run rampant in the war with Greed Dike."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
