<td>Wh-what is that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>A tower of light?! Is that the legendary Tower of Babel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That must be the legendary tower His Excellency has done all this for.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Finally, the time has come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Now, my friend, descend before us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Haa... Haa...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Th-this is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Glorious, isn't it? This is the legendary tower sought by the most powerful people in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wha—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Before you stands the ancient herald of the greatest of alchemists, the true form of the Tower of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You should be honored to be present at this historic moment, Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>The glow of divinity... The Alchemy Source awaits me at the end of this light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Don't you understand that what you're doing could destroy this world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Of course. None who are without power will be left alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Why, you...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>If everything will come to an end, then so be it. I will be the founder of a new nation built on the ashes of the old.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So survival of the fittest is the code you will enforce upon this world? You're no different from Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sol? Hmph, I should be offended to be seen in the same light as that whelp. Still, I will concede that he and I may seem the same to those who can only comprehend the superficial process of restructuring the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>From ancient times to the present, humans have evolved and their civilizations have made spectacular advances to follow suit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yet, even after such advances, humans continue to fight amongst each other. Why do you think that is?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Are you trying to say it's because our civilization is not grounded in the "survival of the fittest" ideal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Exactly. The sinfully proud notion that the weak must be treated as equals of the strong is what causes all of the tragedy in this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There will always be strife without clear, incontestable differentiation between the weak and the strong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>How can you believe that?! A world where people are segregated can only cause more conflict! Isn't that obvious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>You are wrong. Those with true power will lead and those without will follow. This structure, if enforced properly, will leave no room for conflict to arise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>If that whelp was advocating for such a world, then he had the right idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is that truly your ideal world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The world I dream of lies beyond anything that whelp was able to imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Beyond...? What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I dream of a world in which we have overthrown the gods and freed ourselves of their rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>The gods?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Nnrgh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You still live? You are not as weak as I expected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Ugh... Wh-why are you here?! I-I told you...n-not to follow me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I'll do as I please! Let go of Captain Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>N-no... Stay back. He's...out of your league.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I'm well aware of that! I met him in the palace and saw his power for myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Does this Lord Commander have difficulty learning?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Can you not see it was such foolish bravado that resulted in the death of Cadanova, the Flame Dragon King?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>You're wrong! It was Captain Cadanova who taught me that a strong heart is the most powerful weapon one can have in times of distress!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I believe he is watching over me now, and I know it was his teachings that got me through the fight against Sol!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Hmph. I take it your overconfidence comes from your luck in defeating that whelp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I must say, if you were having trouble with him, then you will certainly be outmatched here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Sol said you might equal his strength after getting your hands on the Alchemy Source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>An equal? To him? Is that what the whelp thought? Hahahahaha!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>What's so funny?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The only reason you could best Captain Kudan is due to his wounds from the battle against the Templars!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>If we were to fight you together—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I-it wouldn't make a d-difference...if I were at f-full strength.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I-I'm telling you! Leave! Th-this man is f-far beyond your level!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Has he already attained Nimul's powers?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>N-no! We simply underestimated...the caliber of those who are fit to be called...a Vessel of Reincarnation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Hahaha. "The only reason"? I am in no way overconfident of my strength. If I ever felt Sol would become a threat, I would have immediately moved to subjugate him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Do you mean you've always had power surpassing that of Sol?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>It looks like there's still some time until the manifestation of Nimul. Since you're here, perhaps you can provide me with a little entertainment.</td>
