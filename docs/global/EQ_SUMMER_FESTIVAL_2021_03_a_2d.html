<td>I don't see anyone around. But I don't imagine they've given up, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>For now, shall we go speak to the townsfolk? There are a lot of people here for the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Hey! Over here! This way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Wait! If you go so fast, I'll lose you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Here, take my hand! That way we won't get separated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Friends holding hands and running along... What a happy pair!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I suppose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This makes me look forward to enjoying the festival with Ephylinde.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>You really like that person, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yes... Though I did terrible things to her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Still, even now I would like to share this view with her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Don't you care what you did?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Of course. But it's Ephylinde who gets to decide whether or not to be around me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What is it that you are looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I just went to see everyone having fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Though even spotting them, I can't join them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Th-This is so wrong!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>E-Everyone murdered... B-But me still alive? Is that right? Is that proper?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Will there be peace?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>When morning comes, the people of Wadatsumi, the soldiers, me, and Button would all burn up in the flames of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Our only option would be to wait for death. And this is the only way for you to survive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>This is the only correct solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It was a clever trick...creating a situation where a choice had to be made with no explanation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Having considered what you said... That's a load of crap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Sure, it started out the way you said, but after that, she made the choice herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>She chose to live with us filled with her hatred. To live as FÃ¼ry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Don't find blame in that decision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>She was resolved and made her choice. But what about you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Me? I hadn't thought much about me. Though, I think I got what I was after.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well, I suppose I have no quarrel with that notion. I'm sorry to have spoken so much and said so little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Sol really gets worked up, doesn't he?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Just drop it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I'm surprised, as well. You're quite...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>That's why I said "drop it."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I meant to compliment you. I'm sure it's because of the way you are that Button survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I'm grateful that I was able to entrust her well-being to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Pl-Please stay away from me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Don't be like that! C'mon, let's have some fun together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's your job to entertain us, right? You work for the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>That's not right at all! Please, leave me alone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>What is going on? Are they drunk?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Seems that way. Guess they've been having a little too much fun at the festival.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>The woman seems unable to pull away... Doesn't she remind you of that child a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Maybe... What do you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...I'll go take a look. All this noise is ridiculous.</td>
