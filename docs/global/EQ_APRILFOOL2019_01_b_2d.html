<td>Argh! I am not Headstrong Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Dias, there's been something wrong with father lately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Zeke found us, and so we were able to grow up in such a loving environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But lately, I've been hearing strange voices coming from his room. They sound like the squeals of a groupie to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>No... That's not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>It's true! Father even has an idol poster up in his room!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>He must have become one of them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Don't be foolish! This is Zeke Crowley, the hero of Envylia we are talking about! He wouldn't dare stoop so low as to become an idol groupie!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Logi... I'm scared to go home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I can still hear him in my head... Father, cheering for his favorite idol...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You've heard it too, haven't you, Dias?! What will become of the Blue Flame Guard's morale?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Silence! These are nothing more than rumors! You know nothing of father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>What're you ranting about, boy?Â I heard you saved the village from monsters. It appears you've been running around, doing as you please...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Father! Y-you're not some groupie for any idol, are you, Father?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I heard the cheers coming from your room, Father. Who is Miyu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>From here, we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Don't change the subject, Father!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Come to think of it... Last night, in the camp, I heard father talking in his sleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Something about wanting to drip maple syrup onto Miyu's dimples...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>So now even father is turning into Headstrong Zeke...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Quit expanding on Headstrong Dias!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Father? Are you a groupie for some idol?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>From here we enter the Woods of Mystical Nights. Our destination is the Gilrack Ruins beyond that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Father! You keep trying to change the subject!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Father! Agatha is giving you a glare full of contempt! Are you okay with that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Logi, Dias, you join the scouting party. Agatha, you come with me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Absolutely not!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Agatha... You're hurting daddy's feelings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Father! You're not acting like yourself!</td>
</tr>
