<td>Yes?</td>

<td>What about Eve made you fall in love?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>What about her? Well, let's see…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>First, I'd say it's her smile. Her carefree smile always brightens my day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Then, I'd say it's her work ethic. She always devotes herself to her "Bridal Training."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Her training method was crazy intense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>…But you're right. It's really impressive to train yourself that hard in order to break the curse.</td>

<td>To break the curse…</td>

<td>There's nothing I won't do in order to marry Fraise and build a happy family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, I train. Day in and day out! That's why I call it "Bridal Training."</td>

<td>013</td>
<td>…So, she's been doing it all by herself…</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Fraise?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Let's go. I can't let her go on fighting alone.</td>
