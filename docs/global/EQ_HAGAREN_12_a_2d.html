<td>The towers in all six nations have ceased operation. Well done, Alphonse. Let's not forget Toritoh and Edgar, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But there's still one more left to defeat in order to actually stop the transmutation circle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>There's a tower-like spire in the shrine where Alphonse and everyone from Amestris were transmuted into being. The place I once considered to be my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That makes sense. Well...we have to make our way back to Northern Pride anyway, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I heard from Miss Riza that the souls of those who were sacrificed will continue to be absorbed as long as they're within the confines of the transmutation circle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Once all of the souls are completely absorbed, the Dimensional Gate will open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>My soul is already on its last legs... I think I was already aware...that I would probably die, wherever I went.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>So that's why you seemed sick while we were in Greed Dike...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But there's no reason to give up yet! We can still save you if we bring down that shrine tower!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Although, I'm not sure how probable it is that we can accomplish that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's no time to call any allies to the battlefront. We're just going to have to make do with those already there.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'm sure everyone is already prepared for battle...but the stakes are higher this time, because we could lose Toritoh! So, don't forget...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Wait, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Wh-what is it, General? There's no way you're thinking of giving up and sacrificing yourself, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No. I won't sacrifice myself for the Holy Order. The Holy Order gave me power and status, but they took everything else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My people, my friends, my home, my travels... Even good food. Nothing was left for me...not even anger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>However, my life and my soul are not for the Order to sacrifice. They are mine to dedicate to standing with all of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That's what I want. Instead of letting someone else tell me what to do, instead of following along...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I will move forward on a path of my own choosing and live for no one but myself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Toritoh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>For the people of Babel, I will unite with those of you from Amestris, and hope that when we say goodbye, we can do it with a smile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Please, lend me your strength and allow me to fight at your side!</td>
