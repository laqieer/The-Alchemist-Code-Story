<td>Is this...an Alkaroid? Plus, its mechanism is based on the Beckrams!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What's going on? Why are the Beckrams attacking me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Instead of rattling on, how about you chase them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're gonna lose your valuable item to those dogs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Huh?! Argh! Come back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! There's no way I can catch up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>If you have time to talk, then move your legs. Only a desperate struggle yields the sweet nectar of victory!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Th-that's impossible! There's no way a human can catch up with an Alkaroid running at full speed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sigh. Honestly. Why did he leave a job to someone so inadequate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Wh-what...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Whatever it is the dogs took from you...I guess it's not that important to you, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I'll take care of the rest. You run back home and go to bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ack! A mafia-like you wouldn't understand!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That Alkaroid has the latest state-of-the-art abilities...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'm talking about your attitude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It doesn't matter if you're a mafia or a repairman.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You can't entrust anything to someone who isn't willing to risk their own lives for their job.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>That bell is a symbol of Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I like the sound of that bell. After all, it's the sound of happiness!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Listen up, repairman. For a man, work is not just a means to eat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I know that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>There's no way I'm surrendering it to those blasted dogs! Agh! I'm gonna catch up with them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Hmph. Look at you, suddenly showing some spine. Next time, try doing that from the start. Let's go, men!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Leave it to us, Don! We've evacuated all residents from each street!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The dogs are headed down Rozalt Street towards the main road! We can take them on whenever you're ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Wh-what the...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>There are different ways to fight depending on your opponent. There's no point in fighting blindly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Don Taras!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We'll take care of the dogs. After all, this is the job that I've staked my life on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Repairman, you better get back the item you repaired as if your life depended on it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Got it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>All right, men, let's put on a show! Once we get back to the mansion, we've got the highest quality champagne waiting for us. Let's hurry up and get this over with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huff...huff... I finally caught up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Well then, I'll have you return the key to the sound of happiness in this city!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I'm surprised that Don Taras intervened.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It was a miscalculation. If that man is starting to get involved, then it can make things complicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Shall we retreat?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yes. In any case, we've reaped our rewards. The fact that Edward took out the Philosopher's Stone is an indisputable fact.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Find the location of the Philosopher's Stone that he's acquired.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Understood!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The mafia who control the underground world, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>If we bring them in, it'll give us a decent amount of strength. Let's go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Okay. All that's left is to set this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Father, look! A wedding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Congratulations on your wedding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>You better be happy, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Ohh! The bell is ringing! Veloz must have made it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. He returned the sound of the bell to the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The sound of happiness, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Thank you, Veloz. You've allowed for a worthy congratulations to a new beginning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I'll take back my words from earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?! What is this thing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>When I said that bell should be removed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>The sound of that bell isn't only congratulating those two on their wedding...but it brings happiness to the people of this city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Hahah. Don't worry about it. After all, you're the one who fixed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...Veloz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Perhaps I wanted the sound of this bell to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Huh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I wanted to ring it...just for her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Veloz...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>But that isn't the sound that she would've wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>The sound she liked was the one that celebrated and imparted happiness to everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh, Veloz!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Fiona, how was it compared to the bells from last time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Yes, it was the same sound! Just like last time, it was a very loud sound! You fixed it, didn't you, Veloz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No, I'm the one who should be thanking you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>This bell taught me how to face myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I just did my job the best that I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Wow! It really is an amazing sound! I'm sure this...will reach her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>You told me, didn't you, Veloz? About the person who went far away.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>This bell is big, so I'm sure it is reaching that person! That's what I think!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>You think she can hear it, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm sure you're right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>One day, I want to hear the sound of this bell on my wedding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>In that case, Fiona, until you get married, I promise to fix it every time it breaksâ€”no matter how many times that might be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Really? You promise?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>It looks like the time that had stopped is moving once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Now I can no longer afford to die until the young lady celebrates her wedding day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Hehe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Can you hear the sound of the bell?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I'll do my best here a little longer...to deliver this sound of happiness to you.</td>
</tr>
