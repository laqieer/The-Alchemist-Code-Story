<td>Lost in thought again, Kamui?</td>

<td>003</td>
<td>Ah, Hisham... Lately, I've been preoccupied with ominous thoughts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I have this strange sense that someone has been manipulating the breakout of all these wars across the continent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There's no point in worrying about it if you have no concrete information regarding the issue. Was it not you who taught me that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You're...right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Why not go get some fresh air?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I've been asked to do a favor, but a long trek like that would be too harsh for this old body to handle.</td>

<td>Now, don't make that face. It's the natural order of things for people to age and die. I'd rather see you smile.</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I have lived my life to its fullest. I couldn't say it was the easiest or happiest life, but it wasn't a bad one.</td>

<td>Oh...</td>

<td>A request to deal with some monsters?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's a request from a village that we just formed ties with. Could you take care of this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sure. I suppose I won't solve anything by shutting myself in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Some exercise should do me some good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Grrrrrrr...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Well, this is quite a spectacle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There are a few too many monsters here for this to have happened naturally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I seem to have been set up. Not unduly so, but... What is this? A test?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Grrroooohhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I better just focus on the task at hand first.</td>
