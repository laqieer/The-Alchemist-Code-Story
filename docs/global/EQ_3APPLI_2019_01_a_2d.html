<td>I pinched my cheek, and it hurt...</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>But this has to be a dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I...don't think it is, Mira.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I feel like I did something irrevocably bad...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>So do I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm not the kind of big sister who can protect her brother after finding him next to some girl, you know!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Could you...not put it like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?! Is this a dream?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It appears not, Almace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>No! Wh-what...? Where am I?! Where is Master?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I am not sure... Nowhere in the vicinity, it seems, although we were all together only moments ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I-I'm not worried or anything, though!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I did not ask if you were.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>A blue-haired knight and a...fairy?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>We must be hallucinating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I'm telling you, we're not.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I feel like I know this place, like I've seen it before...but I'm not sure. Is this deja vu? What do you think, Nyx?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure we're somewhere in Babel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It feels like Babel, but also...different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It feels different, but also...kinda like Babel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It seems like Babel, but also...not...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It does look like Babel, but there's something different about the flow of Alchemia here from that of our time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Whoops! Looks like I must have overdone it! Silly me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Acting all cute won't solve anything.</td>

<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>Ngh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>It is perfectly understandable for you to feel confused. We are all in the same boat here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>So, where are you from? What is your name?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I'm a k-kunoichi from the land of Wintry Snows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh! U-um... Can you hear me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Your voice is so soft! You've gotta speak up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm... I'm a kunoichi from the land of Wintry Snows. My name is Hiiragi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Why don't you try again! Louder, this time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>L-louder...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ahem... My name is Hiiragi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Until very recently, I thought I was a normal girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>I like pretty stones, and going on walks. I'm just...me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>But then I performed the Blood Covenant, and my entire life changed in an instant. Before I knew it, my normal everyday became...well, a little extraordinary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I found myself in a place that was neither the Ninja Village, nor the land of Wintry Snows...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>And a boy I've never seen before was staring at me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>This is definitely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>A nightmare!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>A few minutes earlier...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>La dee dah, la dee doo...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Taking a nice, long bath after a battle... Nothing could be better than this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ahhh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Mmm... I'm all warm and clean, like a fresh towel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I feel reborn!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>I'm going to swim underwater! No one's here, after all. It'll be my little secret... Hee hee!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Ready... Sploosh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Wha...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>What?! Aaaahh! Oh, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I have come to bring an end to this time, Lost Ragnarok, in which humankind has been stripped of their dignity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>(I certainly feel like I've been stripped of my dignity!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Have no fear, Killer Princess Almace is here! Manifesting Fae-Fused Teirlinck​ Titania!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Tinnie! What is that thing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>I-I'm not sure! I've never seen its like before!</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I-I'm sorry! It's not like I meant to look at you! This was beyond my control! Well, I mean, I did bring myself here, but—</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>M-M-Mira! I-it's not what it looks like! I promise! I didn't mean for this to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Not what it looks like? I'm looking at my dear, sweet little brother with some strange girl... Is there something wrong with my vision?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Yes—I mean, no! I mean—I know exactly how this looks, but this is all just a misunderstanding!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I hadn't realized you'd grown up so much...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>M-Mira! Stop jumping to conclusions! I swear, this is just—!</td>

<td>Th-that was me. I stopped time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>I'm not looking at you, okay? I promise. So hurry up and get dressed, okay?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>O-oh! My clothes, and my weapons! They're right here. I was so flustered, I didn't notice them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>W-well, I expect they came with you when you were brought here. That's probably how it—whatever's going on here—works. A-anyway, please just get dressed, will you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>R-right...</td>
