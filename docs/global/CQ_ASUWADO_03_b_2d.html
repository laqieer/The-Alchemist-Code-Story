<td>A-argh! You'll pay for this!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>What idiots to so foolishly overestimate their own competence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You understand now, don't you? This world isn't filled with good people. You'd better be more careful in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>But I was all right this time too because you saved me, Aswald. Thank you!</td>

<td>006</td>
<td>Besides, I'm sure those people had their reasons. I pray that their souls may find peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>They were nothing more than thieves. As a Shrine Maiden, there's no need for you to consider the "reasons" of those who live in the world of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You know my identity? I feel embarrassed... I'm still so immature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>If only I had a lot more candy, I'm sure I could have healed their hearts without any conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't understand you. How can you speak that way about people who pointed their swords at you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Mmm. People often tell me that I'm too blissful, but here's what I think:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>How wonderful of a world would it be if everyone trusted each other and lived in bliss?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>In order to achieve that, I'll have to start with me. After all, it's my idea! If I want others to trust me, I have to trust first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>A world where everyone lives in bliss? What a naïve idealism.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Eheheh. Do you think so? ...Sigh. Maybe I am too blissful in my naivety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, you are...but, maybe that's the reason why people reach out to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>In order for others to trust you, you have to trust them first, huh? I see. That's the reason why everyone seems to place their trust in you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Shrine Maiden Kuon! Who are you doing out here all alone?! You're putting yourself in harm's way. Come now. Let's return home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It looks like your people have come to take you back. See you around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Oh...wait, please! Take this, Aswald.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>It's the rest of the candy. I want to give it to you! It's really delicious, so, if you eat a lot of it, it'll make you really happy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I guess you won't take any candy that's offered to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>No. I'll take it. It's a candy so delicious that it'll bring peace to this world, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Yes, of course! Please, put some faith in my taste buds♪</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Thank you for saving me over and over again! Well then, I have to say goodbye now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Let's eat candy together again next time!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Next time, huh? I doubt that will ever happen. The world that an assassin and a Shrine Maiden live in are too far apart. There is a darkness to my world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Still, I'm glad to have seen that not all worlds are filled with darkness—that there are those overflowing with light.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That'll probably be the last time anyone ever calls me a "good person." It really threw me off my stride.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>...Still, it's not bad to have days like these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>The candy... It's sweet.</td>
