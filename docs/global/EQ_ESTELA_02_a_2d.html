<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Hello, Amis. You've come back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yes. I'm sorry I left in such a hurry the other day. Is everything alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What do you mean by alright?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I heard that after we left the other day that the you were threatened by some thug.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>There was no need to worry. Being a fortune teller, these things commonly occur.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Did you know who the person was?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>No. It was the first time ever seeing him. I have no recollection…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>In any regards, could you tell me what is concerning you today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, yes of course. I apologize. First I have to thank you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>After your reading, I evaluated the flow about the preparation of the goods and found some concerns.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I managed to arrange a different route to secure the goods. They almost didn't make it in time for the ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It was all thanks to your help. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure there are more things to be improved…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>That's why I want you to go into further detail. I think the ceremony will go well if you could tell me more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Estella? Is something the matter?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>No, nothing…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I will accept your request, but I need to know the subject deeply in order to tell you further details.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Then I think you should see the ceremony's preparation for your own eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Amis, take her to the Central Technology Bureau. Explain to her about the ceremony. Just not the restricted areas.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Understood. And you…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>For me, I recalled an errand I must run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Really… Just off by himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>(But that's alright. I can't rely on him forever. I'll have to take charge of the ceremony.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>(Because, I…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Amis?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'll…take you to the Central Technology Bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Maintenance inspection of the Magitek Train is complete. It's time to do a test run.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Wow… What an enormous structure of metal. So this is the Magitek Train…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Pretty big, isn't it? This is what we've been researching and constructing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Vice-captain Amis, you're back! About the amount of heat given off by the train… We'd like for you to have a look at this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Let's see. So, this is… Alright. These figures look stable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Vice-captain, could you also take a look at this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>And this please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(She's very passionate about the work. And she doesn't have much time to spare...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>(But she's calmer than when she came to see me the other day. I assume that she took my readings as my advice.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Hmm… That's not coming back any time soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>You're…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I'm Megistos. I'm a clerk here. You're that fortune teller that helped us out, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>You're exaggerating. I just gave a little advice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Not exaggerating at all. Thanks to the advice, I was able to get my job done without any anxiety.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Everyone is looking forward to tomorrow's ceremony. We've all worked hard together to get the train up and running.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Why is everyone so obsessed with this train?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Because this is a feat of engineering which could bring new possibilities for the future of the world..</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Alchemic carriages are commonly used for travel, but they take a lot of time to travel far. In addition, there aren't many available.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>But with a smoothly operating train, many people can be transported far in a single journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>The day will come in which even people without magic abilities could travel anywhere they want easily.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>For engineers like us, it's an exciting time to think about, so everyone is enthusiastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Even more so for Amis, who researched and developed trains from scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Is that so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Well, I personally think the train would be even better if it was loaded with a giant cannon…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>What would be good about that? If you put a giant cannon on a train, it would collapse with the weight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Oh, you're back. In that case, I'll leave customer service to the vice-captain, and I'll go back to my post.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That Megistos…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I apologize, I was the one who brought you here but I'm going off working and neglecting you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>I don't mind. It's necessary to see you working as you would be for a better reading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And I can admire your positive attitude. Isn't this Magitek Train very special for you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Yes. It was something I was researching about even before I came to the Central Technology Bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>It wasn't about having or not having the skills, but my desire to create something that would help everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>The train is sure to be dream come true for many people. That's why I want tomorrow's ceremony to be a success and your help is what we need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Tomorrow's ceremony will be the unveiling of the train. If all goes accordingly, we'll be able to put it into practical use…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I want everything to be prepared well. So please let me know if you see anything wrong with tomorrow's ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Excuse me, Vice-captain Amis. Could you please look at this? We need urgent confirmation…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>I'm sorry, please excuse me for a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Okay then…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I think I have everything I need to make a reading. Let me have a little look…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Again, the dark shadow… This is…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>(It's the same shadow from before… Is this the future of a mechanical civilization?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>(But why? I thought I was able to help with the root of the problem, but how could that not solve anything?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>V-vice-captain Amis! We have a problem. The parts needed for maintenance…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>What happened?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>They've all been destroyed. What's the meaning of this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>No, this can't be! This is horrible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>Jean, what are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>I was wondering what was going on because of the ruckus. This is troubling. You might not be able to fix this in time for tomorrow's ceremony…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>I was also looking forward to your presentation highly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>It's alright. We'll manage to do get everything together for the ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Jean, you should go back to your work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>Understood. But don't wear yourself out. You tend to overwork yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>What are we supposed to do? These parts are specific for the train.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>There's no way we can get replacements! If we don't have the parts, the ceremony tomorrow…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>We did so much to prepare for it…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>It'll be fine. I'll do something about it. If we can't use them, we'll make new ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh? Make new ones…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Everyone! Gather the bureau's metal scraps and bring them here immediately!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>Y-yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>You're going to build the parts out of scrap metal? With magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Wait a minute. You can't do this to yourself. The amount of magic needed is too much for you to handle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>But if it's the only thing we can do, I have to give it my all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>We've brought it all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>Thank you. Okay… This should be enough…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Amis!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I'm alright… Just a bit more…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>We must present the train. We'll show the world what it can do. For that, I'll do whatever it takes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I'll…never give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>So, all the parts are ready, but she's knocked herself out. Ugh… All while I'm out…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>I don’t ever recall telling you to kill yourself over all of this…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>This is how much passion she had for tomorrow's ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Or, for beyond tomorrow, that is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>By visiting this place, I was able to see more of the dark shadows that haunt her future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>The pressure of becoming the next director is pushing a lot of stress on her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Because she's strict. I keep telling her that she doesn't need put so much pressure on herself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>But she doesn't listen. There are some that don't her as a boss because of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>She has the ability to use magic, but she's making things more difficult for herself. Thinking too much is hindering things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>The goal of the Central Technology Bureau is to advance mechanical technology. It's not about what it's used for. Even magic can be used for advancement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Being able to use magic and engineering together shouldn't lead to faults like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Then why did you promote Amis as the next director?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>That's obvious. She has passion for both mechanical engineering and magic engineering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Passion, you say…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>A while back, I asked her why she wanted to join us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>This is what she said. "Because one machine can equal the hands and feet of ten thousand of people."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>You can't use magic without special qualities. But not for machines.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>Machines can benefit everyone. They can also provide hope. It's a wonderful feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>The possibilities are infinite. That's why I want mechanical engineering to help the world… All from the Central Technology Bureau.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Her words of "the hands and feet of ten thousand people" has basically become reality with this train.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Her proposals were turned down a number of times, but she never gave up. And here we are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>If we really are to expand mechanical technology for the future, she's what we need at the lead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>I see. I also think she'd be a great leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>In order to create a better future, she won't give up and will do her best, no matter how difficult it may seem.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>(And so I wouldn't want her to emotionally fall apart here…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>(I still can't see the crucial point. What is this dark shadow pointing towards for the ceremony?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>(There's not enough information to make a prediction. The ceremony is tomorrow… I need more time to look for myself.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>(Then…)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>Our fortune telling skills can help support people to do better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>Now I understand what my mother meant. I want to see a successful future. I want to be part of a successful future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>My mother was able to do fortune telling because there were people who made her feel that way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>The powers that I inherited from her… Now is the time to shine…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Good. This should disrupt the ceremony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>That's…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>And now, this should put a stop to everything!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>…?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>(A barrier should have been placed… Did I put too much power into the spirit divination?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>What can I do for you? I didn't think I had any reservations today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>I got a job to make sure you stop reading fortunes. You're going to go to sleep for a little while.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>(This is bad… I can't control my body as I want to because of spirit divination...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>Grrraaaa!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>…!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Stop it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>Amis?! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Let's talk later! First, let's get rid of this guy!</td>
</tr>
