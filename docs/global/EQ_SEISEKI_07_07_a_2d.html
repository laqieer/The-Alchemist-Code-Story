<td>Currently. Near the foot of Ramproad Mountain.</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>The Shadow Messiah...?! This Spica woman? She's Zahar's underling?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Formerly. That's in the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Well, that might be the case, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Spica simply admired Zahar. They weren't aiming for the same ideals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>She isn't guilty of anything. But that's not enough to convince you, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>If you tell me that, Commander Chloe...I'll believe you! She's my friend as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Huh? Well, I guess you're pretty honest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Of course I am! After all, I respect you. There's no way I wouldn't believe what you say!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Th-thanks... Hey...why do you look up to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? It's obvious... You're the Royal Commander of the Scarlet Flame Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I don't think it's just that. You've been looking up to me ever since you joined the Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Well...how can I say it...you kind of remind me of my older sister, Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your older sister?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>My parents died when I was young, so I was raised by my older brother and sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I have a younger brother and sister as well, but they did their best to look after all three of us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>That sounds like it must've been hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It was. But, I had no idea of how hard it was for them, so I did whatever I pleased.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I heard a little about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Apparently, you started a fight with a gang of outlaws and Captain Vettel, who happened to be passing by, saved you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yes. Captain Vettel told me then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>"You can never truly become strong through physical strength alone."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>He said that there was no point in only having the power to hurt people.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You cannot save people with power alone...you need to learn how to reach people's hearts. That was Captain Vettel's philosophy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Actually, my older brother and sister told me the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My brother and sister had given me the same advice as Captain Vettel from long ago. When I realized that, my eyes were opened for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>So that's when you first realized how much the two of them had struggled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes. Wanting to make amends, I said that I would work for my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But my brother and sister told me that's not what they wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Learning about my admiration for Captain Vettel, they sent me off, telling me to become an honorable knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sure they actually wanted to follow their own dreams as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>What they did isn't something that's very easily done. You have a wonderful brother and sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Yes! I'm very proud of my family! And I feel that they overlap with you and Captain Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>For me, the Scarlet Flame Guard is like my family. I'm sorry. Did I make you feel bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Not at all! I'm glad to hear you see me the same way as your respectable older sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Really?! Thanks!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Commander Chloe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Huh?! What're you all doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We took care of the ruffians faster than we thought we would so we made our way here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I see. Thank you, everyone!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Well, that's one problem taken care of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Sorry! Please hurry and take Commander Chloe and this individual to see a doctor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Huh? Victor...where are you planning on going?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I'm gonna return to Commander Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Huh?! Are you planning on picking a fight with Basheeny again?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No, it's nothing like that. It's just...something about the look in his eyes has been bothering me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>The look in his eyes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>When he said that he was an assassin, he really seemed to be telling the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>It's better to be safe than sorry. Don't worry! I won't cause any unnecessary disputes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>He-hey...Victor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Meanwhile. Halfway up Ramproad Mountain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>For now, I've avoided making a report to Kagura. Are you sure they don't need to make their way down the mountain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>If they encounter Captain Kudan while descending the mountain, it'll be dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>It'll be safer if she hides herself away with Miuna.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>That being said...how did they know that we're here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Just in case of an emergency, I made a report to the higher-ups of the Holy Order.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Outside of Captain Yauras and Captain Othima, that's the only other possibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>It must be Waginau. I'm certain he's connected with Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Is it safe to assume that he's hiding within Greed Dike?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>If he's been brainwashed with the ideals of the Lion Monarch Orion then convincing him otherwise might not be an option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Don't worry. A year or so won't be enough to eliminate the time that we spent together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I just hope that's the case...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Um. What do you mean by convince him...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>We're going to convince Captain Kudan. If he goes missing again it'll be troublesome, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Huh? Do all of you think that Captain Kudanstein is coming back?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>We're gonna make him come back—even if it's by force. We owe an obligation of a lifetime to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>No way. Are you being serious?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I mean, he's the one who tore the Holy Guard to shreds. There's no way that a person like him would come...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Stop spewing nonsense. I am under no obligation to hear the opinion of a trainee like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>U-ughh...! I-it hurts!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Tsk...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Cough...cough...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If we were to get into a fight with Kudan...a trainee like you will just get in the way of things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>If you've finished your work here then hurry back to headquarters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Commander Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You can stay here. After all, you're my bodyguard. Try to rest a little.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Cough...! Why did he get so mad? I don't understand it at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Regardless of how it appears, Captain Monzein wants to believe in the bond he shares with Captain Kudan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>I know it's difficult to comprehend under these circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>The bond...? Isn't it really impractical to hold onto something so uncertain?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>If people have different ways of thinking, the only wave to solve it is by twisting arms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>People follow those with more power than them. That's how this world functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>I'm pretty sure Captain Kudanstein feels the same way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>You've been Kanon's bodyguard and yet you've learned nothing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>If you're gonna go by sheer strength, then there are so many others that have more power than Kanon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>However, that's not the reason why she was selected as Lord Commander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>It's because she values something that surpasses power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>You haven't realized that, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Are you talking about the burning passion within all humans that surpasses power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>You're saying the same thing as the little frog...but I don't think emotional theories like that can stop Captain Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Are you sure about that? Or maybe you've just never experienced the determination that amplifies one's power by incredible degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>The determination that amplifies one's power...? I'm not sure I believe that...but anyway...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I'm just going to focus on carrying out this mission.</td>
</tr>
