<td>Apparently, you started a fight with a gang of outlaws and Captain Vettel, who happened to be passing by, saved you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>Yes. Captain Vettel told me then...</td>

<td>"You can never truly become strong through physical strength alone."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cloe.png" alt="Chloe" height="128"><br>Chloe</td>
<td>You cannot save people with power alone...you need to learn how to reach people's hearts. That was Captain Vettel's philosophy.</td>

<td>Actually, my older brother and sister told me the same thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>My brother and sister had given me the same advice as Captain Vettel from long ago. When I realized that, my eyes were opened for the first time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cloe.png" alt="Chloe" height="128"><br>Chloe</td>
<td>So that's when you first realized how much the two of them had struggled.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>Yes. Wanting to make amends, I said that I would work for my family.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>But my brother and sister told me that's not what they wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>Learning about my admiration for Captain Vettel, they sent me off, telling me to become an honorable knight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>I'm sure they actually wanted to follow their own dreams as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cloe.png" alt="Chloe" height="128"><br>Chloe</td>
<td>What they did isn't something that's very easily done. You have a wonderful brother and sister.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>Yes! I'm very proud of my family! And I feel that they overlap with you and Captain Vettel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/vict.png" alt="Victor" height="128"><br>Victor</td>
<td>For me, the Scarlet Flame Guard is like my family. I'm sorry. Did I make you feel bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="../img/portraits/cloe.png" alt="Chloe" height="128"><br>Chloe</td>
<td>Not at all! I'm glad to hear you see me the same way as your respectable older sister.</td>

<td>The look in his eyes...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>It's better to be safe than sorry. Don't worry! I won't cause any unnecessary disputes!</td>
