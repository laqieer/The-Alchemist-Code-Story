<td>Not a single sprout. Not even a hint of one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I knew you'd be here. How many times do I have to tell you? It's impossible to grow anything here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You'll never know unless you try. Hawk's words, remember? There is no such thing as impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>To give up before even trying is...what's that word...? Uh, negligent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I'm just sayin', you should focus on what's right in front of you instead of counting on something you can't predict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>We won't be able to change anything if we think like that. Hawk entrusted us with bringing green life into this desert!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's true... I guess you're right. You do what you need to do, and I'll support you in any way I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Carla, we got a report. Caravans crossing the desert are disappearing one after another!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What?! Take me to the site! Let them know that the Sand Hawks are on the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is the area in question. Could it be monster attacks or something else targeting the caravans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>There's no point in speculating. We'll have to capture the culprits in the act and find out what we can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If we were a proper country, we'd probably be able to deal with situations like this a lot more efficiently. We need laws that will encourage people to help each other out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That way, nobody would have to deal with their issues alone...like we did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>If everybody in the desert stood up for each other, there would be fewer people who would have to go through tragedies like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It's a dream beyond a dream to turn this place into a country. The people of the desert have their hands full just trying to survive. That's why they need mercenaries like us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You're not wrong, but...we'll never know unless we try. Hm? What's that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Hello there, Sand Hawks. What a coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ankh! If you're here, then...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh, hey. I see you dragged your butts out here, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Rare to see a sloth like you getting his own hands dirty, Ryle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>What's it to you? Stay out of this. I hate having to deal with unnecessary trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We're here on business, same as you. We don't take orders from you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Were you even commissioned to be here? You probably just rushed in, hollering on about peace for the desert or whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Knowing that you only work for profit, I'm sure you're only here to eradicate something getting in the way of you making more money.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Seriously, talking to you is just...exhausting. Do you mind? We're trying to take care of things discreetly. Is it too much to ask that you please stay out of our way?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We're only here to maintain the peace within this desert. As long as your business doesn't interfere with that, we have no reason to get in your way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>This highway is a major trade route for us Desert Wings. It is a matter of utmost importance for us to rectify this situation or the whole enterprise will result in a financial loss.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>I cannot stress enough how inconvenient it would be for us if you were to meddle too much with our work here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>We're here to maintain peace in the desert, and you're here to protect your profits, but we're all here to find the cause of the disappearances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>We seem to share a same goal. Why not cooperate on this one occasion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Nah. That's too much effort. I don't care about maintaining peace, or whatever. To be honest, peace would kill my business... I'm having déjà vu. Didn't we just have this conversation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>There's no way you don't care. We all live here together. We have to depend on each other. Isn't there some part of you that wants to see peace in this place?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>My hands are full managing my guild. You're always ranting on about things too big for your boots, like building a country or bringing peace to the desert, or whatever.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Somebody has to do it. I'd rather get above myself than restrain myself to a tiny sphere of influence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You're entitled to your opinion, but please stop forcing it down my throat. I have my way of doing things and I will thank you to respect that in kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Even if we face the same crisis, you won't stand shoulder to shoulder with us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>We don't even know what is happening here. Don't just make assumptions on your own that this a crisis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Well, I guess it makes sense that you would be a bit sensitive after what happened to your friend. Just be sure you're not letting your judgment be compromised by some personal grudge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Ryle, that's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>How's your garden coming along?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Nothing yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Figures. Aren't there other things you can do instead of wasting so much time on something so futile?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Cooperation requires some kind of incentive for all to participate. The reason the Desert Zone didn't last long as a country was because they lacked that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>If only someone could find some kind of incentive for people to come together... Meh. I'll leave that kind of thinking to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All I'm saying is...trying to appeal to sentimentality will not achieve the results you're looking for. Especially when it comes to a merchant guild like ours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Master Ryle, are you all right? My apologies, but it seems that we have been surrounded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Carla, can you fight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Of course I can! What do you think we're here for?! If I didn't fight, I'd be—um, what was it again? Negligent!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>They must be the ones attacking the caravans. We'll get them and make them talk, gosh darnit!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>It seems that we've gotten involved now. What would you like to do, Master Ryle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ugh. I wouldn't "like" to do anything, but it looks like I have no choice. We'll fight.</td>
</tr>
