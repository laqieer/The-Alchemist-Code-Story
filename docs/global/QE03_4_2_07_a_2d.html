<td>Hmph... I'm impressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>H-her movements are different from the mages we've encountered up until now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>She uses her combat abilities instead of relying just on her magic. I didn't know there was a mage like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How can she move so skillfully on such an unstable scaffold?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I trained hard when I was younger. I refused to be inferior to men, even in combat abilities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>What a strange mage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Not really. All witches don't want to lose to men. That's the way of this country, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>To live in this cursed country, you need power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Lisbeth Finn Lustburg, aren't you seeking Asmodeus to obtain further power?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No...no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>You say you want to save this country, but your reason for seeking the Sacred Stone is vague.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It's hard to believe that you're doing it for the sake of others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's what all the court mages said.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But maybe you think that way because your goals have always been to become stronger than those around you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have always wanted to become like my mother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I want to be like my kind and hard-working mother who raised me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Your mother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We all never had a father...because they each sacrificed themselves so that we could live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>My mother raised me while enduring her own sorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>In this country, there are those who fight for others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Outside of our country, there are those who help wilting flowers. Not everyone wants to fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I think there's something inherently wrong with the fact that such kind people have to suffer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Our fathers became insects and newborn boys have been killed. I don't want that to happen anymore!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>That's why the first thing I did with this power was to help a boy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You used your incredible power to help another?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It may have been for myself as well. After all, I wouldn't want someone I love to become an insect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I've come this far to do this for myself and with the hope that I am helping others as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I fell in love...in this country where it's not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I refuse to believe that there's only sadness in our future!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sure nobody wants that...that's why I want to change this country!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Hehe...ahahah! It must be nice having your youth, your recklessness, and your dreams.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I do agree that there's something wrong with this country for wanting to steal such a future from youth like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I'm an adult and this is my job. If you want to advance forward then you must defeat me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That being said, I don't plan to fight to the death. I'm not like the other mages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>You're the only person that's different than the others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's just a matter of having a wider perspective when working in this vast sky. All right then...time to work!</td>
