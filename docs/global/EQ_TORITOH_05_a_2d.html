<td>What amazing power! But...I've heard of Burning Seal before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's the secret art passed down only to captains of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It can only be used at the final moment of life. It's a technique that allows one to weaponize their remaining life energy. With this...I can win.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You would go that far?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Of course I would! She is the one thing I can't lose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Everything I do now is to save Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>This power is too strong! Is this the true power of a captain of the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Ggh! Ahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Is this still not enough...? But I want to save her, no matter what...and I want to see her, no matter what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Just a bit more! Just... But I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Can I really not save my only friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Is this... Is this my fate?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>No! I won't accept that!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'd bet my life, but...it's still not enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>So this is how everything ends? Huh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Sorry for dragging you into this, Toritoh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>It was just as you said. I was too reckless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>It looks like this is the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Give in to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>(I was right.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(Ah...I wanted to see her again, at least for a moment.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>You're too used to fighting alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Toritoh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huzzaaaaaahh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Toritoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>You're the one who asked for my power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Your passion, your willingness to risk your life for her...that's enough reason for me to fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You have moved me, to tell you the honest truth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I have someone who is important to me, too, and if we were in the same situation, I'm sure I'd do the same as you are now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>If you bet your life on something, and you borrow my power to do it, then the least I can do is bet the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>That said, I've already died and become a phantom, so I have no life to offer, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I can still bet my existence itself!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Toritoh! That formâ€”!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I heard a phantom's form depends on the current state of their soul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>To think, I'm finally taking on the form that embodies my being... How naive I must've been.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This new form is proof of the brilliance of my soul, and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Of my determination not to give up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I'm always worrying someone. I always thought I was alone, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>I took that outstretched hand. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have made it this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>I can see it, now... Even now... I'm not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>My enemy may be a Sacred Stone, but I will not lose!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Lend me everything you've got, Toritoh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>It's all yours, Lakina!</td>
