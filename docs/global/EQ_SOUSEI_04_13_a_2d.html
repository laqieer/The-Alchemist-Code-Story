<td>Where...? Ah, right, I was devoured by Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>It's so cold here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That girl...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Is this really what you wanted?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Agh! My head...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ah... Ju...lia...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Silence! Don't call me by that name! I do not know her! I don't know anything about her!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Are you...okay? I'm so sorry... Right now, I can't...use my healing...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I don't need it! Just stop! Why even bother when you're half-dead yourself?! I should be nothing to you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Because...you were my friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>That is why I believe...one day, we'll be friends...again...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You're mistaken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I am a Sinner. My existence is little more than sinful magic that consumes living things without corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So... So I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Even so...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>You're my Julia...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ahh... Ungh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>E-Emmel...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>...What have I done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>This... Why have I become like this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>What's the point of feeling like this now, after all that I have done?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>If this is how things are to end, it would have been better if I had just died completely...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We're here! We're at Beelzebub's feet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>But the corruption is stronger than what we've faced already. What shall we do?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I will awaken Sephiron and put Beelzebub to sleep. That was the plan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>But... Beelzebub has grown enough to devour Sephiron... Maybe it's no longer possible to seal him away like this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We'll have to change our plan of attack...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Taking on a Cursed Beast so large will be difficult, but we have another strategy we can use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>We will enter its body and strike its core directly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>How do you plan to do that? Even getting through the Beast's shell is going to be quite the task...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>No, there is a way. If it has truly swallowed Sephiron into itself...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Yes, I will be able to open our path forward!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It's too late to turn back, Yna. Don't worry, my Alchemy will protect us from the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>You say that, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>It worked?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Yes, this is the arboreal altar at the heart of Sephiron... Well, currently at the heart of Beelzebub, I guess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>How do I say this... I feel like a sack of meat that has flung itself willy-nilly through a sea of corruption and survived it by the skin of its teeth...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I see... An interesting way to describe that experience...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>In any case, could Emmel truly be imprisoned in such a place as this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Impressive. You've made it across the corruption and made it this far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>To accomplish such a thing you would require a vessel of Sephiron; one with the abilities of a priestess...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>So you readied a Vessel of Purification without my knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>It's quite a shame, but the sacrificial daughter is no longer here. In fact, she is no longer of this world at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Surrender now, pursuers of misfortune. Beelzebub has already awakened. It devours this land.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You are too late.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>That's not something for you to decide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>No matter how tough you act, you cannot change the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>That is a lie.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Excuse me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I can hear Emmel's voice from within Beelzebub's core behind you. It's the sound of a soul that is still fighting against sin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Emmel is still there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Of course... You are the other priestess of sacrifice. Despite knowing, you still walk toward your demise...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What a shame!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Yes. I am the one who was prepared as a spare vessel in case anything happened to Emmel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>I was hidden, of course. Who would go through the trouble of preparing such a thing, only to dangle it as bait before their enemies? No one smart, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>You make jokes in the face of your fate... I cannot comprehend such a way of thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Give Emmel back, Zafeiris!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Why? So she can be used as a tool against the Cursed Beasts again? As a sacrifice to save this world?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>That won't happen. I won't allow it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I will destroy the core of the Cursed Beast with the power of Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Are you trying to say that it's not possible?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>No. Even debating the possibility is foolishness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>What...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>As I expected, I cannot allow you sway me from my path. I will not allow the dedication of our princess to be in vain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'll make you disappear right here!</td>
</tr>
