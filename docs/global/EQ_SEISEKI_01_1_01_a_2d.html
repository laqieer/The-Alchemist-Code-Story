<td>002</td>
<td>Discarded by fate, you drift between multiple worlds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Wh-who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>To obtain great power, which will you choose?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>The Sacred Stone Genesis...or the Philosopher's Stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Huh? W-wait! What do you mean?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Time waits for no one. For the sake of the world you live in...choose! The Sacred Stone or the Philosopher's Stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I-I...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Mm-mmm... What was that? What a weird dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oh no! It's already morning! I'm gonna be laaaate!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What's wrong with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Right back at you. Quit picking a fight over something so stupid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Something so stupid'?! How dare you! As a human—no, as a knight—there are some things you've just gotta stand up for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Give it back! That's my bread!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>What?! I was gonna eat it first!</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>There's no way I'm giving it up!</td>

<td>Oh! ...Sorry, Sir.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I...! I'm in the...13th Rank.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>The 13th Rank?! You're like the lowest of the lowest! I'm shocked you'd pick a fight with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Sh-shut up! You know what they say: "a clever falcon hides its claws"!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Hmph!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>The world inevitably changes, but passions etched in time will surpass history. This memory, etched in a Philosopher's Stone, speaks of a Paladin still without a name.</td>

<td>Eeek! Ack!</td>

<td>Ouch! Hey, be careful...ah!</td>

<td>Listen up! You'll now undertake your final trial with your graduation on the line!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Our final...trial?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>In other words, once we pass, we'll go from being Squires to official Paladins? Yes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>That's if you pass the test.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wh-what's that supposed to mean?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I mean that I'm not sure a low-life like you can graduate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wh-what did you just say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>What!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>I'll now introduce your special instructor who will accompany you on your final trial.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's Captain Vettel from the Scarlet Flame Guard of Envylia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Th-the...Captain Vettel? The hero of Envylia who ended the battle at Gilrack?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>What?! Yo-you...know about him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Come on; he's famous! He's strong, popular, and more than anything...super good looking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Just take Captain Vettel's motto! "My sword heeds my will. The future heeds my sword."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>I've lost count of how many times those words have encouraged me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>You get it, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>It looks like I misunderstood you! No fan of Captain Vettel is a bad person!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm also a huge fan! Let's do our best to pass this trial together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Ta-talk about a sudden change of heart!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Squires, the trial that awaits you may not be an easy one, but I wish you the best of luck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Eeeeek!!! Captain Vettel is soo cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well then, I'll now explain the final trial to you! The trial will be held at the Trial Ruins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>There is only one condition for passing! You must fetch a Philosopher's Stone from the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>...A Philosopher's Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>However, there are many monsters within the ruins!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Use the skills and knowledge you have gained from your training to pass this trial!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>If I pass, I'll finally be able to repay my debt to the Holy Order of Babel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Many a Paladin can be traced back here! Follow in the footsteps of your predecessors! Clear the path to becoming a glorious Paladin!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Today, in addition to myself, I've asked another to travel with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Oh! That's...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Wh-what's going on?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm Cadanova, captain of the Holy Guard's 4th Regiment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Ca-Cadanova? The Guardian of the Land and the Flame Dragon King?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>He's a superstar that every knight—no, every living soul—in Babel has heard of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>H-hey! Isn't this—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>A huge opportunity for us!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Huh? Opportunity?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Even though I'm in the 13th Rank, if I impress Captain Cadanova, he might initiate me into the 4th Guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Ohh... I'm getting my hopes up!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>W-wait! Don't you think it's strange?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Why are two captain-rank knights overseeing the training of Squires? There's gotta be a reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Come on! Who cares about the details? You should do something to impress Captain Vettel as well!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...Really? If I impress him, maybe he'll say, "Would you join the Scarlet Flame Knights for my sake?"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And I would say, "But, Captain Vettel, I'm destined to enter the Holy Guard."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Then he would tell me, "Why not give it up? I want to be with you." Eeeeeek!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Now we depart! Squires, don't let down your guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Yes, Siiiir! Guard is up and ready!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Alrighty! I'm gonna become a Paladin at all costs!</td>
</tr>
