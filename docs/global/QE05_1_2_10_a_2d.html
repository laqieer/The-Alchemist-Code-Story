<td>Oh! Welcome home, Kamui!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You were out all day today, too! Is training to be the Protector really that tough?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>It's certainly nothing to joke about. I'm sorry, Hisham. Recently, I haven't been able to oversee your studies at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>That's what you're concerned about? You're a really nice person, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>It's just a hobby. You've got bigger things to worry about!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Ha. If you say so. Now then, for dinner...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Yep! I've got it all here! I tried this medicinal cooking that I found in one of your books!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Medicinal cooking? Haha, it's unlike you to stray from meat dishes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Well, I... Ahem. I thought it might be nice to try something new sometimes. It's, um, healthy! I did my best, but it's not as tasty as it could be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hisham...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Heheh, you're working so hard that I thought I should do my part, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>This is nothing compared to what you're dealing with!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Haha. Then I shall happily partake in this very thoughtful meal you have prepared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kamui! Is Kamui here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Isidore? What is all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Don't tell me... The Royal Army has made their move?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, that's not it. Just... Just come with me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Malta, she... She's collapsed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What?! What in the world?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>While she was meditating at the arboreal altar, she just passed out! She's resting at the Chief's house right now, but he said that maybe they would need the Protector, andâ€”?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Okay, Isidore. Let's go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What is this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Since when was the glow of Sephiron so bright...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I don't know. The beasts have come down into the village as well, and have started making a ruckus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>My warriors are attempting to deal with them, but they're having some issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>We need to move fast, but don't let down your guard!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Got it.</td>
