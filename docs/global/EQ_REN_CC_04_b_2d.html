<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>You heard me. Come at me like this is life or death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What...the...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Bubbles...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Let's talk, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Natsume...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>To be honest, I don't remember what we talked about.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We just talked like we always did, about nothing in particular.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>But we both were smiling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>That I remember vividly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My sister blew bubbles for me. I don't know how long it had been...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>But I blew some too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>They danced in sky, disappearing one by one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Something like this isn't so bad every now and again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Why are you doing this with me today?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I don't know. I figured it's good to make sure sometimes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Make sure of what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Of where we belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Where we belong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Say what you will. I choose to lead the Shiba Senko in a way that I wouldn't be ashamed of.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>No matter how many lives I have to take.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Humans really live the best lives they can, don't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>That seems like an ironic thing for an assassin to say.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>It's exactly why I can say it. The moment a person dies you can feel them release everything they once held within themselves.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Even with just a slash of a blade, you can feel it. The stronger they feel, the more vivid the feeling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if they're a clumsy fool.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Is everything okay? Did you eat something weird or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Hmm, nothing that you haven't eaten.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I was joking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Do you know why I have this blade?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>To kill?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Yes, to kill. I believe there's something that lies beyond the moment of death. After killing or being killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Seriously, did you eat something weird?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>How rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>What are you trying to say?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>The Black Star doesn't need you, Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This is not where you belong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>H-hey, don't joke like that! I'm your brother! I'm a Black Star...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>You will never beat me. And you'll never truly accept being a Black Star. Do you really think they need someone like you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>The bubbles are pretty, aren't they?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Drifting so lightly on the breeze... It seems like they could go anywhere they wanted to. Just like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't get it! I don't want to go anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>I'm nothing like them... If anything, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I what?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>If I went away, what would happen to you if something happened?! The Black Star line would end...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>That's against your code, isn't it?! The Black Star needs me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>I've been thinking. The code shouldn't be continued based on blood. It should be ability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You've misunderstood me. The place you belong isn't necessarily where you're needed. You'll understand someday.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>I don't get it! I don't want to get it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>It's hard to understand. The code. Why we live. Why we fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>What lies beyond the moment of killing. You don't belong here if you can't understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>It's because you couldn't face all of this. You should...go somewhere before you hold the Black Star back.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Until you understand what waits beyond death.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>I couldn't...face it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What would that change? Does understanding change anything? It doesn't, does it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Then why does it matter if I face things or not?! What...does it matter...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>You'll find somewhere you belong. Somewhere that isn't here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Gather your things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>After Natsume left, the last bubble, floating on the breezeâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>Popped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>At the time, I had no idea what my sister was thinking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>And so I left, hoping that one day I would.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>You don't have to go out of your way to see me off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I'm your sister. I want to see my cute little Ren start his journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Did you eat something weird or something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>How rude.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I guess I should get going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Bye, Natsume.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>...Ren.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yeah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Live a long life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>I remember thinking...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>About how much my sister would do to protect me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>About how she was the same as always. About how thankful I was. About how terrible she was at lying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But I still didn't know what was going on in her head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>I hope that one day I can tell my sister that I understand the words she said to me that day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>That's why I began my journey.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Lady Natsume?! Lady Natsume, wake up! Someone... Someone call the doctor!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Maybe if I could have faced it all, things would be different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Not that it helps to think about it now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Is there really a place for someone like me to belong? The more I thought about it, the more I wasn't sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>But I still kept my eye out for a place like that, because my sister had wanted me to. I hoped it would bring her peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I hated the weak. They died too fast, like those bubbles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>I looked for someone strong. Someone like my sister, someone who could give me the same sense of security she had.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I thought that if I did, that would be enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>I killed and killed and killed and killed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>No matter how much I killed, I still didn't understand what was beyond it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Think about it. Taking lives, living hidden in the shadows...or saving lives, surrounded by happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I think the latter would be much more fun. Don't you think so?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>I felt like I'd found it. A place among the strong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Not just the physically strong, but those with strong hearts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>I didn't understand it at first, but little by little, I came to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>They were fighting to protect others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>And they were willing to die for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>That's my justice, my...legacy. An...iron will...that will never...be broken.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ren... I'm not dying...for the therians. I'm...dying for me...the way I choose... My iron...will...leading me to a...glorious, blazing...end...and turning...to steel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Tell everyone...what I said! Nina... You...will inherit my legacy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>The best kind of outrageous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>Thanks to them, I feel like I've begun to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Understand the things my sister told me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>About what was beyond killing and beyond death.</td>
</tr>
