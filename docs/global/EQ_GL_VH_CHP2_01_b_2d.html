<td>Tch. I expected rather more from you, Red.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>*pants* I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>But I must give credit where it's due.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>A pity we will not be spending a special evening together, Lord Zheng Yi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I do not doubt this will be our last meeting, either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Oh my! Already looking forward to me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Sorry to disappoint, but you don't make the calls. I do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>See you again soon, darling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>My lord, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I am. Though I must say it felt as if they were holding back for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Just who are they? They're too outlandish for assassins.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>(Their manner of dress... Those strange, alien weapons.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>(I can think of a number of nobles who have pledged support for such organizations.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Contact Shion as soon as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The more information we have on them, the better.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Yes, my lord.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Guess we'll never be able to catch a break at this rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Fufu. I'm certain I will not want for work during this period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Rest assured I will darken your foyer again should there be any further developments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Lovely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>And with that, I should be going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I shall be praying for Soren's swift recovery.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...Well, this had better be the last of the headaches today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I'm not sure if I can stand another.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Roxanne looks over the stack of documents in her hands, brow furrowed in worry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I should check on Soren before I make headway on these.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>If this has to do with Atropos, we're in for another wild ride.</td>
