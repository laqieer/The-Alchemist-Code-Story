</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>How spectacular! The ancient curse is being purified left and right! Is this the power of the fabled Sephira?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>The Royal Army?! What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Some of your runners stumbled into the town we had been occupying. They told us many interesting things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You son of a...! We don't have time to be fighting the likes of you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Do not fret. We have no intention of fighting you today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I simply wanted to have a few words with you, Isidore, commander of the Sephira warriors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>How do you know my name?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Any organization has a weak link or two who will leak such information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. You lot are the pests that have come swarming around the Sacred Stone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Pests! How quaint of you. I am a true patriot lamenting the future of my beloved country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Twaddle!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Dear me, why is it that those who still have the strength to fight never want to listen?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Then I suppose there is nothing for it except to take that strength away, don't you think?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ack...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Urgh... After fighting off all the Jam, th-this is...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Huh, still standing after battling so many of my soldiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>How regrettable that such a capable warrior is going to lose his life here. What a loss for this country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Quit your blathering!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I am complimenting you, my boy. You would fight to death for the woman you love!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>A commendable quality for a warrior.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The resurrection ceremony, was it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Even I did not know the name of the ceremony until recently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>How could you know of it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>My, my. I wonder if you know this, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>This all-important ritual you stand here defending requires a sacrifice: the life of your beloved fiancé.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>The daughter of your Chief, was she not? How cruel of him to raise her, only to sacrifice her in the end!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lies! You're lying! Chief Iakov would never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You really know nothing? Disappointing. You're not worth my time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Run back to your village, Sephira warrior. Go see the truth for yourself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Unless, of course, you choose to die here. I find that acceptable as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Bastard! Have you not insulted me enough?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Commander! It would be wise to retreat for now. The warriors are exhausted from the battle with the Jam.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We do not have the energy to face against an army of this size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yes... You are right. Everyone, fall back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Good. Now... Let's see how this seed of doubt I have planted works.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>General, we have collected a sample from the Jam they were fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Good. Take the sample to the Corpse. Something interesting may come of this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Here is your first task as Protector.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Take the druidic priestess, my daughter, to the arboreal altar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>To the arboreal altar? As a bodyguard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You could say that. The base of the great tree has now become a nest of feral beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Getting her to the altar safely will be your first priority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Malta... Are you ready?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Yes. I am ready.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Very well. Then it is about time for the resurrection ceremony to begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Until the ritual is completed, not one soul shall be able to come near Sephiron.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>No matter what hardship you may face, the two of you must overcome the obstacles together, understand?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Chief? What do you—?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>We understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Malta? What is going on? What sort of ritual is this resurrection ceremony?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>All you need to worry about is reaching the altar. Malta knows all there is to know about the ritual.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>(What is happening? Is this the final trial for me to become Protector?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>(A resurrection ceremony? What does Malta have to do with it?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Let's go, Kamui.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Y-yes.</td>
</tr>
