<td>Hmm... So the documents in Envylia and Slothstein were consistent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>This means that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>No, it's too early to decide that, but if this is true...why hasn't it been made public?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Is the information this mural depicts fabricated? If not...that means that someone deliberately...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So this is the truth that the world has hidden away. Heheh. It isn't like me to be so fired up about something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Did you find the truth that you were looking for?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You are such a blockhead... No one likes a man who rushes them, you know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Ngh... Is that right? I...apologize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I told you that it would take some time. You can't observe undefined phenomena. I need to inspect this a little more.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I see. Kaya, these Cursed Beasts you mentioned... Could they have something to do with the Sacred Stones?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hmm... What makes you think that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>There are a few other creatures visible in the background, but the mural mainly depicts seven great beasts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That's the same number of countries in Babel that possess Sacred Stones. It's hard to believe that could be a coincidence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>That's a very interesting observation. I thought the same thing. It's impressive that a blockhead like you noticed something like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Then it really is...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>As I said, we must be patient. If it was a truth that could be so easily arrived at, no one would have bothered to hide it in the first place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>However, I'm very excited about this. It's something that only I can do—something that I want to do from the bottom of my heart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Kaya, for you to get so passionate about this...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>However, I see now that you definitely couldn't function as Captain in the Holy Guard while conducting your research.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I told you. Does that mean that you'll accept my resignation?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I...want us to continue researching together a little longer. This is important for me as well. Where are we going next?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Our next destination will be...Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Kagura, are you all right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm fine! We finished the mission early thanks to you, Kudan, so I don't feel tired at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You'll soon get tired walking in the desert. Let me know if it gets difficult—you mustn't push yourself too hard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Huh, over there—isn't that...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hello. This is a surprise. You're coming back rather early, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Don't tell me you already completed your mission in Wratharis! Wasn't it a large-scale mission to take out bandits?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Yes, and so we are on our way back. It wouldn't do to take so long on a mission of this caliber.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I will eradicate everything that threatens this world in the name of my own justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>That is why I cannot afford to be idle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I never want to fail anyone like I did before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kudan, you're very straightforward...but that can be dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>What do you mean by that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Exactly what it sounds like. Hm... It seems we have visitors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>That can't be... I killed them all!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>No, they're not the same. There are far too many for them to be the remnants of any you may have missed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Which means that the forces in Wratharis were nothing more than a diversion. This is their true objective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I suppose we can help out this time. We can't just wait around here, after all, and I must admit that I'm intrigued...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>But I don't think we need to expend ourselves too much... All right, here I go.</td>
</tr>
