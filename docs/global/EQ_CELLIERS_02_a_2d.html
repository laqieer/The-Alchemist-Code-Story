<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's one of the only memories I have of when I was small.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A lot of children were brought in as experiment subjects.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Kidnapped children, sold children, abandoned children, created children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>All of their memories were removed. They couldn't remember anything about their hometown, their family, or the color of the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From amongst them, only he was able to remember a little of the outside world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>There were more trees outside, the ceilings were higher. And the blue...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>There are white masses called clouds. The rain is cold, but the rainbow after that—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>His memory was our hiding place. He used to encourage all of us that one day we would leave this place.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>After several experiments, he never returned again. All that remained was my desire not to remember anything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>The truth about not being able to save him when he was supposed to be my friend...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>That is what pains me so much even now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Celliers?! Celliers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>The power of the crystal stopped, but...why won't you get up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Do-don't cry! If the monster comes again, it'll be a big problem. We need to hurry back to the mansion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Uff...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>There's no doubt about it. I finally found you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Ohh, Celliers! Celliers! I finally found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I won't let you escape again. I'm the only Mage left from that test lab. Yes, you're mine...just mine!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>We finally arrived.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Celliers still doesn't wake up, but...I can't carry him all the way to the room on the second floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Uck...uhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...! I need to make a place for him to sleep! Oh, and water too...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Eeek?! Wh-what was that?! That sound...was it magic? Did it come from outside?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Ahahah! Now go forward, you sordid beasts! Go and destroy that mansion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Celliers, Celliers, Celliers! Come out now, my adorable little lab rat!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Who is that person...? There's something weird...and frightening about her...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Ah, no...I can't go back there...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(I'm really scared, but...I need to protect Celliers right now!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(Because, because...!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>He's my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Stop it, old lady!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>...What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Who are you? Where's Celliers?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Are you friends with Celliers? If so, then cut it out! Celliers is in pain right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I see. I wonder if it's some kind of symptom or if he's still reacting to Lustburg's curse. Heheh. Observing the situation for now might be best.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>What are you saying? You're terrible...Celliers is in pain...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Terrible? Why? That thing was originally made to experiment on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Treating it like a tool and using it until its breaking point is the greatest way to express one’s love for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>(Hey, what is wrong with this person?! I'm not going to let Celliers near her!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Are you going to stand in my way, little girl?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I won't let you do anything mean to my friend!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You friend? I see. I'd like to see that kind of response as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>When his friend is eaten by the insects, I am so interested to see how he responds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Huh?! The old lady really is weird!</td>
