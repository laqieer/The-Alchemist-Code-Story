<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>It's no good! This corruption is just too dense! No matter how much we purify, it's never-ending!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Don't push yourself, Emmel! This degree of corruption may be too much, even for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>No, Nimul. This is exactly the kind of situation where I need to push myself the hardest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>That sound...is Waginau. He's using that dark power to keep Ouroboros at bay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He can't keep that up for long! We need to purify the core as fast as we can and go help him!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Emmel!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I'm fine. How's the core, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Oof. We may not be able to purify it from the outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>What? We can't?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>So, we may have to do like we did before? Purify from both the inside and outside at the same time?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Emmel? What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Emmel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I'll go inside. It'll be cramped, but I can still sense Lucifer within.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So I'm confident I'll be permitted entrance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No! It's much too dangerous! You'll be consumed by the corruption!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I will not fall to sin. I am the Vessel of Purification. This is the sacrifice I am meant to make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Nimul, this is something only I can do. You understand that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Even so...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It'll be fine, Nimul.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I came this far knowing such an eventuality might come to pass, and that if it did, I would need to fulfill my destiny.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>So everything will be all right. I'll take care if it, Nimul. I swear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I will enter Grand Excelsior and purify it from the inside, while you purify it from out here. If we work together, we will succeed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I understand. And...I believe in you. You and I really are cut from different cloths. And yours is of a much finer make.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>"I beseech the supreme...!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Just like with Beelzebub...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>So if I just clear the corruption from the inside...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>"I beseech...the supreme!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>"The kingdom shall inherit the crown, and the heavenly gates shall open for the souls of the pure. Save us, heal us, spare us!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>"Sephiron, our great Mother, the Tree of Life, crowned supreme; we who pass into temptation, beyond the tertium sephirah, beyond the crossroads."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>"Save us, the lost souls!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I swear, I won't let you be a sacrifice! We can resolve this without any such need! I'll see to it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>"I am Transcender of the Seven Gates!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>"Let Truth descend upon the kingdom from the crown, and all the people share equally its golden treasure."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>"Genesis Arts: Grand Excelsior Reformed!" Purge the corruption that dwells within!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>We did it! Emmel, we've done it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>We did! We fought off the corruption, and control of the tower is now ours! The culmination of your dream is finally within your grasp!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Now, you need to hurry up and get out of there, before—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>No.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Emmel?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Ouroboros is sure to try and steep the tower in corruption again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I should stay here to protect the core.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>But—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>It'll be fine. I can use the power of the Cursed Beast cores just like you, remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>And...it'll be safer for me to deal with things from inside the core. Right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>That may be true, but—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nimul, you should hurry! Waginau needs your help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>...All right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>But promise me that if you're in any danger at all, you'll get out of there right away. Promise me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Of course. You have my word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>...I hate telling lies and making false promises. But I said what needed to be said. And I should be fine here on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Nimul is the only one in the long, long history of the Sephira with the ability to completely clear away corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I can't control the power of the cores nearly as well as he can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That's why I need to merge my soul with all seven of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>If the cores have my characteristics—that is to say, those of the Vessel of Purification—they should be able to withstand the corruption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Nimul might not realize it himself, but there are certain things only he can do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>And as his sister, this is what I can do. What I have to do...and what I want to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Just as all of the Vessels that came before me, I will seal the corruption within my body to help the world reach equilibrium once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>(I've used my power so many times before to seal the Cursed Beast cores within me, but this time is different.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>I've kept this from Nimul for so long now...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Though I'm sure he must have realized the truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>My body just can't hold out anymore. One more shot as Vessel is all I've got left in me, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>But it's fine. It won't be in vain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm giving my life to help Nimul realize his dream.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I promise! I'm going to grow stronger—even more powerful than the village elder! I'm going to make a world where nobody ever needs to be sacrificed! Where we won't need any more Vessels!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>That's my dream, okay?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>This is the future that Nimul wished for, all those years ago...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Is it safe?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Looks like the coast is clear, at least.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Ooh...ahh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Eulalia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Those wounds are deep. They don't look fatal, but you need to rest or that could easily change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>What's...going on?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We've retreated, and are presently hiding from the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Matia is almost certainly trying to sniff us out even as we speak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>And she's moving pretty quickly through the city center in the process...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>All the while hunting down Fallen, for some reason.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on with that either. But what I do know is that more than half of our own troops are hurt. We can't afford to get into any more battles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>One way or another, we need to buy more time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Nyx! Behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Huh? How?! We shouldn't have left any signs of our presence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Wait... Crap! We used magic! Matia can easily spot the residual magil from our Space-Time Manipulation!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>We've got to move! Now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's too late...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Ha! Found you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Matia!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Huh? Something's not right. She's...different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>She's fallen into sin! Matia, did you consume the Fallen?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>What? Are you serious?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>I was running short on magil. It seemed the best way to replenish my supply.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>You're going to turn into a Fallen yourself! You do understand the repercussions of that, don't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>It won't be the first time I've died.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Ugh. We've got to do something, quick!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Mira! Use Space-Time Manipulation on me again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Your body won't be able to handle that! Come, on, think; what do we do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Eeek!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>You're first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Tut-tut. Do you really think you can take out one of my disciples so easily?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>Well, who do we have here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Sorry to tell you, this is the end of the line for you. No more of your nonsense!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Combined forces of Invidia and Ire, prepare to attack! The number of Fallen surrounding us is increasing. We must drive them back!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Yes, sir!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Huh? What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>Is that...Ambrosia's magic?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>Honestly, I have the worst luck when it comes to taking on disciples. Always getting themselves in trouble!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>Ambrosia?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>You saved me! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Wow, you're keeping it short and sweet for once, huh? I must've really caught you by surprise!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...! Ambrosia, behind you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Worry not. We'll handle them. We're not human, so the Fallen can't take us over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>Winnick! You're here, too? What are you all even doing in Superbia Belt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>We can talk about that later. First, we have to—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>You are...all...such...eyesores!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Well, we'll just have to make something more of ourselves, then, won't we?</td>
</tr>
