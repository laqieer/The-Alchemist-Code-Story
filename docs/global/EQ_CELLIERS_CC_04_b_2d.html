<td>HAAAAAAH!</td>

<td>002</td>
<td>Augh... What crazy power!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Still, you're only one guy. We'll take you in alive, and get our hands on those crystals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, he isn't exactly alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>GWAAAH!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Thanks for helping me, Flamel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Goodness, me... To think you'd act as bait to draw them out. I suppose you've got a reckless streak to you as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Sorry to put you in that position. I just knew they must be lying in wait around the laboratory...</td>

<td>With things as they were, Mielikki couldn't return to the village safely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Indeed... Still, it's a good thing we put those soldiers in place. We got through it without too much trouble.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I certainly hope that's all of them...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So, um... What are you going to do with the ones you captured?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Interrogate them, first and foremost. Still, I don't imagine we'll get much useful intel out of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>They're probably some grunt soldiers acting of their own accord. Gluttony hardly has any reason to worsen relations with our kingdom over such trifles.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>To be honest, we barely have enough grounds to even detain them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I can't say for sure. Political matters are outside of my wheelhouse, after all. Let's just leave the rest of this to Michael.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Through his efforts, things will settle down after a spell. I imagine you should be safe for now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh yeah? Then Mielikki can go back to the village safely. What a relief...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>(...That's enough. If Mielikki can live happily in that village...then that's more than enough for me.)</td>
