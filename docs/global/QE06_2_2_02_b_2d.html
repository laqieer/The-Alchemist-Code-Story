<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>I began to overflow with power.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Instinctively, I felt that this power had been sleeping inside me--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Power to oppose senseless cruelty, to protect my sister, to enact my hatred…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>To defend the sanctity of life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I hated, therefore I sought to protect. I sought to protect from that which I hated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>From those conflicting emotions, power seemed to spring forth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>First, I'll start with the humans who captured us and locked us in this place--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>I'll kill them all. I'll never forgive them for putting us through hell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Eventually, I gleaned some information about the people responsible for our capture from the researchers. It was a group called the Demon Hunters…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>They were an organization of unknown size and scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If that's the case--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I decided the only way to be sure they pay for their crime is to kill all humans-- That way no one goes unpunished.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>It's the only thing I can do for Kaede. And--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>My one and only desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Kaede…?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>…Tch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>…Tamba.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I…don't want to die here…I don't want them to take any...more--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Kaede!? What's wrong? Hang in there!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...from me…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hey! Kaede! Kaede!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>…*Growl*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>…!?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>*ROAR*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Kaede had completely transformed before my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>To liken her power to pure carnage would be an understatement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>*ROAR*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She annihilated all the humans present, and then flung herself toward me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>She spoke with an otherworldly voice, her body drenched in blood. But--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tears were in her eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Kaede…Kaede!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>I called her name again and again--the girl who just wanted a normal life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>This…isn't "normal!" I'll show you what normal is. Please!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Let's live! You and me, Kaede!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>I yelled with all my might to somehow get through to her. The next thing I knew, all her strength seemed to evaporate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I caught her tiny body in my arms, giving her support. Surely, the life she dreamed of--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Wasn't this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>I hoped--No, I swore--I'd never let anyone make her feel this way again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>That's why I had to be strong. To wipe out all humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>So, with Kaede in my arms, I started running as fast as I could.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>To escape the insular world we had come to know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>I don't remember how or where I ran to. I just desperately wanted to get outside.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>And then--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>The vast earth stretched before us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>…Tam..ba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>…Yeah, Kaede.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>…This is what the "normal" world looks like.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>…I won't let them ever hurt us again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Someday…I swear I'll eradicate those filthy humans.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Tamba…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Starting with those called Demon Hunters. They're the bastards who put us in there and did that to…mom and dad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>If I kill them all, I'm sure you'll be able to devour humans again…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>What makes you so sure…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>We just need to move past this… I'll be here to help you. I'll do whatever I can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>And I'll help you live a "normal" life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>What's wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>…It's nothing. Thank you, Tamba.</td>
