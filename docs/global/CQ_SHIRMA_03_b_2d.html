<td>002</td>
<td>Graaaarghh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Are you all right, Silma?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I-I am! Thank you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Hahah. I'll never be a match for you, Sis. I've always known that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Silma...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>You've always been so strong and kind... You're my hero. I love you so much, Sis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Silma, I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Still, I understand why you have to go. It's too important to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>But even so, you came back...for me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I guess that's what heroes do, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Heheh. You might be right about that. I'm your hero, and Lord Zahar is mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I will return to this forest. I will come back to you, Silma.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I know. I just hope I'll be all right on my own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I think you will. After all, you're a hero, too. To Polyma and Minera, and to all the children of the forest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>H-huh? Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Yes. That is why I know that I can entrust this place I hold so dear to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Huh? The forest?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>This spot right here. Under this great tree.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>We used to lie here, side by side, and doze off with our backs against the trunk. Do you remember?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Yeah! I do!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>In my darkest moments, I treasured the time I was able to spend with you in this quiet forest above all else.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>What I care for most in this world, what I wish to protect more than anything else, is you and Lord Zahar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I get it! You want to help Lord Zahar, just like how I want to be there for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The Shadow Messiah are gone. You were right to remind me of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But so long as you and I still stand, the Shadow Messiah that Lord Zahar left to me will never truly be gone. It remains with us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>That is why I will return to this forest, just like I promised.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Lord Zahar is in good hands with you, Sis. All I want is for you to...to...do your best. If you're going, go! With your head held high!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Silma...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>It's okay. Really! I'll take care of the forest for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>This place is special to the both of us, and I'm going to be its protector!</td>
