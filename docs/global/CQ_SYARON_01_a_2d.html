<td>I'm told this village has been experiencing an unusual outbreak of monsters recently?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That's right. All of a sudden, whole packs of them have started attacking out of nowhere... We've been at our wits' end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Well, you are in safe hands now. We'll put an end to this before anyone else gets hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You will? I can't thank you enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>(Finally, my first mission in command of my juniors. If I do a good job, it's sure to reflect well on Bertha too.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>How did Sharon end up in the Royal Knights anyway? Wasn't she hoping to get into the Scarlet Flame Guard?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Maybe her instructor set her on the wrong path? Poor girl, being let down like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>(Bertha was the one who inspired me to join the Royal Knights. I've got to show her that she was right to have faith in me.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>We're going to split into two groups, so please listen carefully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Group one, I want you to scout the area. Group two, help shore up the village's defenses. If anything happens, report it to me immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>If I may, commander, wouldn't it be easier to head into the forest and track these monsters down ourselves? If we leave nowâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>We can cross that bridge when we come to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>But I want to do this right. All I need for the moment is for you to follow my orders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I... Understood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>(The sounds around me used to be so much nicer when I was with Bertha and her squad.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>(Here, they sound so suffocated... All these sighs and weary footsteps. I thought I'd given reasonable orders, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Hey, what gives? What about our deal?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Erm... Well, it's unfortunate that things have turned out this way, but it looks like we'll have to cancel our arrangement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I'm sorry to have called you out here for no reason, but as you can see, the Royal Knights are here now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Well, we're all fired up to kill some monsters, so let us at 'em! C'mon, I'll even cut you a discount!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>The infamous Won, giving up on the chance for more coin? Before you took on disciples, you would have snatched it out of my hand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Hey, I haven't gone soft! It's just, y'know... Money's not the only reason I'm... Look, can't you cut us a break?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I suppose you've helped us out on more than a few occasions. If it's that important to you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Excuse me, good knight, but would you mind taking on a few extra hands? Won's no slouch in combat, I assure you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>So you are the ones responsible for keeping the monsters at bay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>We would be glad of your assistance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>All right! Thanks a bunch, miss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I'm Won, Greed Dike's finest jack of all trades, and these fine folk are my disciples. Nice to meet you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I'm Sharon of the Royal Knights of Envylia. It's my pleasure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Oh-ho? We've got visitors! Look lively, you lot! Show me all that training wasn't for nothing!</td>
