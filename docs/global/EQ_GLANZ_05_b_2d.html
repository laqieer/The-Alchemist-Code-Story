<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You're Glanz, ain'tcha? Take out a big-name like you, and I'll be famous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>So you know who I am. I never liked such attention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>But I suppose it was inevitable when I chose to have someone as noisy as you to be my partner.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>The hell you talkin' about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Outta the way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Aaaagh!</td>

<tr>

<td>Grraaaargh! Look at me! If you want a fight, fight me!</td>

<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Agh!</td>

<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Rochelle...! No, stop!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Good. That's it! All of you, look at me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Just like that. Target me. Just me!</td>

<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Urrgh...</td>

<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>R-Rochelle... That's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>That's enough! Please, get out of here! I can't run anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>So run away. If you keep this up...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Run? Why? I won't run or hide. All I can do is fight.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>That's not true. That's not true!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>It's fine, Glanz... It's all okay. I knew.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I was able to fight the way I wanted because you were with me, Glanz.</td>

<td>Helza accepted this black and white bear for how I am. So I was supposed to protect her by keeping the attention to myself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>But I failed. I became alone. But then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Glizzy came along. Pillows are important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>I had fun being with Glizzy. So I don't mind if this is how it ends.</td>

<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>R-Rochelle...</td>

<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Rochelle... You've gotten yourself so dirty again... You're so messy...</td>

<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're always causing me such trouble... Aren't you, Rochelle...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>...</td>

<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(She's still such a young child... Others her age would still be playing with friends, and yet...I never said anything.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>(All I could do for you was be there with you... That was all I could do.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>(You had fun? That's my line...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>You're stained red... Oh, Rochelle... Let's clean you up. What bath item do you want toâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>You know, Rochelle? I wanted to cleanse this world. I wanted to rid this world of the filth that clings to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>But I found something in this world more important than that wish to cleanse. I've become one of the stains on this world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Then let's make a mess together. It'll be fun with Glizzy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Ha. Yes, perhaps it will be.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>If you and I are just more of this world's filth, then I don't see why we can't mess it up as we please.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>No matter how dirty you get, a bath will wash you clean.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Glizzy, is this another one of your bath items? How do you use it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Oh that? You make it float like this and... See? Flower petals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oooohh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>So pretty!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Glizzy! Glizzy, this one! What does this one do?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>H-hey! Don't splash around so much! Look, you take this, and...</td>
