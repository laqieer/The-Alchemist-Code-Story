<tr>
<td>001</td>
<td>Urgh... Nnrghh... You hit pretty hard for a woman. But you're nothing compared to your brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>You're just a terrible sore loser!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Shut it! I don't wanna hear another peep from you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>You'll never surpass your brother, so just quit while you're ahead. Go get married or something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Are you all right, Lotiyah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>I'm fine, but...what about you? That man said some truly repugnant things...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Yes, well... I am afraid that I'm rather used to having my brother used against me in conversation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's a horrible thing to get used to!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>It is unavoidable, I'm afraid, given the path I have chosen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>My brother was incredibly well-respected as a gladiator. Now I attempt to stand and fight in his shoes, in the hope of someday surpassing his legacy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>He means a lot to you, doesn't he, Teona?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Hahah. Of course. He's family, after all. Just like your beasts are to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>I have had my eye on you for some time now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>It hasn't escaped me on how affectionately you treat the beasts under your care. You use a firm hand where it's needed, but a kind one whenever you can.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Observing you has really impressed upon me that the beasts against which we fight are not simply enemies, but beings who have someone who truly cares for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>It made me want to face them more earnestly, more respectfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Oh! Really?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Lotiyah... Would you be my friend?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I am certain that it hasn't escaped you on how few women there are in the Colosseum. It can be rather...lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I often find myself wistfully thinking about how nice it would be if I could spend time with a friendâ€”perhaps over a slice of cake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>O-oh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Hey! Teona!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Darn! I forgot I had training today. I hope we will see each other again soon! Goodbye for now, Lotiyah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>She's gone...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>(Friends...? I don't really like gladiators, but...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>(She cares about family. That's something. She even acknowledged that these darlings are my family. Maybe...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Your...family? Lotiyah, you mustn't get too attached to these creatures. You're the one who will end up hurt if you do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Piria! Piria! No! No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Why...? Why would you do something like this?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Piria... She fought so well for you! How could you...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Heheh. She got what she deserved. She hurt me, the filthy beast...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Piria is a good girl! She knows exactly when she needs to withdraw. She would never attack someone after their win has been decided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I've trained her to never harm anyone unnecessarily! She would never!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yeah... You're right about that. She didn't even resist. She lay down and died like a good little doggie. You trained her well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Y-you... You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It was an accident.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>It is unfortunate, but it happens. Nothing can be done about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>It's just a beast, for god's sake. No point crying about it! Just train up another one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Just train up another...? Don't be so callous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No family member can ever be replaced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(Teona might not be so bad...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(But I don't think I could ever befriend a gladiator. Not after this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Nimbly avoiding the beast's charge before delivering the winning hit! That makes this Teona's tenth consecutive victory, and what a victory it is!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>You did so well! You braved the pain and gave it your all! Come on, come get your pats! That's a good girl!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>She really showed off, didn't she? It must have hurt a lot... I suppose your injuries must be quite severe...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh? Wait... It's not that bad, after all. Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Fowow!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Then...when Teona is showing off, she must be holding back. It's all for show... She's really taking care not to leave you with any serious wounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>All right, everyone! That's it for today. Get some good rest!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>No, wait... Where is Grraw?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>She's not here... Oh, no! Where could she be?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>U-um... Excuse me! Have you seen Grraw?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Eh? Who?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>She's a majestic creature with a magnificent mane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>That don't mean nothin' to me. I can't tell those beasts apart for squat. That's your responsibility, isn't it? You deal with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>H-hey! Wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Nobody cares! My darlings give at least as much as the gladiators do to this Colosseum, yet nobody gives a damn about them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Are you looking for Grraw? Someone came by a little while ago and let her out. Said something about being ordered to hand her over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Wh-what?! This is the first I'm hearing about this! Who was it?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>You see that gladiator over there? That one...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Look what your mangy beasts have done to me! I'm gonna have to opt out of the next match!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You again? Stop blaming my darlings for your inadequacies!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Shut up! That mongrel made a fool of me and I'm really ticked off!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Give 'er here! I'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>No! Not him! Oh, no!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Grrroo!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Heh. Serves you right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Acting all mighty, when you're nothing but a lowly mutt! I'm gonna teach you your place...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Grraw!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Tch... Look who it is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>You...! You horrible, horrible man! You're going to pay for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Oh yeah? Gonna take me on alone, eh? You really think a pathetic trainer like you can beat a gladiator?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Maybe you need a lesson, too. Get it through your head: the stars of the Colosseum are the gladiators. That means our deeds are righteous!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>You...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Hold it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>T-Teona! What are you doing here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Your fellow trainer filled me in on the situation and I began searching for you immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>He was worried about you. You and Grraw.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Beating up a drugged and defenseless animal... Despicable! You are nothing but a coward! As a fellow gladiator, I cannot allow this transgression to go unpunished!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Prepare yourself! I will be your opponent, and you will fight me in fair and open combat!</td>
</tr>
