<td>A-are you the guy who came here from Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>A...a woman?! I-I'm innocent! At least give me some clothes...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Umm...why did you get captured?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I just came here because I was encouraged to! When I tried to enter the country, a flying witch caught me and...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>That must have been the court mage's air defense. But you're a foreigner, right? How could you fly without using magic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>That's because I was riding my buddy...oh, wait!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>My buddy...the witches seized him and placed him somewhere! They better not have broken him?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What do you mean by "riding" and "broken"? Was your buddy a vehicle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Hm? Yeah, he's a bit rough around the edges, but perfect for riding at incredible speeds!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>So, you're the person who came from Slothstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Slothstein, huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I'm a man who goes wherever life takes him. My name is Edgar L. Leonhart. Where I'm from and where I'm headed, Iâ€”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Excuse me! There's something I want you to tell me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>You want to go above the clouds?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>I heard there were flying ships in Slothstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>We can fly as well, but...we don't have enough power to go above the clouds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>We thought you might know of some way to do it, Edgar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Flying above the clouds is no easy task.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But you entered this country from the sky, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I had to. The border checkpoints on the road were strict. That's why I had to go out of my way to jump off a cliff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>First of all, why were you trying so hard to enter this country?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I told you, didn't I? I was encouraged to come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>When you say encouraged, does it have something to do with this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Why do you have that? That witch took that stone away from me. You...totally don't look like that witch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I just took it from her, that's all. It seems she wasn't lying when she said its life had been exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Now that I've confirmed that, this stone is useless to me. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Didn't you come to Lustburg in order to revive this stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Revive the stone? What do you mean, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>No way...that stone?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>So, it wasn't just any stone after all. That's the Sacred Stone, isn't it, Dias?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Whaaat?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It's true that this stone may have once been Belphegor. However, now it's just a rock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>That being said, with this country's secret art it could possibly be resurrected. That's why the man must have come here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>This country's...secret art?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>This isn't the time to be standing around talking. We've got guests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Whoa! They're even bigger than before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>If you beat up that many Familiars, of course, they're gonna come at us with everything they've got!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>We don't have time for this. I'm gonna quickly take these out. Stand back.</td>
