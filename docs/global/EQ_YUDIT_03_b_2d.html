<td>Bud! Now!</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Leave it to me! Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I've gotta admit, I'm impressed. You three can go head-to-head with the Taurus even without Mecha Weapons!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You know what they say: three heads are better than one! Besides, the way we work together, even a titan like the Taurus is no match for us! Right, Bud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>(I hate to admit it, but he's got a point. I fight much better when we're working together than when I charge in on my own.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Bud? Bud! Come on, back me up here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Wh-what?! Never mind that—we've got bigger things to deal with right now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Good point! Time to show this Giant Taurus who's boss!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Keep your head on straight, little frog. Don't get cocky.</td>

<tr>

<td>Bud?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Oh, uh... Yeah, Victor! Cool it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>You're siding with him now?! Great... Now we're bickering like an old married couple.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Seriously, what's up with you guys?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>We've been through a lot. This is actually pretty tame for us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Oh... Well, then.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Uh... Basheeny? Why're you staring at me like that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Your Mecha Weapon... It's different.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Oh! Yeah. I upgraded it a bit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Is that...bad?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Why would it be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I mean...it's a powerful weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Considering everything you've told me... Maybe you don't approve of making something so powerful even more potent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>And...while I was traveling the world, I met someone who was pretty convinced that the Mecha Weapon is a dangerous weapon. So...y'know.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>It is powerful, certainly—but with you in charge of it, I must confess I'm not all that worried. You've made it clear that the Mecha Weapon's purpose is to protect the people of this world, not cause them harm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>(And I think we're going to need it in the battles to come. The more powerful it is, the better.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>O-oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Well, good! I'm glad you think so!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I'm actually thinking of calling this a mech gear! I won't bore you with all the technical details, but by attaching this extra doohickey here, I've managed to up the firepower a ton!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>This baby's capable of piercing straight through a Giant Taurus's core—bam! And it can fly super high! And it lets me zoom around like never before!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Sure, not many people believe in the Mecha Weapon now... But it can do a lot of good, I just know it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>That's why I came here—I need to use this mech gear to take down the Giant Taurus. If I can do that, people will finally see that the Mecha Weapon is a useful invention!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>However, regardless of how strong that mech gear is, you can't rely on it to win this fight for you. Remember: the Giant Taurus wiped out the entire specialized combat force. They should not be taken lightly. We need to work together to—</td>

<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Don't worry! I've got this—really! I'm going to use this mech gear to take down the Giant Taurus and keep everyone safe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Judith...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>(I'm going to protect everyone! Then they'll finally see that the Mecha Weapon isn't some cursed weapon...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>(And that this new-and-improved version is just as useful!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Anyway! Let's get going, shall we? No point dillydallying around here! We know what we've gotta do. Right? Come on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Hey! Judith! There's no need to run! We're not in a—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Yeah! Hear us out before you go charging off! There's no rush!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Wait...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Is that what I'm like? Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>B-Bud? You okay? Why'd you go all quiet?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Yeah, I'm fine... I just realized something.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>You're trying to do everything by yourself, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
