<td>001</td>
<td>A few days ago...near the border of Greed Dike.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Halt! Who are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>I am Kudanstein. I heard that Emperor Orion wanted to meet me, so I've come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Ku-Kudanstein...?! Ah...I-I've been informed of this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>...Where is Orion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>He should be in his royal castle Dynam Dionysus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>You're fast...I see. Your skill with the lance is quite impressive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It's a pleasure to meet you too. I am Fung Liu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Fu-Fung Liu...?! He-hey! Look!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Impossible! Did the experiment really succeed?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...What do you want?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>The Emperor is waiting for you in the royal castle. I am here to convey this to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>So you're my guide? Then quickly...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Ack! What're you playing at?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>What am I...playing at? I am here to kill you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>So...you're not my guide then?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I have conveyed to you that the Emperor is waiting to meet you. From here...I will return to my original mission.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Your mission?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>My original mission is to eliminate any foreign knight who enters within Greed Dike. That is all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>As long as we're meeting like this, you fit the criteria as a target...for me to eliminate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Ack! Seriously. What an annoying nuisance! ...Fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Anyone who stands in my way, I'll cut down. That's all there is to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>...You're fast!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>What rubbish. You'll pay dearly for this rude welcoming...Orion!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Meanwhile. In the Greed Dike's royal castle Dynam Dionysus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>We've received word that Kudanstein has shown himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Did he encounter Fung Liu?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It appears so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I'm sure even Kudanstein will have a hassle dealing with him. After all, his assassin's technique was inspired by origami art.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Hmph. More importantly, you want to boast about the research you of the Corpse have been engaging in, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hehe. Quite so. Having turned Fung Liu into Prototype 0, he is practically a human weapon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Kudanstein should not be able to easily beat him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Now, hurry up and take me to him. Or...do you want me to cut you lot down too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>You should save those words...for after you've defeated me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ack?! What's going on? I know for a fact that I punctured his vitals!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>He is the ultimate warrior...the product of repeated experiments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>There is no such concept of death to a man who, through the technique of we the Corpse, has glimpsed the Door of Truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>The ultimate warrior that cannot physically die, huh? I'm interested to see how Kudanstein responds to him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Impossible! I'm certain that I pierced his heart! What are you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>He disappeared!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>No matter how strong you are, I will never be defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>After all, I cannot die. Goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Aghh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>So you've managed to dodge my attack. Your defensive instinct is...fantastic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Y-you can't die...? Are you a...phantom soldier?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Am I a phantom soldier? Now that's an interesting idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Ack...! Huzzzaaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I will tell you once again...you cannot kill me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Aghh...!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Ug...ugh...! N-no...I'm sure that your body is made of flesh! Are you really...immortal?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Fung Liu, huh? Now that I think about it, he's a man that's been born time and time again under an unlucky star.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Very much so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>If only he hadn't been born in the witches' country of Lustburg...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Most likely, he would never have ended up becoming an assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You speak almost as if we tailored him to be an assassin.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Having been born male and abandoned by his country as a child, my army took him in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Shouldn't we be praised for our actions?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>However...fate would have it that he was picked up by Greed Dike's special assassin forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Heheh. Of course, I don't intend to belittle the circumstances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>Thanks to that, he was able to develop the techniques of an assassin even before he could learn to think for himself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Tsk...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>No. I'm not there anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Huh?! ...Ackkk!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>No matter how much you resist...you cannot defeat me. Please...give up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Agh...! Why? I seem unable to read you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>But...I hear that you cannot develop new prototypes after Fung Liu. Why was he the only one who managed to survive?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Of course...I believe that his unique life of having been raised solely as an assassin plays a small part in this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>It's not every day that you find an individual who has been trained to erase their emotions from their early childhood.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...So you're saying there's another reason?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Yes. What's noteworthy about him is not his technique as an assassin...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>The reason why Fung Liu was able to become Prototype 0 was because of his unusually strong attachment to life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>His attachment to life...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Huff...huff...! Argh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>There's no point in continuing any longer. Let's finish this soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Ack! Huzzaaahhh!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>You don't seem to know when to give up. What's the point of what you're doing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Shut up! I can't afford to die here...huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Your back is completely vulnerable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>Gahhh!!! Ug...gfff! Wha...what is your body made of...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Who knows? It's time to say farewell.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>You have no body temperature...or any pulse! Are you...dead?!</td>
</tr>
