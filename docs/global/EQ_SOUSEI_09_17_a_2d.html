<td>Hey, now! That was a cheap shot!</td>

<td>Isn't that what you do in a fight? You build your defense, and should your opponent drop theirs, you sweep in for the kill. It's called tactics.</td>

<td>There's only so far teamwork can take us, though. There's simply no way we can deal with this many Fallen.</td>

<tr>
<td>Andechs</td>
<td>Unfortunately, I think you're right. If they weren't Fallen, I could just take the hits and break through. But the corruption makes taking any hits at all a losing proposition.</td>
