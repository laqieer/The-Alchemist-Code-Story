<td>You still want to keep going? You know you're outmatched, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>I'm not finished yet!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Mmn... Hm? Whoa?! Zeldris is getting beat up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>The tides of the battle turned while you were knocked out, Captain Leftovers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I was knocked out?! Aw man, I missed out on the fight!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>This should be good enough. Let us finish this in our world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>What did you say?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>What is happening?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I was contemplating how I might dilute the boundaries of our worlds with my magic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I know you were told defeating Zeldris and the Albions would do so, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I thought it would be most appropriate to bring this fight to a conclusion in our own world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Is that what you've been keeping yourself busy with?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It was. My magic alone couldn't affect the principle foundations of this world, so I had to borrow the powers present here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I had to stay focused to do so.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Tch...! You may have prevented me from attaining new powers today, but remember this, Meliodas!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>This isn't over yet! I will not forgive you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Well, what are we waiting for? I'm out.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Couldn't he wait on us?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Let's just go, Diane.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Escanor, you go on ahead. Thank you for all you've done today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Let's go, Cap'n!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Yeah, sure. I'll be waiting for you on the other side, Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>We don't have much time for goodbyes. Do try to make it brief, Princess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>What will you two do now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>There isn't much to do, really. Phantom Soldiers disappear once their mission is over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>We will return to darkness. So whispers the darkness within me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Just when I was starting to get attached to that darkness of yours...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That's awful!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Oh, there's nothing to be sad about. We were happy to have fought alongside you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>The trust you have in your friends brought back some fond memories.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm sure that's something I'll take with me, even if I don't keep memories of this specific event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I will never forget this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>These memories of another world... There's no guarantee that you'll remember.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>We will be one with the darkness...and with the gifts you have given us. I am satisfied with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Elizabeth! It's time to get out of here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Go on, Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>May the darkness guide you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>The darkness? Would we want it to, though?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Okay! Thank you so much!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Someday, somehow, I'd love to see you two again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Let's go, Elizabeth!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Will I forget them?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>The experiences I had and people I met here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Everything that reminded me of the importance of trust.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>I'm sure that's something I'll take with me, even if I don't keep memories of this specific event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>We will be one with the darkness...and with the gifts you have given us. I am satisfied with that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>All right, then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Thank you...so very much.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>What are you doing? Let's go, Elizabeth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Coming, Meliodas... Everyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>What's up?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I find myself hopeful for the future we will share. I'm sure it's going to be wonderful!</td>
