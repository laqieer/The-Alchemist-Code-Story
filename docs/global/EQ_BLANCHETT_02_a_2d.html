<td>Run. All right, go back to the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>No way I'm letting them escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>...! Wait, you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Don't stop me! I'm gonna kill the wolf! Kill it! Ahahah! I'm going to shred it to pieces!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Enough of that! Agh...what strength...someone! Help!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Out of my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ughh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>We're all right. Um, my apologies...for the trouble the child caused.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>No. Still, that was quite the frenzy...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>From when she came to our orphanage, whenever a wolf would appear or howl...or even the mention of one in conversation...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I want to do something to help, but I'm not even sure of what the cause is.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Phew...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>You seem exhausted. You're quite the looker now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It was the first time I've been hit in the face.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I have some medicine to prevent bruising. Hold on a second.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>No, leave it. More importantly, I want to continue our conversation from the afternoon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>According to the rumors...the landlord is connected to the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is that a fact?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I couldn't confirm it, but its credibility is high. Quite a few people lost their lives trying to obtain this information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I see. If that's the truth then I'm sure the landlord will try desperately to conceal it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>If Wratharis were to find out about it, it'll be a big deal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>If that's the case, there's a danger of me interfering and making matters worse. It might be best if I don't meet with him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I wonder what's so fun about living one's life so fast and dangerous.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheh. It's the times we live in. Can you hear that? The sound of history driving us forward?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Even if that were the case, I feel like I want to shut my ears and stay buried in bed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>With that attitude, you must be suffering a lot in your current position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I see. So you're already leaving. I'm sorry I could not be much assistance. Will you be leaving tonight?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Yes. I plan to return to the capital. By the way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Regarding the ingredients for the Stones...how are they being transported from here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Well, it is being delivered directly to His Majesty...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>For these past few months, the landlord has even prepared a carriage and escort for their transport.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>(Just as I thought.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>(The landlord is completely involved in the disappearance of the Stones' ingredients.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Oh, that's right! If you'd like, please meet with the children.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>They would like to thank you for having saved them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Oh dear. I'm not very good at those things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Lord Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Ah, um, of course.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lord Freed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Thank you for saving us! I definitely want to become a soldier like you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>No, that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Ah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Blanchett...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>(The Stone is indeed responding. Is it responding to the strength of her Alchemia?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Can I talk with you a little?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Why did you come over here? The other children want to talk with you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>I'm not used to being seen that way. I'm more of the academic type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>Academic?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>My work has more to do with academia than actual fighting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>I don't really understand those things. Do you mean you read difficult books?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Well, deciphering old texts is part of my work. Also, I help draft policies and gather information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Yeah, it seems difficult.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>It's quite fun when you get used to it. Much more enjoyable than swinging a blade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Um...Mr. Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>You can just call me Freed. For starters, I'm not as great as everyone says I am. It's more a reflection of my parentage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>My father is a soldier of Wratharis. He's a tough guy. Apparently, before the rise of the Deadly Trio, he was the head of the army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>So he's a scary person.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>Yes. That's why no one would come near me when I was a child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>For other children, it was like I was carrying a bomb.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>I'm used to it now, but at the time it made me feel very lonely.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I'm not scared of you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>My father and mother are here with me. The bright red of that day is burned into my vision!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>(The Stone again... Does it respond with excitement every time she reacts emotionally?)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>That's why I'm going to live. No matter how painful it gets, I'm going to live, live, live!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>With my own hands, with these blades...I'm going to eradicate all the wolves!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>(Oh...even after she lost everything...her family...her home...she's chosen to live.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Do you always carry those blades with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>I got them from my mother... They're more important to me than life itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>That's why...if I use them to kill all the wolves...all of them...I'm sure I can go back to my home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>...I see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Blanchett.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Fold here like this. All right, now can you use your blade to cut here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>Folding paper? Why would I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Here, try it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>Just once.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Then spread it like this...see?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>A paper...rabbit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It's called folding pictures. What do you think? That's not a bad way to use your blades, is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>Folding pictures...I didn't know I could use my blades like that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>It's not just your blades...I'm sure there are many things you can do. Revenge is only a small part of who you are.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Huh...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Even if your revenge ends, your life will continue. That's why you should start thinking about what happens when it's all over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>I'm sure you'll be able to find a different answer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>Free...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>Oh, that's so cute! Did you make that, Blanc?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>Um, well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>Wow, that's amazing! It's like magic! Hey, can you make a squirrel?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Um, well...Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I only know how to cut out a rabbit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>Aww...a-are you serious?! Er, squirrel...maybe, if I cut this here...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>Wow! It's a squirrel! Amazing!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>Are you not scared of me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Don't you remember how you protected all of us, Blanc?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>Of course, I was a little surprised, but I know you're like an older sister to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>So thank you, Blanc! You were a little scary but really cool!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>...I see. I see...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>Blanc? Why are you crying?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>It's nothing. I'm completely fine...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Oh, I'm glad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>...Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>You're finally here now. You're making new relationships here. Your life of value to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>I'm relieved. Your life is much more radiant than mine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>...Freed?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Well, I'm gonna go now. Be well, Blanchett.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>...Is that story true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>Yes. As early as tonight, the children are going to be brought from that orphanage to the capital.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>They're going to be used as ingredients for a Philosopher's Stone...that abominable Alchemy crystal...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>Are you telling me the rumor that the royal family of Wratharis is indulging in Alchemy is true?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>Yes! In order to stop this abomination, I have been secretly strengthening my ties with the Holy Guard, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>I never expected them to move so fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>The Holy Guard still has not received permission to send troops and my personal soldiers stand no chance against the Royal Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>These past few months, I've tried every means possible to protect the children, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>Indeed, this blood has a strong Alchemia reaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>There is no doubt then that the owner of this blood...the children of the orphanage, are being carried into the capital?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>124</td>
<td>Of course. You've witnessed how, even now, Wratharis troops are stationed outside the village.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>125</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>126</td>
<td>Please, Captain Zeke! Use your power to save these innocent children!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>127</td>
<td>I belong to Envylia. If this occurs within Wratharis territory, it'll start a war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>128</td>
<td>That may be the case. But think of all the lives that'll be lost if you let this abomination occur! The poison of Alchemy will spread like wildfire!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>129</td>
<td>This is to protect the Magna Code...to maintain the stability of the continent. Please think of it that way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>130</td>
<td>I will save the lives of the children. That alone is enough, correct?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>131</td>
<td>That is all I ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>132</td>
<td>...Very well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>133</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>134</td>
<td>It appears to have gone well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>135</td>
<td>...?! Y-you scum...there...I've done my part, have I not?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>136</td>
<td>Yes, it's enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>137</td>
<td>Blue Flame Wolf Zeke...he does not need this many men to start a war with Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>138</td>
<td>Furthermore...in the name of the Holy Guard, I will rule Wratharis under the direct jurisdiction of Northern Pride!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>139</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>140</td>
<td>Agh?! Wh-why...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>141</td>
<td>It's natural to dispose of that which is no longer necessary, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>142</td>
<td>A pig like you which is motivated by greed has no place bearing the name of the Holy Guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>143</td>
<td>In order to bring peace to this continent...you will sink along with Wratharis in the depths of history.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>144</td>
<td>...Um.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>145</td>
<td>Oh, what is it this late at night. It's time for children to be in bed, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>146</td>
<td>I thought that Freed might be here, so I came to ask.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>147</td>
<td>Oh, would you be Blanchett?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>148</td>
<td>Yes. Why do you ask?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>149</td>
<td>I was given something to give to you in case you came asking.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>150</td>
<td>Huh? A difficult-looking book...and a beautiful stone?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>151</td>
<td>Don't ask me about it. I don't know what it means. If I recall...he said that it was a charm to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>152</td>
<td>That's so mean. He didn't even say a proper goodbye.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>153</td>
<td>Was there something you wanted to talk with him about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>154</td>
<td>No, it's not that, but...the last time I met him it was like I felt he was going to disappear...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>155</td>
<td>Besides, I can't read this difficult book...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>156</td>
<td>I'm sure you will meet him again. You know, you could always go directly to his workplace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>157</td>
<td>Workplace?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>158</td>
<td>He works as the administrator for the National Library. If you're interested, then try to go see him. You can shove that book back in his face while you're at it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>159</td>
<td>The National Library...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>160</td>
<td>All right then, back home with you. If you stay up too late, you'll regret...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>161</td>
<td>A-an enemy attack! Everyone, hurry and run...agh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>162</td>
<td>What?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>163</td>
<td>...! The orphanage is in danger!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>164</td>
<td>Oh, hey! Wait! It's dangerous to go there now!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Lord Freed, preparations for departure have been completed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>166</td>
<td>All right. There's no time to waste. Let's head out immediately.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>167</td>
<td>Understood! Make way for the carriage! We return to the capital!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>168</td>
<td>I'm sorry, Neville. I gave that Stone to the girl.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>169</td>
<td>(I wonder why I did that.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170</td>
<td>... ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>171</td>
<td>I know. It was because she was dazzling. Hating something, yet trying so hard to live.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>172</td>
<td>If there are children like that...then I am sure a bright future awaits Wratharis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>173</td>
<td>Heh. I'm starting to sound like a withered old man.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>I wonder if there truly will be a moment for me when I will feel like I'm alive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>175</td>
<td>Hurraahhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>176</td>
<td>Agh! Enemy attack! All soldiers, battle stations! Protect Lord Freed!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>177</td>
<td>What...?! An attack now?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>178</td>
<td>Don't get in my way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>179</td>
<td>Keep the conflict to a minimum! Promptly secure the carriage and enable its escape!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>180</td>
<td>Yes, Captain!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>181</td>
<td>You are Captain Zeke of the Blue Flame Guard. What are you doing here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>182</td>
<td>I will have you free the children you are trying to take with you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>183</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>184</td>
<td>(Could this be on the orders of the landlord?! He must be trying to stop me before I can report to His Majesty!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>185</td>
<td>In any case, your use of Envylia's soldiers can be seen as nothing more than a proclamation of war.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>186</td>
<td>Huzzah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>187</td>
<td>Agh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>188</td>
<td>(An academic like me is no match for them! I need to persuade them...no...you fool! How can you speak reason to that legendary Zeke on the battlefield?!)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>189</td>
<td>Hurrah!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>190</td>
<td>Lord Freed, we've received word from the soldiers left in the village! There was some kind of raid!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>191</td>
<td>What...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>192</td>
<td>(Ack! If the landlord is behind all of this...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>193</td>
<td>She...the orphan children are in danger! Hurry! We need to head back to the village!</td>
</tr>
