</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Don't you mean, as hot as a frying pan?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>How could an armor be like a party? That doesn't make sense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Or maybe you should say, “My armor feels as hot as a frying pan used at a frying party.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Who the heck are you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Oh, wait!<br>She doesn't have any ill intentions!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>More importantly, Captain Monzein, thank you for earlier.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>What are you talking about? But oh man, it's hot. This is really not a joke!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>No, I mean... You saved me when I was being attacked from behind earlier, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, it's so hot! Shut up already!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It wasn't you who saved Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>I don't know! Those monsters probably just perished from their own accord! Let's just be quiet and start walking!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It wasn't Captain Monzein who cut those monsters down?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Pant... pant...!<br>Kanon, do you have a moment?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>S-sure!<br>What is it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I'm done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>What I mean is that I can't go any further. I'm really done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Huh?!<br>Did you get wounded somewhere?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>No, it's the heat. I've gotten dehydrated. I probably don't have much time left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Huh? Captain Monzein, this is not the time for jokes!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Jokes?! You fool! I'm truly being honest here! Look at the way I'm staggering...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>You don't seem to be staggering at all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>How could you be acting lazy at a time like this? Doesn't that go against your sense of chivalry?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Pure decision-making is also part of my chivalry! I'm really done for!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've never heard of such a “convenient” sense of chivalry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>How can you say such a thing as if you know what you're talking about?! Can't you get that I'm really bad with hot and cold places?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Seems like the Lord Commander is more of a man than you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Did you say anything?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>N-never mind!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Oh, come on...<br>I wonder what Lord Zain would think if he saw you like this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hm?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Excalibur...<br>Besides being the supreme symbol of justice, it's also the key to saving Kagura...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>and it's our last resort in the destruction of the Mikaboshi, who will soon appear once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I hope you do realize how important the restoration of Excalibur is exactly, Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Well... that goes without saying.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>And besides, didn't you say it yourself? How we wouldn't be able to face Captain Kudanstein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Captain Kudanstein?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>“How could we face Captain Kudanstein when he comes back, if we haven't been able to take care of something like the restoration of Excalibur?”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>Those are your own words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>H-hmm...<br>Did I really say that?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>Even after everything he did, you're still waiting for Captain Kudanstein's return?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>I-it's not like I'm waiting for his return!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>It's just that... I wouldn't feel satisfied unless I could give him a thorough beating!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Argh, you're so stubborn.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Even after everything that happened, we're still on the same side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Captain Kudanstein will definitely change himself for the better. We have faith in that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>Phuh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>The strength of your unity, that's the true strength of the Holy Guard, isn't it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I mean to say that it's really wonderful. We'll have to restore Excalibur, no matter what!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Phuh... Anyway, I've reached my limit! Look, even my eyes are all blurry!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Are you still making arguments? There's no way for me to see that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Tsk! By the way, where are Yauras and the others?! How late can you possibly be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Well...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>What?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Captain Yauras, as well as Captain Seida and Othima... they all left.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I guess everybody has his own way of seeing things. I couldn't bring myself to...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>W-w-what?!<br>They left?!<br>They left the Holy Guard?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What?<br>Is that really what happened, Kanon?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>That's also why...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>we don't have a second to lose to get Excalibur restored!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>As the symbol of ultimate justice, Excalibur can act as a beacon of light to call everyone back together!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>Kanon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>And in order to bring everyone back home, I need to be stronger.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>And restoring Excalibur is my very first step on my future path!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>Is that why you want to restore Excalibur?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>...?!<br>Get back, Kanon!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>Monsters?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>How can they be so quick? Watch out!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>S-sure! Ugh...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>N-no, it's not that they're so quick! It's just that our movements have gotten dull!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Could it be... the volcanic gas?!</td>
