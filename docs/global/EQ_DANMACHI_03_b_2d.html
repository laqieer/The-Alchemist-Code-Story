<td>Ais! Thank goodness...you're all right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>What are you doing all the way out here?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Honestly, I don't know. All of a sudden, I found myself in an unfamiliar place with monsters I'd never seen before.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>Do you know anything about all this?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You had to fight before you even knew what was going on? Somehow, that...almost suits you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Let's see, where do I even begin?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>...I see. The wind does feel a bit different here, now that you mention it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>That's your biggest takeaway?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Yes. Now that I know it's a different world, I just have to adjust myself to it, at which point I should be able to carry on as always, I imagine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Hey, Bell! The kid's awake! Get back here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Oh! Ais, sorry, but this is important. Let's finish catching up later!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>So...Kevin's gone off to make sure the child gets sent somewhere more secure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It was just as I thought. It's the children who always pay the dearest prices out here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>From what I was told, they were doing some kind of experiments, right? I can't imagine what they'd be trying to accomplish, though.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Anyone who would round up abandoned kids to experiment on isn't in their right mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>I don't care what those creeps were trying to accomplish, if they were sacrificing children to do it, it needs to be stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Sacrificing?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>There are objects called Philosopher's Stones, which provide the Alchemia needed to perform a powerful magic known as Alchemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>But Philosopher's Stones don't just come out of thin air. They require a certain...energy...to be produced.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Wait, are you saying...?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>Whoever did this seems to be using Philosopher's Stones made from the life force of children to exercise control over the demons around here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>The monster that kid saw when running away...was probably one of them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>It's possible it could've been the monster from my world, too. Though there's no way to know for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I guess some kind of Alchemia misfire is responsible for connecting our world with yours.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>It's unconscionable, performing experiments like this on innocent children... It's the actual worst. The worst possible sort of filth and villainy there is. I can't stand it. It makes me sick.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Me too. And I won't let them get away with it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>No matter what, I will stop them!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Bell, you...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Look, Ila, I want to help you with this. No... I want to settle this matter with you, side by side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Okay. Let's take this scum down, then!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I will lend my aid in this fight as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Ais!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Oh, you're Bell's friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>When there are people being terrorized by monsters...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Be it in this world or any other, what I must do remains the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>I will slay those monsters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Oho! Looks like we've gained another comrade while I was away. And you all seem to be good friends now, too!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>Who says they're my friends?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Now, now. Since Kevin's back, we've got a full complement, so let's see if we can get to the bottom of this whole mess.</td>
