<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Kudan!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Will it not reach him?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>This is our justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>This is our truth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>It will reach him. It will make a difference. Both this justice we inherited...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>And our Alchemy!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It can't be...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Kuza...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Sup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>098</td>
<td>So that's why you handed me your pipe. So that I could summon you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>099</td>
<td>I told you I wanted to choose when I die.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>What do you think you can do with such a lazy, stopgap summon?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>This stopgap is all we needed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>This is all futile! It won't get you anywhere!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>No... It's not possible!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>104</td>
<td>I stalled and held him in place. Was it enough, Brother?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>105</td>
<td>Again!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>106</td>
<td>You already know you cannot harm me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>107</td>
<td>Not alone, I can't. But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>108</td>
<td>Yeah, you know what to do.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>109</td>
<td>You can believe in me!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>110</td>
<td>I'm expecting you to make this interesting, Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>111</td>
<td>This is pointless! You will never defeat me! That day will never come!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>112</td>
<td>Unfortunately for you, I'm aggressively persistent. I'll keep going until I do defeat you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>Hahahahahaha! Not bad, but still not enough!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Farewell, Kudanstein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Nngh! Th-that's—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>A little hand-me-down from my older brother. I told you I'm not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>113</td>
<td>Good show, Brother!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>114</td>
<td>You still need me to babysit you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>115</td>
<td>No...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>116</td>
<td>You haven't forgotten, have you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>117</td>
<td>No. I understand now. I'm not alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>118</td>
<td>I am here with you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>119</td>
<td>Hahah! Not bad at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>120</td>
<td>You seem to have found yourself a good older brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>121</td>
<td>I have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>122</td>
<td>If you would, allow me to shoulder that which he entrusted to you as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td>Embrace the light that guides the world!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>How could I lose? How could I possibly lose to weaklings like you?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>I told you. Our shared bond is our justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>This is... This is unforgivable!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>To force me to my knees... This is unforgivable! You all will die for this!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>I will pave my road to conquest with your bones!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We are done for now. I believe it would be wisest to retreat.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>It is not yet the right time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Waginau...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>There will be time to settle this score later. Will it not be enough to prove your strength to them then?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>I suppose it is not wise to suffer any more losses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Paladins, I will see you again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>It's over.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Did we...win?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>I would say that for now, yes. The future is...less certain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>We're going home! We kept casualties to a minimum, so I say this has been a good day!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Vice-Captain Monzein!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Oh...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Captain Kudan...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Let's go home, everybody.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>(It was your blade that struck him. I suppose you win again, Brother.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>(I wonder if my spear will reach him one day...)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>(No...I will make it reach! Just watch me, Kuza.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Kuza... Rest in peace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>When the day comes for Wadatsumi to be freed, we can build a tomb for Kuza in his homeland.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Before we can do that, we'll have to defeat that man, though...right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>Captain Kudan, why don't we swear an oath together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I haven't yet fulfilled the oath I made with Kuza. How can I make another with you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Allow me to join the one you made with him! Let's vow to avenge Kuza and carry out our justice together.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Not a bad suggestion for an airhead. Can I be part of this oath as well? Rebuilding Wadatsumi is my wish just as much as it was Kuza's.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>A wish that Chihaya and I...both shared.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Right! Basheeny, you're with us, too, aren't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>Um...me, too?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>All right! Then it's decided!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>Why don't we all make the oath together?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>This is a serious matter, not something to be so flippant about! Ahem. I, too, would like to join.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>If the Vice-Captain is willing, then so am I.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I will join as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>Well, then. Let us swear this oath together and keep the Holy Guard's light of justice shining bright.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>What’s wrong?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>I just... I haven't grown at all since that time. I'm still so...powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>What are you talking about? You have so! You succeeded in protecting not only me, but everybody here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>But...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>You were able to protect all of us. Next time, you'll be able to defeat him for sure!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>Now, now. Let's not go making bold assumptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>Oh, don't be such a downer, Monzein.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>There is something about Kanon, though. Somehow the way she says it makes it sound very plausible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>She is...something, that's for sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>If all of you are set on this...who am I to decline?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>All right, then. Let's do this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>We of the Holy Guard will fight for our absolute justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>That the tragedy of Wadatsumi may never happen again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>To prevent the Sacred Stones from falling into evil hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>That innocent blood may never be shed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>To uphold my code of chivalry and protect the weak.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>To see this all through to the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>To honor our friends.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>For the sake of people's smiles! And of course...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>To bring down the evil that brought about the fall of Wadatsumi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>To this cause, we dedicate our lives!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>Justice for the sake of all!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>Ack...urgh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Do you feel more like appreciating the little things around you now?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>Maybe not everything, but I do wish to carry on what you believed in. Though I'm...not sure I can carry it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>You don't need to worry about a thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>How's the view from there?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>This is nonsense.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>095</td>
<td>But...I suppose it's not bad.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>096</td>
<td>Heheh. Love to say I told you so, Brother.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>097</td>
<td>Don't get full of yourself.</td>
</tr>
