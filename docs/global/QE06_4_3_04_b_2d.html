<td>Uncle?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Do demons not have that concept?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>That doesn't even matter anymore. Demon or human, a brother's a brother, a wife's a wife, and an uncle's an uncle. Isn't that what you always say, Koga?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I don't entirely understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>But if they are precious to you, then they are precious to me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>I will look after them, even at the cost of my own life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Ngh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Did you remember something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Or are you still pretending so much of your life never happened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>If it's the latter... Aren't you basically just pretending our mother never existed? That her wishes meant nothing to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Is that really the kind of pretending you want to do, Uncle Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>I must...destroy...all humans...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>Must you, though, Uncle Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Or is that someone else's desire?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>S-silence!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>If there's something that keeps you bound to this path against your will...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>...then we'd like to free you of that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>My will is my own!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Then how come Sumeragi could be reforged using your horn?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>What are you insinuating?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>If it truly is your desire to destroy humanity, then why did your horn respond to our wishes?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>I dare say it's because somewhere deep inside, you still carry feelings for the Wadatsumi of old. In fact, I'm sure of it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>No...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Now, now, you two. Don't go grabbing at your uncle's horns. You'll bother him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>...They aren't afraid of my horns?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>They're too young to understand such things. Besides, you've always been kind to them, so why would they be?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I hope they grow up thinking neither horns nor the demons they're attached to are all that scary. Wouldn't a world like that be a nice place to live?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>â€¦It just might.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Tamba?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>I've been thinking that perhaps I should snap off my horns and cast off my demon appearance, like you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>You don't have to do that! It doesn't matter what you look like. Whether you're a demon or a human makes no difference in the end.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>We're headed toward a Wadatsumi where there is no divide between demons and humans. And you're one of the people protecting that world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see. In that case, I'll no longer think of these horns as things to be feared, but to be used in the defense of others...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Since that's the Wadatsumi you long to see.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>Hey, Uncle Tamba? What kind of future do you actually want for Wadatsumi?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Surely it can't be all that different from what our parents and Lady Mitsuha wanted, right?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>...Silence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>Because even if you don't remember, we do. Whenever you ruffled our hair, your hand always felt so warm and gentle on our heads.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>Yeah. Please don't pretend like those times never happened. For our mother's sake...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>For the sake of all who wish for peace...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>And for our sake.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>Agh! Why won't you shut up?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Like I said, our time here is limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>We'll have to return to these sacred vessels soon. But before we do, we wanted to make sure to deliver our message to you:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Don't forget, there are people here who sincerely wish for your happiness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>......</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>Amane!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>Huff...huff... I thought...I could go a little longer...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>That was plenty long. Longer than anyone could've hoped for, I think.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>Uh, what just happened, exactly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>The rookie finally made herself useful, that's what.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I think we got through to him...even if only just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>We can only pray you're right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Indeed. Because if you didn't, we're still in for quite a scrap.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>Captain Ugachi...!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>Can we really end this without bloodshed? Tanosuke certainly wouldn't approve of us letting our emotions get the better of us, I'm sure.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>So, then... Options?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>Frankly, I don't think we know yet what our options are. We have to wait and see how Tamba will respond. Best not to let your guard down, though, just in case.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I was...</td>
