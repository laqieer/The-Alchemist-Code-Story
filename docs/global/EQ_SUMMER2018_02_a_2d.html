<td>Phew. It's finally over!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Yeah... Why don't we have a chat with those three?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Good idea. You three! Why didn't you heed Liz's orders?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>Hmmmm... Even if you put it that way...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I only came here because it seemed like there was an opportunity to make some coin. So many open-minded souls with silver spoons hanging from their mouths.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Th-that's why you're here?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Since you're all so relaxed, I was also hoping that you might let slip some juicy information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>Huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>Oh, nothing! Hee hee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I simply wanted to enjoy the seaside. I am finally free to roam this land as I see fit, now that I am a Phantom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Yet, woe is me, my body retains the fragility that plagued my mortal days. I am afraid that I will be of little use to anyone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>What do you mean?! You came here to have fun?! Besides, the Phantoms Liz summoned were supposed to be good at swimming!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>It sounds like Liz's eagerness to enjoy our day at the beach interfered with her summoning. Birds of a feather flock together. Does that make sense, Liz?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Not really, but I guess they all wanted to come to the beach, too, huh! How about you, um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ohhhh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>U-um...?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>Ohhhhhhhhh.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>H-hello?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>She's not listening at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>Is she looking for someone? She keeps turning around.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>He's not here. I'll know him when I see him. I will find him. I can't let this chance pass me by.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Hmph. Where, oh where, could he be? I feel like my heart is going to burst!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>She's not listening to a word we're saying, is she? She just keeps fiddling with that strange doll of hers, and looking left and right and left again... It's making my neck hurt just watching her.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>I'm starting to get a little annoyed, actually.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>Why, hello there, little ladies! Looking for something?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>If it's a play mate you want—you found him! I'm right here!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>Oh! Hey, maybe Dorothea was looking for these guys!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>What was that?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>Don't be ridiculous! I don't have a single modicum of interest in men who look like they would roll over and die at the slightest touch!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Wh-what did you just say, you little—?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>Oops. That made him angry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>Of course it did!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Tch! I'll show you what you get for looking so pretty and talking so ugly!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>Enough! Don't think that I'll hesitate to crush you, just because you are a pathetic little worm of a man!</td>
