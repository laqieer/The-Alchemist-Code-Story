<td>Um... Annerose...?</td>

<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>Are you better now? One of the researchers told me that you were, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>My wounds have healed, yes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>I-I'm... I'm really, really sorry, Annerose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I should have listened to you. I wish I'd listened to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>Words are easily spoken, but not so easily filled with intention.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Well, perhaps that is a little difficult for you to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>In any case, I am equally to blame. I should have reined you in while I had the chance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I h-hurt you with my lightning, but you... You still helped me. You s-saved me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>Who knows what would have happened to you, had I not intervened?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>I saved you because I wanted to. I didn't want to lose you, Klima. I care about you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>Huh? Y-you...care about me?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>You're one of the few people with whom I can interact honestly, without things like my parents, or the authority my family carries weighing us down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>D-does that mean that I'm...important to you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>It does. I would do anything to protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>R-really?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>You're important to me, too, Annerose. I'm gonna listen to everything you say from now on!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>Oh, really? Well, then, my dear, I have a present for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>Isn't this...incantation gear?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>I've adjusted it to make it lighter and easier to wear. I would like you to keep it on your person at all times.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>Okay. I will. I've gotta control my powers!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Cause if I can control my powers, I can protect you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I don't need you to protect me. I am here to protect you, after all. However, if you would use your powers more carefully, that would certainly be a weight off my mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>Huh? You don't want me to protect you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>I didn't mean it like that. I wouldn't mind being protected by you, Klima.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>Heheheh! Then I'm gonna! You can count on me! I won't make you worry anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>By the way, the reason I was so absorbed in my reading that day was because I was excited to make this gear for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>However, I concede that my priorities were out of order. You are incredibly important to me, Klima. I should have been paying attention to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>You're so nice to me, Annerose. You're the best!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>You've gotta have fun with me sometimes, though. You can't always be reading!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>All right, all right! I hear you!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>So p-please...stop nuzzling me like that! I c-can't breathe!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>Heheheh!</td>
