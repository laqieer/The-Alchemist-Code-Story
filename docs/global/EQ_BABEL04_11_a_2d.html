<tr>
<td>002</td>
<td>That you wanted to be my friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>003</td>
<td>Even when I became a demon...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>004</td>
<td>You did everything you could to reach me.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>005</td>
<td>I won't forget you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>006</td>
<td>You protected my brother, and encouraged him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007</td>
<td>Everything we achieved was thanks to your words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>008</td>
<td>You were always on my side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>009</td>
<td>I want to be there for you, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>010</td>
<td>I want to be your friend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>011</td>
<td>Ngh?!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>012</td>
<td>It might sound a little childish, but...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>013</td>
<td>I...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>014</td>
<td>Never mind.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>015</td>
<td>Ngh... Unnnnggghhh... Yomi! Yomi!!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>016</td>
<td>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Unnnnggggghhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>017</td>
<td>It's going to be all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>018</td>
<td>B-but... But, I...! I...! Uwaaaaaaaaahhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>019</td>
<td>I know. You were so scared. I was scared, too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>020</td>
<td>But if you keep crying like that...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>021</td>
<td>You'll start looking like a little kid, you know?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>022</td>
<td>Unnngghh! I-I'm not a kid! Uwaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>023</td>
<td>I-it's just...my...baby face! Uwaaaaahhhhhh!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>024</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>025</td>
<td>You've been pushing yourself too hard, haven't you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>026</td>
<td>But it's all right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>027</td>
<td>I'm here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>028</td>
<td>Unnnghhh, nnnngghh... Y-Yomi!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>029</td>
<td>That was excellent.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>030</td>
<td>Lady Kagura!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>031</td>
<td>It's all right, you don't need to get up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>032</td>
<td>I'm glad I was able to witness the power of the sealed sword, Kagomurasaki.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>033</td>
<td>I see now that there's a reason why you're the clan leader.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>034</td>
<td>I am unworthy of such praise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>035</td>
<td>Devouring and storing demonic power...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>036</td>
<td>It is a fitting cradle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>037</td>
<td>Yomi...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>038</td>
<td>Does that mean you're carrying even more corruption around inside of you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>039</td>
<td>It just means that I don't have to wait much longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>040</td>
<td>It's not something you need to worry about, all right, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>041</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>042</td>
<td>Lady Kagura, how is the battle progressing?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>043</td>
<td>It's only a matter of time—and I mean that in our favor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>044</td>
<td>What with General Leafah and her troops, our forces are even stronger—thanks to you, Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>045</td>
<td>Our allies are converging on the Shiba Senko's main forces.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>046</td>
<td>All we need to do now is join them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>047</td>
<td>Then let's go! Just a little more and we'll be able to—!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>048</td>
<td>Yomi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>049</td>
<td>Y-yes, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>050</td>
<td>You were right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>051</td>
<td>What are you talking about?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>052</td>
<td>We of Greed Dike made many pretty speeches, but we never actually changed anything we learned from the past.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>053</td>
<td>You could say we haven't learned anything at all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>054</td>
<td>In order to rebuild our great nation to reflect the ambitions of our young leaders, we attempted invasion once again.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>055</td>
<td>I knew it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>056</td>
<td>Hmm...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>057</td>
<td>Joining forces with the Shiba Senko, we tried to take Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>058</td>
<td>That is quite the betrayal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>059</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>060</td>
<td>What are you going to do, Leafah?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>061</td>
<td>I cannot turn my back on my country.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>062</td>
<td>It's the only home I've ever known.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>063</td>
<td>Then...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>064</td>
<td>However...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>065</td>
<td>I had a saving grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>066</td>
<td>I found comrades, who have tried to come to terms with our shameful past and build a better future for all...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>067</td>
<td>People who strive to be just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>068</td>
<td>Not only those of Greed Dike, but people from Wadatsumi as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>069</td>
<td>I, however... I lost confidence in what I thought was just.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>070</td>
<td>Leafah...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>071</td>
<td>But I do know this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>072</td>
<td>I want to be on your side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>073</td>
<td>I want to be on the side of your justice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>074</td>
<td>A time without conflict, where the days roll peacefully by without anyone killing or being killed...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>075</td>
<td>That's what Jin wanted, isn't it? He wanted to protect Wadatsumi.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>076</td>
<td>Right!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>077</td>
<td>Please, let me be your friend; your ally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>078</td>
<td>I'm always being helped by someone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>079</td>
<td>Heheh. That's how I feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>080</td>
<td>Can I ask you a favor?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>081</td>
<td>O-of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>082</td>
<td>Will you let me lean on you?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>083</td>
<td>H-huh?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>084</td>
<td>Hehe. I, uh, sort of overdid it back there, and my body is quite, um, sore...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>085</td>
<td>Oh! Yes! Yes, of course!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>086</td>
<td>It seems all that waiting finally paid off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>087</td>
<td>I had faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>088</td>
<td>But General Leafah, are you really all right with this? There are Greed Dike soldiers amongst the Shiba Senko.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>089</td>
<td>That's fine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>090</td>
<td>Truly?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>091</td>
<td>They told me my actions were like a child throwing a tantrum...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>092</td>
<td>But if they are respectable adults...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>093</td>
<td>They should be able to forgive the actions of a petulant child.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>094</td>
<td>I'll show them how courageous their general is!</td>
</tr>
